1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
No one can save me.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I must save myself.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I must save myself.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I must save myself.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 16

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Episode 17

7
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
These are all behind you.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't need to see it.

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is Chen Yuan Lu's?

10
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You gave it to Cui Ying?

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
When I arrived at the hospital,

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Pei Su told me that before you passed out,

13
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
you kept talking about going to Cui Ying.

14
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I went to Xinzhou University of Political and Legal Affairs.

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I didn't expect that Cui Ying would run away when she saw me.

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why would she run away?

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Cui Ying, before she graduated from university,

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
was a naive and restless child.

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
She was timid and timid.

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
She was scared when she met a teacher.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I am the vice-captain of the sixth team of the special investigation team.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I need to talk to you about the situation.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you are worried,

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I can tell you that

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Jin Zai Hong is now in the interrogation room of the special investigation team.

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The special investigation team has taken over this case.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Now you can tell me

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
about Chen Yuan.

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Two weeks before her accident,

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Chen Yuan sent the USB to Cui Ying.

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Cui Ying was confused after seeing it

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and couldn't contact Chen Yuan.

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So she told her senior,

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
whom she trusted,

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and showed her the contents of the USB in the clubhouse.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Zhou Hong Chuan?

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Zhou Hong Chuan is Cui Ying's instructor.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I have been taking care of her for half a year.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So Zhou Hong Chuan told her not to report the case.

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now Jin Zai Hong can't escape.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's right.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Jin Zai Hong has already declared that

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
he has committed a crime and is about to die.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Cui Hong Liang also resigned.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What about Zhou Hong Chuan?

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Zhou Hong Chuan is too cunning.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He asked her twice and seemed to have nothing to say.

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Did you investigate the background?

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Is she and He Zong Yi from the same hometown?

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You guessed it right.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Zhou Hong Chuan's original name is Zhou Feng Nian.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's Feng Nian Guo, as Zhang Ying mentioned.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
According to He Zong Yi's mother's memory,

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Zhou Feng Nian's family background is very bad.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
His father is a cripple.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
His mother is a Longya.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
She has been abandoned in the village.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It seems that this lawyer Zhou

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
was not so lucky when he was a child.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Not only was he unlucky when he was a child,

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
he didn't see much when he grew up.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The only time Zhou Feng Nian returned home after college,

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
his whole family was burned to death.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Burnt to death?

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Mother said that there was a fool in the village.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In order to warm up,

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
he set a fire at the tree at the door of Zhou's house.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The burning tree broke it.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It crushed the yard of Zhou's house.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Except Zhou Feng Nian, everyone else died.

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So the clue we have now

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
is only the fingerprint of Mother.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm afraid I don't even have this.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Mother said that the person who took her last night

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
wore sunglasses and masks and had different hair.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It should be Zhou Hong Chuan.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I think this is a good thing.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We can't just let Zhou Feng Nian

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
take the photo of Zhou Hong Chuan.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If we didn't say that this was Zhou Feng Nian,

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
he wouldn't have connected these two people.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I understand.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I finally found the evidence that the scene was not there.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
His company is not in Wencheng West Road.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Zhou Hong Chuan's colleague confirmed that

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
he had been working overtime that night.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Although there was no every moment with him,

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
we can't let the victim

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
keep holding him

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
near his company.

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Did he search the house?

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes, but there is no evidence.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So what do you think

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
we should do next?

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Set fire?

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What a arrogant little fool.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You're so arrogant

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
that you gave me the name card

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
to provide me with the evidence.

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You fabricated the evidence

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and framed me.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
How long can we keep him?

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Three hours.

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Enough.

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The more arrogant you are,

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
the easier it is to keep the evidence.

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Wencheng!

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Wencheng!

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Wencheng!

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Wencheng!

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Wencheng!

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Boss, I brought the evidence.

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is what we found when we caught Zhou Hong Chuan.

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It was found on his body.

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It was the place where his mother jumped off the building.

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It was one of the parts of the railing that was damaged.

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Did he admit it?

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes.

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He is a thief.

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He admitted that he broke the railing.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But he said that he thought that

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
the railing was not visible and he wanted to collect it.

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Who knew that unlucky woman

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
would jump off the building there.

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Are you angry?

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
She said that she wanted to bring it back.

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Collect?

128
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes.

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
She is lying.

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What can she collect?

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Such a narcissistic person

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
often likes to follow the development of the case.

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If she is arrogant,

134
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
she will even take away

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
the things that were on the scene.

136
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Memories.

137
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What memories?

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But there must be a place

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
to put these things.

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What things?

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Have you checked all the activities

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
of Zhou Hong Chuan's new company?

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yes.

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Are there any suspicious places?

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
No.

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We have searched everywhere.

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Sometimes,

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
for them,

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the meaning is more important than the actual thing.

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The meaning is more important than the actual thing.

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The meaning is more important than the actual thing.

152
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Meaning.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
There is a meaning.

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The big picture of the family

155
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
was taken in Xinzhou

156
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
as a lawyer.

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Knowing the meaning.

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's Zhou Hong Chuan of Ren Shun.

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We met at Chenguang Public Hall.

160
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hello.

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hello, Tao Ze.

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Are you still with Cui Ying?

163
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes. What's wrong?

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Ask her.

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Where did she give

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Zhou Hong Chuan a USB?

167
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's a private club.

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
No. 13.

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Which private club?

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Chenguang Public Hall.

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Chenguang Public Hall.

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Manager Luo.

173
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We meet again.

174
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Name?

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Didn't I give you a name card before?

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Answer.

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Zhou Hong Chuan.

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Same name.

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What?

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's not a good name

181
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
for a new born parent.

182
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Zhou Feng Nian.

183
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Manager.

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You asked me to talk about my name?

185
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If so,

186
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'll apply for leave now.

187
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't worry.

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's not time to release him.

189
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
We can talk for a while.

190
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And Zhou Lawyer

191
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
has the obligation to cooperate with us.

192
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Zhou Lawyer should know this better than me.

193
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't need to remind you, right?

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Ask.

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This morning,

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
you sneaked into the Shunzi Building in the new East District.

200
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You broke the safe guard rail

201
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
on the roof of the closed building.

202
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You almost caused...

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I've said it.

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I didn't know that

205
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
someone would jump off the building

206
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
at that time.

207
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
If I can destroy the public facilities,

208
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll accept the punishment.

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's a simple question.

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't you need to ask everyone?

211
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I've worked for so many years.

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I rarely see

213
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Zhou Lawyer

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
being so good at this.

215
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Sir, please pay attention

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
to your own thoughts.

217
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What do you think

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm a criminal?

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Okay.

220
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm not a criminal.

221
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm a lawyer.

222
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I have a few things

223
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
to ask Zhou Lawyer.

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
As a lawyer,

225
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I almost fell off the roof yesterday.

226
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The lady

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
recognized you

228
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
after seeing your photo.

229
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
She said your original name was Zhou Feng Nian.

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It happened to be her hometown.

231
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
According to her testimony,

232
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
we've investigated

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
the background of Zhou Lawyer.

234
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You were born in a small fishing village in Qiandao.

235
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Your parents are disabled.

236
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You have three younger siblings.

237
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You're a hard-working lawyer.

238
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's not easy

239
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
to say that about Zhou Lawyer.

240
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You can't get out of

241
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
a university

242
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
in your village for a year.

243
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Not to mention the school

244
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that is a top school in Xinzhou.

245
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's a mess.

246
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And I found that

247
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Zhou Lawyer didn't have a good accent.

248
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
When you were in your hometown,

249
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
did you also have a Xinzhou accent?

250
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
How is it going, Tao Feng?

251
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Captain Luo has been asking about his background.

252
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He hasn't mentioned the case yet.

253
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The villagers raised you up so hard.

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We can't forget it.

255
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
This is not right, Zhou Lawyer.

256
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm making him angry.

257
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's been many years.

258
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Many people and many things.

259
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't remember them.

260
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Also, sir.

261
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I want to correct it.

262
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The tuition fee for my university

263
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
is paid by scholarship.

264
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The road fee for Xinzhou

265
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
is paid by myself.

266
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
No one has to pay for it.

267
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
As for whether I go back or not,

268
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
you guys are too generous.

269
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The social rules and rules of the society

270
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
are also part of our work.

271
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,720
You guys are the

272
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I accept your criticism

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and actively improve it.

274
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
This is a serious case.

275
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I need to consult Zhou Lawyer.

276
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This girl is called Chen Yuan.

277
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
She died of excessive intoxication a few months ago.

278
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
She is your schoolmate.

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That's too stupid.

280
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
She died of a strange cause.

281
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Two weeks before her death,

282
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
she contacted a college classmate

283
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
named Cui Ying.

284
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
She passed some important evidence

285
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
of the drug-addiction group in the West.

286
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We went to visit her.

287
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
She submitted the evidence

288
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and mentioned you.

289
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Cui Ying said

290
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
she told you about Chen Yuan's story.

291
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But you stopped her from reporting.

292
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Is that true?

293
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes.

294
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I did watch that video.

295
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's indeed quite shocking.

296
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But who should I report to?

297
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
As far as I know,

298
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Jin Zai Hong in the video

299
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
and Cui Ying in the next issue

300
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
are both the same.

301
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Jin Zai Hong

302
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
is close to Cui Hong Liang,

303
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
who is in the same class as Xia Qiqi.

304
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm just an ordinary person.

305
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm not capable of anything.

306
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
To keep a reputation,

307
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
you must be wrong.

308
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No.

309
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I understand.

310
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
As a lawyer,

311
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you have a high level of awareness.

312
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I just don't understand

313
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
what you did

314
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
after you knew about this.

315
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
After I watched that video,

316
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I did go to the real place to investigate.

317
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But I didn't go deep.

318
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Because I once

319
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
was watched by

320
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
several drug dealers

321
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
when I was driving.

322
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I realized that

323
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
this was very dangerous to me.

324
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So I went back and told Cui Ying

325
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
that no one can talk about this.

326
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Nothing happened.

327
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Cui Ying said

328
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
you told her before

329
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
that if you kill someone,

330
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
you will leave it in the drug trade market

331
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
in the lower west district.

332
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Is that true?

333
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm nice to Cui Ying.

334
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
She is my junior.

335
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I've always wanted to protect her.

336
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't know why she said that.

337
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's obviously a joke.

338
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Where were you on the night of the 5th of May?

339
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I went to Chengguang Park with my friend.

340
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Then I went back to work until late at night.

341
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Where was your company?

342
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Wenchang.

343
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
We got the surveillance video

344
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
of the four-wheeled bus.

345
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The victim of the third case of the 5th of May

346
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
was in the middle of the night.

347
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
He got off the bus from Wenchang Road

348
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
at about ten o'clock that night.

349
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
He was killed at random.

350
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The murderer dumped him in the lower west district

351
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
in order to confuse the public.

352
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That was a drug trade market.

353
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What do you have to say

354
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
about this?

355
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
He got off at Wenchang Road.

356
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And then?

357
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What happened

358
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
when he got off the bus

359
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
and was killed?

360
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You don't know anything,

361
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
right?

362
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You have nothing.

363
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You have nothing.

364
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You have nothing.

365
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You have nothing.

366
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You are just joking.

367
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
A surveillance video without a back-up

368
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
is like a suicide in the first case of the fire.

369
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Captain Luo.

370
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Your case is too complicated, right?

371
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
People say that the special investigation team

372
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
is the most elite team in Xinzhou.

373
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's the last hope of Xinzhou.

374
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I think so.

375
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's not long before I'm released.

376
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You don't have anything to ask, right?

377
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Can I leave in advance?

378
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
If not,

379
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
you can give me a bed.

380
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I want to lie down for a while.

381
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Where is Xiao Qiao?

382
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Captain Luo just sent her out.

383
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Where did she go?

384
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
She said she went to find evidence.

385
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Captain Luo,

386
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
let me remind you.

387
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Not everyone

388
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
will be able to

389
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
use your old trick

390
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
to get out of the case.

391
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Don't think too much.

392
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Zhou Feng Nian.

393
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't think too much.

394
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Those hidden goods

395
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
in the 13th building

396
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
of Chengguan Public Administration

397
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
are still waiting for you to go back.

398
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Can you explain

399
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the death of the victim

400
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and the death of the victim?

401
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't know.

402
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Can you explain

403
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
the cowhide paper bag

404
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
that the victim and the deceased

405
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
held in their hands?

406
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Why is it in your private collection?

407
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Search.

408
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yes.

409
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Go.

410
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Zhou Feng Nian.

411
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Tao Fu.

412
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Zhou Hongchuan

413
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
is so scary.

414
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
He made a building

415
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
in Chengguan Public Administration.

416
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's like a collection of goods.

417
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
He actually

418
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
collected all these things.

419
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Including that cowhide paper bag.

420
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
There is a evidence warehouse

421
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
in here.

422
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It seems that he asked Cui Ying

423
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
to go here to find her.

424
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He also took her

425
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
as one of the collection

426
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and possession goods.

427
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Zhou Hongchuan

428
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
is really arrogant.

429
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Have you found

430
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
the book that belongs to He Zong Yi?

431
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I found it.

432
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Senior Lan Qiao just found

433
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
the collection that belongs to He Zong Yi.

434
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Why did the team fall?

435
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The team fell and blew it up.

436
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Nine pieces of evidence

437
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and one guess.

438
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Zhou Hongchuan is so confident.

439
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
He must be sure that

440
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
we can't find Chengguan Public Administration.

441
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
When he is most satisfied,

442
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
he can tell us the key evidence

443
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and we can directly

444
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
destroy his psychological security.

445
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
What time is it?

446
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What are you talking about?

447
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I don't understand.

448
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You want to say that it's not yours

449
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
and it has nothing to do with you?

450
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Lawyer Zhou,

451
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
there are so many private collections.

452
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Is it difficult to find your DNA?

453
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Besides,

454
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
who told you that

455
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
after He Zong Yi left

456
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the bus stop at Wenchang Road,

457
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
we couldn't find

458
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
his trace?

459
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Impossible.

460
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You are suspected of murdering on purpose

461
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and running away from the city.

462
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You are afraid that your family will recognize you

463
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
and force an innocent woman

464
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
to commit suicide.

465
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
You also broke the high-ranking defense barrier

466
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
and interfered with the investigation several times.

467
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You misled the special investigation team

468
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
and added to their credit.

469
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Zhou Hongchuan,

470
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
these are the evidence.

471
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Do you have anything else to say?

472
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
A poor man and a white man immigrated to this place.

473
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
They struggled for so many years.

474
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
They finally got along well.

475
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
They even got married.

476
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
They almost had to walk all day long.

477
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
They made a wrong step

478
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
and became a murderer.

479
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Sometimes there is a life, but there is always a life.

480
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
There is no life without force.

481
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Zhou Hongnian,

482
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I feel sorry for you.

483
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
What evidence do you have?

484
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You took me to kill.

485
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Do you have my fingerprints on the paper?

486
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Zhang Donglan's fingerprints

487
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
are clearly covered

488
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
on the blood vessels of the neck.

489
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Isn't it more direct evidence?

490
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Is it just because his family is rich

491
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
or because he...

492
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Zhang Donglan's fingerprints

493
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
are clearly covered

494
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
on the blood vessels of the neck.

495
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Mr. Zhou,

496
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
you are more capable

497
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
than the staff of our witness group.

498
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
They have to hold the machine

499
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and compare for a long time.

500
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You can only know

501
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
by subjective opinion.

502
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
A suspect.

503
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Can you call the suspect this time?

504
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Mr. Zhou.

505
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Hold it.

506
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The crime has been committed.

507
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
The rest is just some details.

508
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I won't waste your time.

509
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Wait.

510
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I am a political party.

511
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
What did you say, Mr. Zhou?

512
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
What Mr. Zhou?

513
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I am a political party.

514
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
You are a professional

515
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
and educated elite in the industry.

516
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You are in charge of this case.

517
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You are a political party.

518
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Did you hit He Zongyi

519
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
with a stick

520
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
and hit yourself?

521
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
He Zongyi was poisoned.

522
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I was helpless.

523
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I was so scared.

524
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I know you are investigating Chen Yuan's case.

525
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I can be the main witness.

526
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I can cooperate with you.

527
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
As long as you agree,

528
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
you can give me a little relief.

529
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
The case is closed.

530
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I will take the responsibility.

531
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I will take the responsibility.

532
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I will take the responsibility.

533
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I will take the responsibility.

534
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I will take the responsibility.

535
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I will take the responsibility.

536
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I will take the responsibility.

537
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I will take the responsibility.

538
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I will take the responsibility.

539
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I will take the responsibility.

540
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I will take the responsibility.

541
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I will take the responsibility.

542
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I will take the responsibility.

543
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I will take the responsibility.

544
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I will take the responsibility.

545
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I will take the responsibility.

546
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I will take the responsibility.

547
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Zhou Hongchuan,

548
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I reported to Du Zi.

549
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
We have met your requirements.

550
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Can we talk about it now?

551
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
At the end of last year,

552
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I took my team as legal counsel

553
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
to see a client in Xaxi District.

554
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
When I was driving,

555
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I met someone following me.

556
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
He Zongyi was the one who followed you?

557
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
He recognized me.

558
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
He said he had 100,000 yuan.

559
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Is it a mandarin?

560
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
When it's boiling,

561
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
it's better to use a low temperature.

562
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
He came to the office

563
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
to meet me near the company.

564
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I had no choice but to calm him down

565
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
and ask him to meet me

566
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
at the cafe downstairs.

567
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
This is a mandarin.

568
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I know.

569
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I borrowed this name when I delivered it.

570
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Mr. Feng,

571
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I'm working at a cafe now.

572
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Do you like this?

573
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Do you want some?

574
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I have a place to get it. It's cheap.

575
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
No, thanks.

576
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Mr. Feng,

577
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
you're doing well

578
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
in Xinzhou.

579
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm really happy for you.

580
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
By the way,

581
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I saw you

582
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
with a girl a few days ago.

583
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Is she your girlfriend?

584
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
What do you want?

585
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I just want to ask.

586
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Your parents are in Tianzi.

587
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
They must be happy

588
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
to see you doing so well.

589
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
He Zongyi,

590
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
don't mention this to me.

591
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I haven't spent a penny

592
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
since middle school.

593
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm not a good person.

594
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I haven't spent a penny

595
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
since middle school.

596
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I quit my job

597
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and got beaten up by others.

598
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I did everything

599
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I could to get a good job.

600
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I just wanted to read books.

601
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I would be a star one day.

602
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Now I'm finally

603
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
in Xinzhou.

604
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
No one can bully me.

605
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I didn't.

606
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'm not...

607
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Mr. Feng.

608
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Mr. Feng, I...

609
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I didn't.

610
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I didn't.

611
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
From that day on,

612
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
my nightmare began.

613
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
He Zongyi

614
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
wanted to use the monkey in the prison

615
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
to get me.

616
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You met him

617
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and you knew he was going to hurt you?

618
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
He wanted to hurt me.

619
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
He told me

620
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,400
I knew he was blackmailing me and blackmailing me

621
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,800
But I had no choice

622
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,080
I still gave him the money

623
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,120
But he still found Zhang Ying

624
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,080
Then I went to him again

625
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,920
I gave him a new phone

626
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,360
I begged him not to come to me again

627
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,040
But he was greedy

628
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,400
Then I found Chengguan Public Hall again

629
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,120
He wanted to embarrass me in front of Zhang Ying and Zhang Donglan

630
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,200
So you decided to kill him

631
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,400
I was so excited

632
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,040
Then I saw the video of Chen Yuan

633
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,120
I ran to the place to investigate

634
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,800
I found He Zongyi and a young man

635
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,520
The place they were in

636
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,040
was the place where the drugs were traded

637
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,320
He was a secret agent

638
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,120
Look carefully

639
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,800
Is the secret agent you're talking about this person?

640
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,400
Yes

641
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,800
I followed everyone

642
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,000
through the shadow on the window

643
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,000
and found him sharing drugs with He Zongyi

644
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,920
Just by seeing the shadow

645
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,680
can you tell He Zongyi is a secret agent or a blackmailer?

646
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,440
What else?

647
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
What else can it be?

648
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,960
I've seen their dealings several times

649
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,760
You saw He Zongyi's dealings

650
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
He and Xiaoqian

651
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,960
asked that friend to deal with them every time

652
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,640
But once

653
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,320
I saw a message in his phone call

654
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,400
that they were changing the deal

655
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
You don't believe it?

656
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,520
But I do

657
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
I told you

658
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,360
don't consume any drugs

659
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,580
哦

660
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,080
That night

661
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,480
on the third day

662
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,680
he came to Chengguan Mansion again

663
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,800
and no matter who paid him back

664
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:42,720
he had to see me

665
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,080
and no matter who paid him back

666
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,760
commit

667
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,160
Achild suspended

668
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,480
Senator Yin

669
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,480
who wanted to pay you back

670
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,040
Will you accept it

671
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,560
will you accept it

672
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,880
and will you change your term?

673
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:52,960
No

674
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,840
Now本

675
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
I don't know anything except money

676
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,920
I'm the crab

677
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,920
that wants to climb up the building

678
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,320
No one can escape me

679
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,040
I'm protecting myself

680
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,280
to be safe from harm

681
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
What's wrong with me?

682
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
Lawyer Zhou is right

683
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
I have three last words

684
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840
I hope Lawyer Zhou can listen to it

685
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
First

686
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
This is the autopsy report of He Zongyu

687
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
It shows

688
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
He Zongyu has never touched drugs

689
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Second

690
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
Because He Zongyu's mother wanted to make a spade

691
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
She was forced to ask you for 100,000 yuan

692
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,840
From then on, every day

693
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,840
You see clearly

694
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
Every day

695
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
She was trying to save money

696
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
and pay you back

697
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Because she was afraid you would be unhappy

698
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
She never mentioned your name to anyone

699
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Let alone your background

700
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
Oh, right

701
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
You are a person without empathy

702
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
You can't understand it, can you?

703
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
Lawyer Zhou

704
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
You are too smart

705
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,840
You are always the first to act

706
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
You think He Zongyu wants to get you

707
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,840
So you want to kill him

708
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,840
You think Zhang Donglan will be your

709
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,840
stepping stone to fall into Zhang's family

710
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
So you want to frame him

711
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
You even think He Zongyu's mother

712
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,840
will accuse you of meeting you at the door of the special investigation team

713
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,840
So you want to kill him

714
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,840
But in fact

715
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,840
The three of them have never thought of

716
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,840
stopping you

717
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
or accusing you

718
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,840
Instead, if you are not so confident

719
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,840
so arrogant and arrogant

720
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
We won't catch you so quickly

721
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
The last thing

722
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,840
I didn't report to our boss just now

723
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
As for my promise

724
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
I'm sorry

725
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
I am also a bastard

726
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840
My promise only to my future wife

727
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
I'm challenging you

728
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
You

729
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
You are my...

730
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
No, no, no

731
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
I can be your witness

732
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
My client has a lot of high-level steps

733
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
I can provide them to you

734
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
I can help you

735
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,840
I can help you

736
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,840
I can help you

737
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
I can help you

738
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
I can help you

739
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,840
Ms. Zhong

740
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,840
In the office

741
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
Your story is really fake

742
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
I heard the smoke

743
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Captain Luo

744
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
Captain Luo

745
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
Lu Wencheng

746
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,840
I can help you

747
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
I can help you

748
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,840
I can help you

749
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Luo Tian

750
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,840
Luo Tian

751
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,840
Luo Tian

752
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
Luo Tian

753
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,840
Luo Tian

754
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
Luo Tian

755
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,840
It's...

756
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Boss Zhou

757
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,840
Why did he kill Zou Yi?

758
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,840
Why?

759
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,840
Why?

760
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
Why?

761
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
Why?

762
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,840
Why?

763
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,840
Why?

764
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
Zou Yi

765
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,840
I've taught him to be a good person since he was a child

766
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,840
But he is still a bastard

767
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Did I teach him wrongly?

768
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,840
I'm sorry

769
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
I'm sorry

770
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
I'm sorry

771
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,840
I'm sorry

772
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
I'm sorry

773
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
I'm sorry

774
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
I'm sorry

775
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
I'm sorry

776
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
I'm sorry

777
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
I'm sorry

778
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,840
I'm sorry

779
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
I'm sorry

780
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,840
I'm sorry

781
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
I'm sorry

782
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,840
I'm sorry

783
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
I'm sorry

784
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
I'm sorry

785
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,840
I'm sorry

786
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
I'm sorry

787
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
I'm sorry

788
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
I'm sorry

789
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
I'm sorry

790
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
I'm sorry

791
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
I'm sorry

792
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
I'm sorry

793
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
I'm sorry

794
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,840
I'm sorry

795
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
I'm sorry

796
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,840
I'm sorry

797
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,840
I'm sorry

798
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,840
I'm sorry

799
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
I'm sorry

800
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
I'm sorry

801
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,840
I'm sorry

802
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,840
I'm sorry

803
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,840
I'm sorry

804
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,840
I'm sorry

805
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
I'm sorry

806
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,840
I'm sorry

807
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,840
I'm sorry

808
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,840
I'm sorry

809
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,840
I'm sorry

810
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,840
I'm sorry

811
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
I'm sorry

812
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,840
I'm sorry

813
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,840
I'm sorry

814
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,840
I'm sorry

815
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,840
I'm sorry

816
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,840
I'm sorry

817
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,840
I'm sorry

818
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,840
I'm sorry

819
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,840
I'm sorry

820
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,840
I'm sorry

821
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,840
I'm sorry

822
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,840
I'm sorry

823
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,840
I'm sorry

824
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,840
I'm sorry

825
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,840
I'm sorry

826
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
I'm sorry

827
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,840
I'm sorry

828
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
I'm sorry

829
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,840
I'm sorry

830
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,840
I'm sorry

831
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
I'm sorry

832
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,840
I'll get you order

833
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,840
Be careful

834
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,840
Welcome

835
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,840
To Aer astronauts

836
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,840
Strange

837
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,840
I'll leave it to you.

838
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,040
How's Zhang Ying?

839
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,560
Not good.

840
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,560
I thought he'd never

841
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,640
get involved in the case.

842
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,400
But his brother

843
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,600
was sent to the special investigation team

844
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,840
by the accomplice.

845
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,280
The murderer was actually

846
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,320
his boyfriend.

847
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,000
His uncle was also involved.

848
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,040
He was under a lot of pressure at home.

849
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,440
One of Zhou Hongchuan's collections.

850
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,800
Take a look.

851
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,640
What's this?

852
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,240
So it's him.

853
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,280
Do you want to know

854
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,720
what this pen's label is?

855
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,200
Not really.

856
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,880
You don't have to return it to me.

857
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,440
It's a bit burnt.

858
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,560
I don't want it.

859
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,520
By the way,

860
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,280
I have something to ask you.

861
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,040
Go ahead.

862
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,200
Tao Zi said

863
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,160
you saw that

864
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,720
Zhou Hongchuan and He Zongyi

865
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,040
were in the same town.

866
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,720
I'm curious.

867
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,040
Zhou Hongchuan

868
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,600
has no obstacles in his cognition.

869
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,240
He's good at hiding himself.

870
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,440
How did you know?

871
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,840
I can only say that Zhou Hongchuan

872
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,800
is too arrogant.

873
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,640
You came to pick up Zhang Donglan that day.

874
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,320
Zhou Hongchuan came to me

875
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,600
to ask about the progress of the case.

876
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,680
Actually, it's not important.

877
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,440
This is a custom in our hometown.

878
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,080
After a pack of cigarettes is opened,

879
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,880
pick one, pour it back,

880
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,600
and make a wish.

881
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,000
This must be left until the end.

882
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,800
You can only make a wish

883
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,760
if you pick it yourself.

884
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,680
Make a wish?

885
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,200
So He Zongyi...

886
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,000
You saw it.

887
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,640
It's in the surveillance video of the crossroad.

888
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,600
Huang先 infantry Republic

889
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:29,820
No.

890
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,320
It can't help but speak.

891
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,600
I'll be there soon.

892
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,600
What a pity.

893
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,600
What's a pity?

894
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,600
No one will ever know...

895
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,600
what a pity is.

896
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,600
What a pity is.

897
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,600
The End

898
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,600
Dear audience,

899
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,600
this is FM 88.6.

900
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,600
Next, we'll be bringing you

901
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,600
the best of the best of the best.

902
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,600
Master, how much further?

903
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,600
About 10 kilometers.

904
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,600
Okay, 10 kilometers.

905
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,600
The End

906
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,600
Hello, Xiao Qiao.

907
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,600
Hello, Boss.

908
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,600
The day we found out that Hong Fu was arrested,

909
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,600
are you sure you've sent me the information?

910
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,600
Yes, Boss. I've sent you the information.

911
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,600
There can't be any mistakes.

912
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,600
And the people in the group

913
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,600
were all in the same group.

914
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,600
No one could have escaped.

915
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,600
What's wrong, Boss?

916
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,600
Nothing. I'm hanging up.

917
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,600
The End

918
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,600
Let us live a few days

919
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,600
in this short life.

920
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,600
Let us live happily.

921
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,600
Let us hide our lives.

922
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,600
My crime is too obvious.

923
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,600
What you just heard was

924
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,600
the award for the best music score

925
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,600
of the music reading.

926
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,600
The winner is...

927
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,600
Thank you for listening.

928
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,600
Hello, Boss.

929
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,600
When I was packing up the files,

930
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,600
I found that there were two more things that didn't work.

931
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,600
That night, besides Zhou Hongchuan,

932
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,600
there was an empty account

933
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,600
that sent a message to He Zongyi.

934
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,600
The letter was sent to the one in Hong Di.

935
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,600
He Zongyi is not a drug addict.

936
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,600
Why would someone send him such a message?

937
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,600
What was the purpose?

938
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,600
And another one.

939
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,600
That day, in Hong Fu's main hall,

940
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,600
he gave me an address to remind me of that reception.

941
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,600
I just saw that night.

942
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,600
From Hong Fu's main hall,

943
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,600
everyone's information was taken away.

944
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,600
There was no such person.

945
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,600
This person could actually

946
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,600
disappear from the eyes of the special investigation team.

947
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,600
Isn't that strange?

948
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,600
Tao Ze.

949
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,600
Tao Ze.

950
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,600
Wei Zhao.

951
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,600
Please look.

952
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,600
He's here again.

953
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,600
After the special investigation team entered,

954
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,600
the drug case in the West West Region was reported.

955
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,600
The Deputy Chief of the Department of the Department of Justice of the West West Region, Cui Hongliang,

956
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
is still being investigated.

957
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,600
Reporter Yu Tong is reporting for you.

958
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,600
It's so noisy.

959
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,600
I really didn't expect

960
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,600
such a thing to happen.

961
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,600
Fortunately, Mr. Pei hasn't signed

962
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,600
the contract to invest in the development of the West West Region's property.

963
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,600
Mr. Su is right.

964
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,600
If we sign it,

965
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,600
it will really have a bad impact.

966
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,600
Yes.

967
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,600
But I think Mr. Su, you said

968
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,600
it's still very important.

969
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,600
There's no such thing.

970
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,600
If we don't do it in the West West Region,

971
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,600
we might as well start over.

972
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,600
Let's plan the 13th District's ice and sea Bay.

973
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,600
13th District's ice and sea Bay?

974
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,600
That's right.

975
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,600
I saw the 13th District's ice and sea Bay plan

976
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,600
my dad and you did three years ago.

977
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,600
I think it's very good.

978
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,600
But this project

979
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,600
is still in a state of being put aside.

980
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,600
I think the time is just right now.

981
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,600
What do you think, Mr. Su?

982
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,600
This... I have to ask.

983
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,600
Who are you asking about Mr. Pei?

984
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,600
How about this, Mr. Pei?

985
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,600
I'll go to the company tomorrow

986
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,600
to discuss with the vice president, okay?

987
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,600
Then I'll trouble you, Mr. Su.

988
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,600
Okay. I'll take my leave.

989
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,600
I won't see you out.

990
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,600
Du Jia, you heard it, right?

991
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,600
What do you think is wrong with this?

992
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,600
I still don't understand

993
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,600
what their purpose this time is.

994
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,600
Is it to expose the West West Region's

995
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,600
drug trafficking?

996
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,600
To take down Cui Hongliang.

997
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,600
What is this? To eliminate harm for the people.

998
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,600
I don't care what their purpose this time is.

999
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,600
I can't wait to know

1000
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,600
what they want to do next.

1001
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,600
Next?

1002
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,600
I found the 13th District's ice and sea Bay

1003
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,600
when I was in Cui Ming.

1004
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,600
But Su Cheng was just

1005
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,600
talking about this.

1006
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
This must be an important clue.

1007
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,600
What are we going to do next?

1008
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,600
Yu Lian's story is over.

1009
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,600
Next.

1010
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,600
Who is it going to be?

1011
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,600
I'm sorry.

1012
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,600
I'm sorry.

1013
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,600
I'm sorry.

1014
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,600
I'm sorry.

1015
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,600
I'm sorry.

1016
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,600
I'm sorry.

1017
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,600
I'm sorry.

1018
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,600
I'm sorry.

1019
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,600
I'm sorry.

1020
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,600
I'm sorry.

1021
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,600
I'm sorry.

1022
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,600
I'm sorry.

1023
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,600
I'm sorry.

1024
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,600
I'm sorry.

1025
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,600
I'm sorry.

1026
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,600
I'm sorry.

1027
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,600
I'm sorry.

1028
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,600
I'm sorry.

1029
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,600
I'm sorry.

1030
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,600
I'm sorry.

1031
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,600
I'm sorry.

1032
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,600
I'm sorry.

1033
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,600
I'm sorry.

1034
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,600
I'm sorry.

1035
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,600
I'm sorry.

1036
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,600
I'm sorry.

1037
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,600
I'm sorry.

1038
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,600
I'm sorry.

1039
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
I'm sorry.

1040
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,600
I'm sorry.

1041
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,600
I'm sorry.

1042
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,600
I'm sorry.

1043
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,600
I'm sorry.

1044
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,600
I'm sorry.

1045
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,600
I'm sorry.

1046
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,600
I'm sorry.

1047
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,600
I'm sorry.

1048
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,600
I'm sorry.

1049
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,600
I'm sorry.

1050
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,600
I'm sorry.

1051
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,600
I'm sorry.

1052
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,600
I'm sorry.

1053
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,600
I'm sorry.

1054
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,600
I'm sorry.

1055
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,600
I'm sorry.

1056
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,600
I'm sorry.

1057
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,600
I'm sorry.

1058
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,600
I'm sorry.

1059
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,600
I'm sorry.

1060
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,600
I'm sorry.

1061
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,600
I'm sorry.

1062
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,600
I'm sorry.

1063
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600
I'm sorry.

1064
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,600
I'm sorry.

1065
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,600
I'm sorry.

1066
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,600
I'm sorry.

1067
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,600
I'm sorry.
