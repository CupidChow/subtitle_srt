1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,800
Tenth year.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,040
For our attention.

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,960
Wei Wenxuan.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,520
Someone claimed that you are the leader...

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,400
of a small school group.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,400
They often instruct others.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,080
For example, flushed skin kids.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,880
He's葉 cohesive hurt others...

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,880
and his people.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Do you admit it?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
On the 26th of this month,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Feng Bin was killed in Yelang Valley.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Someone pointed out that you colluded with a wanted criminal

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and attempted to kill him.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How do you explain this?

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Can you talk about the location of Xia Xin'an's phone?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I didn't expect that

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the Xia Xin'an who bullied you in the school

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
would also have the courage to report you.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Wei Wenxuan, stop struggling.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You have built those levels and principles

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
of the school.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They are all collapsed.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
All your classmates

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
are in the next interrogation room.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Where did you get the drug?

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Honestly,

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
this is your chance to confess.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I want to see my father to find me a lawyer.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Long Yuncheng?

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Are you sure?

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If so, I'll take someone there now.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The entire building is the place of the chief's office.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If we don't prepare to go there,

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm afraid it will only alert the enemy.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And Senior,

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
we can't talk about what happened in the opening ceremony.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I suspect that

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
someone has changed.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Senior,

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I have a way.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll go with you.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If you don't believe me,

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
just leave it to me.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll call you when I have news.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Wait.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Is Xiao Hanyang, the 250, with you?

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Watch her for me.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll take Tao Ze with me tonight.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's have dinner together.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So is Luo De still angry?

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're so good at talking.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Can you help me look at this check?

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Where is it wrong?

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I think you're good at dealing with the team.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There's another one.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You took the wrong way, Mr. Pei.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You should have done it earlier.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Now you...

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000

Xiao Yang Yang, you're not a small-minded person.

173
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You should be careful when you talk outside.

174

I know, Captain Luo.

175
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000

Put your phone together.

183
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
No one is allowed to touch it.

184
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000

I'll go first. Don't be too spicy.

195
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay.

196
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Be careful.

197
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't burn your hand.

198
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Ping Di Guo.

199
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Stop jumping around.

200
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Come and eat.

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Ping Di Guo, stop jumping around.

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Ping Di Guo, stop!

203
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What? You even looked at it?

204
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Your bag is old.

205
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I have a few new ones. I'll change them for you later.

206
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay, I'll take the most expensive one.

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Who is it?

208
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Anyone is possible.

209
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
There's nothing valuable in my bag.

210
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't usually care.

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Usually, it's just a random throw.

212
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Anyone, ordinary people, victims, and current people,

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
are all possible.

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's not necessarily that they're all people.

215
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Indeed.

216
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
If it were me,

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I would have the cutting equipment installed on Captain Luo.

218
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
At least, you two would have one person.

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
In Old Yang's will,

220
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
it mentioned the 327 case and the sale.

221
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So this person should be their accomplice.

222
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Even earlier.

223
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What are you talking about?

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
This 250 case is a big sale.

225
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It counts as the victim's family.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Then I should be

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
a criminal who betrayed the organization

228
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and counts as the victim's family.

229
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Everyone has different information.

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We eat together and talk to each other.

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll introduce you to the rest.

232
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Eat.

233
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Thank you, Senior.

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Wei Wei, the snacks you ordered are ready.

235
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay, thank you.

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Thank you.

237
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Xiao Guo.

238
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Wei Wei, why are you here?

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I brought you food.

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Here.

241
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Thank you, Wei Wei.

242
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You always bring us food.

243
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm hungry.

244
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Eat more.

245
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's delicious.

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Right?

247
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This is Wei Wen Xuan's father, Wei Zhan Hong.

248
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
He is a low profile person.

249
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He never shows up in public.

250
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The two landmarks in Xinzhou,

251
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Long Yun City and Feng Xi City,

252
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
are his business.

253
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Is there any other information?

254
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There are rumors in the circle

255
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
that Wei Zhan Hong is the owner of the company.

256
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He is the owner of the company.

257
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He is the owner of the company.

258
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He is the owner of the company.

259
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He is the owner of the company.

260
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He is the owner of the company.

261
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
There are rumors in the circle

262
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
that Wei Zhan Hong is a famous star.

263
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He is not that lucky.

264
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You asked his competitors

265
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
for a favor.

266
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
A favor?

267
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
A favor?

268
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If the target of the intruder is Wei Zhan Hong,

269
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
then many things can be said.

270
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Even though Wei Wen Xuan,

271
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
the little bastard,

272
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
doesn't talk about Du Guosheng,

273
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
he confessed about the group violence.

274
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
He also said that he learned that

275
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
from a netizen in school.

276
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You also know

277
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
the name of that netizen.

278
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Like Sha Du Fu.

279
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The most urgent thing now

280
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
is to find Du Guosheng.

281
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Can we check the surveillance video

282
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
of Long Yun City that Xiao Xiao and the others mentioned in the daytime?

283
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If we investigate directly,

284
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
it's not very convenient.

285
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The whole building is Wei Zhan Hong's.

286
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's their own business.

287
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The surveillance video near the fishing ground is theoretically okay.

288
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But the surveillance video needs to be applied.

289
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It also needs a proper reason.

290
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's not something we can just fish.

291
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And even if the bugs in the bag are not made by ourselves,

292
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
it's a matter of culture.

293
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Before we can reach the size of seven,

294
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
we still need to be careful.

295
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
By the way,

296
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
what's the plan you told me this afternoon?

297
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Don't worry.

298
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
My people

299
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
are in place.

300
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What's wrong?

301
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I can't either. Can you check it for me?

302
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I need to go to the toilet. I can only take a nap in there.

303
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I can't go in there. You can just sleep here.

304
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Okay. I'll keep an eye on you.

305
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Before and after noon on October 16th.

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the lobby,

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
the front and back doors and the garage.

308
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the lobby, the front and back doors and the garage.

309
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the lobby, the front and back doors and the garage.

310
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the lobby, the front and back doors and the garage.

311
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the lobby, the front and back doors and the garage.

312
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the lobby, the front and back doors and the garage.

313
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the lobby, the front and back doors and the garage.

314
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the lobby, the front and back doors and the garage.

315
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the lobby, the front and back doors and the garage.

316
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the lobby, the front and back doors and the garage.

317
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the lobby, the front and back doors and the garage.

318
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the lobby, the front and back doors and the garage.

319
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the lobby, the front and back doors and the garage.

320
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the lobby, the front and back doors and the garage.

321
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the front and back doors and the garage.

322
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the front and back doors and the garage.

323
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the front and back doors and the garage.

324
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the front and back doors and the garage.

325
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the front and back doors and the garage.

326
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the front and back doors and the garage.

327
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the front and back doors and the garage.

328
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the front and back doors and the garage.

329
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the front and back doors and the garage.

330
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The surveillance video of the restaurant, the front and back doors and the garage.

331
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Guo Zi.

332
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Guo Zi.

333
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Xiao Guo went to the bathroom.

334
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's me.

335
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I saw that you were working so hard, so I brought you food.

336
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Wei?

337
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Wait for me to change my clothes.

338
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Wait for me to change clothes.

339
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,000
The person has reminded me that I took good care of you and I was monter tired of the經.

340
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,240
Now I don't want to think about them anymore.

341
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,240
I will go meet my hideout.

342
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,000
Come on.

343
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm sorry.

344
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Over here, please.

345
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,300
Thank you for your hard work.

346
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,600
What?

347
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,560
Datian.

348
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,800
What's wrong?

349
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,280
Don't worry.

350
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,880
My people can't tell if the ghost is real or fake,

351
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,800
& haven't been found.

352
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,760
Who just turned off the monitor?

353
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,160
A couple of my friends.

354
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,600
You never think of me,

355
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,160
but you know that?

356
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,100
A expert in cloth production

357
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,240
makes people love cloths.

358
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,880
He is Du Guosheng,

359
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,080
Keep this money.

360
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,480
Wait until we catch Du Guosheng.

361
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Catch Wei Wenxuan.

362
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,320
It's not too late.

363
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,960
Let's see where he left from.

364
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Du Guosheng

365
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,000
Du Guosheng is too cunning.

366
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,120
He even took off the car license plate.

367
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,320
That's normal.

368
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,360
He has been hiding in the warehouse for years.

369
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,360
He's a man who's always a little bit

370
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,160
cautious and is always threatened by dreamers.

371
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
It's almost half a month.

372
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,280
Even if the carpet is visiting the locals,

373
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,240
it's unlikely to find the witness.

374
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,480
Xiao Yang, what are you looking at?

375
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,240
There's a reflective mirror here.

376
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,440
Du Guosheng

377
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,560
3,

378
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,120
6,

379
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,880
I can't see what's in front.

380
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,960
It could've been X,

381
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,920
or K.

382
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,120
No worries,

383
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,040
we only need a few clues.

384
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,240
Hello, Lao Qiu.

385
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,440
I need your help with something.

386
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,040
My girlfriend's car was hit by a car two days ago.

387
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,840
Of course she ran away.

388
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,240
I only found out today.

389
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,840
Please check it for me.

390
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,240
By the way,

391
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,040
keep this a secret.

392
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,640
It's not good to tell people about this.

393
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

394
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,440
I'm sorry.

395
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
I'm sorry.

396
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,240
I'm sorry.

397
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,240
I'm sorry.

398
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,040
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
I'm sorry.

400
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
I'm sorry.

401
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,240
It's a black car.

402
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,440
It looks good.

403
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,640
October 16th, around 12 o'clock in the afternoon.

404
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
It was hit by a surveillance camera in Longjing City.

405
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,840
The number of the license plate is 336.

406
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,640
It looks like a local car.

407
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,840
Thank you.

408
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,640
My brother did this for me.

409
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,240
I'll bring you some good cigarettes later.

410
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,840
Okay.

411
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,640
What are you looking at?

412
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
You don't ask for help.

413
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,840
You just want to play around.

414
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
That's what you have.

415
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,240
The most important thing in our heart

416
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
is human resources.

417
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,240
You don't know how to grasp it.

418
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Wait for the dawn.

419
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,440
I'll go to the patrol team.

420
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,440
Dao Ze.

421
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,240
You and Xiao Han Yang go back to the special investigation team.

422
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,840
Ask Wei Zhan Hong and the other members of the group

423
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
to cooperate in the investigation.

424
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,240
Wait for my news.

425
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,040
Pei Su.

426
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,240
Wait for my news.

427
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,040
Don't act without permission.

428
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,440
Enough.

429
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
Stop wiping.

430
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,640
You've even made your eyes dirty.

431
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,240
The first thing we need now

432
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
is to find the place where Du Guosheng is hiding.

433
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,840
This may be the only chance

434
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,040
for us to get close to the wanted criminal.

435
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,440
This is a long night.

436
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,840
We must act quickly.

437
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,240
Listen up, everyone.

438
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,040
First, be careful of speed.

439
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,240
Second, be careful of confidentiality.

440
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,040
Third,

441
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,640
be careful of your own safety.

442
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,640
Fourth,

443
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,240
be careful of the communication equipment.

444
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,240
If you're not sure if you're being heard,

445
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,040
just walk a little.

446
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,240
Xiao Han Yang.

447
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Please

448
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
clean up the problem with the mouth organ.

449
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,040
Don't say anything to me.

450
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,240
Captain Luo.

451
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,840
Although I've tested and wiped it,

452
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,240
I'm still not a commander.

453
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,840
I'm the commander.

454
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,840
Is that okay?

455
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,640
Excuse me.

456
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,840
You're not going to sleep?

457
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Wei Wei.

458
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,240
Why aren't you asleep?

459
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,640
I...

460
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,840
I can't sleep.

461
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,240
I just want to ask you.

462
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,440
Are you going to catch the bad guy?

463
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,240
Yes.

464
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,440
Maybe we're getting close this time.

465
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,440
Don't cry.

466
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,640
I...

467
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,240
Sister Wang.

468
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Are you okay?

469
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,640
She's safe.

470
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,240
Don't worry.

471
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,640
Wei Wei.

472
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,640
You did a good job.

473
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,040
What else do I need to do?

474
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,640
Captain Luo, just tell me.

475
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,640
I'm not afraid of anything.

476
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,240
As long as I can catch the bad guy,

477
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,840
I don't care about getting shot

478
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,240
or having a meeting with them.

479
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,040
No.

480
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,240
We're not that far.

481
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,040
We're probably never going to be that far.

482
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,440
Yay?

483
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,840
Jump!

484
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,240
I'mguilty!

485
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,840
When will our kid turn up?

486
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,440
I'll go to your director to talk

487
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,400
Sorry, sorry

488
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,440
What's your problem?

489
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,960
What's your problem?

490
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,080
Don't tell me that

491
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,880
I don't understand

492
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,840
This is my business

493
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,560
Don't worry

494
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,520
Sit down, okay?

495
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,560
I don't understand

496
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,520
Calm down

497
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,640
I don't understand

498
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,440
I know

499
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,080
Calm down

500
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,280
We'll give you the result

501
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,000
Don't worry

502
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,640
Sorry

503
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,440
Please trust us

504
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,400
Calm down

505
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,040
Calm down

506
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,080
Calm down

507
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,800
Yes

508
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,920
Why don't you answer?

509
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,480
The car is not in good condition

510
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,480
According to the clues provided by Lao Qiu

511
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,480
The time and location of the car

512
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,480
The local car is well maintained

513
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,080
These conditions were checked

514
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,440
I found this car

515
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,720
After receiving the sound

516
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,240
I came here

517
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,840
East market

518
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,480
But is it too obvious?

519
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,160
This year's high-end consumer market

520
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,680
I've checked it several times

521
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,200
The entire industry is very bad

522
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,280
The common area is in such a big place

523
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,320
The common area is in such a big place

524
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,760
The common area is in such a big place

525
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,240
The wanted criminal is raised in such a big place

526
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Is it not fatal?

527
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Maybe it's dark

528
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,640
The golf course here

529
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,920
Provide delivery service

530
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,040
The car used

531
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,080
Like the one that delivered the sound

532
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,800
In Longyun City that day

533
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,160
The same as the last one

534
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,520
East street

535
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,000
I have to think of a way to get in

536
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,760
Contact these delivery drivers

537
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,680
How to get in

538
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,680
Is it your salary?

539
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,440
I have arranged it

540
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,080
That's it

541
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,040
Ok, Mr. Du

542
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,280
You have worked so hard today

543
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,080
Should be

544
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,280
This is what you do

545
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,240
Be careful of your feet

546
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,280
No problem

547
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,880
Bye bye

548
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,240
Ok, take care

549
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,520
Be careful

550
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,280
Take care, Mr. Du

551
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,920
Take care, Mr. Du

552
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,280
The big city wants us to drink soup

553
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,800
It's all like this

554
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,360
It's all like this

555
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,320
Ok ok

556
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,280
It's so tiring to talk like this

557
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,600
Sir

558
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,880
What do you do

559
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,840
What do you do

560
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,720
There is a mine at home

561
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,240
This business is not good

562
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,040
I quit

563
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,360
This brother

564
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,880
Find me to do something else

565
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,320
very good

566
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,720
There are many accidents ahead

567
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,680
Please be careful of the driving

568
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,040
What's up

569
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,040
No, it's okay to be in the line

570
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,640
Brother

571
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,720
This car is not good

572
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Next time I will change a car for me

573
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,960
Just that

574
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,160
Do you know

575
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,120
Just that

576
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,120
Just the mud

577
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,800
Full face all over the lake

578
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,720
Just their hotel

579
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,760
That whole thing

580
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,360
All are millions of good cars

581
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,640
There is a photo

582
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,920
Why are you still with me

583
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,120
Keep communicating

584
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,760
No, it's okay

585
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,280
Master, ask a question

586
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,680
No, you said

587
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,960
Your car is outside

588
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,320
If it's scratched

589
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,600
Who pays

590
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,320
I think this is all the company's car

591
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,120
Unified

592
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,760
If something goes wrong

593
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,880
It must be the company

594
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,760
Then you don't have to find me

595
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,040
I tell you

596
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,400
I don't care if he hits me in front

597
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,680
I'll go straight up

598
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,400
I'll pay him

599
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,680
I don't have to pay for it

600
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,160
Is it?

601
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,280
I usually do my job

602
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,080
When the company is out

603
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,120
I said the client was out

604
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,320
What can he do for me

605
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,240
You don't have to pay for it, brother

606
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,200
Just your business

607
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,720
Just count money at home

608
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,200
Boss

609
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,720
Not as simple as you say

610
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,200
Our cars are all company

611
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,640
The company has its own rules

612
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,080
Besides, we usually

613
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,520
Are all fixed cars

614
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,880
If we have money

615
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,440
Insurance fee

616
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,720
Too much higher than other cars

617
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,400
Then the company is not stupid

618
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,600
I can see it with my eyes

619
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,720
No way

620
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,160
Brother

621
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,320
How much time do you have to get to the airport

622
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,720
This is still fifteen minutes

623
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,760
People

624
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,600
No, I can't

625
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,080
I'm going to

626
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,040
My feet

627
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,040
I'm so scared

628
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,000
You come to me

629
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,960
Is it okay to stop behind

630
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,600
No

631
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,960
I can't joke about this now

632
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,000
I'm on a high-rise bridge

633
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,480
How can I

634
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,280
What do you think i am

635
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,400
I don't know this is a bridge

636
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,600
I let you go down

637
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,720
Good good good

638
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,360
No, I can't

639
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,080
I can't stand it

640
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,400
Good

641
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,600
Let me go down

642
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,940
good

643
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:57,880
teacher

644
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Mr. Pei, I've finished handling it.

645
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Captain Luo, I helped you arrest the wanted criminal.

646
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Do you think SID will give me a big prize?

647
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Don't worry, I've already handed the person over to SID.

648
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I didn't violate the rules.

649
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I didn't expect that little Feng Chao was really hiding something.

650
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
That driver.

651
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The evidence is in the head.

652
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
The evidence is Sun Xin.

653
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Actually, they are all fake names and fake documents.

654
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
The real name is Sun Jiaxing.

655
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Two years ago, her child was sick.

656
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
She had a surgery and needed money.

657
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
She was fooled by her friend and was taken to the police.

658
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
She didn't expect that she would be caught before she could make money.

659
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
But she was in the hospital at the time.

660
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
She wasn't caught by the scene.

661
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
She wanted to turn herself in.

662
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But those people found her and gave her money.

663
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
The condition was to let her go to Xinzhou and find a job that was not in her hands.

664
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Are they the hunters of the wanted criminal?

665
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
They can get money from the cat of the Wen family.

666
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
On the 16th of October, was it her who drove the car and sent Du Guosheng?

667
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Yes.

668
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
The cars of their company are all fixed-wing drivers.

669
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
That Du.

670
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
He had to apply to the company in advance.

671
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Du Guosheng was raised in Feng Chao?

672
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
No.

673
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Although they all have a proper position in the company.

674
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
For example,

675
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Du Guosheng.

676
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
His name is Du Lin.

677
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
He is a electrician.

678
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But they only arrive in Feng Chao from the residence before they leave the office.

679
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Then they take the car of the company to the client.

680
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
After that, they have to travel through Feng Chao.

681
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
In this case, if they are watched outside,

682
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
or if they are caught by someone,

683
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
they can only get to Feng Chao.

684
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
No one can find their residence inside Feng Chao.

685
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:23,820
Feng Chao is a

686
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
What's going on?

687
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
When did he get here?

688
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'm telling you.

689
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You are the big boss.

690
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
We are the big boss.

691
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You are...

692
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You are...

693
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Come on.

694
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Don't be like this.

695
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Don't be like this.

696
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Come on.

697
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Calm down.

698
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Calm down.

699
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Calm down.

700
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Calm down.

701
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Calm down.

702
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Calm down.

703
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Calm down.

704
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Calm down.

705
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Calm down.

706
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Calm down.

707
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Sit down.

708
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Calm down.

709
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Sit down.

710
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Calm down.

711
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Calm down.

712
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Calm down.

713
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Please believe us.

714
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Please believe us.

715
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Calm down.

716
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Please calm down.

717
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Come.

718
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Come.

719
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Calm down.

720
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Calm down.

721
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
By asking the police,

722
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
they will treat you well.

723
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Calm down.

724
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
People are always wrong.

725
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Don't hurt your children,

726
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Don't worry.

727
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Believe us.

728
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Okay?

729
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
At least stay calm.

730
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Just sixteen years old.

731
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You don't have to do all this.

732
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
During this time,

733
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
you are only a crazy girl.

734
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You can never convince people to stay calm.

735
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Yes.

736
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
In the past,

737
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,280
I'll take you to the toilet.

738
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,640
This child has been in there for a day.

739
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,480
I won't tell you.

740
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,200
What can you let go?

741
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,600
I'm sorry. Please wait a moment.

742
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,920
Sir, where are you going now?

743
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,120
We can take you to the toilet.

744
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,720
I'm going to the toilet.

745
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,400
What?

746
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,640
Are you afraid I'll run away?

747
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,240
I didn't mean that.

748
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,000
All right, all right, all right.

749
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
My son was detained here by you.

750
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,000
Where can I go?

751
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,320
Yes.

752
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,800
Then we, He Zhou,

753
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
come here

754
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,000
to the toilet.

755
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,320
You have to follow me.

756
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,800
Listen to me, everyone.

757
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,480
Listen to me, everyone.

758
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
I suggest

759
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,120
they take the handcuffs directly.

760
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,680
Sir.

761
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,800
We can arrest them.

762
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,200
Everyone, right?

763
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,520
Sir, we didn't mean that.

764
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,080
We...

765
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,280
We can arrest them.

766
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,560
We can arrest them.

767
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,880
Why are you taking the handcuffs?

768
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,040
Calm down, everyone.

769
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,760
Don't be angry.

770
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,080
We didn't mean that.

771
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,680
When can we go home?

772
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,360
When can we go home?

773
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,440
When?

774
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,840
I just want to know when.

775
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,760
When can we go home?

776
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,520
I understand.

777
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,400
We understand your feelings.

778
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,600
Please calm down.

779
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
Calm down.

780
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,480
We must complete the task

781
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,680
of arresting He Zhou.

782
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,280
I can't.

783
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,760
Go.

784
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,360
Go.

785
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,200
Go, go.

786
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,480
You.

787
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,480
Xiaohai Yang, what are you doing?

788
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
What are you doing?

789
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,800
This is the men's toilet.

790
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
You don't know anything.

791
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
Why are you helping me?

792
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
I'm not helping you.

793
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
Can you handle it?

794
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
I...

795
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Forget it if you don't want to tell me.

796
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Compared to the suspect,

797
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
I certainly believe in the colleagues

798
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
who usually work with me.

799
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,480
But if you make me believe the wrong person,

800
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,480
you'd better be careful.

801
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
I'll kill you later.

802
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,480
Kill me?

803
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
I'm not going to kill you.

804
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,480
I'm not going to kill you.

805
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,000
Listen,

806
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,480
don't go to visit me immediately.

807
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,520
Go!

808
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
Let's go to the Pay Line!

809
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,520
Yes!

810
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Hurry.

811
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
Get into my car.

812
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:18,560
The

813
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,400
Xiao Cheng, what does this mean?

814
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,720
It should be for the people who are confused about the red.

815
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,000
But it can't be delayed for too long.

816
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,400
Where is Du Guosheng hiding?

817
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,080
Near Feng Chao?

818
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,680
The location and service location are too obvious.

819
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,240
Even if it's dark,

820
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,080
two more people like Du Guosheng

821
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,640
with the same appearance and temperament as the ordinary wanted criminals,

822
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,440
it's hard to find them.

823
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,800
According to what you said,

824
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,280
from Feng Chao to Du Guosheng hiding place,

825
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,920
if it's a distance that's not close,

826
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,240
will he use the traffic tools?

827
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,640
It can't be Feng Chao's military vehicle.

828
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,400
That driver named San didn't say anything.

829
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,760
They should be from hiding place to Feng Chao,

830
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,880
then from Feng Chao to other places.

831
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,600
These are two lines.

832
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,640
They should be kept secret between each other.

833
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,160
Otherwise,

834
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,320
it's meaningless to put fire on them.

835
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,160
It's impossible to use public transportation.

836
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,080
That driver said

837
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,280
Du Guosheng's fake name is Du Lin.

838
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,040
His fake identity is

839
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,640
Feng Chao's maintenance shop, right?

840
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,840
The electric car.

841
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,840
The electric car.

842
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,400
The electric car.

843
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,440
The electric car.

844
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,760
Check the situation on October 16.

845
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,280
Which insurance did Young Master Wei book?

846
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,120
And,

847
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,440
check Young Master Wei's consumption record.

848
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,040
Hurry up.

849
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,600
Young Master Wei hasn't been here recently.

850
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,960
I didn't ask you to check the latest.

851
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,920
Check the last month's.

852
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,120
Check the last year's.

853
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,720
Chao's company isn't internal sir.

854
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
It's special.

855
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,920
We Quando start testing the number of Wenお願いします test.

856
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,720
OK.

857
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,440
OK.

858
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,840
You are wired back to the mobile phone.

859
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,080
Your updating is canceled.

860
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,480
Your number is not in service.

861
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,320
Please wait for a while.

862
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,320
There are four lines of the bus.

863
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,320
It should be planned by the team of the professional.

864
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,680
Every station on the way

865
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,520
is in a place where the population is relatively concentrated.

866
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,200
This kind of location is hard to hide.

867
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,440
But there are three lines of the bus.

868
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,760
One is single-storied.

869
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,720
There are people on every station of the bus.

870
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,240
Only the single-storied line

871
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,720
has a finishing line.

872
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,560
A finishing line?

873
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,000
You mean

874
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,480
this single-storied line is from the east to the west.

875
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,280
The staff of the night shift

876
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,240
will be sent from Fengchao to the ecological park in the morning.

877
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,880
The bus will be sent at 10 o'clock in the morning

878
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,160
and will arrive at 12 o'clock.

879
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,520
But the return train in the afternoon

880
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,240
will be sent from the ecological park at 2 o'clock

881
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,520
and will arrive at Fengchao at 4 o'clock.

882
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,200
The gap between the two stations is only two hours.

883
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,760
It's very rare to see this kind of design on the bus.

884
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,200
I understand what you mean.

885
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,680
But you

886
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,720
are just guessing.

887
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,640
There is a saying.

888
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,400
The second half of the single-storied line

889
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,280
is the same as the extension line

890
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,880
of the subway line 10

891
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,640
that opened in October last year.

892
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,480
And

893
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,000
one of the stations

894
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,120
is only two hundred meters

895
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,680
from the nearest subway station.

896
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
If I were the manager,

897
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,400
I would either delete the whole line

898
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,920
or remove the second half of the line.

899
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,280
Maybe Fengchao is too big and too small.

900
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,520
They don't care about this line.

901
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,040
Or

902
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,520
the management staff is too slow

903
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,400
and can't react.

904
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,640
It's all possible.

905
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,560
If you can be sure

906
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,640
that Du Guosheng once hid a point called Fengchao,

907
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,920
he must have used a traffic tool.

908
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,560
And the traffic tool he used

909
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,360
must be a bus.

910
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Then I agree with your guess.

911
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,400
But the problem is

912
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,040
how can you be sure?

913
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,040
Why didn't he use a delivery truck?

914
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,000
Why didn't he use a small bus

915
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,800
for this?

916
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,440
Because I heard a saying.

917
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,360
It's in that place.

918
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,680
I'm sure it's in that place.

919
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,320
But I don't know where it is.

920
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,560
I don't know where it is.

921
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,720
I don't know where it is.

922
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,560
I don't know where it is.

923
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,360
I don't know where it is.

924
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,240
I don't know where it is.

925
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,240
I don't know where it is.

926
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,240
I don't know where it is.

927
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,240
I don't know where it is.

928
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,240
I don't know where it is.

929
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,240
I don't know where it is.

930
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,240
I don't know where it is.

931
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,240
I don't know where it is.

932
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,240
I don't know where it is.

933
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,240
I don't know where it is.

934
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,240
I don't know where it is.

935
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,240
I don't know where it is.

936
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
I don't know where it is.

937
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,240
I don't know where it is.

938
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,240
I don't know where it is.

939
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,240
I don't know where it is.

940
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
I don't know where it is.

941
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,640
I don't know where it is.

942
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,640
I don't know where it is.

943
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,640
I don't know where it is.

944
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,640
I don't know where it is.

945
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
I don't know where it is.

946
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,640
I don't know where it is.

947
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,640
I don't know where it is.

948
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,640
I don't know where it is.

949
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,640
I don't know where it is.

950
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,640
I don't know where it is.

951
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
I don't know where it is.

952
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,640
I don't know where it is.

953
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,640
I don't know where it is.

954
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,640
I don't know where it is.

955
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,640
I don't know where it is.

956
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,640
I don't know where it is.

957
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,640
I don't know where it is.

958
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,640
I don't know where it is.

959
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,640
I don't know where it is.

960
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
I don't know where it is.

961
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,640
I don't know where it is.

962
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,640
Look at me.

963
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,640
I'm not adding any risking money.

964
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,640
Do I need to use

965
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,640
useless scrap iron

966
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,640
as military weapons?

967
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,640
Go and get some private rooms for them.

968
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,640
I'm willing to go out.

969
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,640
Get lost!

970
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,640
There are people waiting to catch them and make contributions.

971
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,640
In the future, whoever is not careful to leak the information

972
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,640
and die with the people living with him.

973
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,640
The King's Avatar

974
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,640
Don't search.

975
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,640
Let's go.

976
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,640
Go to the central station.

977
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,640
Seven or eight years ago,

978
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,640
you didn't even know what Pei Chongyu was talking about.

979
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,640
Why do you remember the conversation you overheard in the accident so clearly?

980
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,640
You asked me to help you before.

981
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,640
What's the matter?

982
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,640
I'm not telling you.

983
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,640
But now,

984
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,640
I don't think I can go that far.

985
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,640
You'll know.

986
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,640
Hello, Mr. Du.

987
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,640
Mr. Pei, what should we do next?

988
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,640
Go to the place I told you.

989
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,640
Let's go.

990
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,640
Go to the central station.

991
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,640
Don't wait any longer.

992
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,640
Boss, it's in Longyuan City.

993
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,640
Go to Longyuan City.

994
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:18,640
Longyuan City

995
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,640
This place looks like a railway factory.

996
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,640
It's a three-way street.

997
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,640
Take a look.

998
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,640
Is there a parking lot or a station nearby?

999
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,640
Here.

1000
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,640
But it's not the time to move the car.

1001
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,640
So I can't be sure.

1002
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,640
Look at this.

1003
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,640
This place is familiar.

1004
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,640
This is the place where the accident happened.

1005
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,640
There are people in this country.

1006
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,640
Du Guosheng must be here.

1007
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,640
What are you waiting for?

1008
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,640
Didn't you see that?

1009
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,640
There are people in this house.

1010
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,640
Everyone in this house

1011
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,640
has several lives tied to him.

1012
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,640
We went in without permission.

1013
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,640
Even if we can catch Du Guosheng,

1014
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,640
we can't guarantee that

1015
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,640
we can catch everyone in there.

1016
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,640
What should we do now?

1017
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,640
Sir,

1018
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,640
we're just waiting for you.

1019
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,640
What else can we do?

1020
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,640
We should have helped earlier.

1021
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,640
Is it safe?

1022
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,640
Should we use my people?

1023
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,640
We can't use your people.

1024
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,640
We are catching suspects.

1025
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,640
We are not passing by.

1026
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,640
We are going to the official city.

1027
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,640
But I don't want to see you

1028
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,640
go through the city

1029
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,640
and then be gone.

1030
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,640
What are you talking about?

1031
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,640
Can you be nice to me?

1032
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,640
Sir,

1033
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,640
I think my boss's words

1034
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,640
are reasonable.

1035
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,640
The opinions of the people are also opinions.

1036
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,640
Although the opinions of the people are not professional,

1037
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,640
some of them can be used as reference.

1038
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,640
No,

1039
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,640
is it so casual?

1040
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,640
Who are you calling?

1041
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,640
Boss, you have to take care of him.

1042
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,640
You can't let him do this.

1043
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,640
Isn't there a problem inside?

1044
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,640
Beautiful.

1045
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,640
There is one thing.

1046
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,640
Please come with me.

1047
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,640
The police station.

1048
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,640
Did Mr. Wei send you to investigate?

1049
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,640
Do you suspect that

1050
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,640
he has made some bad friends?

1051
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,640
These are all kids.

1052
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,640
Besides,

1053
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,640
the waiters of our restaurant

1054
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,640
haven't been in this room.

1055
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,640
What do you think?

1056
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,640
Impossible.

1057
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,640
Don't be a accountant.

1058
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,640
Investigate again from the beginning.

1059
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,640
Investigate the surveillance records

1060
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,640
of other cameras together.

1061
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,640
Tell everyone to go out.

1062
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,640
OK.

1063
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,640
Found it, boss.

1064
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,640
From twelve o'clock to twelve and a half o'clock,

1065
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,640
someone picked it up.

1066
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,640
It's not connected here.

1067
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,640
The first day of the first month

1068
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,640
of the first month

1069
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:12,640
of the first month

1070
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,640
