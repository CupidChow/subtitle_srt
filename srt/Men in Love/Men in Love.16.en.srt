00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,360
Sorry.

5
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,960
Why are you dressed so sexy?

6
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,080
I'm going on a date.

7
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,370
With whom?

8
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,620
With the love of my life.

9
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,220
I want to give her a surprise.

10
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,680
Right?

11
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,930
Let me give you a shock first.

12
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,950
I'm sending it to Yun.

13
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,580
Why are you sending it to her?

14
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,110
What are you doing?

15
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,290
You're wearing your dad's clothes again?

16
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,170
I'm wearing your dad's clothes.

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,640
These are my clothes.

18
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,220
Why are you dressed so sexy?

19
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,970
I'm going on a date.

20
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,130
Make me a cup of coffee.

21
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,600
Why are you dressed so sexy?

22
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,720
I'm going to make a date.

23
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,670
But my clothes look very nice.

24
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,910
-Nice.
-I…

25
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,230
Go make coffee.

26
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,660
Well.

27
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,280
You can really bring good luck to your husband.

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,590
It's been a bad year.

29
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,970
But your husband still made so much money.

30
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,660
Your husband is not bad either.

31
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,610
I heard that you're going to come into the STAR Market?

32
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,730
It's nothing.

33
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,270
Our annual profit

34
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,100
is not as much as

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,220
the rent of a building of Shengyun's.

36
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,770
Shengyun.

37
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,550
You always come alone.

38
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,720
It's supposed to be a couple gathering.

39
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,030
Is there any problem

40
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,490
between you and your husband?

41
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,550
Why are you so gossipy?

42
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,370
My husband is shy.

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,160
He doesn't like such occasions.

44
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,130
Right.

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,060
I don't think your husband

46
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,220
has many topics with us.

47
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,300
Don't you think

48
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,240
Shengyun is amazing?

49
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,829
She doesn't care about his condition.

50
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,570
She got married to him because he was young.

51
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,120
What do you know?

52
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,910
He's young and strong.

53
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,460
But Shengyun,

54
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,310
as friends,

55
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,140
we're worried about you.

56
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,500
Young men nowadays

57
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,010
are usually not ready to settle down.

58
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,880
You see, you're always alone

59
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,829
at our gatherings.

60
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,530
Some people

61
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,990
may think

62
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,790
you're divorced.

63
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,390
Don't worry about me.

64
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,590
If we get divorced,

65
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,660
I'll inform you immediately.

66
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,050
Shengyun,

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,840
is that your husband?

68
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,970
Honey.

69
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,940
Why are you here?

70
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,909
I was here for something

71
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,840
and saw you, so I came here.

72
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,180
Why is he here?

73
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,720
Don't you have something important to do?

74
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,960
Seeing my wife is the most important thing.

75
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,460
I can do other things later.

76
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,770
So handsome.

77
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,680
Let me introduce.

78
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,580
This is my husband,

79
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,340
Lu Zheng.

80
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,680
Young and strong.

81
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,960
Do you usually praise people like this?

82
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,860
They just praised you like this.

83
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,760
Hello, guys.

84
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,100
I'm Lu Zheng, a young and strong man.

85
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,760
I was too busy,

86
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,400
so I didn't get together with you.

87
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,720
And, honey,

88
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,990
this is the first time we meet with them

89
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,270
since we got married, right?

90
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,350
Yes.

91
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,270
Let me propose a toast to you.

92
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,830
Okay?

93
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,470
Okay.

94
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,740
-Okay.
-Come on.

95
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,830
You're more handsome than they said.

96
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,880
Shengyun, your husband is so handsome,

97
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,280
and you are so beautiful.

98
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,480
Your kids will be pretty in the future.

99
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,580
Maybe they can be actors.

100
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,360
That's silly.

101
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,640
By the way,

102
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,780
why don't you consider having a child?

103
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,659
You're wasting such good genes.

104
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,010
Shengyun would be an old pregnant woman.

105
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,530
Of course, she's worried.

106
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,630
Well.

107
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,280
I let Shengyun down.

108
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,800
My wife always wants to give me a child,

109
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,770
but I don't want to.

110
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,570
So, we're still

111
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,710
enjoying

112
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,520
the world of husband and wife.

113
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,220
Honey, have you eaten?

114
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,410
A little.

115
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,710
Here, have some.

116
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,980
Have some more.

117
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,240
No.

118
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,340
I'm afraid I won't digest if I eat too much.

119
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,070
Let's eat.

120
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,790
All right.

121
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,550
Your opinion matters.

122
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,900
Let's have a drink

123
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,800
for good digestion.

124
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,280
Okay.

125
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,630
Come on.

126
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,060
Cheers.

127
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,010

You guys talk. I'll check the backstage.

148
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,460
Okay, go ahead.

149
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,420
Yiwen has made a comeback. Do you know?

150
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,570
That is good.

151
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,320
She can perform again.

152

This is what she has always wanted.

153
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,310
Since we're here,

154
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,100
why don't we go to the backstage and say hello to her?

155
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,010
We haven't been in touch for a long time.

156
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,920
I'm afraid she doesn't want to see me.

157
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,580
How do you know if you don't go?

158
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,810
Forget it.

159
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,220
It's good to stay here.

Are you really not going?

00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,850

We'll see when it's over.

166
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,760
Aren't you going to say hi?

167
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,960
Have you forgotten what I told you?

168
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,950
All right.

169
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,070
But you go say hello to Yiwen first.

Get ready at the entrance.

174
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,950
Yiwen, are you ready?

175
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,700
Relax. Let's go.

176
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,340
Okay.

177

Yiwen is in good condition.

178
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:26,970
Yeah.

179

180
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,960
What's wrong?

00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,530
Did your feet hurt again?

182
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,580
Sit down.

183
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,370
Take a seat.

184
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,600
I'll explain to them.

185
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,450
No need.

186
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,280
Are you still going on stage?

188
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,180
how long have I waited for this day to come?

I can't give up.

190
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,090
Trust me.

191
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,100
Are you sure?

192
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,270

00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,260
It could be a secret information

383
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,140
or manipulating public opinion.

384
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,740
Have you ever thought

385
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,940
that maybe Xu Yan just hates you?

386
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,040
If you can't help,

387
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,000
go back.

388
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,550
Wait, I can help.

389
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,880
I can help.

390
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,230
I have an empty room.

391
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,060
But there's a tigress in my house.

392
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,050
If you're not afraid, you can go.

393
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,300
What are you doing?

394
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,100
Watch out for eavesdropping.

395
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,140
You guys are exaggerating.

396
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,430
I'm an adult.

397
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,040
It's good to stay in a hotel.

398
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,270
No.

399
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,310
It'll cost so much to stay in a hotel for two weeks.

400
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,190
Looks like your business has been good lately, Lawyer Xu.

401
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,870
How about this?

402
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:12,990
If you feel uncomfortable,

403
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,550
you can pay us rent.

404
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,240
Jiacheng.

405
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,610
Just let Xu Yan stay at your place.

406
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,570
Why?

407
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,350
Watch out.

408
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,590
I'm cleaning.

409
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,320
Do you have to do it every day?

410
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,100
My house isn't cleaned every day.

411
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,600
Isn't it clean too?

412
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,840
Your house is cleaned by the maid.

413
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,040
What do you think?

414
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,460
Your cleaning is good.

415
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,000
But can you lower the intensity and frequency?

416
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,100
Besides,

417
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,710
don't spray the alcohol.

418
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,150
It stinks.

419
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,830
No.

420
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,100
I must spray it.

421
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,370
Do you know

422
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,850
how much invisible bacteria there is?

423
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,100
I can put up with it.

424
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,040
What I can't stand the most is

425
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,470
why does the disc have to be ranked alphabetically?

426
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,310
Also,

427
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,440
the cups

428
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,010
have to be displayed parallelly.

429
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,900
So what if I don't put them parallelly?

430
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,880
So what?

431
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,320
Comfortable.

432
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,350
Wait.

433
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,440
Why are you looking at me

434
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,240
like that?

435
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,020
How dare you say that?

436
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,870
If Xu Yan lived in your house,

437
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,510
he'd wear white gloves every day,

438
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,710
in case he left his fingerprints.

439
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,840
Xu Yan will live in our house.

440
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,140
I wanted you to choose.

441
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,520
I guess I was too reckless.

442
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
This is not a choice question at all.

443
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,380
Leave me alone.

444
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,690
It's more comfortable for me

445
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,040
to live in a hotel.

446
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,280
Wait.

447
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,230
We don't feel comfortable when you're comfortable.

448
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,490
That's not what I mean.

449
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,830
I mean

450
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,230
how can we let our brother stay in a hotel?

451
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:19,830
Otherwise,

452
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,470
people will think

453
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,670
we're faking

454
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,700
our brotherhood.

455
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,230
Right?

456
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:23,950
When did you

457
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,010
care so much about others' feelings?

458
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,550
Right.

459
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,250
If you cared so much,

460
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,840
you wouldn't have looked so ugly.

461
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,070
What are you talking about? I know…

462
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,260
Did you cut your nails?

463
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,340
Xu Yan, it's a deal.

464
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,900
You'll stay with Jiacheng.

465
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,870
It's decided then.

466
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,910
Stay at my place. Don't think about it anymore.

467
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,750
Yes.

468
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,030
Let's go.

469
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,750
Let me beat you.

470
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,470
Come on.

471
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,510
Not necessarily.

472
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,510
Come on.

473
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,680
I haven't practiced for a long time.

474
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,760
Don't worry. It's okay.

475
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,670
She's gone for so long

476
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,580
and yet there are still so many things behind.

477
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,560
It's not much actually.

478
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,070
As for Jie's books

479
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,570
and clothes,

480
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,510
I'll take them with me.

481
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,380
No.

482
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,180
I will take

483
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,920
all of her stuff.

484
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,540
You can't take anything away.

485
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,800
Mom.

what are you doing?

548
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,870
I have too many distractions.

549
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,820
My pulses tend to be influence by them.

550
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,610
I'm adjusting my pulses.

551
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,310
Will people acquire this kind of courage

552
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,420
after turning 30?

553
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,130
When a person turns 30,

554
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,400
there can be

555
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,380
many weird things around.

556
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,560
To endure these weird things,

557
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,480
we can only become weirder people.

558
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,090
Join me.

559
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,780

561
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,250
What happened?

562
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,020
I won't tell you.

563
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,040
Although

564
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:25,820
I trust you,

565
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,980
you may not trust yourself.

566
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,770
Right?

567
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,520
That makes sense.

568
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,470
That makes sense.

569
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,550
Don't stop.

570
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,100
Come on.

571
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,880
One, two, three, four.

572
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,720
Two, two, three, four.

573
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,900
Move.

574
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,760
I've finally calmed down.

575
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,780
What? Did you find a job?

576
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,660
Do you work at your dad's company?

577
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,870
How do you know?

578
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,970
That's what happens

579
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,850
when you have a syndicate at home.

580
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,640
It's different.

581
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,870
How should I put it?

582
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,820
My story

583
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,330
is more secretive and ambitious.

584
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,820
Only the person who helped me with my entry

585
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,980
knows about this.

586
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,450
No one in my family knows

587
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,450
I work in our company.

588
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,590
You're quite smart now.

589
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,840
Comfortable.

590
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,560
Ye Han.

591
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,600
Hello?

592
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,040
Xu Yan will move tomorrow.

593
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,120
He's moving to your house.

594
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,080
Really?

595
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,040
It's a gift from above.

596
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,750
Xu Yan and I can be in the same place alone!

597
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,800
Ye Han, thank you.

598
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,960
Thank you so much.

599
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,210
Our deal has ended.

600
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,100
I don't owe you anything anymore.

601
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,310
What deal?

602
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,570
You mean your crush?

603
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,900
How is it?

604
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,610
Is your crush going well?

605
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,080
Can I ask you for a refund?

606
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,980
It didn't go well?

607
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,570
I feel like you were rejected.

608
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,720
Let bygones be bygones.

609
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,120
Don't mind it, okay?

610
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,270
Thank you.

611
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,980
Bye. Bye.

612
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,010
Xiaoxiao,

613
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,690
let me introduce you to someone.

614
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,790
It's my brother's friend.

615
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,710
He's handsome and talented.

616
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,390
But he's a little weird

617
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,800
and has mysophobia.

618
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,070
It's harmless.

619
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,340
Think about it.

620
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
Forget it.

621
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,020
I don't get along with

622
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,080
the person you mentioned.

623
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,110
Do you know Ye Han?

624
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,040
Not only that.

625
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,880
He's my brother's friend.

626
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,070
It's not strange that you know him.

627
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,730
But why don't you get along?

628
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,320
It's a long story.

629
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,850
But

630
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,710
he seems to have much leisure.

631
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,880
He even cared about his friend's sister's love life.

632
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,719
I think I got some inspiration.

633
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,389
I wondered why he asked me

634
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,920
about his love problems.

635
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,310
He had a crush on you, right?

636
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,179
It was you, isn't it?

637
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,300
A love triangle.

638
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,150
Is it so fierce?

639
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,989
You're really smart.

640
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,110
Ye Han…

641
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,670
How did he sound?

642
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,260
Is he doing well?

643
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,239
Didn't you dump him?

644
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,980
Why do you care so much?

645
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,489
My pulses are messed up again.

646
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,020
No way.

647
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,380
It's a mess.

648
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,810
I have to dance again.

649
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,790
I told you to rest at home.

650
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,670
Why are you here?

651
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,490
I have something to tell you.

652
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,940
Why can't you tell me over the phone?

653
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,250
Just rest.

654
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,470
Why are you running around?

655
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,590
I think I should tell you face to face.

656
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,430
What is it?

657
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,070
I may not be able to attend

658
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,680
the following shows.

659
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,250
Why?

660
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,140
Because the doctor has declared my verdict.

661
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,780
He said

662
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,430
if I wore high heels again,

663
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,760
I wouldn't be able to walk anymore.

664
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,960
Is it that serious?

665
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,160
I'm sorry, Ms. Bei.

666
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,820
I let you down.

667
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,630
Don't say that.

668
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,040
You never let me down.

669
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,340
Don't worry.

670
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,710
I'll negotiate with the brand.

671
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,140
But should I postpone

672
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,010
the rest of your work,

673
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,990
so you can have time to rest?

674
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,990
I remember you have a photoshoot next week.

675
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,160
I'll talk to them.

676
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,290
No need.

677
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,490
Although I can't go to the T-station,

678
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,860
I'm still a model.

679
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,310
I have to do my job.

680
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,960
Okay, I got it.

681
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,170
Thank you.

682
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,950
Help!

683
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,400
Coming. What's wrong?

684
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,070
Brother, help me.

685
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,390
What are you doing?

686
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:43,950
Come on.

687
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,110
This way.

688
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,070
This is the way out.

689
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,870
This way.

690
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,670
Thank you.

691
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,390
I thought

692
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,830
I was going to die before getting married.

693
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,830
What were you doing?

694
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,570
Were you pretending to be a squirrel?

695
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,350
Yes.

696
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,670
I was hiding some nuts.

697
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,070
I was cleaning of course!

698
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,470
It's so dusty under the bed.

699
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,370
Have you seen it under your bed?

700
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,240
It seems to be another universe over there.

701
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,910
A new civilization will be born soon.

702
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,030
Jialin,

703
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,060
we have a cleaner at home.

704
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,910
Why do you have to clean?

705
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,750
The cleaner is good,

706
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,170
but my good intentions are more important.

707
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,070
You've grown up abroad.

708
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,870
You didn't even wash your socks.

709
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,390
Now you're cleaning up.

710
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,170
How about this?

711
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,890
Help me clean my room, too.

712
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,670
Okay, thank you.

713
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,590
You're my brother,

714
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,910
but you're not Xu Yan.

715
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,920
Xu Yan!

716
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,010
[IN WORK]

717
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,610
The last part is

718
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,850
the proposal about film and television cooperation

719
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,650
submitted by the Cultural Team.

720
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,550
Good idea.

721
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,370
Okay.

722
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,190
-I'll ask them to make the plan more detailed.
-Okay.

723
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,030
Contact them

724
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:40,360
and see what movies and TV we can work with.

725
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,270
You still have feelings for her.

726
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,680
Why are you ignoring her?

727
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,470
Did you get it wrong?

728
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,400
She dumped me.

729
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,000
Even so,

730
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,170
she was there.

731
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,430
You treated her as air.

732
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,590
You were obviously embarrassing her.

733
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,430
Because I'm just such a selfish person

734
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:02,090
who doesn't care about others' feelings at all.

735
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,950
Is everything okay?

736
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,230
Yeah.

737
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,870
So, Mr. Editor,

738
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,950
let's go eat.

739
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,200
You can go ahead.

740
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,400
Okay.

741
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,810
Are you busy?

742
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,400
No.

743
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,950
Are you working overtime later?

744
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,670
No.

745
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,600
Where are you going?

746
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,250
I'm going home. Why?

747
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,100
So soon?

748
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,390
Why don't I ask everyone out

749
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,590
and have a drink?

750
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,020
It's not easy for you to get off work on time.

751
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,240
Hello, Jiacheng.

752
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:04,790
Are you busy?

753
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,370
It's the winter vacation.

754
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,430
Of course, I'm not.

755
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,410
Do you want to come out for a drink tonight?

756
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,640
It's okay if it's inconvenient for you.

757
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,760
After I say these words,

758
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,910
let's go back to how we used to be.

759
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:22,800
Okay?

760
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,050
I don't want to lose a friend like you.

761
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,290
I can go to you.

762
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,960
I'm also upset

763
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:30,850
and want to have a drink.

764
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,370
Okay, I'll send you the address.

765
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,410
See you tonight.

766
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,280
Okay.

767
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:35,150
See you later.

768
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:35,980
Bye.

769
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,730
Come on, have a drink.

770
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,340
Don't you think I'm exceptionally handsome today?

771
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,290
What's wrong with him again?

772
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,360
Did you go to be an MC?

773
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,000
I think he went for a banquet.

774
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,140
Ye Han.

775
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,850
As the Editor-in-Chief of a fashion magazine,

776
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,050
you should know.

777
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,310
Limited edition.

778
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,850
Shengyun seems to be in a good mood recently.

779
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,980
You have new clothes to wear every day.

780
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,760
Poor clothes.

781
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,940
Don't be a limited edition in your next life.

782
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,380
He doesn't deserve you.

783
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,830
Poor clothes.

784
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,740
I pity you in this life.

785
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,770
What do you know?

786
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,740
Are you just trying to

787
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,640
show off your new clothes?

788
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,740
Am I showing off my clothes?

789
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,360
I'm showing off how nice my wife is

790
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,940
to me.

791
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:50,350
Do you know how I got this?

792
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,140
My wife took me…

793
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,410
She bought the latest limited edition

794
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,000
with me.

795
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:59,370
Enough. Keep your voice down.

796
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,270
What are you doing?

797
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,910
You bachelors don't know

798
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,110
about our happiness.

799
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:03,870
You know?

800
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,110
Enough of that.

801
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,190
Come on, have a drink.

802
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,990
Come on.

803
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:08,560
Here.

804
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,990
Xiaoxiao.

805
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,940
This way.
