00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,470

00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,010

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,420
Your dad came?

10
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,509
Why was he here?

11
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,620
It's been years.

12
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,000
He has never visited you.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,590
He didn't care about you when you were little.

14
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,490
When your mother was sick,

15
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,800
all he wanted was a divorce.

16
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,960
Why was he here now?

17
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,990
He must be up to no good.

18
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,120
He said he lost his job,

19
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,850
so he is unable to make a living now.

20
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,380
Did he come to ask for money?

21
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,579
Listen.

22
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,500
Don't be soft-hearted.

23
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,040
Don't give any money to him.

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,110
If he knows he can get money from you,

25
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,140
he will ask again.

26
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,930
That's a bottomless pit.

27
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,550
You didn't give it to him, did you?

28
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,520
I gave him 20,000 yuan.

29
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,250
I've made it clear to him.

30
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,160
I will only help him this time once.

31
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,480
And he promised me he would never show up again.

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,880
Do you really think it's that simple?

33
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,750
This kind of thing

34
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,380

00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,210
Are you stupid?

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,120
You didn't see him like that.

37
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,070
If you had seen him, you wouldn't refuse him, either.

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,460
He won't come again.

Well,

96
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,480

98

380
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,750
♫Moonlight is the monologue of my heart♫

381
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,589
♫It's always there♫

382
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,619
♫It's always there♫

383
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,240
♫It makes my heart race♫

384
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,090
♫I wasn't waiting for anyone♫

385
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,510
♫You happened to come following the light♫

386
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,210
♫But the conversation was pleasant♫

387
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,240
You're cute

388
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,030
♫I'm a little overjoyed♫

389
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,370
when you're not talking.

390
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,820
♫At the places where you can't see♫

391
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,540
I wish I could

392
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,820
♫My love keeps increasing♫

393
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,950
hear something nice

394
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:51,130
♫It accumulated into the most beautiful surprise♫

395
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,070
from your mouth.

396
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,250
♫Can you hear me?♫

397
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,520
♫The first time I feel that I miss you every night♫

398
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,430
Did I wake you up?

399
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,980
♫Can you see me?♫

400
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,190
♫Come to me; hold me tight♫

401
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,020
♫Will you love me more?♫

402
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,600
♫At times of sadness or joy♫

00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,010
♫Let's go through together♫

404
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,320
♫Every moment of it♫

405
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,530
♫Because you're with me♫

406
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,500
Is this the gift you prepared for me?

407
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,180
♫The uniqueness you prepared specially♫

408
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,760
Of course not.

409
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,120
♫Is so meaningful♫

410
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Get up.

411
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,190
This is my gift to you.

412
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:28,880
What do you think?

413
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,890
Do you like it?

414
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,990
It's my little wish

415
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,630
to ride a bike

416
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,030
with my boyfriend

417
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,190
on a beautiful path.

418
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,440
Alongside the path,

419
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,850
flowers are blooming.

420
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,140
The warm breeze brings the fragrance of flowers,

421
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,950
blowing gently.

422
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,110
What a beautiful image.

423
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,070
But I don't know how to ride a bike.

424
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,630
[Yiwen]

425
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,840
[Yiwen]

426
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,490
[Call] [Contact]

427
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,460
[Yiwen]

428
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,310
I didn't contact you.

429
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,260
And you didn't contact me, either.

430
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,830
Hello.

431
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,540
Hello.

432
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,600
Your package.

433
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,600
Okay, thank you.

434
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,740
It's okay. Bye.

435
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,080
It's from Xu Jiacheng.

436
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,290
Have you received the housewarming gift?

437
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,770
Yes, you're right.

438
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,450
This is my precious amber bracelet.

439
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,100
You must keep it well.

440
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,920
Xu Yan, congratulations.

441
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,230
You can live

442
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,170
a carefree life in your new apartment.

443
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,010
By the way,

444
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,710
remember to call me for the housewarming party.

445
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,080
The updated data is out.

446
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,750
I know.

447
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,560
My FTB has increased again, right?

448
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,870
You're quite confident.

449
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,040
Of course.

450
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,160
I think it will improve yet again

451
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,660
if I practice more.

452
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,550
Stay humble and patient.

453
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,750
Keep it up.

454
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,110
I gotta go now.

455
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:29,700
Bye.

456
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,600
Bye.

457
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,910
Have you set the date?

458
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,750
Yes.

459
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,230
But if we break up before then,

460
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,370
I'll tell you.

461
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,580
What's wrong?

462
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,110
Did you fight

463
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,860
during the wedding preparation?

464
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,540
We've fought six times.

465
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,150
I quarreled twice and a half times with his mother,

466
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,360
half a time with his dad,

467
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,790
and three times with him.

468
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,740
I even talked about breaking up.

469
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,040
It's said that people are most likely to fight

470
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,550
when preparing for the wedding.

471
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,480
It seems that you're no exception.

472
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,230
I start to hesitate about whether to marry him.

473
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,180
Is it that serious?

474
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,290
Do you think it'll be better after the wedding?

475
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,230
Of course,

476
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,160
the premise is that I'm still attending the wedding.

477
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,250
Don't overthink.

478
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,450
It will be okay.

479
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,020
Get back to work.

480
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,900
Hello.

481
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,750
Thank you, Mommy.

482
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,630
Do you need my help

483
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,260
even with this kind of thing?

484
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,060
Fine.

485
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,380
Don't explain it to me.

486
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,800
Listen.

487
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,350
In the next regular meeting,

488
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,320
I want to see a complete, new plan.

489
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,340
That's it.

490
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,650
What's wrong?

491
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,960
What happened?

492
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,420
I want to upgrade the quality of room service.

493
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,090
I asked them to come up with a plan.

494
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,230
But those plans they handed in

495
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,840
are all the same old ones.

496
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,680
All right.

497
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,260
Take it easy.

498
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,100
At this age,

499
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,460
you still have to work hard for the company.

500
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,500
Jiacheng.

501
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,520
Can't you help your dad with his company?

502
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,290
He is old enough

503
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,560
to retire, but he can't.

504
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,420
Yeah.

505
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,740
How long are you going to make me work?

506
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,070
I've seen your ability.

507
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,530
Stop working at the magazine.

508
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,880
Come to work at my company.

509
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,660
It's time for you

510
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,790
to make contributions to the company.

511
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,330
And you too, Jialin.

512
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,650
Come to my company

513
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,770
to learn something

514
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,800
and help me.

515
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,030
I don't want to.

516
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
You don't want to?

517
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,340
What do you want to do, then?

518
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,950
If you don't want it,

519
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:58,670
why did you study management abroad?

520
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,730
Your brother doesn't care about your dad's company.

521
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,930
Don't you want to help your dad, either?

522
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,500
I also want to do what I like.

523
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,710
What do you want to do?

524
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,770
I...

525
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,680
I want to

526
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,860
join a girl group.

527
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,520
You don't believe me?

528
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,190
I inherited your good genes.

529
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,500
Am I right, Dad?

530
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,080
Yes.

531
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,600
You're right.

532
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,800
You spoiled her.

533
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,660
How could you laugh?

534
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,870
Fine.

535
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,630
Since neither of you

536
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,330
want to take over your dad's company,

537
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,270
you should get married as soon as possible.

538
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,540
Then,

539
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,610
our future daughter-in-law

540
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,790
and son-in-law

541
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,590
can take over your company.

542
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,430
I agree.

543
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,850
Mom. Dad.

544
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,210
I want to say something.

545
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,420
I won't give up on the magazine.

546
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,190
Dad feels proud about

547
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,020
his career.

548
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,840
Me too.

549
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,900
I have deep feelings for the magazine.

550
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,800
Don't make me give it up

551
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,290
just because I'm your son.

552
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,160
So, don't mention letting me work at your company

553
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,290
any more from now on.

554
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,980
What are you talking about?

555
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,820
And...

556
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,820
Mom.

557
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,820
Don't set me up on blind dates anymore.

558
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,060
There is a girl I like.

559
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,330
Tong Yiwen?

560
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,300
Yes.

561
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,240
I'll make Tong Yiwen my girlfriend.

562
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,290
Don't mind our business anymore.

563
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,130
And don't go to her again.

564
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,320
About Yiwen,

565
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,330
just let me know when you are ready

566
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,480
to accept her.

567
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,790
I'll bring her home

568
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,340
and introduce her to you.

569
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm telling you.

570
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,850
Don't even think about it.

571
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,340
As long as I'm here,

572
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,920
she will never

573
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,220
be allowed to be part of our family!

574
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,500
Xu Jiacheng,

575
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,970
is that how you talk to your parents?

576
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,530
Enjoy your meal.

577
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,540
Dad, don't be mad.

578
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,350
Dad.

579
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,970
I saw you sneaking around again.

580
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,620
What are you doing?

581
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,720
I want to see if Ms. Chen is in the office.

582
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,560
Ms. Chen?

583
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,750
She went out for work just now.

584
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,830
Is there anything?

585
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,090
I heard that our hotel

586
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,400
is collecting advice to improve the room service.

587
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,550
I have some ideas.

588
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,280
Tell me about it.

589
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,200
I found that our hotel

590
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,810
lacks care for pregnant women,

591
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,720
people with disabilities, and senior citizens.

592
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,920
We don't have any staff who know sign language.

593
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,990
Nor do we provide a hotel service manual

594
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,050
for people with vision impairments.

595
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,190
And there's an extreme lack of convenience service

596
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,700
for pregnant women.

597
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,820
But what you said is not

598
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,090
for regular customers.

599
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,080
As far as service is concerned,

600
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,220
it's important how much help we can offer,

601
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,250
but showing our hotel image to the customers

602
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,410
is also essential.

603
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,350
I think your idea

604
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,250
sounds interesting.

605
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:40,940
Well.

606
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:41,730
Lin Jia,

607
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,970
make a proposal based on your idea,

608
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,030
and then we can move on.

609
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,120
No problem.

610
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,530
Okay.

611
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,400
Ask the legal department to add the new content

612
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,220
and draw up a new contract for me.

613
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,590
What?

614
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,000
It's weekend.

615
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,010
So what?

616
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,210
I'm the boss. I'm working overtime, too.

617
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,470
I hope tomorrow morning,

618
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,250
when I open my eyes,

619
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,040
there will be a new contract in my mailbox.

620
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,950
Understand?

621
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:24,680
Honey.

622
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,640
Have some water.

623
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,990
Focus on driving.

624
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,190
Don't worry about me.

625
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,580
You...

626
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,220
Where are we now?

627
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,600
Why is it so slow?

628
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,670
There's a traffic jam ahead.

629
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,670
We're stuck here.

630
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,570
We can't fly over there.

631
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,470
It's okay.

632
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,030
We'll get on the highway at the next intersection.

633
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,160
Then, it'll be fine.

634
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,290
Did you do it on purpose?

635
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,230
Why didn't you follow the GPS?

636
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,510
Why did you drive by yourself?

637
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,230
At this speed,

638
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,710
when can we get to Doctor Miracle's place?

639
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,230
When we get there, it will be too late for our appointment.

640
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:01,870
What?

641
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,360
Did we have to make an appointment?

642
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,430
He's a highly skilled doctor.

643
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,380
Of course we need to make an appointment.

644
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,060
I think you've gone crazy.

645
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,830
Honey.

646
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,630
Don't worry.

647
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,800
If we can't make it in time,

648
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,030
it's good for us to go out for a ride.

649
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,800
I'm not in the mood for a ride.

650
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,700
What are you doing?

651
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,150
Turn right ahead

652
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,710
and go to the national road.

653
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,230
It's hard to drive on the national road, honey.

654
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,790
It'll be faster this way.

655
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,920
I told you to go to the national road.

656
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,670
Just follow the GPS.

657
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,150
What do you mean?

658
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:34,910
You don't want to go?

659
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,080
Did you do it on purpose?

660
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,630
What do you mean?

661
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,150
Even if I didn't follow the GPS,

662
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,150
I'll follow what my wife said.

663
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:40,990
Okay?

664
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,420
Don't be mad.

665
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,230
Have some water.

666
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,230
No.

667
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,950
Mr. Xu.

668
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,870
Why are you here on the weekend?

669
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,960
I came to deal with something.

670
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,450
Aren't you, too?

671
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,710
I was going to call you.

672
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,390
Is the contract of Mr. Hu's company here with you?

673
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,290
I need to meet them in the afternoon. I'm in a hurry.

674
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,290
Yes, it's with me.

675
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,040
Mr. Xu?

676
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,150
Why don't you go ahead with your business now?

677
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,550
I'll give it to you later.

678
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,420
Okay.

679
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,370
I'll go.

680
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,100
Xu Jialin.

681
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,070
I don't think we have agreed

682
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,470
that we can enter each other's room at will.

683
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,840
I'm here to install this.

684
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,270
I heard you always cough at night.

685
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,870
I think maybe it's too dry in this room.

686
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,760
What am I thinking?

687
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,210
Forgot something?

688
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,600
Have some tea before you leave.

689
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,520
No, thanks.

690
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,670
Since you're in this house,

691
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,130
you have to obey the rules here.

692
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,930
Didn't we have an agreement?

00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,690
♫I've been looking forward to it♫

753
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,820
♫I just found that you're irreplaceable♫

754
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,660
Are you home?

755
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,990
I'm downstairs.

756
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,620
Tell Jiacheng I'm not here when he comes.

757
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,990
So soon?

758
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,200
Coming.

759
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,120
Jiacheng.

760
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,630
Xiaoxiao.

761
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,380
Is Yiwen not home?

762
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,750
She's not.

763
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,530
It's for you.

764
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,870
Thank you.

765
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,780
I'm leaving.

766
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Xiaoxiao.

767
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,360
Can you help me

768
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,430
with something?

769
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,270
Go ahead.

770
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,490
I'm having a fight with Yiwen.

771
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,500
I really don't know what to do.

772
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,120
Jiacheng bought it for you.

773
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,480
Put it there.

774
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,400
It's hard to get.

775
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,960
Try it.

776
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,180
Just put it there.

777
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,600
Did you have a fight?

778
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,620
Why are you so angry with him?

779
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,670
He asked you to do this, right?

780
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,570
You're easily persuaded.

781
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,630
You've punished him for quite a long time.

782
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:25,950
Stop being mad.

783
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,950
Just forgive him.

784
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,850
It has nothing to do with him.

785
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,870
I haven't figured it out yet.

786
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,540
It's so complicated.

787
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,110
Why did you stop?

788
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,630
Honey, can I say something?

789
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,280
Go ahead.

790
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,160
Are you sure it's going forward?

791
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:07,600
Just do as the GPS says.

792
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,170
What are you up to?

793
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,840
What?

794
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,930
From this afternoon on,

795
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,760
you're taking the wrong path on purpose.

796
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,310
What do you mean?

797
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,840
You don't want to go, do you?

798
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,790
Honey, I've been preparing for this

799
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,790
since this morning.

800
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,330
I got scolded while driving.

801
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,680
I had a hard time, too.

802
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,010
We finally

803
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,680
get to hang out together.

804
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,840
I'm sorry, I mean

805
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,280
we came out together to see a doctor.

806
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,800
You kept making calls

807
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,120
since you got in the car

808
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,530
and ignoring me.

809
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,470
Now you're scolding me.

810
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,670
That's because you're sick.

811
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,320
Isn't it?

812
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,940
I'm sick.

813
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,550
If my wife says I'm sick, then I must be sick.

814
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,670
I'm sick!

815
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,270
Stop shouting.

816
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,550
Drive.

817
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,390
Still? Down this road?

818
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,880
Just do as the GPS says.

819
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,720
Okay.

820
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,860
You're the boss here.

821
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,490
GPS and I are both sick.

822
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,510
What happened?

823
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,550
Honey, calm down.

824
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,960
Let me take a look.

825
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,490
What happened?

826
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,730
Fell into the pit.

827
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,970
Who fell into the pit?

828
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,390
You fell into the pit.

829
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,870
You...

830
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,630
How could we fall into a pit?

831
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,080
How did you drive?

832
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,630
You asked me to drive according to the GPS.

833
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,790
I followed the GPS

834
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,990
and fell into the pit.

835
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,020
There's something wrong with the GPS.

836
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,550
What

837
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,190
excuses do you have?

838
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,950
Say it.

839
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,670
You... What's wrong with me?

840
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,470
You didn't update the map.

841
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,120
You didn't update the map,

842
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,750
so you drove into the pit.

843
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,550
That's a good excuse.

844
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,550
A really good one.

845
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:02,480
Yes.

846
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,310
It's because I didn't update the map.

847
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,150
And what?

848
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,750
If I had updated the map,

849
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,170
the pit would have been filled.

850
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:08,920
Right.

851
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,220
What should we do?

852
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,260
What should we do?

853
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,790
I'll call the tow truck driver.

854
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,850
Don't move, honey.

855
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,790
Hello?

856
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,580
Is this the tow truck company?

857
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,110
Here's the thing,

858
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,910
my car fell into a pit.

859
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,810
Is there something wrong with you?

860
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,040
Do you have medicine for that?

861
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,390
Why aren't you afraid?

862
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,270
I'm afraid of nothing.

863
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,670
What are you doing?

864
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,800
There's a mosquito.

865
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:03,550
A mosquito.

866
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,070
Don't be mad.

867
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,000
You said you are afraid of nothing.

868
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:08,950
Did it hurt?

869
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,440
You're so annoying.

870
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,550
I called the tow truck company.

871
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,150
They'll be here in 40 minutes.

872
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,750
What's taking them so long?

873
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,480
Honey, have you looked around?

874
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,310
You can't even order takeout here.

875
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:19,970
Do you know?

876
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,510
There is no landmark building.

877
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,600
It's in the middle of nowhere.

878
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,530
I begged them to come. I'm just glad that they agreed.

879
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,030
It will take 40 minutes.

880
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,280
Get off for a walk.

881
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,190
No.

882
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,630
Get off.

883
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,580
No.

884
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,190
Get off.

885
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,040
I was wrong.

886
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,200
Am I heavy?

887
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,480
You even brought the mosquito repellent?

888
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,760
I don't need anything,

889
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,560
but I must bring the mosquito repellent for my wife.

890
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,640
For me to drink?

891
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,240
Have a love shot, then.

892
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,550
Stop it.

893
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,700
Give me your hand.

894
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:10,990
The other one.

895
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,960
And feet.

896
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,620
See?

897
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,720
You didn't bring anything here.

898
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,140
What would you do

899
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,850
without me?

900
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,280
I'd just go with the flow.

901
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,470
Honey.

902
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,550
How long haven't we

903
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,010
watched the stars together?
