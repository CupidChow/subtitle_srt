00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,050
Look at him.

193
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,460
Discipline him.

194

Why are you getting so angry?

195

197
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,460

Jiacheng and Jialin have grown up.

201

They're not children anymore.

202
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,980

Don't be so mad.

207
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,370
He's already proposed.

208
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,820
There's no turning back.

209
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,260
Did I allow it?

210
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,390
Did I approve it?

211
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,430
He wants to marry her?

212
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,610

214
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,210
My brother,

215
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,150
aka your son,

216
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,460
will turn 40 in a couple of years,

217
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,070
and 50 in 10 years.

218
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,220
He's not a hot shot.

219
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,640
Just let him get married.

Even though he's not in a hurry,

221
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,720
aren't you in a hurry to have a grandson?

222
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,520
That's right.

223
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,200
Jialin is right.

224

Jiacheng has the same temper as you.

225
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,300

Chubby grandson.

229
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,920

230
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,860
A pair of Aces.

231
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,280
Like this?

232
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,950
No, no.

233
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,120
Grandma, it's like this.

234
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,870
I played a pair.

235
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,160
So at this time, you have to

236
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,200
play a pair of Twos.

237
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,030
The pair of Twos is the biggest among all the pairs.

238
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,250
Thank you for playing with her for so long.

239
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
It's my pleasure.

240
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,810
Thank you for visiting her often.

241
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,950
She hasn't been so happy for a long time.

242

If I knew Grandma was sick,

247
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,750
I wouldn't have gone to Beijing.

248
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,690
No need to be sorry.

249
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,780
You didn't know it.

250
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,790

251
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,080
Don't mention it again.

252
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,740
I should go.

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,230

That's right.

What do you have to say today?

397
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,090

Xiaoxiao have to wear Jialin's wedding dress?

442
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,270
Because once a woman wears the wedding dress,

443
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,750
she'll have an urge to get married,

444
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,670

You're not a bride,

655

and you get to stand in the street in a wedding dress.

You don't get many chances like that.

Tell me.

00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,680
Now that you're wearing a wedding dress,

660
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,540
is there anything you want to do?

661
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,620
It's a pity to go back directly.

662
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,140
Is it because

663
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,790
I'm wearing a wedding dress?

664
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,620
Maybe.

665
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,640
Maybe he thinks we're married,

666
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,470
seeing us dressed like this.

667
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,430
Maybe

668
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,860
he thinks you kidnapped the bride.

Why are you doing this?

744
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,150
Let's not talk about your ability

745
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,430
to deceive and flatter;

746
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,590
you turned a blind eye

747
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,040
to what had happened to Zhou before.

748
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,310
How can a person like you

749
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,800
stay

750
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,270

She was the one who was late,

759
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,620
but she blamed me for being early.

760
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,350
She didn't even say sorry to me.

761
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,640

762
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,790

770
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,730

"Let our love

772

If we take off our equipment in the game,

843
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,710
