00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,590
You did nothing rude to me.

195
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,410
Jialin.

196
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,650
Even if I had been there yesterday,

197
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,640
please pretend it wasn't me.

198
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,040
I'm fine.

199
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,580
I hope you're fine, too.

200
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,940
Come in ten minutes later.

201
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,730
This is a newly added condition by me.

202
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,470
His love is so sweet.

203
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,720
My unrequited love is still there.

204
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,830
I was always trying to win your love.

205
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,860
Now I succeeded.

206
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,470
Li Xiaoxiao,

207
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,590
you have a boyfriend now.

208
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,830
Li Xiaoxiao,

209
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,340
you're amazing.

210
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,010
You're charming.

211
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,710
From today, I'm a girl with a boyfriend.

212
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,580
My boyfriend is calling.

213
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,560
It's not him.

214
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,510
Hello.

215
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,970
[Qidao Street]

216
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,340
[Office of Auxiliary Police]

217
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,670
Zhong Zixuan.

218
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,230
What happened?

219
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,990
Miss Li.

220
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,640
How did you hurt your face?

221
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,920
Did you

222
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,990
hurt any other part of your body?

223
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,140
Miss Li, I'm sorry.

224
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,920
Didn't I tell you not to cause any trouble?

225
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,290
Sorry, officer.

226
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,250
I'm his teacher.

227
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,780
You're his teacher.

228
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:21,109
I couldn't get in touch with his guardian,

229
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:21,970
so I called you.

230
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,980
Officer,

231
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,569
what happened?

232
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,450
Here's the story.

233
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,800
Give it to me.

234
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,250
What's wrong with you?

235
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,390
Let go.

236
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,290
What are you doing?

237
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,070
Give it back.

238
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,710
What are you doing?

239
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,990
None of your business.

240
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,310
You guys, let go of him.

241
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,910
Boss!

242
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,770
Run!

243
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,370
Sir.

244
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,310
Sir.

245
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,990
-Are you okay?
-Thank you.

246
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,660
Are you okay?

247
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,430
Thank you, sir.

248
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,630
It's okay. It's okay.

249
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:56,990
Wait a moment.

250
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:57,510
Later...

251
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,840
Where are your parents?

252
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,150
It's okay now.

253
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,280
Are you robbing him?

254
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,950
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

255
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,470
You misunderstood.

256
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,990
Are you robbing him? I've called the police.

257
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,820
Let go of me!

258
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,410
That's what happened.

259
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,810
It's just a misunderstanding.

260
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,870
They were both trying to help the boy.

261
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,720
They were doing a good thing.

262
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,040
But they were

263
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,270
being too impulsive.

264
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,440
They resorted to violence before knowing what was going on.

265
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,970
It's wrong to use violence.

266
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,160
So I criticized them.

267
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,130
You're right. I'll do the same thing when we go back.

268
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,910
You are adults.

269
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,890
Think about the consequences before taking action.

270
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,020
Don't be impulsive.

271
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,380
Which school are you in?

272
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,570
I'm not a student.

273
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,530
I'm a migrant worker in Shanghai.

274
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,170
Do you have any family members

275
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,630
or relatives in Shanghai?

276
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,070
My family are not in this city.

277
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,670
Even if they know I'm in the police station,

278
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,330
they will do nothing about it.

279
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,460
Just like me.

280
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,740
Give me your number.

281
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,570
You two, add each other on your WeChat contacts.

282
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,170
Why?

283
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,910
When the police catch the robber,

284
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,870
you need to come back and help with the investigation.

285
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,400
So you should keep in touch.

286
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,960
Is it delicious?

287
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,020
You caused trouble again.

288
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,610
This time, you got hit.

289
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,430
Don't make any trouble again.

290
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,870
How is your training?

291
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,640
After our last conversation on the phone,

292
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,970
did you do any training?

293
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,480
Something happened in my family recently.

294
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,010
So I didn't do any training.

295
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,620
What happened?

296
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,560
Is there anything I can help with?

297
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,150
I'm not a kid anymore.

298
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,570
I can take care of myself.

299
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,350
You are still my student.

300
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,590
So before you graduate,

301
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,960
the school and I are responsible for you.

302
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,820
I need to take care of you.

303
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,540
Will you do that after I graduate?

304
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,860
After you graduate...

305
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,830
By then,

306
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,960
you might have forgotten who your teacher is.

307
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,870
No, I won't.

308
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,890
Even after graduation,

309
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,490
I'll visit you and bring you flowers and fruit.

310
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,060
It sounds weird.

311
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,200
You don't like it?

312
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,850
I can bring you something you like.

313
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,890
How about wine?

314
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,300
You brat.

315
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,110
Eat your food.

349

How are you?

350
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,850
Is your foot better?

351
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,030
Yes.

352
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,840
I'm here

353
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,850
to check my schedule for next month.

354
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,910
I've made some arrangements for you.

355
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,300
It's not a hectic schedule.

356
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,060
Take a look.

357
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,350
This is the opening

358
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,440
of a new store of a famous brand.

359
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,220
Many young and popular actresses will go there, too.

360
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,120
This is the 20th anniversary celebration of a mall.

361
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,300
It's a big occasion.

362
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,700
And there are two campaigns for big brands.

363
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,520
These are all commercial activities.

364
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,380
I'm not interested in any of them.

365
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,510
Now, short videos

366
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,190
are very popular.

367
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,840
Our company has contacted some top livestreamers.

368
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,850
You can be a guest

369
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,940
in the most popular livestreamings.

370
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,270
You can also help the brands you worked with

371
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,680
increase their livestreaming sales.

372
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,630
I don't want to do livestreaming marketing, either.

373
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,270
I'm a model, Bei.

374
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,250
I'm not a saleswoman.

375
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,440
Right.

376
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,430
Yiwen.

377
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,680
The company is doing its best for you.

378
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,980
If you can't do the catwalk show,

379
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,060
and you don't want to do commercial activities,

Were these outfits

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,410
those displayed on the Fashion Week show?

384
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,830
Yes.

385
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,120
You

386
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:59,390
came here from Shanghai just to see me?

387
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,400
Even if you were in Antarctica,

388
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,680
I would go find you.

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,330
Why do you want to see me?

390

after the show.

392
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:10,990
Don't say that.

393
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,160
They draw my attention.

394
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,340
Don't you think my design

395
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,200
is not experimental?

396
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,440
Most new designers

397
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,330
try to make something experimental.

398
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,710
That's why there are so many

399
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,440
bizarre designs in the market.

400
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,800
Your design is different.

401
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,800
The clothes you design are comfortable to wear

402
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,710
and do not mean to attract people's attention first.

403
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,470
Good.

404
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,070
But only when you combine practical elements with artistic ones

405
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,850
can you make your design classic.

406
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,980
You have potential.

407
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,730
But others haven't noticed it yet.

408
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,190

This model is quite special.

00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,740
I'll give it to you.

So whenever I felt unhappy,

481
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,510
I told myself

482
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,680
to hang in there

483
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,430

I did everything by myself.

Everyone said I was such a strong girl.

491
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,580
Actually, no one knew

492
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,550
I had no choice but to be strong.

I had no one to rely on.

After I grew up,

00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,580
I made some achievements

You know what?

00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,170
The modeling industry is incredibly competitive.

500
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,670
When I recovered,

501
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,200
I found that there was no place for me.

502
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,830
But I wasn't that frustrated.

503
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,430
I told myself

504
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,860
if I kept working harder,

505
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,920
I would be able to stand on the catwalk again.

506
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,350
But after this injury,

507
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,740
I have no chance at all.

508
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,510
Even so,

509
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,430
I don't want to be the pretty girl pleasing the guests at a celebration.

510
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,830
I don't want to be the hostess for a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

511
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,690
I don't want to do livestreaming.

512
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,230
I don't like any of them.

513
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,710
Those are meaningless.

514
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,690
I hate making concessions.

515
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:55,990
I know.

516
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,030
You did your best.

517
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,020
You really did.

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,560
So,

522
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,880
I've been thinking about it.

523
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,320
I think...

524
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,030
I think it's time for me to give up.

525
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,690
Working as a model brought me a lot of happiness.

526
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,730
I enjoyed it.

527
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
Although this is not a happy ending,

528
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,580
I have no regrets.

529
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,530
Yiwen, you're strong.

530
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,150
You really are.

531
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,560
But sometimes, you don't have to be that strong.

532
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,280
At least when you are with me,

533
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,920
you can be sad

534
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,030
or vulnerable.

535
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,850
If you are tired,

536
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,860
you can choose to let it go.

537
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,620
If you feel a pain in your foot,

538
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,870
you can cry in front of me.

539
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,960
You don't need to be a perfect Tong Yiwen.

540
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,490
Just be yourself.

or where you want to stay,

543
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,380
you won't be alone anymore.

I'm with you.

545
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,550
Trust yourself.

556
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,330
I reconsidered it.

557
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,710
I can understand

558

why you don't want to do those jobs.

559
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,470

00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:11,310
You've done so much for me and my career.

563
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,650
What's wrong?

564
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,489
Before I graduated from college,

565
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:15,770
you noticed me.

566
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,760
You were a talent scout at that time.

567
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,030
You helped me start my career.

568
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,850
You let me join the company

569
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,360
and you were with me when I was on those shows.

570

You've been there for me all the time.

You were there for every show.

572
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,739

00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,739
if you hadn't been with me,

576
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,980
Later, I hurt my foot,

577
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,510
but you were still there with me,

578
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,850
telling me everything would be fine.

579
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,469
I'm really grateful to you.

Thank you.

00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,590
You asked me

00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,850
what I can be if I'm not a model.

587
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,700
I've thought it through.

588
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,170
I decided not to be a model anymore.

589

It won't happen again.

Zixuan is from a single-parent family.
