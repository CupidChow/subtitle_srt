What's wrong?

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,030
What's wrong?

9
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,390
Well...

10
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,660
Who are you?

11
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,940
Xu Yan.

12
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,680
Are you drunk?

13
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,360
Yes.

14
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,600
This is my life.

15
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,150
Sometimes, I get drunk.

16
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,540
I'm sorry. I shouldn't

17
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,440
have called you.

18
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,540
It's not a good habit to call you when I'm drunk.

19
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,970
When I'm drunk,

20
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,630
I cannot control my hand.

21
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,750
Who are there with you?

22
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,060
Why are you so drunk?

23
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,370
It's none of your business.

24
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,230
Don't answer my call next time.

25
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,720
Don't do it, please.

26
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,720
Where are you now?

27
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,870
I'm at the hotel owned by my family.

28
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
Stay where you are. I'm coming soon.

29
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,650
Yun.

30
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,980
Why are you here?

31
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,800
She called me.

32
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,320
What happened?

33
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
She drank some.

34
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,860
How much did she drink?

35
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,540
Not much.

36
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,630
Since you've come here, have a seat.

37
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,230
Waiter, get him a glass.

38
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,910
Come on.

39
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,010
Have a drink.

40
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,510
Yun.

41
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,350
I don't want to drink now.

42
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,340
I'll drive you two home later.

43
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,670
I'm divorced.

44
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,280
Have a drink with me.

45
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,320
How long have you been drinking?

46
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,540
We started drinking after dark.

47
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,740
Your tolerance to alcohol is as good as ever.

48
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,130
You can never get drunk.

49
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,060
It's strange

50
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,430
that sadder I am,

51
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,220
the more I want to get drunk,

52
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,350
and the harder it is for me to get drunk.

53
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,510
Lu Zheng didn't sign

54
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,470
the property settlement agreement.

55
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,800
Why not?

56
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,950
He wanted to make me feel bad, right?

57
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,630
He did it because he still loves you.

58
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,620
Is it also the reason for divorcing me?

59
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,580
I've known Lu Zheng for so many years.

60
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,340
I've never seen him like this.

61
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,410
I think

62
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,440
you're not happy either.

63
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,800
You know what?

64
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,270
He and I were together for so many years.

65
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,650
It became a habit to have him in my life.

66
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,510
When someone suddenly disappeared

67
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,310
from your life,

68
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,200
you will definitely feel sad.

69
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,159
But if we keep being together, we'll both be miserable.

70
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,350
I had to make this decision,

71
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,430
so that we won't be miserable in the future.

72
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,100
As time goes by,

73
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,690
we will get used to the new life.

74
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,990
But I don't know

75
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,030
when that day will come.

76
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,040
You can understand this,

77
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,470
right?

78
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,190
Yes.

79
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,630
I think my design

80
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,760
doesn't have a unique personal style.

81
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,910
Okay.

82
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,840
I'll discuss it with you tomorrow.

83
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,590
Thank you.

84
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,230
Hello.

85
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,070
Why are you not sleeping?

86
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,790
Have some cake.

87
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,790
Okay.

88
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,150
I haven't had supper yet.

89
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,390
Aren't you afraid of getting fat?

90
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,159
I'm not a model anymore.

91
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,730
I don't have to be on a diet.

92
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,590
I'm under too much pressure at work.

93
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,540
I have to eat something sweet

94
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,930
to relieve stress.

95
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,710
I think

96
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,260
you are much happier than before.

97
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,060
Because I really like designing clothes.

98
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,140
And it's

99
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,490
completely different from being a model.

100
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,610
Now, I'm in a healthy competition.

101
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,970
I want to keep working hard to become better.

102
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,820
So

103
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,860
you made a right choice to get a different job.

104
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,630
I should thank you and Jiacheng.

105
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,310
Without your encouragement,

106
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,240
I wouldn't have had the courage to start a new career.

107
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,050
Without me and Jiacheng,

108
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,960
you would do a good job too.

109
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,520
Because

110
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,390
you are always

111
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,450
a positive and hard-working person.

112
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,320
Yes.

113
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,750
After I met Jiacheng,

114
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,590
I now believe

115
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,870
true love does exist.

116
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,430
True love

117
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,260
makes one better,

118
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,710
and more positive.

119
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,470
Is the love

120
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,710
between Ye Han and me true love?

121
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,990
Is something wrong between you two?

122
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,100
Is it because of Song Jinran?

123
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,240
This is tricky.

124
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,450
If I were you,

125
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,200
I would be anxious too.

126
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,670
Now I think

127
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,570
no matter what I do, it'll be wrong.

128
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,820
I don't know what I'm thinking.

129
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,169
I asked him to go that day.

130
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,440
But after he left,

131
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,150
I was alone in the room.

132
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,100
And I couldn't stop thinking about them.

133
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,340
Thinking about what it would be like when they met,

134
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,760
what they would say,

135
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,050
whether Ye Han would make it clear to her,

136
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,650
and whether Ye Han would betray me.

137
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,790
Anyway, I was always

138
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,700
assuming the worst.

139
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,470
In my opinion,

140
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,870
Ye Han won't betray you.

141
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,860
Right.

142
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,620
In my head,

143
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,120
there was a voice

144
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,330
telling me that he wouldn't betray me.

145
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,710
But I couldn't help thinking what if he would.

146
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,550
I just can't

147
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,590
pretend nothing happened.

148
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,710
I shouldn't get mad at him.

149
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,330
That is not rational.

150
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,560
But I feel terrible to keep everything to myself.

151
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
I really don't know what to do.

152
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,230
Who said girls must be rational?

153
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,000
Does he like you

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,190
because you're rational?

155
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,070
You can tell your feelings

156
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,400
and thoughts to him.

157
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,590
You can tell him everything.

158
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,250
In my experience,

159
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,820
if you don't communicate,

160
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,070
your relationship will only get worse.

161
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,480
How should I tell him?

162
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,100
You know Ye Han the best.

163
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,980
But remember,

164
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,830
do not just wait for good things to happen.

165
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,630
Alright.

166
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,570
You've sobered up.

167
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,670
Is it Xu Yan?

168
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,200
You can't recognize him now?

169
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,710
You called him and asked him to come.

170
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,870
Really?

171
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,470
He said you had called him.

172
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,750
Why are you not drunk?

173
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,320
As Xu Yan said,

174
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,590
I would never get drunk.

175
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,590
Fine, since you've sobered up,

176
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,390
I'll leave now.

177
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,990
My head hurts. Send him away.

178
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,070
Stop pretending.

179
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,890
You asked him to come.

180
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,230
When he just arrived here,

181
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,560
he was not in a good mood.

182
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,990
He's yours.

183
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,320
Yun.

184
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,630
Yun.

185
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,070
Wake up.

186
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,540
Xu Yan.

187
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,930
Thank you for telling me you like me.

188
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,230
Now,

189
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,870
I could finally say to the 18-year-old Jialin

190
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,280
that as long as you persist,

191
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,130
you will get the answer one day.

00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,310
It suits you.

381
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,600
You can be the model yourself to show your clothes.

382
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,450
Take a look. I think

383
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,610
there's something missing, but I don't know what it is.

384
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,140
It's good in general.

385
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,730
But you can work on

386
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,610
some details which should show

387
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,520
the distinctive features of your design.

388
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,570
Stay still.

389
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
Yiwen.

390
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:52,870
Jiacheng.

391
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,490
Try it.

392
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,020
How is it?

393
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,660
Did you misunderstand just now?

394
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,230
No.

395
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,420
Then why did you say my name so loudly?

396
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,400
Was I that loud?

397
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,660
It's too quiet here.

398
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,860
Oh, that is the problem.

399
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,330
I bought you your favorite coffee.

400
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,710
We haven't had a proper meal together

401
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,240
for a long time.

402
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,160
Jialin said that

403
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,910
we hadn't gone on date for a long time.

404
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,950
You are so busy

405
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,960
with your work that you've forgot you have a boyfriend.

406
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,330
I'm sorry.

407
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,750
But I've had so much work to do lately.

408
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,520
You're yawning. You didn't sleep well recently?

409
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,710
Something is bothering me.

410
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,910
So I can't sleep well.

411
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,770
You need to have good sleep.

412
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,550
This is temporary. I won't be so busy soon.

413
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,120
Temporary?

414
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,200
You don't even have time on weekends.

415
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,660
Why don't you take a few days off to have a good rest?

416
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,720
I want you to spend more time with me.

417
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,450
Not now.

418
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,680
I'll fall behind if I take a few days off.

419
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,350
Everyone here is so excellent.

420
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,280
I don't know

421
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,820
if my work will be chosen.

422
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,530
I understand.

423
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,070
When will you be free?

424
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,520
Why?

425
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,470
Tell me when you'll be free

426
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,470
so that I can

427
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,120
adjust my schedule and spend a day with you.

428
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,510
That's more like it.

429
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,250
All my time is for you.

430
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,450
Come to me whenever you have time.

431
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,630
Eric needs to see me.

432
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,030
I have to go.

433
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,110
It's him again?

434
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,970
He must have something to tell me.

435
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,350
Are you worried about me?

436
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,200
You haven't finished your meal.

437
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,000
Of course I'm worried about you.

438
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,430
I won't be so busy very soon.

439
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,580
When I'm free,

440
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,800
I'll make it up to you.

441
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,800
Let's make a pinky promise.

442
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,820
Come on.

443
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,930
You have my word.

444
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,400
I'll keep my promise.

445
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,410
Thank you for the food.

446
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,180
There's a lipstick mark on your cheek.

447
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,020
Bye.

448
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,830
Bye.

449
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,980
Mr. Ye.

450
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,160
These are the photos of the exterior scenes.

451
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,440
Please take a look.

452
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,660
And these are the photos of our actors with makeup.

453
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,950
They are professional Kun opera actors.

454
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,980
Mr. Ye, a lady wants to see you.

455
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,110
Let her in.

456
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,480
Thank you.

457
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,270
Ye Han.

458
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,310
This is for you.

459
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:49,130
Thank you for taking care of Kaize for me last time.

460
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,670
You're welcome.

461
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,490
It's just a small favor.

462
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,980
This is nothing expensive.

463
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,880
Just some cookies I baked myself.

464
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,440
I only learnt to make cookies

465
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,710
when I was abroad.

466
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,310
Okay.

467
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,880
Thank you.

468
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,970
Thank you.

469
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:07,330
Do you have anything else to do here?

470
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,150
Actually, I want to...

471
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,150
Mr. Ye.

472
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,480
We've got an emergency!

473
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,790
The photographer who was supposed to come today

474
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,280
couldn't make it because of a car accident.

475
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,470
I contacted several photographers we used to work with.

476
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,350
But none of them can come.

477
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,390
The shooting will start in two hours.

478
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,230
So...

479
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,470
Where is Chloy?

480
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,090
Didn't you say she could be our photographer this time?

481
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:24,950
Have you forgotten?

482
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,510
She gave birth last week and is taking a rest.

483
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,970
Right.

484
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,580
I can help.

485
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,890
I'm free this afternoon.

486
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:35,030
You are...

487
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,480
Jasmine Song.

488
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,670
Song Jinran.

489
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,180
I heard about you.

490
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,790
I really like your works.

491
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,140
Nice to meet you.

492
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,230
What a coincidence.

493
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,240
You can be our photographer today.

494
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,320
I don't want to bother you.

495
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,110
We'll think of another way.

496
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,390
Ye Han.

497
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,050
Under the current circumstances,

498
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,920
it's hard for you

499
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,810
to find a suitable photographer.

500
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,150
We used to work together.

501
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,030
I know what you want to see in the photos.

502
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,160
We don't have any problems in negotiation.

503
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,070
I think I'm the best choice

504
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,630
for you now.

505
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,190
Mr. Ye.

506
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,600
We can't cancel today's shoot or delay it.

507
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,400
Mr. Wu will take a flight and go abroad tonight.

508
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,710
Send me the address.

509
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,610
Don't tell him I'm going.

510

[Clouds Cafe]

511
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,480
I want to give him a surprise.

512
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,830
Thank you.

513

[Old Alleyway]

515
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,830
Miss Li, you look so beautiful.

516
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,860
Are you going on a date?

517
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,110
[Clouds Cafe]

518
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,610
Really beautiful?

519
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,430
The dress suits you.

520
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,090
You should wear a dress more often in the future.

521
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,860
What would you like to order?

522
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,430
Three iced Americanos and one latte.

523
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,750
Two creams and half sugar for the latte.

524
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,360
[Clouds Cafe]

525
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,810
Okay, please wait a moment.

526
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,310
Do you have a pen?

527
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:01,990
Yes.

528
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,990
Can I borrow it?

529
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,070
Thank you.

530
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,850
The ceiling spotlight should be brighter.

531
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,880
Okay.

532
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,260
Okay, let's take a break.

533
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,250
How are the photos?

534
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,020
Let me take a look.

535
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,470
I think we can highlight

536
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,990
the combination of the traditional culture and art.

537
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,820
What do you think?

538
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,700
Yes.

539
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,310
Then

540
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,350
the pictures won't be so dull.

541
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,550
Here are your coffees.

542
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,850
Latte with two creams and half sugar.

543
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,500
-It’s mine.
-It’s mine.

544
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,750
Thank you.

545
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,280
How about this one?

546
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:06,990
Okay.

547
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:07,790
Okay now?

548
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,870
Yes.

549
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,570
Thank you all.

550
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,470
The shooting is done.

551
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,390
Let's call it a day.

552
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,510
You're welcome.

553
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,820
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

554
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,110
You have such a busy schedule. Thank you for coming.

555
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,700
I should thank you.

556
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,310
Nowadays, very few media

557
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,590
will report Kun opera.

558
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,890
They all think traditional operas are outdated.

559
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,830
It's a good thing that you promote Kun opera

560
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,200
and let more people know more about traditional arts.

561
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,550
It's a good thing.

562
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,360
Kun opera is the quintessence of Chinese culture.

563
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,760
It can never be outdated.

564
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,710
Some people in the media industry

565
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,110
only want to attract people's attention,

566
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,480
so they always follow trendy things.

567
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,070
But I believe media

568
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,150
have the obligation

569
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,150
to spread right values

570
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,630
to the public.

571
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,150
Well said, Mr. Ye.

572
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,510
You should hold this belief forever.

573
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,470
Sure.

574
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,350
Mr. Wu, let them remove your makeup.

575
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,150
When this issue of the magazine comes out,

576
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,350
I'll give it to you in person.

577
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,990
Okay, thank you.

578
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,670
Zhang Min.

579
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,530
-Walk Mr. Wu to the exit.
-Coming.

580
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,070
Mr. Wu, this way, please.

581
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,270
Thank you

582
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,650
for what you did today.

583
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,570
You're welcome.

584
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,389
Zhang Min will discuss with you about your remuneration.

585
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:22,710
No need.

586
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,260
I'm happy that I could

587
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,679
work for Declaration again.

588
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,000
We have so many good old memories.

589
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,750
Do you remember when we shot

590
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,120
the photo for the cover of the first issue of our magazine?

591
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,250
It's all in the past.

592
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,480
Now we should focus on the present.

593
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,469
I thought we...

594
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,670
I think I should make it

595
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,190
clear to you.

596
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,429
I hope nothing will happen

597
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,550
between you and me

598
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,840
because you are not in my life now.

599
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,469
I don't want to have you in my life anymore.

600
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,590
Ye Han.

601
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:54,960
I

602
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,830
always want to explain to you.

603
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,070
I actually want to apologize to you.

604
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,240
It's all in the past.

605
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,970
I don't care about it anymore.

606
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,030
I just hope the life I have now

607
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,510
won't be destroyed.

608
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,900
I didn't mean to ruin your life.

609
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,550
But you did unconsciously.

610
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,720
I have a girlfriend now.

611
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,460
And I care about her feelings.

612
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,450
So I don't want her to be upset.

613
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,660
If you really feel sorry for me,

614
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,500
I hope you can avoid seeing me.

615
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,130
Zhang Min will discuss with you about your remuneration.

616
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,240
See you.

617
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,870
Why are there so many coffees left?

618
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,270
They were not bought by our producer.

619
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,930
They are not of the same brand.

620
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,230
This is...

621
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,630
There are words on it.

622
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,630
What words?

623
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,760
This is the gift in return for the cake.

624
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,600
[This is the gift in return for the cake.]

[Shengli Dumplings]

626
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,070
[Song Jinran]

627
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,870
Why are you here?

628
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,410
I missed you.

629
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,880
What are you doing?

630
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,930
Being a cute boy.

631
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,980
How old are you?

632
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,270
When I'm with you,

633
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,550
I feel like I'm only 18 years old.

634
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,400
You brought the coffee.

635
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,790
Why didn't you say hello to me?

636
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,370
I didn't want to disturb you.

637
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,830
Xiaoxiao.

638
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,190
The photographer had an accident today.

639
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,760
That's why we asked Song Jinran to help.

640
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,280
But I've made it clear to her.

641
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,410
I told her that I have a girlfriend now.

642
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,170
So I won't see her again.

643
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,120
Okay.

644
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,930
But you two look like a good couple.

645
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,060
Are you really angry?

646
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,340
Sorry, Xiaoxiao.

647
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,820
I shouldn't have asked her for help.

648
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,800
I should have thought of another way.

649
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:04,030
I'm upset not because you asked her to help with your work.

650
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,670
It's because you two have so many good memories.

651
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,180
You were such a happy couple in the past.

652
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,670
You have the same likes.

653
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,150
You even have the same taste for coffee.

654
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,490
I can't deny that she and I were together in the past.

655
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,630
But the fact is that

656
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
she and I are unsuited to each other.

657
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,550
Only you.

658
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,010
You are the one I want to spend my life with.

659
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,630
I don't know what's going on with me.

660
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:43,870
When I see her,

661
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,080
I feel uneasy.

662
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,330
She's so pretty

663
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,370
and talented.

664
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,530
You fool.

665
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,120
Look at me.

666
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,190
Why?

667
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,750
Look at my eyes.

668
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,950
There's no one else

669
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,550
but you in my eyes.

671
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,500
Mr. Chen.

672
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,390
Declaration has had a good reputation

673
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,710
and a lot achievements

674
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,310
throughout all these years.

675
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,640
Your company's brand concept

676
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,070
is in line with the content of our magazine.

677
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,620
I know about

678
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,320
your magazine.

679
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,480
I've read your advertising proposal.

680
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,030
But I have some questions

681
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,370
about your magazine.

682
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Go ahead.

683
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,230
Your magazine is a paper magazine

684
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,550
and there's no any digital version of it, right?

685
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,810
We are also running a WeChat public account.

686
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,720
The content of it is the same as that of the paper magazine.

687
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,420
The account has a large fan base.

688
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,900
But our magazine remains a paper magazine.

689
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,590
Mr. Xu.

690
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,250
I'll be honest with you.

691
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,070
The public account

692
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,950
is like the paper magazine.

693
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,830
A few years ago, it could gain many views and much traffic.

694
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,480
But in the past few years,

695
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,470
fewer and fewer people

696
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,510
read articles.

697
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,160
Most of the traffic

698
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,440
goes to live streaming and short videos.

699
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,560
I understand.

700
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,230
We're still focusing on the paper magazine.

701
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,420
We want to become the top magazine in the industry.

702
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,500
Our core content is very different

703
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,240
from short videos.

704
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,890
According to the statistics,

705
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,090
the advertisements we put on paper media last year

706
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,690
didn't bring many benefits.

707
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,750
You know it's increasingly difficult to do business now.

708
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:49,230
Our group's budget

709
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,420
for marketing has been cut again.

710
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,360
His Story ceased publication recently.

711
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,930
So we have the budget to find another magazine.

712
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,700
His Story ceased publication?

713
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,060
Yes.

714
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,960
We just got the news.

715
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,530
Mr. Xu.

716
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,550
Personally,

717
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,650
I like your magazine.

718
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,890
I think highly of your ability too.

719
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,820
But

720
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,760
if your magazine cannot gather huge traffic online,

721
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,350
it's hard for me to persuade my bosses

722
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,180
to spend the budget on your magazine.

723
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,490
Do you know His Story ceased publication?

724
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,080
How is that possible?

725
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,260
You're kidding, right?

726
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,850
Do I look like I'm kidding?

727
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,180
Why?

728
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,680
I don't know.

729
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,610
A client told me the news.

730
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,600
And the client didn't agree to collaborate with us.

731
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,570
I have a feeling now.

732
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,080
I think it's very possible

733
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,230
our magazine

734
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,180
will cease publication very soon.

735
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,070
You're exaggerating.

736
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,460
Even if we have lost some clients,

737
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:53,840
it won't have such a bad influence.

738
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,950
I'm serious.

739
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,950
Look at the statistics.

740
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,630
And the money in the account

741
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,470
won't last long.

742
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:02,820
Ye Han.

743
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,680
If we want to survive,

744
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,800
I think we need to reform.

745
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,800
Reform?

746
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,720
How will you reform?

747
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,680
Digitize our magazine.

748
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,910
Make it more popular on the Internet.

749
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,560
Do you want us

750
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,590
to be one of those stupid Internet magazines?

751
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,230
Oh.

752
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,450
You mean we can make short videos,

753
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,630
make an app, and start a live streaming account

754
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,570
and sell goods through live streaming.

755
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:32,050
At least we can give it a try.

756
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,230
At least it sounds

757
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,610
we are keeping pace with the times.

758
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,000
It can also bring traffic, right?

759
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,470
You're wrong, Jiacheng.

760
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:40,250
This will slowly damage the reputation of our magazine.

761
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,210
What do you think we should do?

762
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,930
Stick to our original aspiration.

763
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,920
Only a few people can always do the right thing.

764
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,050
Dude.

765
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,900
We're running a company.

766
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,240
If you only focus on your artistic aspiration,

767
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,420
we won't be able to survive on the market.

768
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,010
You are now like one of those

769
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,170
who hold pessimistic views about the development of the print media.

770
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:58,870
What about you?

771
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,280
Are you different from

772
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,240
those stubborn guys who reject everything new?

773
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:01,870
What about you?

774
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,310
You are no different

775
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:03,990
from those businessmen who only care about money.

776
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,950
Fine.

777
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,860
I only care about money.

778
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,590
I'm a businessman who prioritizes profits.

779
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,220
You are

780
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,140
an artist with a dream, okay?

781
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,290
But Ye Han,

782
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,190
can you please not be so self-centered?

783
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,250
You are also the boss of this company.

784
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,060
Do you want everyone in the company

785
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,010
to make sacrifices for your artistic aspiration?
