00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,010
Jialin was at my place last night.

192
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,760
She cried all night.

193
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,430
Don't try to persuade me.

194
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,290
I won't change my mind.

195
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,980
Sorry for your trouble.

196
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,140
You're already sad yourself.

197
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,070
But you still have to take care of her.

198
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,030
You know it?

199
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,630
Are you okay?

200
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,380
Actually, it's good to have Jialin with me.

201
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,260
At least,

202
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,200
I don't have time to think too much.

203
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,170
I know Ye Han.

204
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,190
There must be misunderstandings between you two.

205
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,580
If he hurt you by doing anything wrong,

206
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,460
I would be the first to beat him up.

207
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,900
You don't have to persuade me, either.

208
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,170
We've broken up.

209
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,160
I won't change my mind.

210
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,830
I can see myself out.

211
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,860
Go on to the meeting.

212
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,000
Take care.

213
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:28,830
Bye.

214
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,690
Bye.

215
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,650
What?

216
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,930
With whom?

217
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,320
I said

218
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,980
I wanted to date Xu Yan,

219
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,600
and I wanted to marry him.

220
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,460
Let me ask you.

221
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,730
Did you miss the plane

222
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,990
because of him?

223
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,090
What do you think, Dad?

224
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,980
I... I won't agree.

225
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,960
Why?

226
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,500
Why?

227
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,370
Don't you know why?

228
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,940
He's about the same age as your brother.

229
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,480
Other than that, his wife was...

230
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,040
No parents would allow their daughter

231
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,980
to marry a married man.

232
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,120
But I like him.

233
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Like?

234
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,720
Do you have to get married just because you like him?

235
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,620
I've liked him since high school.

236
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,050
Isn't that enough?

237
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,200
Jialin,

238
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,650
you're still young.

239
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,640
Marriage is not a small matter.

240
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,610
Your mom and I have been through it.

241
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,350
About this, we must...

242
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,590
What if I say

243
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,050
if you allow me to date Xu Yan,

244
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,050
I'll take over the company?

245
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,460
Are you bargaining with us?

246
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,460
Dad, the intern Lin Jia,

247
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,280
who you once praised,

248
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,340
is me.

249
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,630
Is that you?

250
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,420
Yes.

251
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,280
I asked Mr. Wang

252
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,430
to put me into the company.

253
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,080
Why?

254
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,750
I wanted to see the real problems of the company

255
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,670
as a base-level employee.

256
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,030
So I saw

257
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,110
what you can't see as a C-suite.

258
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,100
Then it seems that

259
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,830
you are well prepared to negotiate with us.

260
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,160
It contains my detailed analysis of the company's status quo

261
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,010
and plans for the future.

262
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,240
I'm capable

263
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,560
and I have the confidence

264
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,120
to manage the hotel for you.

265
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,990
But you have to

266
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,440
allow me to date Xu Yan.

267
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:51,950
You...

268
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,040
If you don't give us your permission,

269
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,520
I will never take over the company.

270
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,030
That's all I want to say.

271
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,890
Think about it before you give me the answer.

272
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,580
What do you mean?

273
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,180
This is out of control.

274
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,900
What should we do?

275
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,000
How did we raise such a child?

276
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,350
Do these again.

277
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,910
Okay.

278
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,230
I'm done with the e-zine arrangement.

279
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,910
So soon?

280
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,100
But there is a problem.

281
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,110
What is it?

282
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,640
They made a request.

283
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,200
They want you

284
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,610
to host the first episode.

285
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,080
After all, this is your project.

286
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,290
You have the final say.

287
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay. I can do it.

288
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,960
You agreed so quickly.

289
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,150
Yes.

290
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,670
I can attend online meetings about our paper issues.

291
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,760
It's our first time trying an electronic version.

292
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,460
I hope I can have more control of it.

293
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,190
Are you okay with three months?

294
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,010
Three months?

295
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,790
OK.

297

298
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,880
If you need me in Shanghai,

299
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,240
I can come back anytime.

300
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,170
If you didn't break up with Xiaoxiao,

301
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,520
would you go?

302
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,950
Maybe I would make my decision even faster.

303
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,240
Because I wouldn't think about leaving.

304

305

You took off the ring.

307
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,850
So, you decided to ignore my disapproval.

308

If I did,

309
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,550
I wouldn't have let her cry so many times.

312

But please forgive her.

00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,730
The one who should be angry was angry.

380
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,080
And the one who should apologize apologized.

381
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,200
But I don't think

382
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,620
we will change our minds.

383
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,600
By the way, you didn't invite Jiacheng today. Is it because of me?

384
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,240
Thanks to you,

385
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,490
he has been working hard recently.

386
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,890
He went to see a client.

387
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,340
From now on,

388
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,850
don't exclude him.

389
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,810
Exclude me.

390

391
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,420

392
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,120
then I should be the one

393
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,680
who's excluded,

394
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,100
not him.

395
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,020
All right, I'm going to the meeting.

396
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,570

397
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,380
By the way,

398
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,390
Jie's death anniversary is Monday.

399
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,980
But we have a weekly meeting that day,

400
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,710
so we decided to go on Saturday.

401
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,670
They made such a scene.

402
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,350
Do you think Jiacheng will go?

403
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,070
I don't know.

404
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,410
But he never missed one.

405
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,150
On a day like this,

406
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,040
I'm sure he'll be there no matter what.

407
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,940
I'm worried if he's there.

408
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,030
I'm worried if he's not there as well.

409
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,460
Saturday, right?

410
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,370
Good.

411
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,330
I have something to do this weekend.

412
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,950
You have nothing to do this weekend?

413
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,410
Aren't you going on a date?

414
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,910
Why do I feel like you are better behaved

415
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,110
after the divorce?

416
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,020
That's because the person I want to see

417
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,310
doesn't want to see me.

418
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,530
Who?

419
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,250
Shengyun.

420
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,470
I feel

421
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,470
she now lives in my mind.

422
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,320
But when I go back home, where I live,

423
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,510
I can't see her.

424
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,430
I am frustrated.

425
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,420
Now you feel frustrated.

426
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,030
Why didn't you feel that before the divorce?

427
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,670
You can't say that to me.

428
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,720
Among the four of us,

429
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,070
you and I are the only ones who broke up.

430
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,010
We're in the same boat.

431
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,040
Why don't you diss me?

432
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,630
I'm not in the mood to argue with you.

433
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,160
I'm over 30.

434
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,030
How could I be affected by this?

435
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,560
It's normal.

436
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,550
My neighbor, who is 60 years old,

437
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,790
still wanted to commit suicide because of the breakup.

438
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,080
No.

439
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,560
Can you give me a chance

440
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,760
to get things off my chest?

441
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,340
OK, go ahead.

Jialin was here.

448

She didn't want to disturb you,

449
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,380
so she asked me to give these to you.

450
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,170
Thank you.

452

Are you here for Xu Yan again?

468
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,340
Mom just called me.

469
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,420
She said you were an intern at our hotel.

470
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,960
Is this your plan?

471

Not entirely.

472

But they won't agree no matter what,

473
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,800
so I had to make a deal with them.

474
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,560

♫If we can notice all the considerations♫

568
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,300

♫Let's not lose each other again♫

570

♫And change our destiny♫

576
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,350
How many times have Jialin cried for you?

577
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,120
She cried for you

578
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,050
♫I'll go far away with you♫

579
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,430
not because you rejected her,

580
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,380
but because she met you.

♫In the future I've been dreaming of♫

582
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040

even if you accept her now,

584
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,130
she's still crying.

585
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:05,530
♫Love is like a lost ark♫

586
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,710
Do you want her

587
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,480
to suffer for the rest of her life?

588
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,510
Xu Yan.

♫Where is the entrance to dreams♫

590
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,790

599
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,920

601
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,600
Both of us are uncomfortable.

Ye Han.

♫I'll be with you♫

604
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,720
Fortunately, I have you.

605
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,900
I can still talk to you.

606
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,070
I'm going on a business trip.

607
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:45,970
About three months.

608
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,100
I'm going to Beijing.

609
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,060
Three months?

610
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,290
Are you going on a business trip

611
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,040
or are you trying to avoid them?

612
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,570
Maybe...

613
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,070
I am

614
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,530
trying to avoid something.

615
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,870
How can you do this?

616
00:29:58,910 --> 00:29:59,750
What about me?

617
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,590
I don't know what to do

618
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,350
caught between them.

619
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,150
I'm living in Jiacheng's house.

620
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,570
No, I have to find a way to go home.

621
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,750
I'm home.

622
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,230
So heavy.

623
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,700
Today's fruits are fresh.

624
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,990
Buy one and get one free.

625
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,230
So, I wanted to buy some

626
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,870
and share with my boyfriend.

627
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,410
My dear boyfriend, how's your day?

628
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,090
You must be tired today.

629
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,550
I'm sorry.

630
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,410
What?

631
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,910
Why are you apologizing suddenly?

632
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,860
Ye Han, Lu Zheng, Jiacheng, and I

633
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,360
went to see Jie today.

634
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,950
I'm sorry.

635
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,490
I didn't plan to tell you.

636
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,730
I wanted to see her.

637
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,340
I finally mustered up my courage today.

638
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:40,850
I'm sorry

639
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,700
for making you cry again.

640
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,430
I promise

641
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,280
I won't make you cry again.

642
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,760
Why don't we stop saying sorry?

643
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,710
I hope you can be happy every day.

644
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,610
Okay?

645
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:55,800
Okay.

646
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,210
You met Xu Yan at the cemetery?

647
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,520
We went to see Jie together.

648
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,530
Now that I think about it,

649
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,480
I'd rather not go.

650
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,240
Now everyone's unhappy.

651
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,310
After what happened,

652
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,910
I believe no one can be happy.

653
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,860
But you've been friends for more than ten years.

654
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,360
Everything will be fine.

655
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,220
I don't know why.

656
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,610
It's like the fate is teasing us.

657
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,110
Xiaoxiao broke up with Ye Han.

658
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,070
Lu Zheng divorced Shengyun.

659
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,030
Xu Yan and I are in such a situation.

660
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,550
You're back.

661
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,680
Jiacheng is here.

662
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,350
I'll go back and rest.

663
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,840
Xiaoxiao,

664
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,370
I have something

665
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,280
to tell you.

666
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,400
Ye Han is going to Beijing soon.

667
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,670
He's on a business trip for three months.

668
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,440
Did he ask you to tell me?

669
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,120
No.

670
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,260
Well,

671
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,230
then just pretend

672
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,770
that you never told me.

673
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:31,810
You guys talk.

674
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,570
Good night.

675
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,670
[Store for Transfer]

676
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,139
[Store for Transfer]

677
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:57,760
[Store for Transfer]

678
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,100
[Store for Transfer]

679
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,000
Grandma.

680
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,970
Grandma, are you home?

681
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,920
Grandma.

682
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:06,960
Xiaoxiao.

683
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,390
Auntie Wang.

684
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,210
Have you seen my grandma?

685
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,560
The house has been sold.

686
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,370
Don't you know it?

687
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,370
Your grandma went to a nursing home.

688
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,790
What?

689
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,800
Thank you.

690
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,610
-Hello.
-Hello.

691
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,880
May I ask

692
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,550
if there is a woman named Wu Caifen?

693
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,790
Wu Caifen...

694
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,580
She seems to be in the entertainment room downstairs.

695
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,270
Go down from here?

696
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,080
Yes, just go down from here.

697
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,990
Thank you.

698
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,150
Grandma.

699
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,440
Xiaoxiao.

700
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
Grandma.

701
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,430
Why didn't you tell me you were sick?

702
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,300
I didn't want you to worry

703
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,030
and overthink.

704
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,310
The doctor said

705
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,980
this disease takes time.

706
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,690
I don't have any symptoms now.

707
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,650
It's just that my memory's declining.

708
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,570
It's all my fault.

709
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,160
It's all my fault.

710
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,980
You are sick.

711
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,300
But you had to go to the hospital alone,

712
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,740
move alone,

713
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,600
and come here alone.

714
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,800
It's all my fault.

715
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,220
I'm good here.

716
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,400
I have someone to take care of me

717
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,410
and someone to play with me.

718
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,290
There are many activities here.

719
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,000
Well...

720
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,710
I'm here to enjoy life,

721
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,630
not to suffer.

722
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,930
I'm quite fashionable.

723
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,270
I found myself a good place.

724
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,320
I didn't take good care of you.

725
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,840
Xiaoxiao,

726
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,350
aging, illness, and death

727
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,090
are very common

728
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,940
at our age.

729
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,430
I'm happy

730
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,570
to live to this day.

731
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,880
Besides,

732
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,910
I'm fine now.

733
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120
Grandma.

734
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,150
I'm scared.

735
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,640
Will you forget me?

736
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,530
Maybe I will forget you.

737
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,520
Kid,

738
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,790
listen.

739
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,870
Just like when you were little,

740
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,080
I took you to travel with me.

741
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,340
A friend told me

742
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,430
I was wasting my time

743
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,370
because you wouldn't remember

744
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,640
where I took you.

745
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,620
But I don't think so.

746
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,010
I think

747
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,050
I had a good time with my granddaughter.

748
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,150
I can remember it.

749
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,250
Xiaoxiao,

750
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,320
it's your turn now.

751
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,440
As long as you remember me

752
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:16,370
and the days we spent together,

753
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,280
that's enough.

754
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,190
All right.

755
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,400
Don't cry.

756
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,590
Let's not worry about the future.

757
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,610
Let's live this moment

758
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,950
and

759
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,470
every day we have now.

760
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,240
I will never forget you.

761
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,730
I will never forget you.

762
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,960
[To 30-year-old Xu Yan] [From 18-year-old Jiacheng]

763
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,980
[To 30-year-old Jiacheng] [From Xu Yan]

764
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,580
[To 30-year-old Jiacheng] [From Xu Yan]

765
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,420
Dear Jiacheng after 15 years,

766
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,460
hello.

767
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,850
I'm Xu Yan.

768
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,720
Have you improved your basketball skills?

769
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,070
During these 15 years,

770
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,870
you have to beat me at least once.

771
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,190
When you play basketball,

772
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,880
don't focus on the ball only.

773
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,630
Look at your opponents' shoulders and feet.

774
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,780
Because you are not playing against the ball,

775
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,060
but your opponents.

776
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,590
Don't tell me you can't realize this

777
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,510
after 15 years.

778
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,480
How do we look

779
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,550
when we are old?

780
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,410
Are we healthy?

781
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,970
Can we keep our promise

782
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,690
to play basketball together even when we're old?

783
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:17,730
By the way,

784
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,040
we are still friends, right?

785
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,730
I think we still are

786
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,750
even after 15 years.

787
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,250
Why did you come here?

788
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,010
I don't want to lose my brother.

789
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,530
I didn't expect

790
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,600
you to dig it out.
