are just friends.

7
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,960
What we did wasjust to provoke you.

8
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,800
I know.

9
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,830
Jialin told you about it?

10
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,479
I'm a few years older than you.

11
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,500
I could tell.

12
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,000
What else?

13
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,270
Also,

14
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,960
everyone can see

15
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,320
that you and Jialin like each other.

16
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,810
It's not just her wishful thinking.

17
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,740
Right?

18
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,970
No matter what concerns you have,

19
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,730

21

Moreover, she's been in love with you for ten years.

22
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,120
Can you be more brave?

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,800
I'm happy

24
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,020
that Jialin has a friend like you.

25
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,390
I once had the life I wanted,

26
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,240
a stable

27
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,560
and happy life.

28
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,550
But one day,

29
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,200
God took everything away.

30
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,590
If you have it, you'll lose it.

31
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,829
Losing is painful.

32
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:52,579
I'm too old to act recklessly.

33
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,700
So,

34
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,250
whether I like Jialin or not,

35
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,970
I won't be with her.

36
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,190
No way.

37
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,730
Why can't you be with her?

38
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,490
Is courage related to age?

39
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,080
I don't think

40
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,150
you have to

41
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,270
make excuses that no one believes

42
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,510
in front of someone who's leaving.

43
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,700
Maybe it's because I feel guilty.

44
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,160
The more I like her,

45
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,390
the more I feel guilty.

46
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,550
This is a vicious cycle.

47
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,610
All her affections for me

48
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,640
will become a weapon to hurt us in the end.

49
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,110
That might be the answer.

Why are you still up so late?

00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,160
Okay.

That won't do.

I heard you went to that dinner party anyway.

109
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,300
That's because you haven't heard

110

that I rejected Mr. Hu's cooperation proposal on e-magazines.

did you tell Song Jinran

Why would I tell her about this?

116
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,050
I heard

117
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,110
that you left angrily after she came.

118
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,860
It had nothing to do with her.

I just think

120
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,340
there must be a reason for the print media to exist.

Then I just think

00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,260
there's no need

So I'm kind of your teacher, too.

382
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,530
Who knows if you'll still be after today?

383
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,570
Wait.

384
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,210
Tell me the address.

385
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,450
I won't tell you.

386
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,660
Ms. Zhang.

387
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,010
You're here.

388
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,020
You look so beautiful. Happy wedding.

389
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,770
Of course I look beautiful.

390
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,450
I spent a lot of money.

391
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,730
It's well worth it.

392
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,050
Luo Yi.

393
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,250
Let me introduce you.

394
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,930
This is my colleague,

395
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,370
Li Xiaoxiao.

396
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,010
Hello.

397
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,060
This is my husband's childhood friend,

398
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,730
Luo Yi.

399
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,540
Hello.

400
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,340
Nice to meet you.

401
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,130
Hello.

402
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,610
Luo Yi is a programmer,

403
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,170
a senior engineer.

404
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,150
Xiaoxiao is the most beautiful coach in our school.

405
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,290
You're both young people.

406
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,170
I don't have to say too much.

407
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,390
You can get to know each other.

408
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,780
I have other friends there.

409
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,660
I have to go.

410
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,260
You guys talk.

411
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,620
He makes hundreds of thousands of yuan a year.

412
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,260
Have a good chat.

413
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,340
Don't go.

414
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,900
Aunt.

415
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,970
Here is the bride.

416
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,170
I heard a lot about you from Ms. Zhang.

417
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,980
I finally met you in person today.

418
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,920
Really?

419
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,780
So I don't feel unfamiliar with you.

420
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,410
But I think you're different

421
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,340
from what I imagined.

422
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,660
You don't look like a bike coach.

423
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,970
Maybe this dress helped a lot.

424
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,980
This dress suits you.

425
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,020
You don't look like a programmer, either.

426
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,390
What do you think a programmer is like?

427
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,530
Someone who stays home,

428
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,390
wearing glasses and polo shirts,

429
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,250
That's a misunderstanding.

430
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,250
I don't like wearing a polo shirt.

431
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,530
I like going out.

432
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,510
I like outdoor sports the most.

433
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,380
What sport?

434
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,020
I like rock climbing.

435
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,530
By the way, I'm also good at cycling.

436
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,410
We can have a ride someday

437
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,410
and have a duel.

438
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,310
Can I join you?

439
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,140
I learned my bike skills

440
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,860
from Miss Li.

441
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:07,740
Really?

442
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,400
You must be very skilled then.

443
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,470
It's all right.

444
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,150
This is for you.

445
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,170
You brought flowers for a girl

446
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,090
at the wedding.

447
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,020
You're quite thoughtful.

448
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,510
It's what the heart wants.

449
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,110
But your heart seems...

450
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,640
There's a reason.

451
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,450
Yes.

452
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,810
You always have a reason.

453
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,830
[Marry me]

454
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,820
Why are you here?

455
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,020
I'm here to apologize.

456
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,940
I'm gonna get down on my hands and knees

457
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,700
and apologize to you.

458
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,980
I want to tell you

459
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,350
I care about you.

460
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,620
I'm also afraid of losing you.

461
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,180
With this?

462
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,340
That… You'll have to blame your good student, Zhong Zixuan.

463
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,090
What does it have to do with him?

464
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,820
If he told me the address

465
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,260
of the wedding,

466
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,920
I wouldn't have run after him,

467
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,680
and the flowers wouldn't have become like this.

468
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,490
You

469
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,030
went to my school?

470
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,580
I brought you some flowers.

471
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,360
Xiaoxiao.

472
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,520
Don't come near me.

473
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,410
We're on a break.

474
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,580
Xiaoxiao,

475
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,530
what you saw that day was a misunderstanding.

476
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,770
I saw you hugging each other.

477
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,420
That's not true.

478
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,820
She hugged me.

479
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,810
What's the difference?

480
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,260
How is it the same?

481
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,580
I didn't move at all.

482
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,340
Then why did she hug you?

483
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,970
That hug

484
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,090
meant comfort.

485
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,610
She told me

486
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,980
why she had to leave me at that time

487
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,330
and hugged me.

488
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,300
The hug

489
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,020
meant comfort.

490
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,930
So you two made up?

491
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,120
No.

492
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,400
But I understand her.

493
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,420
I understand her,

494
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,850
but I won't forgive her.

495
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,610
So don't break up with me.

496
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,330
You are

497
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,730
the only one

498
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,570
I want to make up with.

499
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,900
I always told myself

500
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,270
it was a misunderstanding,

501
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,530
and I had to trust you

502
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,340
and our love.

503
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,820
The more I thought about it,

504
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,500
the more I trusted you, and the more I felt sad.

505
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,570
I wanted to pretend

506
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,940
to be generous.

507
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,460
But I couldn't.

508
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,410
I just care.

509
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,770
I'm unhappy.

510
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,210
Sorry.

511
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,420
Do you remember

512
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,820
that I found you

513
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,810
among so many people?

514
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,180
Looing back what we've been through since then until now,

515
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,690
it's not been easy.

516
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,850
What if

517
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,530
I still want to break up with you?

518
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,810
If you insist,

519
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,860
let's break up.

520
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,180
Anyway, I'll find you

521
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,150
in the crowd like I did before.

522
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,380
Then,

523
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,750
I'll start my unrequited love again.

524
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,470
The wedding is about to begin.

525
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,450
I'm leaving.

526
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,060
Come in.

527
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,530
Ms. Chen.

528
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,410
President Xu saw your proposal

529
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,450
and thought it was great.

530
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,540
He wanted to see you

531
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,970
and hire you as a regular employee.

532
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,780
I...

533
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,180
We'll sign the contract with you this week.

534
00:25:59,180 --> 00:25:59,850
But

535
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,420
you can't skip work anymore

536
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,480
after you become a regular employee.

537
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,260
Ms. Chen,

538
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,430
I think I'm in a good state now.

539
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,200
I...

540
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,070
This is a rare opportunity.

541
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,650
Why do you refuse?

542
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,660
Because you can't skip work anymore?

543
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,500
Yes.

544
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,630
No, no.

545
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,500
I mean

546
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,080
I'm still young.

547
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,970
It's good to be an assistant.

548
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,050
I like living a free life like this.

549
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,090
I don't care

550
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,590
if I can become a regular employee or not.

551
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,890
This is double-sided embroidery.

552
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,100
I think it'll be better

553
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,940
to use it in a large area,

554
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,220
so that it'll look natural when the model moves.

555
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,010
But we need to schedule in advance,

556
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,420
because it's handmade.

557
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,810
And

558
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,660
[Refuse] [Answer]

559
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,660
[Jiacheng]

560
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,740
this is one-sided embroidery.

561
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,820
I think it's better

562
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,060
to use it on the shoulder.

563
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,060
What do you think?

564
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,980
I think it's a good idea.

565
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,930
Well...

566
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,580
Answer the phone first.

567
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,410
Hello, what's up?

568
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,450
I just want to ask you

569
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,420
if you're done.

570
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,650
Can I pick you up from work

571
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,810
and have dinner with you?

572
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:15,580
Not today.

573
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,120
I have to work late.

574
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,500
What about tomorrow night?

575
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,230
I also have a lot to do tomorrow.

576
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,470
Are you still mad at me?

577
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,010
No, I've been really busy lately.

578
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,450
I'll call you as soon as I'm done.

579
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,090
Okay?

580
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,260
Okay.

581
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,020
Call me anytime.

582
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,210
Bye.

583
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,250
So annoyed.

584
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,030
There he is.

585
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,880
Hello, Mr. Xu.

586
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,420
Long time no see.

587
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,730
Hello.

588
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,940
What do you mean by this?

589
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,220
I think I've made it clear on it.

590
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,260
Do you think you can solve it with a piece of paper?

591
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,190
Who do you think you are?

592
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,190
So what if you're a lawyer?

593
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,690
Can you bully ordinary people like us with your identity?

594
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,930
I'll have to ask everyone to judge it.

595
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,890
How can you be reasonable if you don't pay your debt?

596
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,900
It's only right to pay your debt.

597
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,950
High interest loans are not protected by law.

598
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,460
We can sit down and talk

599
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,150
if you accept my proposal.

600
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,180
But it's useless to shout here.

601
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,800
Let me tell you.

602
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,090
We're not afraid of your bluffing.

603
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,740
Don't try to intimidate us

604
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,470
with your identity as a lawyer.

605
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,660
Don't touch me.

606
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,250
So what if I touch you?

607
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,460
So what?

608
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,570
So what?

609
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,490
You hit me?

610
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,210
The lawyer hit me!

611
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,410
The lawyer hit me!

612
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,180
Look.

613
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,770
The lawyer hit me!

614
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,900
Look.

615
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,660
Don't be a rascal.

616
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,620
Are you warning me?

617
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,080
[IN WORK]

618
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,890
Are you okay?

619
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,210
How are you?

620
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,210
He fell himself.

621
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,890
He fell himself.

622
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,850
Call 120, please.

623
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,380
Call the police. Did someone call the police?

624
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,550
Call the police.

625
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,840
[IN WORK]

626
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,970
Those two people were arrested.

627
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:43,940
They are at the police station now.

628
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,340
Do you need me to go there?

629
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,290
No.

630
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,490
The police are there.

631
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,210
But I don't think

632
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,250
I'll be able to meet my clients tomorrow in this state.

633
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,980
I'll have to bother you with it.

634
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,260
I should check with you

635
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,450
on something.

636
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,780
Just have a rest.

637
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,580
Leave the rest to me.

638
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,980
It's all about recuperating.

639
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,770
Luckily,

640
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,770
your brain should be fine this time.

641
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,410
Leave the work to me.

642
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,450
Don't worry.

643
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,380
Okay.

644
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,730
Thank you.

645
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,260
Okay.

646
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,140
Xu Yan, your...

647
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,900
Your hand is broken?

648
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,500
Why are you here?

649
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,690
I didn't want to come, either.

650
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,690
But how could I not come that you're injured like this?

651
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,650
It must hurt a lot.

652
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,940
I've checked everything.

653
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,130
It's just a fracture.

654
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,260
Nothing serious.

655
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,090
I'll stay in the hospital for a night

656
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,380
to see if there's a concussion.

657
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,460
I'll be discharged tomorrow

658
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,720
if there is no problem.

659
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,650
Nothing serious.

660
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,250
Don't worry.

661
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,540
Mr. Xu,

662
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,400
let me buy you something to drink.

663
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,020
I brought warm milk.

664
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,750
It's for a calcium supplement.

665
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,460
I'll buy you some toiletries.

666
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,260
You'll be discharged tomorrow…

667
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,270
I brought them with me, too.

668
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,940
Just in case,

669
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,550
I also brought eye masks, earphones,

670
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,710
and disposable slippers.

671
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,940
Is your bag

672
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,890
Doraemon's treasure box?

673
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,450
Why do you have everything?

674
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,420
Of course.

675
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,150
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come later than you.

676
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,580
I'll go back to the law firm to deal with the clients.

677
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,370
Okay.

678
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,000
Ms. Huang,

679
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,300
Xu Yan broke his hand.

00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,940
Please take care of the work.

681
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,310
You must be busy.

682
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,800
I won't let you stay, then.

683
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,160
Why don't you eat something?

684
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,890
You must have skipped lunch.

go back first?

688
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,130
Your right hand is injured.

689
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,210
Someone should take care of you.

690
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,660
I can stay and take care of you tonight.

692
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,050

It's okay.

698
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,670
I'm glad you need it.

00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,370

702
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,580
I'll get going then.

703
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,730
Since they are here,

704
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:18,010
you should be well taken care of.

705
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,930
But if anything happens,

706
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,940
call me no matter how late it is.

00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,380

Hello, Mom.

710

I'll be back soon.

I don't think my brother can go back.

712
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,790
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

who gave you all the gifts?

715
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,580
Who gave them to me?

716
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,480
Doesn't the snitch know about it?

717
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
The snitch?

718
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,590
Who is it?

719
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:20,360
I made Americano for you.

720
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:21,489
I made it myself.

721
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,659
Bro,

722
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,460
I have a fracture.

723
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,610
I need a calcium supplement.

724
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,820
Do you think I have too much calcium

725
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,480
that you make me drink coffee?

726
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,110
A calcium supplement?

727
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:30,969
I got it wrong.

728
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,340
This is latte.

729
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,540
It's a combination of calcium and iron.

730
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,449
Is this Americano or latte?

731
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,389
Don't be so strict.

732
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,300
Let me see what this is.

733
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,420
This...

734
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,090
Isn't this milk?

735
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,580
Have some milk

736
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,650
and then, some Americano.

737
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,580
Shake a little, and it'll be latte.

738
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:53,850
That's great.

739
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,340
Don't make the two gestures.

740
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,250
This is six.

741
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,730

-How are you?

742
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,180
I'm fine.

743
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,700
You two came here together?

744
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,860
Who came with him?

745
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,410
Yeah, who came with him?

746
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,730
The editorial department is working overtime today.

747
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,010
I don't know why the Editor-in-Chief is here.

748
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,690
That's because the editors of the editorial department are working overtime,

749
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,930
not me.

750
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,580
They didn't fulfill my task,

751
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,980
so they had to do it again.

752
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,260
I'm taking a break now

753
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,690
because this is not my working time.

754
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,100
Are you satisfied with this answer, President Xu?

755
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,800
Yes.

756
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,220
Very satisfied.

757
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,170
Hey, you two.

758
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,630
What's wrong with you two?

759
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,780
What happened?

760
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,060
You two should stop.

761
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,080
Aren't you here to visit me?

762
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,560
Can you show some peace?

763
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,090
I'll let him go

764
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,180
for your sake.

765
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,810
Don't pretend to be generous.

766
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:23,290
Who was fussing over working overtime just now?

767
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,430
Oh my god. How can you say this?

768
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,250
Hello?

769
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,020
This is a ward. The patient needs rest.

770
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:33,850
If you can't

771
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,420
come here hand in hand,

772
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,300
get out.

773
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,050
Okay?

774
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,400
Xu Yan.

775
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,450
You can't be angry anymore.

776
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,290
If you get angry again,

777
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,020
your condition will get worse.

778
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,200
Let me ask you.

779
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,580
What are you doing here?

780
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,480
Are you here to visit the patient?

781
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,830
You've been arguing since you got here.

782
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,760
Do you want to make it worse for him?

783
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,550
Does it hurt?

784
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,620
Sorry.

785
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,220
Does it hurt?

786
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,860
You two stay here.

787
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,480
You leave.

788
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:12,780
Look how mad he is.

789
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,350
[IN WORK]

790
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:25,820
Morning, Mr. Ye.

791
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,970
This is it.

792
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,220
[Declaration]

793
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,770
Jiacheng.

794
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:38,530
Let's

795
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:40,910
have a talk.

796
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,770
I'm not thirsty.

797
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,690
It's not for you.

798
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,050
What?

799
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,010
It's for my apology.

800
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,100
Apologize to me?

801
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,100
I'll drink tea instead of alcohol.

802
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,430
I'll finish it in one go.

803
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,150
Good for you.

804
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,210
I'm sorry.

805
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,910
What's with that expression?

806
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,530
For so many years, it's the first time

807
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,990
I've never heard you say something serious.

808
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,070
I thought I heard it wrong.

809
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,170
It must have been hard for you

810
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,190
for all these years.

811
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:51,850
Yes.

812
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,460
I thought about it.

813
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,690
You've been tolerating me all these years.

814
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,420
You've been accommodating me.

815
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,530
So, most of my willfulness

816
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,500
is nurtured by you.

817
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,380
Are you blaming me

818
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,420
by saying that?

819
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,540
I'm not blaming you.

820
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:11,860
I'm grateful to you.

821
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,810
Thank you

822
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,020
for making friends with me

823
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,410
when I was young and weird.

824
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,920
Thank you for being the first one to support me

825
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,580
and giving me all your support

826
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,940
when I chose to start a business.

827
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,240
You even chose to forgive me

828
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,800
when I left selfishly.

829
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,810
Thank you for everything you've done for me for the past ten years.

830
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:46,490
Thank you.

831
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:50,980
Actually,

832
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,580
I've been thinking a lot these days.

833
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,200
I'm too used to your efforts.

834
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,890
I've been focusing on my dream.

835
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,950
I never thought about your dream.

836
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,640
But Jiacheng, you know what?

837
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,970
“Declaration” doesn't get to where it is today

838
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,050
because of me,

839
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,850
but because of you.

840
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:18,690
We've actually been on the same path.

841
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,160
It's just I forgot about it.

842
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,110
Sorry.

843
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,650
What?

844
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,510
Why are you so emotional today?

845
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,840
I'm reflecting on myself.

846
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,450
Actually,

847
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,810
I should have said this six years ago.

848
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,270
Ye Han,

849
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,670
do you know

850
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,130
why I chose to be your friend?

851
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,790
Maybe it's because I'm tall and handsome.

852
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,160
That's Xu Yan.

853
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,430
It's because

854
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,760
you showed me what I wanted to be.

855
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,210
You're reckless,

856
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,190
straightforward,

857
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,050
and brave.

858
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,060
You just say whatever you want

859
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:26,060
and do whatever you want,

860
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,300
without caring about others' feelings.

861
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,300
But you're free.

862
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,610
That's I want to be friends with you.

863
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,770
I want to have the same dream as you.

864
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,800
I want to be on the same path as you.

865
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,240
I've thought about it these days.

866
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,140
If you insist,

867
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,960
I'll go on with you.

868
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,720
You and I

869
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,460
are not only partners

870
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,840
but also...

871
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,430
I think...

872
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:14,930
Well…

873
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,850
I think

874
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,750
I can change a little, too.

875
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,810
I think I can

876
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:21,930
find a way to coexist.

877
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,460
I can also make an e-magazine.

878
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,210
Yeah.

879
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,700
Really?

880
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,730
Yes.

881
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:28,630
We are...

882
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,340
All right.

883
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,820
Don't say it. I know.

884
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:34,930
How about

885
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,390
opening a bottle of wine?

886
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:38,270
Now?

887
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,510
Yeah.

888
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,890
We just made a passionate confession.

889
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,720
Isn't tea a bummer?

890
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:44,770
Then what?

891
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,780
Should we drink distilled spirit

892
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,290
and make you finish a glass of spirit for me?

893
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:47,730
No.

894
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,970
Are you trying to kill me?

895
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:52,030
I am today.

896
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,260
Wait for me to get it.

897
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:55,890
Don't run.

898
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,700
Hurry up.
