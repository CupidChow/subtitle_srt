00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,470
But when I'm sad,

192
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,670
I'll look for Ye Han.

193
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,150
He has a magical power.

194
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,160
[Jun'anli]

195
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,860
Miss, your coffee to go.

196
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,730
Thank you.

197
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,360
By the way,

198
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,620
where is Ye Han?

199
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,400
Why haven't I seen him lately?

200
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,480
Ye Han went back to Shanghai.

201
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,810
He said he had something urgent.

202
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,940
I don't understand.

203
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,910
Could it

204
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,660
really be because of me?

205
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,440
Ye Han.

206
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,220
Why are you here?

207
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,260
Aren't you going to stay there
for a few more days?

208
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,430
I heard about it,

209
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,280
so I came here immediately.

210
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,220
Your mom was in poor health before, right?

211
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,550
She had stomach cancer.

212
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,390
She'd been in the hospital
for over three months.

213
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,850
At that time, she was already in poor health.

214
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,380
Fortunately,

215
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,520
she hung on until I won the award.

216
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,840
Luckily,

217
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,360
in the end, she saw

218
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,670
how great her son was.

219
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
If my mother could be alive,

220
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,890
I would rather not have any awards.

221
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,910
My condolences.

222
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,930
Thank you, Ye Han,

223
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,630
for coming to the funeral.

224
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,150
Of course.

225
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,540
Hello?

226
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,910
Okay, it's in my suitcase.

227
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,800
I'll find it for you immediately.

228
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,400
Hold on.

229
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,810
[Don't hesitate]

230
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,260
Didn't you go back to Shanghai?

231
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,900
I came back.

232
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,420
Why?

233
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,650
I'm afraid you'll misunderstand

234
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,050
that I went back to Shanghai because of you.

235
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,060
Can I go in?

236
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,650
The things before…

237
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,500
I'm sorry.

238
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,210
I went too far.

239
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,230
When I was at the wishing tree,

240
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,890
I...

241
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,940
About that,

242
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,250
do you need me to apologize to you?

243
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,100
If I don't apologize to you,

244
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,680
will you ignore me?

245
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,570
I just don't want our relationship

246
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,460
to be affected by these things.

247
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,100
I don't want things to become awkward between us.

248
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,830
I'm not afraid of awkwardness.

249
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,130
I just want us

250
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,800
to be a little more awkward.

251
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,640
That's why I kissed you.

252
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,900
I mean,

253
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,950
don't pretend

254
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,670
nothing happened.

255
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,840
I don't want the thing
that I mustered the courage to do

256
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,170
to become meaningless.

257
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,630
Because I don't want to

258
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,870
go back to the way we used to be.

259
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,590
I don't want

260
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,630
to be so-called "friends" with you.

261
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,090
If this way I'll lose you,

262
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,030
then just let it be.

263
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,620
If you're afraid of losing me,

264
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,340
think about it.

265
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,330
-I…
-Don't rush to answer.

266
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,420
I'll give you time.

267
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,940
Have you made up your mind?

268
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,840
It's only been ten seconds.

269
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,190
In ten seconds,

270
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,670
Bolt can run 100 meters

271
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,160
and win the gold medal.

272
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,370
My brain cells are running fast enough.

273
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,750
Judging from your reaction,

274
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,830
I still have a chance.

275
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,440
Didn't I mean to ask you to leave?

276
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,940
All right.

277
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,170
I'm confused.

278
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,480
Okay.

279
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,110
Take your time.

280
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,510
I'll wait for your answer.

281
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,030
Did you come back from Shanghai because of me?

282
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,540
Actually, since one month before Christmas,

283
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,370
I've received more than 30 invitations.

284
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,960
They're from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou…

285
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,280
Everywhere.

286
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,250
But now I'm here.

287
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
I'm here for only one reason.

288
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,510
I'm here for you.

289
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,520
It's not only true for yesterday,

290
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,560
but also true for today.

291
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,410
Sleep early.

292
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,570
[Don't hesitate]

293
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,950
[Dump three men!]

294
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,970
Dump three men?

295
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,110
Hello.

296
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,440
Have you made up your mind?

297
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,180
It's only been two hours.

298
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,020
In two hours,

299
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,660
the earth can rotate 30 degrees.

300
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,970
In terms of distance,

301
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,350
we can travel 3,333 kilometers.

302
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,590
It's enough to travel
from Shanghai to Singapore.

303
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,590
Two hours have passed. It's been so long.

304
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,250
What were you doing
if you still haven't figured it out?

305
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,140
I...

306
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,330
I just took a shower.

307
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,010
I'm applying cleaning toner.

308
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,560
Yes.

309
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,400
It's important to moisturize your skin.

310
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,750
Especially in the premise

311
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,660
that you want to dump three men,

312
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,200
moisturization is really important.

313
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,400
What did you say?

314
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,480
Nothing.

315
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,970
How did you know?

316
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,950
What do you mean?

317
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,860
Make it clear.

318
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,760
Go on with your toner.

319
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,600
Bye.

320
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,490
Hello?

321
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,710
Why didn't he make it clear?

322
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,350
How could he know?

323
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,490
Why am I nervous?

324
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,370
Why would I be nervous?

325
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,270
Ye Han?

326
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,390
What are you doing here?

327
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,850
Have you made up your mind?

328
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,620
Where are you going?

329
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,400
Where are you going?

330
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,250
Why are you ignoring me?

331
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,380
You're in your thirties.

332
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,130
Can you stop being so childish?

333
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,930
Thank you for the background music.

334
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,120
I don't need it.

335
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,170
You can leave,

336
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,740
but you have to leave the answer.

337
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,380
It's been 12 hours.

338
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,670
Have you made up your mind?

339
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,040
Don't I need to sleep?

340
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,200
You can find the answer when you sleep.

341
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,190
Look.

342
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,800
Newton took a nap under the apple tree

343
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,760
and found the law of universal gravitation.

344
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,390
Paul McCartney

345
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,570
dreamed of a melody

346
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,110
and wrote a song.

347
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,510
What should I do?

348
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,960
When I was sleeping, my head was empty

349
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,890
and I didn't think about anything.

350
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,740
I'm leaving. Don't follow me.

351
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,790
Bye-bye.

352
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,680
You caught up with me so soon.

353
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,060
What are you doing?

354
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,940
Well,

355
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,730
I adopted a cool pose,

356
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,590
waiting for you to see me.

357
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,430
But you came much faster than I thought.

358
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,760
Aren't you tired of being so stiff?

359
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,570
A little.

360
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,270
Then why didn't you

361
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,190
come to me first?

362
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,750
I just want to see you

363
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,290
walking towards me.

364
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,430
And it wasn't in vain.

365
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,580
My wish came true.

366
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,690
This is for you.

367
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,160
Thank you for finding the suitcase for me.

368
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,950
What is this?

369
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,260
This is made of the red wool.

370
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,180
Why was the red wool in your place?

371
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,550
That's not your business.

372
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,680
This is called

373
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,260
Worry Doll.

374
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,370
Worry Doll?

375
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,960
It's a doll that helps you relieve your worries.

376
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,600
The Mayans give it

377
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,360
to children who are worried and insomniac

378
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,570
to help them get rid of their worries,

379
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,720
and hope they can sleep well.

380
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,330
Do you think I'm still

381
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,300
a child who gets worried?

382
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,090
Of course not.

383
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,630
You're just

384
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,910
a man in his thirties who gets worried.

385
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,400
I have a 30-year-old woman

386
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,670
who is extremely worried

387
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,180
in front of me.

388
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,710
She wants to dump three men.

389
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,130
She must be so very worried.

390
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,560
I forgot to ask, how did you know about that?

391
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,040
Well...

392
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,690
By chance.

393
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,920
I found out by chance.

394
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,950
You even went specially

395
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,610
to read my wish note?

396
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,100
How boring.

397
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,300
Don't blame me.

398
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,280
I just want to help you realize your wish.

399
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,790
But I regret it.

400
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,100
I thought I could really help you.

401
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,350
How should I put it?

402
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,390
Actually,

403
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,970
I don't have to dump three men.

404
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,020
I just think I'm inexperienced in love.

405
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,360
I always feel

406
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,640
something is missing.

407
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,780
So I'll start with dumping three men

408
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,730
as a small goal.

409
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,380
It could be more than three.

410
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,170
Li Xiaoxiao,

411
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,050
how amazing you are.

412
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,300
Of course,

413
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,050
it's a little difficult even for me.

414
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,240
[Zeus Hotel]

415
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,610
I know I'm not mature enough,

416
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,370
but can we meet?

417
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,460
About my mom,

418
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
I want to apologize to you formally.

419
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,400
No problem.

420
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,470
That apartment will do.

421
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,790
I'm quite satisfied.

422
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,840
Brother.

423
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,760
Why are you here?

424
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,800
Didn't you go to team building?

425
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,020
Do you still remember you have a brother?

426
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,280
Why didn't you tell me you were back?

427
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,660
Come back home with me with your stuff.

428
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,660
I don't want to live with you.

429
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,070
I'm an adult. Why should I live with you?

430
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,170
I just found a small apartment. It's great.

431
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,960
You don't have a job. Why do you rent an apartment?

432
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,950
Listen.

433
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,920
If you don't listen to me, I'll call Mom now

434
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,790
and ask her to suspend your credit card.

435
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,790
Believe it or not.

436
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,050
I won't leave.

437
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,990
How did you know I was here?

438
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:01,000
Did you ask someone to follow me?

439
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,550
Am I crazy? Why would I do that?

440
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,000
Look at your Weibo.

441
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,330
It shows your location.

442
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:09,190
I didn't expect
you pay so much attention to my alt account.

443
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,770
Of course. You are my sister.

444
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,540
Of course I care.

445
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,970
Besides,

446
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,110
you haven't obtained your doctorate,

447
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,390
why are you back?

448
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,360
I don't want to do it anymore.

449
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,380
I want...

450
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,960
I want to do something else.

451
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,160
What do you want to do?

452
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,010
I want to be in a girl group.

453
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,130
I want to be an idol!

454
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,490
Oh my god.

455
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,520
Don't you know you can't sing?

456
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,530
How could you be in a girl group?

457
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,820
I can dance even though I can't sing well.

458
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,840
I've lost 20 kilograms.

459
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,810
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

460
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,430
You didn't even say you missed me.

461
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,390
Do you know how hard it was
for me to lose weight?

462
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,110
Fine.

463
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,670
I miss you. I miss you.

464
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,680
I know it was hard for you to lose weight.

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,580

is Xu Yan back too?

474
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,300
It's none of your business.

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,360
We don't need to worry anymore.

491
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,190
It should be

492
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,230
that this ring heard our prayers

493
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,470
and grew on his hand.

494
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,430
You are

00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,550
not afraid of pain,

496
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,080
instead, you're afraid
you can't pretend to be single anymore.

497
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,520
This is interesting.

498
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,590
Some people

499

try so hard to remove the ring.

Look. Here comes another one

501
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,150
who would rather die than take off the ring.

502
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,040
It's better to be something serious.

503
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,240
I'm tired of seeing you guys these days.

504
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,240
Are you guys really my friends?

505
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,760
You didn't take me when you went to have fun!

Do you know how I've been living these days?

It's fine that you don't take me with you,

511
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,450
but you even posted it on Moments.

512
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,260
You didn't even block Shengyun?

513
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,880
She knows you are in Zhejiang.

514
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,650
I don't even have any excuses to go out.

515
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,920
Isn't this a normal married life?

516
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,600
Besides, activities like an outing

517
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,000
are not suitable for a married man like you.

518
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,470

Think carefully.

00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,720
Don't regret it.

00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,660
I'm not angry anymore.

524
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,090
Is there anything interesting in Zhejiang?

525
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,600
Tell me.

526
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,160
Of course.

00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,190
Ye Han.

528
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,550
Ye Han returned to Shanghai halfway

529
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,670
and flew back to Zhejiang the next day.

530
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,510
What did he

531
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,140
take so much trouble for?

532
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,390
It's for the festival.

533
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,600
What's with the festival?

534
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,130
You should celebrate it with the one you like.

535
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,550
Wait.

536
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,450
I think we were together that night.

537
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,820
Ye Han, are you a pervert?

538
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,360
Luckily, I have the room to myself.

539
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,490
I also think

540
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,750
I'm crazy myself.

541
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,790
Because next,

542
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,910
I plan to do

543
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,580
something crazier.

544
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,240
What are you going to do?

545
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,320
What's going on?

546
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,750
Have you made up your mind?

547
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,940
What are you doing here

548
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,270
so early in the morning?

549
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,720
I'm here

550
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,370
to give you a psychological test.

551
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,960
Here's the topic.

552
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,170
You got lost in a forest.

553
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,600
A kind animal came out

554
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,900
to be your guide.

555
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,860
What would this little animal be?

556
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,870
A, a monkey. B, a kitten. C, a rabbit.

557
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,110
A rabbit.

558
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,790
If you choose the rabbit,

559
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,420
it means you're ready to date.

560
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,210
Go ahead. Don't hesitate.

561
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,210
Then what if I choose...

562
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,500
the kitten?

563
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,300

00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,090
♫At the places where you can't see♫

754
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,000
♫My love keeps increasing♫

755
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,420
♫It accumulated into the most beautiful surprise♫

756
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,540
♫Can you hear me?♫

757
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:51,760
♫The first time I feel that I miss you every night♫

758
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,170
♫Can you see me?♫

759
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,280

Do you think

767
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,480
your feeling for him

768
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,820
♫I'm a little overjoyed♫

769
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,070

♫Because love♫

771
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,040
or

772
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,740
just friendship?

773
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,380
Friendship?

774
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,760
♫My steps slow down♫

775
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,040
♫Because love♫

776
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,680
No.

777

♫Because love♫

778
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,230
What is it then?

779
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,410
♫Is the most beautiful accident♫

780
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,670
Bai.

781
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,700
Our company

782
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,220
cooperates only with short video companies now.

783
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,720
If it weren't for our relationship,

784
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,920
you wouldn't have gotten the chance

785
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,750
for us to work with your magazine.

786
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,480
But you're so talented.

787
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,700
You should turn to make short videos.

788
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,440
I don't think

789
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,790
the print media will disappear so easily.

790
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,510
There are still many people
who like to read magazines

791
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,500
and like the sense of ritual
a magazine brings.

792
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,760
I sincerely advise you

793
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,800
to change your profession.

794
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,810
There's no hope for the print media.

795
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,730
Bai Sha,

796
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,360
can you stand that?

797
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,650
Why are you here?

798
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,580
Some magazines don't sell

799
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,250
because its content

800
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,350
is too boring.

801
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,410
Just like your magazine.

802
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,810
If you don't work with short videos,

803
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,740
you won't be able to sell any at all.

804
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,280
Really?

805
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,160
I heard

806
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,180
your sales have also decreased significantly.

807
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,820
As

808
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,770
the content king, Chief Editor Ye,

809
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,410
I guess you should have a sense of crisis?

810
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,540
Crisis?

811
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,270
When is there no crisis?

812
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,420
When the radio appeared,

813
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,920
when the TV appeared,

814
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,280
when the internet appeared,

815
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,900
and when the social media appeared,

816
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,100
people said it was the biggest crisis for the print media.

817
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,060
But did it disappear?

818
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,150
It's been 300 years.

819
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,200
The magazines have always been there.

820
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,330
Do you know how hard
I work for the magazine?

821
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,850
I get up to work

822
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,140
at 4 a.m every morning.

823
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,800
Some people

824
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,330
have their personal failure

825
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,010
boiled down to

826
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,670
the failure of the industry.

827
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,530
Fine.

828
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,050
I won't argue with you, okay?

829
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,220
You're right.

830
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,780
I'll wait and see how long you can hold on.

831
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,260
See you.

832
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,190
I'm not blaming you.

833
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,810
But are you really working so hard?

834
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,740
Getting up at 4 a.m. every morning?

835
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,390
Do you think I'm crazy?

836
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,280
But I sleep until four o'clock every day.

837
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,450
You're really...

838
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,020
really arrogant.

839
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,650
What are you doing here?

840
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,820
What am I doing here?

841
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,920
I'm not here for you. That's for sure.

842
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,960
I don't have time for you, either.

843
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,110
Mr. Ye,

844
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,230
you're still so handsome.

845
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,300
You too.

846
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,780
You're getting prettier.

847
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:56,480
It's rare to hear you praising anyone.

848
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,260
I'm praising myself too.

849
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,650
Praise myself

850
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,940
that I have sharp eyes.

851
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,090
You haven't changed at all.

852
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,650
But indeed,

853
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,320
if you hadn't scouted me

854
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,040
to be a model in your magazine,

855
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,840
I don't know where I can be now.

856
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,830
But to be honest,

857
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,060
I really liked you back then.

858
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,780
Fortunately, you fell in love with someone else.

859
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,820
I know

860
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,880
you're getting married.

861
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,500
What about you?

862
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
Are you married?

863
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,560
No.

864
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,900
So,

865
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:26,130
you broke up with Song Jinran?

866
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,280
For how long?

867
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:33,670
For a long time.

868
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,600
About seven or eight years.

869
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,740
Can I ask about the reason?

870
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,850
Good question.

871
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,960
Because I want to know it too.

872
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,270
Why do I feel

873
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,690
that you still hate her?

874
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,640
Yes.

875
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,130
I still hate her

876
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,650
and resent her.

877
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,800
There's always a sign for parting.

878
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,750
It's sad to realize the sign.

879
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,890
But when you really face the breakup,

880
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,320
the sign will be your airbag.

881
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,600
The name of the airbag may be...

882
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,580
"I knew it."

883
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,420
But I can't be sure

884
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,160
all partings have signs.

885
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,740
Sometimes when we walk
in the street in the rain,

886
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,930
a car suddenly passes by
and splashes water all over us.

887
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,380
Sometimes when we play games,

888
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,380
the game console suddenly crashes.

889
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,940
These partings without any signs

890
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,710
are a kind of violence.

891
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,220
What we first feel

892
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,760
is pain and anger,

893
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,730
instead of sadness and frustration.

894
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,390
That's how

895
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,880
I put myself aside.

896
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,690
I've been fighting

897
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,680
with deep resentment and despair.

898
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,340
One day, I suddenly asked myself,

899
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,160
"Is this really a parting?"

900
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,990
Because no one

901
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,190
clearly told me that this was a parting.

902
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,490
So I never got out of it.

903
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,540
Do you think

904
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,630
your feeling for him

905
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,220
is love

906
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,280
or

907
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,690
just friendship?

908
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,930
I don't know.

909
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,750
What is it then?

910
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,370
Well,

911
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,120
the more

912
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,740
♫I'll be heartbroken no matter how careful I am♫

913
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,320
you know about him,

915
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:36,050
♫Maybe you have nothing to say♫

916
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,670
And when I'm with him,

917
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,030
I'm relaxed,

918
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,070
because I can be myself.

919
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,360
Isn't that

920
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,750
love?

921
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:43,830
♫Our love takes a roundabout route♫

922
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:51,880
♫We could only blame that we didn't have time to prepare for it♫

Hello?

924
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,420
I'll be there soon. Don't rush me.

925
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,550
I'll be there soon. Where are you now?

926
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,630
♫If missing is a misunderstanding♫

927
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:59,480
♫The contradictory emotions are also shaky♫

928
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,630
