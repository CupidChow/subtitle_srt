00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,550
work for you.

198
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,150
I didn't poach him.

199
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,680
He came to me himself.

200
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,710
I have no reason to turn him down.

201
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:52,710
I'm leaving.

202
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,780
I'm not done yet.

203
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,030

204
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,720
[IN WORK]

205
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,710
Mr. Ye.

206
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,210
Are you hurt?

207
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,550
Why are you here?

208
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,670
Mr. Ye.

209
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,610
Did you see my True Heart?

210
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:36,970
Are you crazy?

211
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,480
But I saw yours.

212
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,340
Are you okay?

213
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,480
I'm fine.

214
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,350
Who is that man?

215
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,270
I think he's quite aggressive.

216
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,040
He's the project director of His Story.

217
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,840
He poached someone from me before.

218
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,520
That person came back to me.

219
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,370
So, he was annoyed.

220
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,650
Did you stalk me?

221
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,920
No.

222
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,480
I didn't stalk you today.

223
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,330
I just...

224
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,130
I accidentally saw it

225
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,280
on the way bringing my True Heart here.

226
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,480
True Heart?

227
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,530
Finally.

228
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,050
I

229
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,560
thought of many ways.

230
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,350
But

231
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,350
as a PE teacher,

232
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,420
this is the only thing I can do.

233
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,630
This is my True Heart.

234
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,690
Your True Heart is

235
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,560
a letter written by you?

236
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,120
You like the love letter thing.

237
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,750
I didn't write it myself.

238
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,360
Don't open it.

239
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,070
Open it after I leave.

240
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,000
Since you've received

241
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,100
my True Heart,

242
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,470
then

243
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,230
I'm leaving.

244
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,430

245
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,310
Thank you

246
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,230
for today.

247
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,430
That's also my True Heart.

248
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,070

meet you.

252
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,110
And then

253
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,830
I fell in love with you.

254
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,650
We are

255
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,210
so close

256
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,040
but at the same time so far away.

257
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,730
But my True Heart

258
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,680
has always been with you.

259
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,680
Mr. Ye.

260
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,390
Did you see it?

261
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,960
I showed you my True Heart when I cried for you,

262
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,860
when I laughed for you,

263
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,850
when I was worried about you,

264
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,800
and when I suffered for you.

265
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,470
Do you still like me?

266
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,080
But I start to like you now.

267
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,810
These all showed my True Heart.

268
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,340
My True Heart has always been with you.

269
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,770
It never leaves you.

270
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,910
I have to face all this.

271
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,120
Now, I give it to you.

00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,230

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,780
it only belongs to you.

in your articles.

278
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,710

286
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,970
You'd better come.

287
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,460
I've made an appointment with him.

288
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,980
Just think of it as a chance to make friends.

289
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,900
He's a really good man.

290
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,130
OK.

291
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,450
I thought they were all for me.

292

A friend of mine opened a chateau.

293
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,070
These are gifts for him.

294
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,110
No wonder you asked me

295
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,060
where I was so anxiously.

296
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,710
I was wondering if you were going in the same direction with me.

297
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,720
I will definitely drink,

298
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,580
so I can't drive.

299
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,460
Give me a ride.

300
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,750
Where did you go?

301
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,710
Shopping?

302
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,350
That was not shopping.

303
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,830
I was just taking a walk.

304
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,310
Are you going to the chateau

305
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,470
alone?

306
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,860
None of your business.

307
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,110
Go home early and go to bed early.

308
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,190
You always complain about your skin condition.

309
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,230
It's because you sleep too late, you know?

310
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,590
Stop nagging.

311
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,430
You're more and more garrulous.

312
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,290
Wow.

00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,560

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,610
A great name.

316
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,120
Sheng's got something.

317
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,420
He got upgraded every time he divorced.

318
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,150
He started with a milk tea shop.

319
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,520
Now he owns a chateau.

320
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,480
Well, slow and steady.

321
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,850

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,260

00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,230
behind every successful man,

324
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,340
there is a woman

325
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,990
who's willing to sacrifice.

I'm now having an interview at the cafe.

Aren't you tired?

330
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,430
I don't want to attend those boring activities

331
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,520
with Shengyun.

332
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,950
This place is nice.

333
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,840
I want to come here again next week.

334
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,260
I'm going on a business trip next week.

335
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:31,950
Oh, right.

336
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,030
Top up your card then.

337
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,870
Sheng.

338
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,300
It has been a long time.

339
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,950
It has been a long time.

340
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,990
The four of us

341
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,990
brought you some gifts.

342
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,110
You don't need to bring anything.

343
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,830
Thank you.

344
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,280

00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,650
Is my chateau okay?

346
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,670
-It's great.
-It's great.

347
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,710
Come more often.

348
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,430
-Of course.
-Of course.

349
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:50,990
Here.

350
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,430
I prepared some good wine for you.

351
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,460
Have a taste.

352
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,630
Make yourselves at home.

353
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,680
Here.

354
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,270
-It's good.
-These are good.

355
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,010
Here.

356
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,590
Here.

357
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,590
Thank you. Thank you.

358
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,710
You all know that

359
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,160
I had a rough life.

360
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,350
I've divorced four times

361
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,690
although I'm not 40 yet.

362
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,940
Every divorce

363
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,880
broke my heart

364
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,510
into pieces.

365
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,420
But now,

366
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,700
I have these things.

367
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,980
So,

368
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,630
if you lose something, you gain something.

369
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,990
If you gain something, you lose something.

370
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,430
Right?

371
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,110
Yes.

372
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,000
I've learned a lot from your words.

373
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,230
Not at all.

374
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:27,830
That's why

375
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,870
we can't learn from you.

376
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,190
Come on, cheers.

377
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,110
Cheers.

378
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,550
Ms. Guo.

379
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,720
You're here.

380
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,720
Do you not see the Yellow River come from the sky?

Rushing into the sea...

382
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,930
Yun is here.

383
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,110
Mr. Lu.

384
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,990
It has been a while.

385
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,010
Are you all good?

386
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,030
You three brought him here?

387
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,470

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,020
Sure.

I don't know him. I'm sorry.

402
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,570
I like that movie too.

403
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,560
And I watched it many times.

404
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,480
When I was younger,

405
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,420
I didn't understand why

406
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,500
they couldn't be together in the end.

407
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,839

I understand it.

00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,630
Actually, I can understand

410
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,560
what the director wants to convey.

411
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,470

Should people lie to their spouses?

00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:01,720
I...

491
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,310
You didn't do anything.

Honey,

494
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,070
I'm nervous

495
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,870

496
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,120
I shouldn't have lied to you.

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,190
You're right.

The most important thing between a couple

499
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,000
is honesty and sincerity.

500
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,530
How can we lie to each other?

501
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,370
Besides, judging from what happened today,

502
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,630
I should spend less time playing around.

503
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,310
Other than running the cafe well,

504
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,860
I should spend more time

505
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,130
with you.

506
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,170
Honey, I've made up my mind.

507
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,680
I'll work hard

508
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,830
and make money.

OK?

513
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,710
If I fail to do so,

514
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,640
I don't deserve to be your husband.

515
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,040

520
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,110

Hello?

532
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,550
Say something.

533
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,810
It's only been a day.

534
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,510
Don't I need to sleep?

535

Didn't you say

536
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,120
you can come up with an answer even when you sleep?

537
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,680

538
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,500

540

when he was sleeping.

543
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,360
Well, I'm not like them.

544
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,980
Just like you, my head is empty when I'm asleep.

545

Childish.

546
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,450
Mr. Ye, it's meeting time.

547
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,440
All right.

I'll call you

549
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,480
if I make up my mind.

550
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:40,920
Just wait.

551
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,740
I have a meeting to attend.

552
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,530
Don't hang up.

553
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,130
Hello?

554
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,980
This feels so good!

555
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,590
Ye Han!

556
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,970
How long do you have to think?

557
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:03,950
Guys,

558
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,110
how do you feel

559
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,260
about the contract?

560
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,390
Today?

561
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,200
Yeah.

562
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,470
If not, then why are you here?

563
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,670
OK. I can talk about it after dinner.

564
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,360
After dinner.

565
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,600
You're already here.

566
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,710
We went to play golf

567
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,760
and got stuck in traffic on the way here.

568
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,280
Sorry for being late.

569
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,080
Let me introduce.

570
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,090
This is the famous model,

571
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,130

572

And this is

578
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,200
Xu Jiacheng

579
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,560
from Declaration.

580
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,080
Nice to meet you.

581
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,480
Nice to meet you.

582
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,440
Here.

583
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,070
I'm late.

584
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,620
I'll drink as a punishment.

585
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,940
Shuyang, you are in high spirits today.

586
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,420
How about this? Let's drink together.

587
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,060
Cheers.

588
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:54,950
You guys drink.

589
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,330
Jiacheng.

590
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,090
You are a little bit down today.

591
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,150
Maybe

592
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,090
it's because I have too many things to worry about.

593
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,130
Jiacheng needs to adjust his mood.

594
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,270
Jiacheng,

595
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,900
put the contract thing aside for now.

596
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,690
Don't worry about work.

597
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,080
-Okay?
-Right?

598
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,930
Let's eat first.

599
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,570
Let's eat.

600
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:26,860
Eat this.

601
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,150
Thank you.

602
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,330
Let me tell you.

603
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,630
If you go there again,

604
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,990
take this out.

605
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:36,710
Shuyang,

606
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,590
you are quite close

607
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,560
with Yiwen.

608
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,790
Eat your food.

609
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,430
Why are you shy?

610
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,060
Well...

611
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:46,730
Jiacheng.

612
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,680
We need to

613
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,050
catch up with him.

614
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,640
Yes.

615
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,790
But I...

616
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,010
I have someone I like.

617
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
But

618
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,490
she has been rejecting me.

619
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,570
Really?

620
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,720
Why?

621
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,900
I am also wondering about it.

622
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,270
Why?

623
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,370
What do you think, Miss Tong?

624
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,440
Jiacheng,

625
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,400
It's your own business.

626
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,730
Why do you ask Miss Tong?

627
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,260
Excuse me.

628
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,810
You guys eat first. I'll make a call.

629
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,040
Tong Yiwen.

630
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,620
Are you crazy, Xu Jiacheng?

631
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,760
Yes.

632
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,280
I'm crazy.

633
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,320
I saw you sitting beside

634
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,910
another man.

635
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,110
How can I not be crazy?

636
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,920
Do you like him a lot?

637
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,710
Do you want to be with him?

638
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,210
No matter who I like

639
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:51,950
and who I'm with,

640
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,950
it's my own thing.

641
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,130
None of your business.

642
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,150
Who are you to question me?

643
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,710
Since you've chosen

644
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,710
to start a new life,

645
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,110
then don't interfere with my life anymore.

646
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,270
Go back now.

647
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,150
Don't you have contracts to sign?

648
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,160
Yes.

649
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,670
I do have contracts to negotiate.

650
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,990
But just now,

651
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,250
I messed up three contracts

652
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,010
to stand in front of you.

653
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,780
You're so foolish.

654
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,710
That's right.

655
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,690
I am such a fool.

656
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,620
Only three contracts.

657
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,310
Even if I have 30 contracts

658
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,910
or 300 contracts in front of me,

659
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,310
I will still stand here.

660
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,440
I will still argue with you

661
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,900
face to face

662
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,050
and hurt each other.

663
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,800
But Tong Yiwen,

664
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,150
you know what?

665
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,210
Even so,

666
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,730
I still think I'm lucky today.

667
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,470
Because I saw you again today.

668
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,260
You know what?

669
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,870
That's exactly why

670
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,190
I hate love,

671
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,770
especially love without a happy ending.

672
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,230
♫I'll be heartbroken no matter how careful I am♫

673
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:51,080

I'm fine.

690
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,490
Sorry about today.

691
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,010
It's nothing.

692
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,880
It's just that

693
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,840
what's your relationship

694
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,950
with Jiacheng?

695
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,060
Can you tell me?

696
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:09,390
We broke up because we loved each other so much.

697
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,680
But I still love him very much.

698
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,440
I came back to see him,

699
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,190
but we missed each other again.

700
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,530
I finally mustered up my courage

701
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,010
but the timing was wrong.

702
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,640
And because of this,

703
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,840
I can't pluck up my courage again.

704
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,720
Okay.

705
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,320
I got it.

706
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,770
It's over in the end.

707
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,490
It's not over.

708
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,990
As long as you turn around,

709
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,970
we can start over.

710
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,270

patient 3020.

726

Lu Zheng.

729
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,320
Why are you here?

730
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,010
You can go back to work.

731
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:15,730
Okay.

732
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,030
After the last check-up,

733
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,840
I've been thinking about it.

734
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,590
I want to ask

735
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,240
has the result of the embryo come out?

736
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,120
Not yet.

737
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,360
I'll let you know immediately

738
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,020
if the lab tells me the result.

739
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,640
I have a question.

740
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,030
If

741
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,590
the result is not good,

742
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,260
what are the possible reasons?

743
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,800
There are many reasons.

744
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,240
It's usually caused by the poor quality

745
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,510
of the female's egg or the male's sperm.

746
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,590
Don't be nervous.

747
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,030
The result is not out yet.

748
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,990
Don't worry.

749
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,280
Yes.

750
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,140
Dr. Li.

751
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,120
I'm here

752
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,310
to ask you

753
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,370
to do me a favor.

754
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,880
If the result is bad,

755
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,350
and if...

756
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,480
I mean if

757
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,390
it's because of Shengyun,

758
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,590
I hope that you don't tell her.

759
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,430
Tell me first.

760
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,210
Because I believe you can tell

761
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:08,270
Shengyun is desperate to have a child.

762
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:08,870
If

763
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,300
she knows the problem is on her,

764
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,780
I'm afraid she can't accept it.

765
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,840
So, tell me first

766
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,130
and I'll find another chance

767
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,130
to tell her.

768
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,060
I don't want her

769
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,340
to have too much mental burden

770
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,940
because of this child thing.

771
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,040
Shengyun married the right man.

772
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,270
Let's not assume.

773
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,750
If you succeed,

774
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,080
everyone will be happy.

775
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,140
But I promise you that

776
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,020
I'll call you

777
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:34,870
if I get the result.

778
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,470
Okay?

779
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,290
Thank you, Dr. Li. Thank you.

780
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,360
Thank you. I'll leave you be then.

781
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:44,770
[Ultrasonic Medicine]

782
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,680
Don't worry.

783
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,630
-Hello, Ms. Guo.
-Hello.

784
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:51,880
Please wait a moment.

785
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,210
I'll arrange it for you.

786
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:53,970
Okay.

787
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,230
Mom.

788
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,850
Did you behave yourself when you were home with Dad?

789
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,740
Yes.

790
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,880
Did you?

791
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,330
She kept bothering me because she wanted to pick you up.

792
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,730
And she wants lollipops.

793
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,210
Little glutton.

794
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,990
Then Mom and Dad

795
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,310
take you to buy lollipops now, okay?

796
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:07,990
Okay.

797
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,710
Let's go.

798
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,420
Come on.

799
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,130
Shengyun.

800
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,200
Jialin.

801
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,070
It has been a long time.

802
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,290
You've lost weight.

803
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,350
Right?

804
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,120
Many men are chasing after me.

805
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,320
It's good to be young.

806
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,090
Enjoy your youth.

807
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,920
Don't regret it when you get old.

808
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,590
But compared to two-timing,

809
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,920
I prefer being committed to one person.

810
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,810
You still like Xu Yan?

811
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,680
What do you mean?

812
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,600
I've only liked him

813
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,900
for ten years.

814
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,160
I thought your first love was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.

815
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,590
I didn't expect you to be so serious.

816
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,910
Of course.

817
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,670
I wish I could marry him in the future.

818
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,540
What? You don't think we can get married?

819
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,920
This is your personal matter.

820
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,400
I have no stance on this.

821
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,460
They say love is caused by hormonal changes

822
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,270
and it can't last more than three years.

823
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,159
However,

824
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,900
I still believe in love.

825
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,489
If love can only last

826
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,340
three years,

827
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,969
I don't think what I feel for him now is love.

828
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,580
It's faith.

829
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,210
If you need my help,

830
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,650
just let me know.

831
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,420
OK.

832
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,580
Ms. Guo, I've arranged it for you.

833
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,960
Okay, thank you.

834
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,350
Ms. Guo?

835
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,540
So fancy.

836
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,690
Don't you know I have a lot of houses?

837
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,620
Your career is booming.

838
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,440
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

839
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,409
Ms. Guo,

840
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,699
I'd appreciate your help in the new year.

841
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,580
Stop it.

842
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,480
I'll pay this lady's bill today.

843
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,250
Let's go.

844
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:45,900
Let's go.

845
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:50,800
Come on, everyone.

846
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,780
Cheers.

847
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,770
Xu Yan.

848
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,320
Dong Hao.

849
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,460
It has been a long time, bro.

850
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,060
Yeah, it has been a long time.

851
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,630
This is my classmate from law school.

852
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,060
This is my colleague at the law firm.

853
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,030
Nice to meet you.

854
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,870
Are you back from abroad?

855
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,990
No, I immigrated long ago.

856
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,870
I came back to visit my family this time.

857
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,520
I haven't heard any of your news since you went abroad.

858
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,910
It's my fault.

859
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,250
It indeed has been a long time.

860
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,350
I remember the last time we met

861
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,890
was at your wedding.

862
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,370
It's been years.

863
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,620
By the way, how is Zheng Jie?

864
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,830
Next time, we must invite your wife

865
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,330
to meet with us.

866
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,430
Your phone number hasn't changed, right?

867
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,470
Yeah, still the old one.

868
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,170
Dong Hao, come here.

869
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,970
Okay, I have something to do over there.

870
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,100
I'll call you.

871
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:41,610
Okay.

872
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,320
-Bye.
-Bye.

873
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,460
Keep drinking.

874
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,280
Come on. Drink.

875
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:54,910
Here.

876
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,230
Are you okay?

877
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,110
Eat.

878
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,960
Don't drink so fast.

879
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,430
You'll get drunk easily.

880
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,270
Right.

881
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,840
I did drink too fast.

882
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,710
I'm leaving.

883
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,360
Mr. Xu.

884
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,710
Mr. Xu, are you alright?

885
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,570
Do you need a ride?

886
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,450
It's okay.

887
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,520
Let me drive you home.

888
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,250
No need.

889
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,040
You guys keep drinking.

890
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,010
Remember to write the receipt.

891
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,290
I'll cover the expenses.

892
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:56,880
Okay.

893
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,260
Bye.

894
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,820
Be careful on your way home.

895
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,140
Let's continue.

896
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,750
I have a feeling

897
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,170
that I'm looking for

898
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,220
something I lost.

899
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,570
I have no time

900
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,200
and no direction.

901
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,570
But I'm looking for it.

902
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,410
I understand.

903
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,280
Until I met you,

904
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:33,870
I realized

905
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,890
I found it.

906
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,110
So cheesy.

907
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,530
I've refrained myself from saying cheesier things.

908
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,740
I also understand one thing.

909
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,920
What?

910
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,010
We have many problems

911
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,100
that can't be solved for now.

912
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,940
But as you said,

913
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,280
as long as we are together,

914
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,020
no matter what happens in the future,

915
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,030
the most important thing is to enjoy this moment.

916
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,160
Right?

917
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,260
That's why I like love love.

918
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,040

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,650
I'm sorry.

955
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,800
♫On the snowy streets♫

956
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,200
I don't want to move.

957
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,840
♫I'm wandering alone again♫

958
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,110
♫If we can meet♫

959
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,390
But I want to move.

960
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,760
♫And change our destiny♫

961
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,670
Why am I so bad?

962
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:41,680
♫I'll go far away with you♫

963
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:47,590
♫In the future I've been dreaming of♫

964
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,090
I don't want to forget you.

965
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,520
But I want to forget you.

966
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:54,370
♫Love is like a lost ark♫

967
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,360
I'm sorry.

968
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,640
♫Where is the entrance to dreams♫

969
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:05,000
♫I don't know what to do♫

970
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,910
♫I'll be with you♫

971
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,700
♫I'll see this through♫

972
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:19,310
♫Let's greet with a smile♫

973
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,270
Xu Yan.

974
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,220
♫At every intersection♫

975
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,030
Are you here?

976
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:28,200
♫I'll be with you♫

977
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,960
Xu Yan.
