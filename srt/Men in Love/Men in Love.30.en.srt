What are you doing?

193
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,610
I just got home.

194
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,510
I just met a client.

195
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,320
I'm going back to the magazine.

Have you eaten?

197
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,470
I was thinking about eating steamed buns,

198
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,170
and I was wondering which restaurant to go to.

199
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,760
I suddenly wanted to hear your voice,

200
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,090
then I forgot to eat.

201
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,720
Now,

202
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,160
you heard my voice.

203
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,930
Go eat steamed buns.

204
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,350
But after hearing your voice,

205
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,690
I want to see you now.

206
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,990
How about

207
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,760

210
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,400
Okay.

211
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,200
I'll continue to work for you.

212
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,190
Don't forget to eat dinner.

213
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,740
Okay.

214
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,930
Ye Han.

215
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,510
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,140
I came here to see you so suddenly.

217
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,710
What do you want?

218

I want to formally apologize to you.

219
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,710
Do you know what you're doing?

220
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,150
You not only hurt me,

221
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,870
but also my girlfriend.

222
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,490
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,730
I didn't know your girlfriend was here.

224
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,660

why Song Jinran suddenly disappeared?

274

He doesn't know about it.

I don't think it's that simple.

Was she still that pretty?

279
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,790
She looked young

280
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,050

Being cute can never beat someone being proud.

295

If a proud person shows a little vulnerability,

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,630
people will care for her so much.

382
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,970
let me tell you something.

383
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,550
Song Jinran came to me.

384
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,020
You told her my address.

385
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,760
Sorry.

386
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,970
It's okay.

387
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,300
It's for my own good.

388
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,870
I understand.

389
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,710
It's not your fault.

390
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,460
Sorry.

391
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,960
Ten seconds left.

392
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,120
Hurry up.

393
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,310
Speed up in the last 5 seconds.

397
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,820
Time's up.

398
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,610
Well.

399
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,320
Overall,

00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,060
everyone has improved.

401
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,260
Keep it up.

402
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,500
We have to face

403
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,980
the coming national tournament at our best.

404
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,950

405
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,810
But what should we do as Zixuan is gone?

406
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,230
You take his place first.

407
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,840
I understand how you feel.

408
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,980
Trust me.

409
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,130
Zixuan will come back.

410
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,270
So we have to work harder.

411
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,980
Nobody can slack off.

412
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,150
Let's wait for Zixuan to come back.

413
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,310
Okay.

There's a new intestine noodle restaurant.

418
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,280
I heard it was very delicious.

I don't want to go.

421
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,780
If you don't eat actively, you have a mental problem.

00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,270
I'm not hungry.

right?

428
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,150

No.

460
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,900
Why do you ask?

461
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,720
Then why didn't you contact me?

462
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,550
I haven't contacted you

463
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,910
since last night.

464

Why aren't you worried at all?

465
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,160
Right.

466
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,400
I did it on purpose.

467
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,150
But why did you do nothing?

468
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,270
I called you last night,

469
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,550
but you didn't answer.

470
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,000
I thought you were asleep.

471
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,710
You have classes this morning,

472
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,670
so I wanted to call you after class.

473
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,830

you didn't contact me on purpose.

477
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,290
Then why didn't you contact me on purpose?

478
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:07,790
Do you want to make me your ex-boyfriend?

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,260
No.

480
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,020
It's just that

481
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,490
your ex-girlfriend suddenly appeared,

482
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,700

484
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,510
I should cut off contact with you
for a few days

485
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,830
so that you would feel threatened.

486
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,780
Unfortunately, the plan failed.

487
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,740
I can imagine

00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,920
that my plans

It must be hard for you.

But this plan doesn't suit you.

493
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,380
Then I'll try

494
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,990
my plan.

495
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,390

Don't think about other women anymore.

00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,900

It's too late.

It's a long trip there and back.

505
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,440
It takes up my entire lunch break.

506
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,060
I don't have time to eat.

507
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,830
It's all your fault.

508
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,190
Can you

509
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,790
give me a chance to make up for my mistake?

510
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,160
I'll drive you there

511
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,620
and buy you some food.

512
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,750
You neither contact me

513
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,760
nor update your Moments.

514
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,230
No sign for me?

515
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,760
My phone is broken?

516
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,810
You always show up

517
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,690
when I suspect my phone is broken.

518
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,720
What?

519
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,640
Are you off work?

520
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,210
I'm home.

521
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,340
Okay.

522
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,470
Make some food for yourself.

523
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,460
I'm not going home.

524
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,990
You're really the poster boy for picking the woman you love over your sister.

525
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,470
Your sister is eating snacks to stay alive,

526
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,870
but you date others every day.

527
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,070
How many days haven't you been home?

528
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,030
What are you talking about?

529
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,990
I'm working.

530
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,310
Being a boss is busy.

531
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,030
All right, I'm hanging up.

532
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,710
You won't understand.

533
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,920
Just stay at home.

534
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,490
Mind your own business.

535
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,270
You want me to stay at home?

536
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,840
I won’t.

00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,330

00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,520
A love blogger's column.

542
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,750
I paid for it.

543
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,190
No matter how much you spend,

544
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:57,290
love skills can't be improved

545
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,250
through theoretical knowledge.

546
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,880
You and Ke Xiaodong have been pretty close recently.

547
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,190
What's going on between you two?

548
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,000
Nothing happened.

549
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,200
We're just friends.

550
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,730
But don't tell Xu Yan.

551
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,160
Ke Xiaodong and I are pretending to be a couple
in front of him.

552
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,160
You are playing this?

553
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,360
Nice.

554
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,100
I don't think you need to

555
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,630
pay for the love blogger's column.

556
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,290
You can be a blogger yourself.

557
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,390
But,

558
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,470
aren't you afraid that Xu Yan will be angry?

559
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,080
I wished he would.

560
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,880
I just wanted to make him angry.

561
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,750
But he didn't seem to react at all.

562
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,790
He didn't seem to react,

563
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,620
but it doesn't mean he was not angry.

564
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,430
Xu Yan is

565
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,860
calm.

566
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,710
He won't

567
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,230
show any emotion.

568
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,990
He's not very calm.

569
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,490
So you mean

570
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,870
he was already furious,

571
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,070
but he pretended

572
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,710
to be calm.

573
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,230
Something like that.

574
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,830
I haven't thought of it this way.

575
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,510
You're back.

576
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,740
I'm back.

577
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,310
Look.

578
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,230
Who's here?

579
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,750
Who's here?

580
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,760
Why are you here?

581
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,510
My brother doesn't come home

582
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,950
and dates someone.

583
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,160
As his sister,

584
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,250
I'm alone and lonely.

585
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,470
So I came to see Xiaoxiao.

586
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,470
Who said we were always dating?

587
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,560
We have business to take care of.

588
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,250
You two tell the same story.

589
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,070
But I’m not here to see you.

590
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,270
Xiaoxiao will go out later,

591
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,510
I'll leave too.

592
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,830
Who are you texting?

593
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,230
A friend.

594
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,120
Boyfriend?

595
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,670
What boyfriend?

596
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,170
I don't have a boyfriend.

597
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,810
Li Xiaoxiao, I...

598
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,640
I don't know what to say to you.

599
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,130
You agreed to cut off contact with him
for at least 3 days.

600
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,520
You contacted him. Not even one day.

601
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,800
I missed him.

602
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,120
What should I do?

603
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,850
I kept thinking

604
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,750
about why he didn't text me.

605
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,020
So lame.

606
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,590
I've taught you nothing.

607
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,530
I understand

608
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,950
what you said.

609
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,030
But when it comes to Ye Han,

610
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,710
I can't

611
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,250
control myself.

612
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,430
What happened between you and Ye Han?

613
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,650
Don't ask about it.

614
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,730
I'll go to the restroom.

615
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,020
Don't mess with Tong Yiwen

616
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,220
when I'm away.

617
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,230
You're not on the same level.

618
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:47,990
Get it?

619
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,650
Don't scare her.

620
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,080
I don't eat people.

621
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,810
You don't eat people?

622
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,430
When you introduced a girl

623
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,510
to Xu Yan,

624
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,990
you didn't act like this.

625
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,870
You reminded me.

626
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,750
I remember Xue sent me

627
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,390
a message this morning.

628
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,110
She told me that she had a date with Xu Yan today.

629
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,630
They must be eating candlelight dinner

630
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,470
at this time.

631
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,550
What are you eating?

632
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,470
You...

633
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,980
Where are you now?

634
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:36,990
Mr. Xu.

635
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,950
I'm relieved to hear that.

636
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,830
I don't have any legal knowledge.

637
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,510
I'm afraid of being deceived.

638
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,400
Don't worry.

639
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:47,120
If you have any questions,

640
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,330
just send me.

641
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,560
I'll check it for you.

642
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,070
Thank you so much.

643
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,050
Thanks for

644
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,910
your consulting service and for sending me back.

645
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:56,780
It's okay.

646
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,840
That's on my way.

647
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,969
Excuse me, I need to take this call.

648
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,570
Hello?

649
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,850
Hello, Xu Yan.

650
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,889
I didn't send that message.

651
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,020
It should be Jialin.

652
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,719
Did she go to you?

653
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,730
I see.

654
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:24,699
It's okay.

655
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,969
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

656
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:29,810
Sorry.

657
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:30,840
I have something urgent.

658
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,960
I can't drive you home.

659
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,679
It's okay. I can take a taxi.

660
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,810
I'll let you go.

661
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,480
Okay.

662
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,230

♫We could only blame that we didn't have time to prepare for it♫

673

came here

675
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,470

♫I want to say something♫

757
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,950
And...

758
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,060
♫But I just stand there and stare for a long time♫

759
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,460
I'll lose everything,

760
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,220
♫Maybe I don't want to leave♫

761
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,080
include you.

762
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:44,930
♫It still hurts♫

763
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,220
♫Looking back♫

764
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:57,010
♫I feel so much warmth again♫

765
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,370
For me,

766
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,910
I'm afraid of

767
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,510
♫I'll be with you♫

768
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,910
losing you the most.

769
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,860
♫You know it's true♫

770
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,890
♫Memories are endless♫

771
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,670
I really don't know how to leave you.

772
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,430
So please leave me.

773
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,710
♫But why♫

774
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:18,020
♫We've been with each other♫

775
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,220
You got to figure it out.

776
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:22,770
♫But why can't we have each other?♫

777
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,870
♫I'll be with you♫

778
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,140
♫I'll see this through♫

779
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:37,730
♫If we can notice all the considerations♫

780
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,610
♫At the intersection of time♫

781
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,620
♫Let's not lose each other again♫

782
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,230
♫On the snowy streets♫

783
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,350
♫I'm wandering alone again♫

784
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,360
♫If we can meet♫

785
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,990
♫And change our destiny♫

786
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:12,330
♫I'll go far away with you♫

787
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:17,890
♫In the future I've been dreaming of♫

788
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:24,710
♫Love is like a lost ark♫

789
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,180
♫Where is the entrance to dreams♫

790
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,370
♫I don't know what to do♫

791
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,820
♫I'll be with you♫

792
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,170
♫I'll see this through♫

793
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:49,890
♫Let's greet with a smile♫

794
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,440
♫At every intersection♫

795
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:58,630
♫I'll be with you♫
