00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,790
We love to try new things

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,030
and challenge our limits.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,160
Every time we develop a new hobby,

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,860
we will compete

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,310
in a fair way.

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,210
That's comparing our equipment.

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,170
Good.

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,210
How about this?

10
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,410
Looks good.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,620
Isn't this the first prize

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,390
of Battle of Gods?

13
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,880
How do you have it?

14
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,270
Have you heard of

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,890
buying accounts?

16
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,840
It can't increase character attributes.

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,130
It's only good-looking and takes up room in the warehouse.

18
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,050
I didn't expect

19
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,100
someone would actually buy an account for this.

20
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,220
Yes.

21
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,630
This thing

22
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,510

24
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,670
So unwise.

25
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,390
Yeah.

26
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,410
You will never understand

27
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,300
what kind of pleasure it can bring to players like me.

28
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,740
Nice.

29

33
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,190
Yes, you have your equipment.

38
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,600
Isn't your bracelet

39
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,930
the kind that craftsmen

40
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,530
like and cherish?

41
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
The sandalwood bracelet, right?

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,120
Good for you.

43
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,120
Your beeswax bracelet also looks nice.

44
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,210
Come on. Let's swap.

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,729
Yes.

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,280

Be careful.

51

This is...

00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,030
Isn't this

You can't just get these.

62
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,450
They are really hard to find.

Can't you see my watch?

73
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:42,350
It can record heart rate. You can also pay

74
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,160
and chat on this.

75
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,270
You can do everything with it.

Most importantly, mine is green.

77

85
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,180
Don't touch them. They are expensive.

I'm supporting our domestic products.

89

In my opinion,

90
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,790
you are too shallow.

91
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,510
You rely on equipment too much.

is quite reasonable.

114

In fact, the best equipment we have

is the way we think

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,190
There's only one real ring.

197
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,610
I hope I only have one husband in my life.

198
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,830
The only magazine with typos

199
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,180
is in the hands of the reader, Li Xiaoxiao.

200
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
For the Declaration,

201
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,240
she is special.

202
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,230
She knows how to make herself

203
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,140
eye-catching

204
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,910
in a page smaller than one quarter.

205
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,700
Although she hasn't realized it yet,

206
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,120
it's not because she wore beautiful clothes

207
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,890
and exquisite makeup.

208
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,540
Thanks to her,

209
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,090
as the publisher,

210
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,620
we managed to maintain the completeness of the Declaration

211
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,810
and publish the 10th New Year's edition of the Declaration.

212
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,780
The first luck to welcome the new year

213
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,080
is our reader, Li Xiaoxiao.

214
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,340
Is it good?

215
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,410
Not bad.

216
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,490
Not bad?

217
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,650
I specially wrote this

218
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,380
as a surprise for you.

219
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,580
It's just a regular article.

220
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,300
Why did you, the Editor-in-Chief, write it yourself?

221
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,080
For a qualified Editor-in-Chief,

222
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,320
every article is important.

223
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,090
Moreover, it's about you.

224
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,330
Thank you.

225
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,760
You described me in a too good way.

226
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,870
What?

227
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,390
Should I write something bad about you?

228
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,190
Like kissing me when I'm drunk?

229
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,220
Stop.

230
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,090
Stop talking about your neck.

231
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,170
If I drink again,

232
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,790
I'll be your granddaughter.

233
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,910
Speaking of which,

234
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,090
I've prepared a gift

235
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,400
for my granddaughter.

236
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,560
What is it?

237
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,830
It looks like a gift

238
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,640
for a star.

239
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,290
Yes.

240
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,920
This is an excuse I prepared

241
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,150
to see you.

242
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,480
I hope you are satisfied with it.

243
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,480
Have some water.

244
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,870
I didn't expect

245
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,620
you are collecting our magazines.

246
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,440
Yes.

247
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,920
I bought them one by one.

248
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,530
And

249
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,620
I want to collect every issue.

250
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,470
I didn't miss even one issue in the past two years.

251
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,540
But I don't have any copies earlier than that.

252
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,400
I guess it's because of Jiacheng.

253
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,560
Are you feeling better?

254
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,740
Much better.

255
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,420
But having a secret crush on him

256
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,980
has become one of my habits.

257
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,940
I'm also in the Declaration.

258
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,250
Can't you see me?

259
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,610
I seldom read the Editor-in-Chief's comments.

260
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,840
I don't think many people

261
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,840
would read those long articles.

262
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,370
But maybe you do.

263
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,300
I suddenly feel

264
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,270
I've become a very special person.

265
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,340
You are special,

266
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,810
especially after drinking,

267
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,370
and you especially like to kiss others.

268
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,910
Let's not talk about it.

269
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,050
You gave me such a special gift.

270
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,580
Stay for dinner.

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,330
Let me return the favor.

272
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,550
I'd better go back.

273
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,980
I'm not confident

274
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,360
in your cooking.

275
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,970
How do you know if you haven't tried it?

276
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,400
I'm good at cooking.

277
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,390
What are you doing?

278
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,110
I think Yiwen is back.

279
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,040
I'm back.

280
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,590
It's fine.

281
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,590
I'll go say hello.

282
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,440
No.

283
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,980
She will misunderstand.

284
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,350
Xiaoxiao.

285
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,020
I'm here.

286
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,870
I'm going to take a shower.

287
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,190
Let's begin.

288
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,840
Didn't you say you want to take a shower?

289
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,120
Shut up.

290
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,560
Anyway,

291
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,160
my shoes are out there.

292
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,110
Keep your voice down.

293
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,070
I'll leave now.

294
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,230
I won't disturb you.

295
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,330
What did you say?

296
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,910
Remember to hide his shoes next time.

297
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,070
Those are my shoes.

298
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,990
Then your shoes are quite big.

299
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,460
I have an appointment. I have to go.

300
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,710
In 2007,

301
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,370
the 20-year-old Tong Yiwen

302
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,230
first attended Paris Fashion Week

303
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,510
and took part in 13 shows.

304
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,520
[Tong Yiwen, the star of fashion show]

305
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,870
In 2009,

306
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,320
she was ranked eighth globally

307
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,640
as she participated in 40 shows that year.

308
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,900
In 2010,

309
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,920
Tong Yiwen rose to fourth place.

310
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,990
Unfortunately,

311
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,680
she left the stage after getting hurt in 2018

312
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,830
and slowly stepped out of the circle of the fashion show.

313
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,230
This weekend,

314
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,460
I'm going to play golf with those British men.

315
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,380
Come if you have time.

316
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,950
Let's get to know each other.

317
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,750
Yiwen, can you play golf?

318
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,970
You have such a good figure.

319
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,910
I'm sure you are good at sports, right?

320
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,970
I did know how to play.

321
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,720
But most men don't dare to play with me.

322
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,030
So, I don't have the chance to show off.

323
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,430
Then I'll learn from you.

324
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,870
Can you be my coach?

325
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:26,900
No.

326
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,700
You're already here.

327
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,450
Stop pretending to be aloof.

328
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,600
In such a situation,

329
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,040
do you still think you're a world-renowned model?

330
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,150
Are you kidding me?

331
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,210
Say it again.

332
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,710
What's wrong with that?

333
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,910
Am I wrong?

334
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,140
Apologize.

335
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,560
Apologize?

336
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,450
Yes.

337
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,350
Didn't you hear her? Apologize.

338
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,310
Jiacheng.

339
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,230
Jiacheng.

340
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,650
What are you doing?

341
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,180
Apologize.

342
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,050
Jiacheng.

343
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,270
What are you doing?

344
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,030
I'll say it one last time.

345
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,200
♫I'll be heartbroken no matter how careful I am♫

346
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,290
Apologize.

347
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:05,290
♫Maybe you have nothing to say♫

348
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,070
I'm sorry.

349
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,720
Don't let me see you here again.

00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:13,270
♫Our love takes a roundabout route♫

351
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,110
How do you know them?

352
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,230
What about you?

353
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,190
Why were you drinking with them?

354
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:21,160
♫We could only blame that we didn't have time to prepare for it♫

355
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,710
I was on a blind date.

356
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,590
I told you that.

357
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,950
Those people?

358
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,230
Then why are you here?

359
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,190
I've told you

360
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,220
♫If missing is a misunderstanding♫

361
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,120
I'm the person you're looking for.

♫The contradictory emotions are also shaky♫

363
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,310
But you don't trust me.

♫The traffic lights are like tears♫

365

♫Twinkling in my heart♫

♫I just found that you're irreplaceable♫

379
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,390
Because I can't be with the person

who knows the ugliest side of me.

381
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,859
I have no secrets in front of you.

382
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,250
♫How can I love like the way you do?♫

383
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,680
But thank you for helping me today.

384
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,670
Let's never meet again.

385
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,760
I mean it.

386
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,010
You're back.

387
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,310
It's so cold.

388
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,860
What are you doing outside?

389
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,990
Why didn't you tell me?

390
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,660
What?

391
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,320
Xu Jiacheng.

392
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,080
His family runs a hotel.

393
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,620
Hotel?

394
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,980
What hotel?

395
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,520
Zeus Hotel.

396
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,110
Really?

397
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,090
He hid it so well.

398
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,600
I really don't know.

399
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,590
I've never been so humiliated in my life.

400
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,530
I'm so embarrassed.

401
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,380
What happened?

402
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,610
Tell me about it.

403
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,860
Why did I go there?

404
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,150
All right.

405
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,070
Don't be upset.

406
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,290
Why are you alone today?

407
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,490
I was dumped.

408
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,000
Then this is on me.

409
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,410
This is especially suitable for a heartbroken man.

410
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,260
Then one cup is not enough.

411
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,420
This is my second time being dumped

412
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,130
by the same person.

413
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,270
Then you should drink more.

414
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,030
I don't understand.

415
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,990
What's wrong with me?

416
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,810
Maybe it's not your fault.

417
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,250
Some women

418
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,000
love themselves more than men do.

419
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,230
Maybe

420
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,470
your girl is the kind who regards

421
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,670
her pride as higher than anything else.

422
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,720
That's true.

423
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,790
Thank you.

424
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,880
Hello?

425
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,360
I sent you the draft through email.

426
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,560
Remember to check it.

427
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,350
You're not home?

428
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,080
I'm drinking. Are you coming?

429
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,380
Why would I drink?

430
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,090
Did you do it on purpose?

431
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,490
Because you don't want to show up together with me tomorrow.

432
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,090
Forget it. I'm hanging up.

433
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,620
You have something to do tomorrow morning.

434
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,820
Don't drink too much.

435
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,810
Okay.

436
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,550
Bye.

437
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,030
Seriously?

438
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,230
You have to drive such a flamboyant car?

439
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,840
flamboyant?

440
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,560
Yes.

441
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,040
It's a bit too much for you.

442
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,410
But it's perfect for me.

443
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
I want to check in.

444
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,020
You live here?

445
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,180
What?

446
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,530
I can't live here?

447
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,660
You can.

448
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,840
But I don't want to stay in the same hotel with you.

449
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,530
Well,

450
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,420
you can stay in another hotel.

451
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,630
Then you won't meet me.

452
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,630
Why should I?

453
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,900
You don't own the hotel.

454
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,860
Yes.

455
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,470
I don't.

456
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,570
But what can I do?

457
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,960
Jiacheng owns this hotel.

458
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,910
He dragged me here,

459
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,170
wanting me to stay here for several days.

460
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,010
Actually, he's also very worried.

461
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,490
He owns too many things.

462
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,750
Some people just have nothing.

463
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,210
You came here for nothing.

464
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,070
Anyway, award ceremonies like this

465
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,930
already had the results decided.

466
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,460
You knew it?

467
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,940
If you knew the results,

468
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,300
then why are you here?

469
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,740
What do you mean?

470
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,690
They told you that you won an award?

471
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,730
You can guess.

472
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,060
Okay, sir.

473
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,910
No way.

474
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,710
Hello, Xiaoxiao.

475
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,340
Why aren't you here yet?

476
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,590
Don't mention it.

477
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,950
When I opened the suitcase,

478
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,100
I found everything inside is not mine.

479
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,030
I might have taken the wrong suitcase

480
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,380
when getting off the high speed train.

481
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,460
What should we do?

482
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,110
I just called the train station.

483
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,210
They said no one contacted them.

484
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,330
Now,

485
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,870
we can only wait for that person to contact me

486
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,980
when that person finds out about the wrong suitcase.

487
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,340
You need to find it.

488
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,800
Do you need my help?

489
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,170
It's okay.

490
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,450
I'll go down later.

491
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,510
Okay.

492
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,280
Bye.

493
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,070
I can't wear the new dress I bought.

494
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100
Mr. Ye.

495
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,320
We finally meet.

496
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,120
I'm the Editor-in-Chief of Modern Women.

497
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,360
I'm your fan.

498
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,200
I'm also a fan of your magazine.

499
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,180
Your articles are so interesting.

500
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,330
It makes me want to poach your editors.

501
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,300
Thank you.

502
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,600
Our sales are decreasing.

503
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,970
We've been worried.

504
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,230
I'm so glad to

505
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,520
hear your compliments.

506
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,460
But now,

507
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,110
paper media's future is not that bright.

508
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,160
It's a pity.

509
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,470
If you think it's a pity,

510
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,800
come up with solutions.

511
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,000
Magazines are declining.

512
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,550
People nowadays like to watch

513
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,810
short videos on their phones.

514
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:12,750
No matter how good your long articles are, no one will read them.

515
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,020
Advertising income comes first.

516
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,480
Good content comes first.

517
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,240
But you won't understand it since you've never written anything.

518
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,480
Good content

519
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,040
always attracts people

520
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,340
no matter if it's on the screen or on paper.

521
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,270
That's why

522
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,400
you can't be the first in the industry.

523
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,600
If the first in the industry has to be like you,

524
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,560
I'd rather give up the first place.

525
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,400
Welcome to

526
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,650
the award ceremony

527
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,860
of the 21st Publishing Culture Awards.

528
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,470
Here,

529
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,670
on behalf of the organizer of this event,

530
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,390
I would like to express heartfelt gratitude

531
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,150
and sincere welcome

532
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,990
to every guest here tonight.

533
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,300
The winner of the fashion unit

534
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,000
of the 21st Publishing Cultural Award

535
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,600
is He Says.

536
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,820
Congratulations.

537
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,120
I told you.

538
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,270
It's useless for you to come here.

539
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,080
It's okay.

540
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,700
I'll kindly accept the award since you don't want to be the first.

541
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,650
Any news about your luggage?

542
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,590
I guess there will be progress soon.

543
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,450
I left my phone number.

544
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,960
Nothing expensive in your suitcase, right?

545
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
Luckily,

546
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,730
I didn't bring my diamonds this time.

547
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,170
Otherwise, I would be in trouble.

548
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,980
That's a relief.

549
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,020
What are you talking about so happily?

550
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,280
We're talking behind your back.

551
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,120
You can't even shut up when you drink,

552
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
right, Xiaoxiao?

553
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,320
The skewers are ready. Hurry up.

554
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,630
Don't you have a stereo?

555
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,990
Play some music.

556
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,040
I... I'll get it.

557
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,310
I'll get it.

558
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,830
Give me the room card.

559
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,750
I'll be back soon.

560
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,330
I'm coming in.

561
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,520
Where is it?

562
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,940
I saw it.

563
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,120
Okay, I'll look for it.

564
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,680
Bye.

565
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,640
Where is Ye Han?

566
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:21,360
I haven't seen him all day.

567
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,860
Are you talking about me?

568
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,000
You scared me.

569
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,190
The Ye Han you mentioned

570
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,350
is me, right?

571
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,680
Can you be more decent?

572
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,000
Why are you here?

573
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,410
I haven't asked you.

574
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,300
What are you doing here secretly?

575
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,070
Can you fasten your bathrobe first?

576
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,760
I'm really wearing my clothes inside.

577
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,640
Look.

578
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,230
You haven't explained it to me.

579
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,290
Why did you speak ill of me behind my back?

580
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,950
Who said bad things about you?

581
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,280
Did you hear it wrong?

582
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,780
I was praising you.

583
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,930
I said you were cute.

584
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,730
Cute has never been my style.

585
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,960
They are waiting for me.

586
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,640
Who is it?

587
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,410
Why are you here?

588
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,760
I just want to ask

589
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,120
what you're doing tomorrow.

590
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,860
I haven't decided yet. Nothing for now.

591
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,830
I see.

592
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,470
Aren't we on vacation?

593
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,890
Jiacheng and Xu Yan told me

594
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,280
they wanted to stay in the hotel tomorrow.

595
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,820
They are too lazy.

596
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,430
And I rented a car.

597
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,790
So I want to ask you

598
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,130
if you want to hang out with me.

599
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,730
Sure.

600
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,670
Well,

601
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,830
let's go somewhere to eat first tomorrow.

602
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,250
There's one restaurant where I really want to go.

603
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,690
You just said...

604
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,310
first.

605
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,340
So there's somewhere you want to go later?

606
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,510
You'll know tomorrow.

607
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,320
See you tomorrow.

608
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,460
See you tomorrow.

609
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,270
-Good night.
-Good night.

610
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,060
Are you really not going to eat anything?

611
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,360
You said you wanted to go to a restaurant.

612
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,750
I didn't expect it to be a street stall.

613
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,050
This is not an ordinary street stall.

614
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,410
This food truck is very famous.

615
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,570
It has no fixed open time.

616
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,630
They only sell 50 portions a day.

617
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,940
Only 50.

618
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,770
We're lucky

619
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,300
to be able to get the chance.

620
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,440
Seriously?

621
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,080
It's just fried instant noodles.

622
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,480
Don't underestimate this bowl of noodles.

623
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,440
Simple ingredients are hard to cook.

624
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,830
Look at the noodles.

625
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,070
Stir-fried with hot oil and wrapped in thick sauce.

626
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,000
They are al dente

627
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,910
and fresh out of the pot.

628
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,740
Perfect!

629
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,840
Why didn't I notice

630
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,230
you are so literary?

631
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,210
You're indeed a foodie.

632
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,180
When you talk about food, your vocabulary multiplies.

633
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,240
Try it if you don't believe me.

634
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,430

It's my first time here.

658
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,130
So this is the tea garden.

659
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,350
Why are they picking tea

660
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,760
in this season?

661
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,750
Tea leaves are usually picked in spring.

662
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,360
But some will be picked after Frost's Descent.

663
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,840
After four seasons,

664
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,990
the taste of winter tea will be richer.

665
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,040

It's okay.

670
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,780
I just want to ask you

671
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,160

672
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,810
our tea-picking event.

673
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,030
Only the tea leaves here

674
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,390
haven't been picked.

675
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,260
If you miss the chance, you need to wait until next year.

676

689
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,380
She might fall down.

690
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:21,930
Okay, thank you.

691
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,780
Okay.

692
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,920

694
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,300

What?

696
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,740

00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,990
And now you're like this.

760
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,070
That's why you can't recognize me?

761
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,200
How is that possible?

762
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,190
I recognized you as soon as you came in.

763
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,980
I was just acting.

764
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,690
I'm good at acting, right?

765
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,090
Besides, why would I hire a pretty girl

766
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,290
as a waitress?

767
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,680

Sit down.

00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,730
When will you leave this time?

771
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,860
I'm not leaving.

772
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,450
Have you finished your PhD?

773
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,150
I'm not going to do my PhD anymore.

774
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,780
I can't manage the company just by studying.

775
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,580
I need practical experience.

776
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,860
That makes sense.

777
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,110
So you mean

778
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,330
you want to inherit the family business for your brother?

779
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,430
But it's still a secret.

780
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,980
You can't tell others.

781
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,290
I have my own plan.

Let's talk about coffee later.

790

Where is Xu Yan now?

791
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,300
You just came back. You don't ask about your brother but Xu Yan?

792
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,450
Does Jiacheng know you're back?

793
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,160
Of course not.

794
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,810
I want to live independently

795
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,250
after I come back.

796
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,200

if I still live with my brother?

801

You told me so many secrets.

But I trust Shengyun.

the good news of my successful interview.

Please, I beg you.

Don't tell her.

Why are you telling her this?

813
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,580
Then tell me

Hurry up.

00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,500
It's not a big deal.

Sure.

What's wrong?

Why are you suddenly so quiet?

844
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,420
It reminds me of my childhood.

845
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,380
There is a river like this

846
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,690
in my hometown.

847
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,720
Sometimes when we went home by boat.

848

When the boatman was busy,

849
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,610
my father would row the boat himself.

850
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,760
To let me sit quietly,

851
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,090
my dad would sing me children's songs.

852
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,440
The funny thing is he always sang them wrong.

00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,110

854
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,420
I always listened carefully.

855
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,200
And without realizing it,

856
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,320
we got home.

857
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,530
Now that I think about it,

858
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,950
he did it on purpose.

00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,460

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,720
your father

861
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,720
is a very smart person.

I didn't have many chances to know him better.

00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,800
Let me tell you a secret.

866
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,980
When I was five,

867
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,800
my parents

868
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,300
died in a car accident.

Taking a boat with him

870
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:51,310
is one of the few memories I have between us.

871

your father is not only smart

884
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,670
but also optimistic.

885
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,640
That's why you take after him.
