You're welcome.

Thank you.

Lin Jia.

384
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
Don't mention it.

385
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,150
From now on, wherever Mr. Gu is,

386
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,630
I'll go with you.

387
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,470
With me there,

he won't do anything to you.

389

-I'll go then.
-Let's go.

[Yan Yan Law Firm]

391
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,830
Bye.

392
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,520
Jialin.

393
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,040
What were you thinking?

394
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,350
Nothing.

395
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,220
Nothing.

396
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,800
Don't act rashly.

397
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,410
The priority is to protect Zhou,

398
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,140
instead of getting evidence.

399
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,200
Do you understand?

400
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,120
How did you know what I'm thinking?

401
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,710
I watched you grow up.

402
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,040
I can tell what you're thinking when you turn your eyes.

403
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,080
Don't act rashly.

404
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,830
Understand?

405
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Yes.

What is she up to again?

409
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,680
I might as well hang myself.

410
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,340
It was the ceiling just now.

411
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,360
Are you looking for it on the floor?

412
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,090
I'm punishing myself.

413
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,820
I think you should quit drinking first.

414
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,590
I won't drink anymore.

415
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,230
What are you doing?

416
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,570
I want to change the design

417
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,730
and the draft.

418
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,380
Haven't you not

419
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
apologized to Jiacheng yet?

420
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,290
He didn't come to me.

421
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,620
I guess he doesn't want to contact me anymore.

422
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,680
You've been waiting for so many days.

423
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,380
Why are you so hesitant?

424
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,140
If he doesn't come to you, go to him.

425
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,160
I don't know what to say.

426
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,630
Don't worry.

427
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,730
Jiacheng is a generous man.

428
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,630
He will forgive you immediately

429
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,010
as long as you give him some kind of excuse.

430
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,230
Unlike Ye Han,

431
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,250
he makes a small matter complicated.

432
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,030
It's a long story.

433
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,160
Go on with your work.

434
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,280

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,370
I'm not going.

437
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,610
I won't go no matter how good the man is.

438
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,550
Okay.

What's wrong?

442
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,600
Mr. Gu asked for you again?

443
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,510
What did he say?

444
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,590
He asked me to go to the hotel

445
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,290
to get the documents from him.

446
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,700
Isn't it obvious?

447
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,560
Did you record it this time?

448
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,250
He called the landline.

449
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,480
He's so cunning.

450
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,520
I'll go with you.

451
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,960
The contract will be signed tomorrow.

452
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,400
He doesn't dare to do anything.

453
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,900
But I haven't finished the materials

454
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,210
Mr. Wang gave me.

455
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,130
Which hotel?

456
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,090
Maybe I should tell Mr. Wang.

457
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,700
It's okay.

458
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,610

It's me, Zhou.

Sorry to bother you.

464
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:16,900
It's okay.

467
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,920
She...

468
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,470
She went to a hotel alone.

469
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,130
What?

470
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,880
She went to the hotel to see Mr. Gu for me.

471
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,840
Send me the hotel address.

Sorry.

476

Zhou is sick today,

477
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,240
so I came on her behalf.

You can tell me if you need anything.

479
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,330
I will try my best to satisfy you.

480
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,800
I have nothing to say.

481
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,580
As for the contract,

482
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,450
some terms are not verified yet.

483

We'll sign them tomorrow.

484

To be cautious,

485
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,290
I can only ask you to work overtime and come here.

486
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,090
It's our hotel's honor

487

00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,280
We're also very good partners.

Which terms?

493
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,800
I'll check with you now.

496
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,590
Why don't we talk in my room?

497
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,740
It's quiet there.

498
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,050
How about we talk about the contract later?

499
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,810
Is this bottle of wine newly opened?

500
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,300
It was my fault that you couldn't enjoy yourself last time.

You're really a fast learner.

You know what?

508
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,450
In fact,

509
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,720
many chain hotels

510
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,070
have made better offers than you.

511
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,570
And their service and facilities

512
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,870

with the authority of our department,

519

we'll give you five percent discount at most.

This is the lowest price we can offer you.

521
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,450
No.

522
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,960
I don't care about the discount at all.

523
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,150
It doesn't matter who I sign the contract with.

524
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,680
The company will pay for it.

525
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,910
The key is

526
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,300
how I

527
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,390
can get my request fulfilled?

528
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,100
What else do you want?

529
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,740
I can see

530
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,310
you are more sensible than Zhou.

531
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,220
You're a rookie, too.

532
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,310
You must want to

533
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,570
to perform well

534
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,370
in such a big project.

535
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,430
Right?

536
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
What do you think?

537
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,600
Come back to my room and have another drink.

538
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,080
As long as I'm happy,

539
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,990
the contract

540
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,920
will be signed smoothly tomorrow.

541
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,900
Of course,

542
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,360
I won't treat you badly.

543
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,730
If you want anything,

544
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,730
just tell me.

545
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
I'm sorry.

546
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,070
Your request is not within my scope of work.

547
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,590
I can't satisfy you.

548
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,690
I'm leaving.

549
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,900
I have to work overtime tomorrow.

550
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,630
Don't you want to think more about it?

551
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,690
It's a good deal.

552
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,580
How much do you earn every month?

553
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,510
3,000

554
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,890
or 5,000?

555
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,790
You can get much more

556
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,390
if you're with me.

557
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,320
I don't need to think about it.

558
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,930
It's up to you whether you want to sign the contract or not.

559
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:21,680
Goodbye.

560
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,040
What do you mean?

561
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,050
Nothing.

562
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,400
I'm going back to my room.

563
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,480
I won't see you off to the first floor.

564
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,610
What are you doing?

565
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,730
Let go of me!

566
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,310
You knew what would happen before you came.

567
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,150
Don't waste time.

568
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:23,950
Let go of me!

569
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,500

570
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,220
Let go of me!

571
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,150
Let go of me!

572
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,230
You'd better show some gratitude!

573
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,440
Let go of me!

574
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,280
You pervert!

575
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,800
Let go of me!

576
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,870
Let go of me!

577
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,130
Let go of me!

578
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,380
Who are you?

579
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,270
I'm warning you.

580
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,680
Don't move!

581
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,970
Call the police for me.

582
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,200
It's okay now.

583
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,690
It's okay now.

584
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,470
I told you not to act rashly.

585
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,030
Why didn't you listen?

586
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,100
Do you know how dangerous it was?

587
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,950
I didn't expect him to be so shameless and bold.

588
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,670
Luckily, Zhou called me.

589
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,670
I arrived in time.

590
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,740
Otherwise, something would have happened just now.

591
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,070
There are so many surveillance cameras.

592
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,950
I didn't know he was so bold.

593
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,230
Look at this.

594
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,710
I recorded all the evidence

595
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,780
of him threatening me.

596
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,910
If it's not enough,

597
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,890
there is the surveillance video in the hotel elevator.

598
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,130
Is that enough?

599
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,800
Is it enough?

600
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,310
Is it enough?

601
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,790
Is it enough?

602
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,790
Yes.

603
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,620
Are you really angry?

604
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,630
Nothing happened this time.

605
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,770
This is called

606
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,929
a victory by taking risks.

607
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,870
Can you be more careful?

608
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,110
Don't be so reckless in the future.

609
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,440
You should at least tell me first.

610
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,929
Don't be angry.

611
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,139
I apologize to you.

612
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,630
What's going on?

613
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,120
How can you make Xu Yan worry about you?

614
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,790
I'm sorry. Xu Yan.

615
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,600
Have you eaten?

616
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,360
Let's go.

617
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,050
Let's go.

618
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,580
I'll buy you anything you want.

619
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,290
Take it as my apology.

620
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,220
[Art is life, IN WORK]

621
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,890
You want your job back?

622
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,870
If you think I'm a traitor,

623
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,560
I have nothing to say.

624
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,680
After I learned everything from you,

625
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,520
I left.

626
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,000
Now I want to betray them

627
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,280
and come back here.

628
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,870
I just

629
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,910
really want to come back here

630
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,420
and work with you.

631
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,440
If changing jobs for a higher paycheck

632
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,030
is considered betrayal,

633
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,430
there will be traitors everywhere.

634
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,650
And if I really think so,

635
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,880
I wouldn't be sitting across you today.

636
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,990
Thank you for your understanding.

637
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,270
You're the vice director of "His Story."

638
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,450
But if you come back,

639
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,300
the position I can give

640
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,800
is just an editor.

641
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:05,320
I don't care about my position.

642
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,510
I know

643
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,900
my annual salary will be decreased, too.

644
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,570
I just hope

645
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,330
when my article is published,

646
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,050
I won't feel too ashamed.

647
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,520
I really like being an editor.

648
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,110
I want to make excellent magazines.

649
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,300
So,

650
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,120
I hope you can give me

651
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,480
another chance

652
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,310
to serve an excellent magazine.

653
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,840
Mr. Gu is always punctual.

654
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,570
How could he be late?

655
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,530
His phone is off, too.

656
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,880
Zhou.

657
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:51,440
When was the last time

658
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,560
you contacted Mr. Gu?

659
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,310
Em...

660
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,350
Yesterday.

661
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,540
When?

662
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,920
Yesterday...

663
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,160
No need to wait.

664
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,310
Mr. Gu won't come today.

665
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,890
What do you mean?

666
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,850
How did you know?

667
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,790
Mr. Gu is at the police station.

668
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:08,940
I called the police.

669
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,480
What police?

670
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,860
Are you crazy?

671
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,610
Lin Jia.

672
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,770
Last night,

673
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,240
he asked me to the hotel,

674
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,070
threatened me in the name of the contract,

675
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,470
and tried to be harass me.

676
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,920
The evidence is solid.

677
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:22,990
He should be questioned

678
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,360
by the police now.

679
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:24,960
But...

680
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,070
Was it

681
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,590
a misunderstanding?

682
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,450
I don't think Mr. Gu is that kind of person.

683
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,360
Mr. Wang.

684
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,190
You must be mistaken.

685
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,450
-This way, please.
-I…

686
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,000
Excuse me.

687
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,400
Are you Mr. Wang?

688
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,420
Yes, I am.

689
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,300
You are?

690
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,070
I'm from Baohe Tourism Company.

691
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,230
My name is Grace.

692
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,670
I'm here to take over the project

693
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,240
we discussed with your company.

694
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,550
I'm here to sign the contract today.

695
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,480
Hello.

696
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,510
Have a seat.

697
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,070
May I ask

698
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,920
who is Lin Jia?

699
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,750
I am.

700
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,380
I'm really sorry.

701
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:00,910
On behalf of our company,

702
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,570
I sincerely apologize to you.

703
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,700
The company has decided to fire Gu Jun.

704
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,030
I'll take over all his work

705
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,600
in the future.

706
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,610
Sorry for the trouble.

707
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,440
I sincerely apologize.

708
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,660
That means everything is fine, right?

709
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,080
Well...

710
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,040
That's good. That's good.

711
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,140
I've brought the contract.

712
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,740
Our official seal has been stamped.

713
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,040
We didn't change a word.

714
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,900
But it is not a one-year contract.

715
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,980
Not... Not a one-year contract?

716
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,240
It's a three-year one.

717
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,410
Three... Three-year is good.

718
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,640
What do you think?

719
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,030
Great.

720
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:36,810
Let's

721
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,640
get

722
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,850
the contract signed.

723
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,080
Here.

724
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,310
Please have a seat.

725
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,220
Grace.

726
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,170
Have a seat.

727
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,830
Come on.

728
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,600
Three-year.

729
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,230
We've always hoped...

730
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,070
Please review these.

731
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,460
He passed the interview?

732
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:57,900
Yes.

733
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,500
You look happy.

734
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,470
Of course I'm happy.

735
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,110
What a psycho.

736
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,430
Whoever was with me

737
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,790
will eventually come back to me.

738
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,550
There's only one person left.

739
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,430
Who is it?

740
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,980
She'll come back, right?

741
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,990
The true heart is not something physical.

742
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,750
How can I bring it to you?

743
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:54,630
So annoying.

744
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,510
[Declaration]

745
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,930
I have an idea.

746
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,110
Jialin.

747
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,950
I don't think we have a rule

748
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,790
to enter each other's rooms.

749
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,950
I'm here to install this.

750
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,470
I heard that you always cough at night.

751
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,100
I think it's because it is too dry in this room.

752
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:42,820
Really?

753
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,750
Did you install anything else

754
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,030
beside this?

755
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,030
For example,

756
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,110
cameras?

757
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,790
Don't worry.

758
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:57,120
I've already installed them long ago.

759
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,990
Liar.

760
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,110
They're in my eyes.

761
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,870
Jialin's focus

762
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,070
has always been Xu Yan.

763
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,550
The system is turned off.

764
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,870
Warning, intimate contact.

765
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,470
How are things with Zhou?

766
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,670
It's settled.

767
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,510
Mr. Gu has been arrested

768
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,290
and fired.

769
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,470
What about your contract? Will it still be signed?

770
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,030
Of course.

771
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,030
And it's not one-year contract this time.

772
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,110
We signed a three-year contract.

773
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,830
That's good.

774
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,390
Thank you for helping me in time.

775
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:41,510
Well.

776
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,000
If there's nothing else, go back to sleep.

777
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:46,970
Okay.

778
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,070
By the way,

779
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:53,790
don't forget

780
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:56,750
you can enter my room at will.

781
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:57,870
Stop it.

782
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,070
Go back to sleep.

783
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,150
Okay.

784
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,470
Good night.

785
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,400
Good night.

786
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,550
Thank you

787
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,230
for that…

788
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,040
It's nothing.

789
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,750
Call me

790
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,270
whenever you're bored.

791
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,470
Go back.
