There are a lot of superheroes.

00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,840
Why does a superhero have such bad taste in clothes?

10

He's a classic.

His muscle tone is awesome.

12
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,570
In my opinion,

00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,560
in terms of looks,

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,830

determining our ultimate hero

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,580
was very important to us.

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,790
Because the hero we supported

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,660
reflected directly on us.

00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,450
In 2016,

00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,480
there was a fight of the century

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,390

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,630

Just based on the name,

29
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,600
I think Batman is better.

30

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,550
-was the one who asked Superman to the fight?
-Yeah.

34
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,910
That doesn't mean he'll lose.

35
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,470
It doesn't mean he'll win.

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,380
Fine.

Monkey King

52

took out the Sea-Stilling Needle from his ears

53
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,650
and put it here.

54
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,240
Then, he took out a strand of hair

Monkey King

57
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,510
took out a screwdriver

I don't think we were admiring those heroes,

70

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,720
Go ahead.

195
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,710
Go to the meeting room earlier

196
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,030
to prepare for the meeting later.

197
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,620
Got it. Got it. Got it.

198
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,140
Okay.

199
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,200
Don't forget.

200
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,190
Jialin.

201
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,070
Jialin.

202
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,710
Mom.

203
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,780
Who is that?

204
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,840
He looks like someone from our hotel.

205
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,810
Do you know him?

206
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,450
No.

207
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,010
He just came up to talk to me.

208
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,490
He's weird.

209
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,640
You

210
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,440
never come home.

211
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,430
What are you doing?

212
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,040
What are you doing here?

213
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,230
I miss you, Mom,

214
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,360
so I came to see you.

215
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,290
If miss me, then do better

216
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,140
instead of making me worry.

217
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,710
You're back

218
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,990
but you're not working

219
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,310
and not married.

220
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,090
I'm so worried.

221
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,860
Talking about marriage,

222
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,010
do you know the girl

223
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,500
that your brother is with?

224
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,080
She's a model.

225
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,720
It gives me a headache.

226
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,460
Both of you

227
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,000
are troubling me.

228
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,370
Aren't you living with your brother?

229
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,590
Keep an eye on him.

230
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,990
Tell him to stay away from useless people.

231
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,440
Especially that model.

232
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,480
Do you hear me?

233
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,070
Okay, Mom. No problem.

234
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,590
Mom, are you busy?

235
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,350
Go back to work.

236
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,720
Come home.

237
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,560
I heard that delivering food is quite profitable nowadays.

238
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,800
Why don't you try it?

239
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,810
I also heard that it's quite profitable.

240
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,830
But first of all,

241
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,830
I need money to buy an electric bike.

242
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,270
How about

243
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,080
you lend me some?

244
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,670
I don't have money to lend you.

245
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,000
Do you want me to deliver food on foot then?

246
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,720
Zhong Zixuan.

247
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,050
Miss.

248
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,610
Why did you skip class?

249
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,960
The whole point of you going to school is to piss me off, right?

250
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,890
I have important business to discuss.

251
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,620
You skipped class in the morning.

252
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,620
Are you skipping the afternoon too?

253
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,350
Aren't you that guy from last time?

254
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,200
Yes.

255
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,090
Hello.

256
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,910
Don't you two don't know each other?

257
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,510
We're getting to know each other now.

258
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,350
Go to class once you're done.

259
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,170
Do you hear me?

260
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,230
Yes Miss.

261
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,570
You seem

262
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,920
to be quite close to her.

263
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,640
She respects her students from the bottom of her heart.

264
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,570
She's really good to her students.

265
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,910
What's that term?

266
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,330
Intergenerational friendship, right?

267
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,820
You said hello to her when you knew she'd scold you.

268
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,070
In order to talk to her,

269
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,110
you got scolded.

270
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:32,690
Amazing.

271
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,450
Have you ever taken cultural classes?

272
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,240
How is it an intergenerational friendship?

273
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,040
We're not that different in age.

274
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,320
Hurry up and eat.

275
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,120
I'll teach you a lesson if you skip class again.

276
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,920
Bye, teacher.

277
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,070
Goodbye.

278
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,170
Why are you looking at me?

279
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,560
How is your family?

280
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,700
Just so so.

281
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,080
I don't know much either.

282
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,020
Why don't you ask then?

283
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,860
I did.

284
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,210
They're not telling me.

285
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:01,990
My dad

286
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,590
doesn't like to

287
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,990
to tell me about himself.

288
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,710
Ask your mother then.

289
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,230
My mom?

290
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,220
I can't find her.

291
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,400
Why?

292
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,460
You...

293
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,990
don't know where she is?

294
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,230
I know where she is.

295
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,840
But it's too hard

296
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,300
to go there.

297
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,110
Let's eat.

298
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,990
Eat.

299
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,590
Why didn't you call ahead instead of

300
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,990
waiting here like a fool?

301
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,850
I'm happy to wait for you.

302
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,290
Thank you for the gift.

303
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,790
Without it,

304
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,930
I wouldn't have been able to sleep yesterday.

305
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,080
I'm glad you like it.

306
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,600
By the way,

307
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,040
at the KTV yesterday...

308
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,020
Tell your friend I'm sorry.

309
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,330
I'll treat her to a meal next time.

310
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,930
Did Jialin sleep well last night?

311
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,310
She was still sleeping when I left.

312
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,000
She slept in Xiaoxiao's room.

313
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,810
Are you hungry?

314
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,250
I'll take you to eat.

315
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,210
I'm not hungry.

316
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,320
I don't want to eat.

317
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
I want to go home.

318
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,960
What's wrong?

319
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,410
You've been acting weird since last night.

320
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,070
You didn't reply my messages.

321
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,940
It's nothing.

322
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,080
It's not like you to be so evasive.

323
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,640
What happened?

324
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,680
You went on a blind date?

325
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,280
I'm sorry.

326
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,770
Yes, I went on a blind date.

327
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,880
My mom arranged it.

328
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,040
I did it to pacify her.

329
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,450
I don't want my mom to get mad at you for this.

330
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,680
You're so considerate.

331
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,510
I was wrong about the blind date.

332
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:50,990
But...

333
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,110
But?

334
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,480
You're easily persuaded, are you?

335
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,490
Because you helped me resolve the penalty issue,

336
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,610
you can't refuse your mom's request.

337
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,670
Right?

338
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,640
I just wanted to help you

339
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,870
in my own way.

340
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,100
Don't be angry, okay?

341
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,260
What right do I have to be angry?

342
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,350
If it were the old Tong Yiwen,

343
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,090
I would have had a big fight with you already.

344
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,370
But I've grown up.

345
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,160
I know you went on a blind date because of me.

346
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,330
That's why I'm not being ungrateful.

347
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,690
I owe you.

348
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,450
You don't owe me anything.

349
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,460
You don't have to suffer in silence either.

350
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,980
We're dating.

351
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,000
I helped you solve the problem

352
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,060
because I don't want to see you worry.

353
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,470
We're a couple. We don't owe each other anything.

354
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,820
Why didn't you tell me

355
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,730
before making the decision then?

356
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,840
Would you accept it if I told you?

357
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,100
You wouldn't.

358
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,610
So I chose not to tell you.

359
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,000
Have you ever considered that

360
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,430
if you helped me,

361
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,670
I won't able to hold my head up in front of your mother anymore?

362
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,680
Is what my mom said so important?

363
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,830
I'm the one who's dating you.

364
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,400
How old are you?

365
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,010
Do you still think it's just a game,

366
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,770
only thinking about yourself?

367
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,420
How far do you think a relationship that isn't approved can go?

368
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,190
by your family

369
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,040
How long do you think you can endure this?

370
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:04,950
Forget it.

371
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,750
Tong Yiwen.

372
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,880
I'll contact you when I calm down.

373
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,130
I don't want you to be interested in my son.

374
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,670
All my assets,

375
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,940
everything,

376
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,700
will be left to my son.

377
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,800
But...

378
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,420
I won't leave it to you.

379
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,630
Coming.

380
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,090
Grandma.

381
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,920
Yiwen, you're home.

382
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,650
Why are you here?

383
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,660
Should I change my shoes?

384
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,610
No need.

385
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,480
Come in.

386
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,140
I miss you.

387
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,810
You didn't even go back to visit me during Chinese New Year.

388
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,010
Have a seat.

389
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,069
Is Xiaoxiao not here?

390
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,170
She hasn't come back yet.

391
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,180
Have a seat.

392
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,550
You're back.

393
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,720
Grandma?

394
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,150
Why are you back?

395
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:24,890
You're back.

396
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,800
Let me see.

397
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,710
What did you buy?

398
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,090
I bought some vegetables.

399
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,560
What can two little girls eat when there's no one to take care of them?

400
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,100
Let me improve things.

401
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,370
Sure!

402
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,190
Hurry.

403
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,670
-Come on.
-Let’s go.

404
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,650
You still know to come back?

405
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,420
I can come back whenever I want.

406
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,930
It's none of your business.

407
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,990
I'm your brother.

408
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,450
Who's going to care about you if I don't care?

409
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
I don't want to argue with you today.

410
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,610
By the way,

411
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,310
your mom asked me to tell you

412
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,600
to stop seeing Tong Yiwen.

413
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,410
I've passed the message.

414
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,810
Think about it yourself.

415
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,470
Welcome.

416
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,710
Welcome, Grandma.

417
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,230
It looks delicious.

418
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,150
Try it.

419
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,380
Let me try.

420
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,900
That's it.

421
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,890
Grandma.

422
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,070
Don't visit me suddenly again.

423
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,240
You must tell me in advance next time

424
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,700
so that I can pick you up at the station.

425
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,810
No need.

426
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,950
That's troublesome.

427
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,470
I just came to see you.

428
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,670
I'll go back tomorrow.

429
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,390
Don't leave in a hurry.

430
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,510
I have nothing to do this week.

431
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,390
I can show you around tomorrow.

432
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,600
Yiwen,

433
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,320
I have to tend to my shop.

434
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,920
I also told Ye Han

435
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,190
that you're here.

436
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,840
He wants to treat you to dinner.

437
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,510
Tell him that's too polite of him.

438
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,680
He should be polite.

439
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,420
Don't you know?

440
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,760
I haven't had time to tell you.

441
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,660
Ye Han

442
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,030
is my boyfriend now.

443
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,030
Really?

444
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,340
Great.

445
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,530
Ye Han is a good boy.

446
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,350
With him taking care of you,

447
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,560
I'm relieved.

448
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,530
What about you, Yiwen?

449
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,400
What?

450
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,350
I've met that boy too.

451
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,900
He's a nice kid.

452
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,080
He's fine.

453
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm relieved that you're both fine.

454
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,190
Yiwen,

455
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,530
remember what I said.

456
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,120
No matter what happens,

457
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,400
you must eat well and sleep well.

458
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,280
Happiness is the most important.

459
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,280
I know, Grandma.

460
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,640
It's your famous line.

461
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,510
Grandma.

462
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,140
Stay a few more days.

463
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,030
I really have something to do tomorrow.

464
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,890
How about this?

465
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,920
When

466
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,320
the weather is warmer,

467
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,610
I'll come again.

468
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,120
Then I'll give Ye a chance

469
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,990
to treat me to dinner.

470
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,600
You need to cultivate Ye's drinking abilities.

471
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,460
If you want to marry my granddaughter,

472
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,840
he has to prepare that.

473
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,410
Right?

474
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,440
Yes.

475
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,650
Don't drink too much.

476
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,370
Health is the most important.

477
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,260
Happiness is the most important.

478
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,940
I'll wash the dishes after dinner.

479
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,610
Let's go for a walk after that.

480
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,430
[Sunflower symbolize silent love]

481
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,840
Hey, where are you?

482
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,990
For you.

483
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,840
You don't like it?

484
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,260
No.

485
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,910
So this is how a boy feels when he receives flowers.

486
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,150
Does that mean you like them?

487
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,760
It just feels like you opened

488
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,210
the door to a new world.

489
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,640
As expected from a writer.

490
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,730
You're good at expressing emotions.

491
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:01,810
Yeah.

492
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,590
Just like how you're good at exercising.

493
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,320
That's why you hit me every day.

494
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,650
You want a beating?

495
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,640
So why did you suddenly give me flowers?

496
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,150
No reason.

497
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,500
I saw it when I went to buy bread

498
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,900
so I wanted to give it to you.

499
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,100
You're in the mood.

500
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,110
Recently, whenever I see something fun, tasty

501
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,100
or interesting,

502
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,690
I just want to share them with you right away.

503
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,610
Me too.

504
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,050
Whenever I see people who talk nonsense

505
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,140
once they're drunk,

506
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,300
I think of you.

507
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,150
Don't force me to show my real skills.

508
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,430
Just kidding.

509
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,030
Just kidding.

510
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,010
Aren't you busy today?

511
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,150
I'm busy.

512
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,490
But

513
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,190
I was busy thinking about you.

514
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,350
I was busy

515
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,970
missing you. Missing you, missing you.

516
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,650
What are you doing?

517
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,260
Haven't you noticed?

518
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,590
What?

519
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,600
I'm wearing the clothes you gave me.

520
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,520
I gave those to you?

521
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,730
When?

522
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,540
Have you forgotten?

523
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,320
The day that you were drunk.

524
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,360
When you kissed me?

525
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,520
That day, you looked

526
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,150
so thirsty.

527
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,270
Shut up!

528
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,230
Looks like you've forgotten everything.

529
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,820
Who is it?

530
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,080
I don't know.

531
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,040
Son.

532
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,080
Are you home?

533
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,180
My mom is here.

534
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,650
I'm not here.

535
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,820
Mom.

536
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,450
You're home.

537
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,430
Why are you back in Shanghai all of a sudden?

538
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,140
I'm on tour.

539
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,370
I have a connecting flight in Shanghai,

540
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,650
so I came to see

541
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
my precious son.

542
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,090
You didn't bring your luggage?

543
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,190
Aren't you staying over?

544
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,170
I won't stay over.

545
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,540
I'll stay in a hotel.

546
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,820
It's more convenient.

547
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,900
I think you're doing quite well.

548
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,430
I'm relieved.

549
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,220
Alright.

550
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,710
I'll leave you alone.

551
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,900
I'm going back.

552
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,430
No.

553
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,470
You just came in.

554
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,760
Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

555
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,160
I have an early flight tomorrow.

556
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,280
I have to rehearse after landing.

557
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,300
I need to go home and rest early.

558
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,260
See you.

559
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,500
Let me give you a ride.

560
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,600
No need.

561
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,790
I have a performance in two days.

562
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,030
I'll be back soon.

563
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,830
Bye.

564
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,160
Stop hiding.

565
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,550
Come out.

566
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,250
That was close.

567
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,740
I was scared to death.

568
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,840
Scared to death?

569
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,580
Is it so shameful to date me?

570
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,180
I'm not ready to see your mom yet.

571
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,430
Your mom won't come back, right?

572
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,810
No.

573
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,450
It's too dangerous here.

574
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,210
I have to go.

575
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,130
The shoes!

576
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,430
The bag.

577
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,270
Did your mom find out already?

578
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,510
So what if she did?

579
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,740
She'll find out sooner or later anyway.

580
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,080
That's a problem for later.

581
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,590
Bye.

582
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,980
Honey, what are you doing? Hurry up.

583
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,000
Hurry up.

584
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,140
Okay.

585
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,640
Dr. Li.

586
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,570
None of them can be used?

587
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,260
Fine.

588
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,280
You didn't tell her, did you?

589
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,650
Thank you.

590
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,840
Okay, I'll take her there later.

591
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,550
Well,

592
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,970
don’t tell Shengyun the reason why it failed.

593
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,920
Thank you.

594
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,990
What took you so long?

595
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,880
I was using the toilet.

596
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,540
Who were you on the phone with?

597
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,560
Well, Dr. Li called.

598
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,870
Are the results out?

599
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,350
What did she say?

600
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
She said

601
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,960
we'll know when we go to the hospital.

602
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,530
Let's go. Hurry up.

603
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,650
Let’s go.

[Surgery Department]

605
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,440
Shengyun, don’t be too sad.

606
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,740
Don’t be discouraged.

607
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,150
Some couples fail here

608
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,230
and conceive naturally afterwards.

609
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,190
So don't worry.

610
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,010
Don't keep think about it.

611
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,600
The more you think about it, the more stressed you are,

612
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,200
and it may make things worse.

613
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,280
Doctor, I have a question.

614
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,430
When can I try again?

615
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
I think

616
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,300
you'd better stop for now.

617
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,410
Go back and recuperate.

618
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,620
Every time you take an egg out,

619
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,540
it will hurt your body a lot.

620
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,480
If you insist on doing it,

621
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,880
it'll be a vicious cycle.

622
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,670
Yes, honey.

623
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,800
The doctor says so too.

624
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,380
Take care of your body.

625
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,370
Don't worry. Take your time.

Dr. Li.

627
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,580
Whose problem

628
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,580
is it?

629
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,230
Well...

630
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,250
Honey.

631
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,220
No matter whose problem it is, the result won't change.

632
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,150
You don't have to worry about this.

633
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,240
How about this?

634
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,040
I suggest you two go home

635
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,640
and talk more, alright?

636
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,880
Yes, let's talk.

637
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,700
Honey, stop thinking about it.

638
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,420
Go back and recuperate,

639
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,380
okay?

640
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,470
Shengyun.

641
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,650
Honey.

642
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,730
It doesn't matter if we have kids or not.

643
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,360
We're doing fine

644
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,010
with just the two of us, right?

645
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,310
Maybe it's better to have a child.

646
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,390
Don't worry about this anymore.

647
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,310
I think

648
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,840
the most important thing is to enjoy the present, right?

649
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,040
Are you enjoying the present?

650
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,310
I do.

651
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,990
You go out every day.

652
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,880
Then I keep suspecting you and monitoring you.

653
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,140
Are you satisfied with this kind of life?

654
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,120
I always think

655
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,210
you have no sense of responsibility and go out every day

656
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,680
because we don't have children.

Me alone

658
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,760
isn't enough to tie down your heart.

659
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,440
That's not true, honey.

660
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,680
Cut the crap, Lu Zheng.

Let's go to another hospital.

682

If this hospital can't find the reason,

683
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,310
we'll go to another hospital.

684
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,760
We'll find the reason.

it's my fault.

707

If you ask again,

708
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,590
it'll be so awkward for me.

Don't be discouraged.

714
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,340
Let's solve the problem.

715
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:22,890
The doctor said

716
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,290
there's no special medicine.

717
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,610
I have to work on it myself.

718
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,600
Then let's do it.

719
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,620
Well...

720

Yes.

-Yeah.

-Sleep early.
-I'm pretty energetic now.

-Sleep.
-Come on. Be good.

737
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,760
Honey, don't be sad.

738
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,300
Go to sleep. Let me help you sleep.

739
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,440
Come on.

740
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:45,940
Alright.

741

Your rotation frequency is good too.

Let's focus on

745
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,250
practising the team rotations these few days.

746
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,230
In the next competition,

747
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,640
our results will be even better.

748
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,620
Are you confident?

749
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,530
Yes.

750
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,080
Okay.

751
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,420
Let's take a break.

752
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,640

Is something bothering you?

756
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,760
No, nothing.

757
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,660
I heard about your family.

758
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,080
Is there anything I can help with?

759
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,080
It's nothing.

760
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,630
I just need to hang in there.

761
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,820
But you don't look well lately.

762
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,250
Are you anxious because of your dad?

763
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,360
No, he...

764
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,340
He's been running around all his life.

765
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,320
He was destined to have a hard life.

766
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,380
Fortunately, it's nothing serious.

767
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,760
It's okay, Miss.

768
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,830
Don't worry.

769
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,000
That's good.

770
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,070
Next month,

771
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,940
will be the city's Bicycle Racing Classics.

772
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,180
I have faith in you.

773
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,100
You must win the first place.

774
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,790
Do you hear me?

775
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,050
Will I get prize money?

776
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,470
Of course not.

777
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,760
But the sense of accomplishment and value

778
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,840
can't be bought with money.

779
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,560
Come on.

780
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:06,430
Okay.

781
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,570
You're here for Ye Han?

782
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,650
Yes.

783
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,949
[Perfect]

784
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,159
A latte, please.

785
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,139
Okay.

786
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:33,440
[Perfect]

787
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,429
Your coffee.

788
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:38,389
Thank you.

789
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,880
[Perfect]

790
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,719
Excuse me.

791
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,320
Sit down.

792
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,310
It's okay.

793
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,290
I didn't hold it properly.

794
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,000
It's okay.

795
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,320
I'm sorry.

796
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,770
I'll go get some more tissues.

797
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:02,360
[Perfect]

798
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,760
[Perfect]

799
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,350
Isn't it nice to have such a sweet boyfriend?

800
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,680
You know my boyfriend?

801
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,930
Not only do I know him, we're quite close.

802
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,040
You are...

803
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,000
Guo Shengyun.

804
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,320
He told me about you.

805
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:23,190
[Perfect]

806
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,180
Hello.

807
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,250
I’m Li Xiaoxiao.

808
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,180
There's no need for us to shake hands.

809
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,760
Why?

810
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,570
From now on,

811
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,520
we may meet often.

812
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,150
Do you have a future with him?

813
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,500
Why not?

814
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,840
Our relationship

815
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,350
is very stable.

816
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,680
Is a stable relationship with a married man

817
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,870
something to show off about?

818
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,240
I'm Lu Zheng's wife.

819
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,270
I know.

820
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,240
What do you mean by a married man?

821
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,810
[Perfect]

822
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,700
You've met.

823
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,190
Yun.

824
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,250
Let me introduce.

825
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,070
She's my girlfriend,

826
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,910
Li Xiaoxiao.

827
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,130
Mr. Ye.

828
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,280
For Lu Zheng,

829
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,910
you're willing to take the blame for anything.

830
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,630
Honey.

831
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,760
When did you get here?

832
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,430
Thank you.

833
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,710
You haven't introduced each other, have you?

834
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,700
Xiaoxiao.

835
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,930
Ye Han's girlfriend.

836
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,760
You have great camaraderie.

837
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,650
You know Ye Han will lie for you.

838
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,370
I...

839
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,950
It's not the first time

840
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,360
you guys teamed up to lie to me.

841
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,110
I don't want to expose you.

842
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,990
Honey, what are you talking about?

843
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,150
What do you mean?

844
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,390
Xiaoxiao is just a customer.

845
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,470
She ordered a cup of coffee.

846
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,030
I accidentally spilled it when I served it.

847
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,140
Did I ask you to speak?

848
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,390
I have to, even if you didn't.

849
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,190
I didn't tell you before.

850
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,390
That's my problem.

851
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,410
What's your problem?

852
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:39,050
It's a misunderstanding.

853
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:39,830
And you, Ye Han,

854
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,390
why didn't you

855
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,950
explain it to my wife?

856
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,790
Who is she? Who is she?

857
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,030
Stop arguing.

858
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,400
Do you believe me now?

859
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,450
Did you see that?

860
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,850
They even kissed.

861
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,770
Well...

862
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,330
I'm sorry.

863
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,450
Xiaoxiao, right?

864
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,220
From now on,

865
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,490
we'll see each other often.

866
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,130
You were quite open just now.

867
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,020
Actions are

868
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,980
more straightforward than words.

869
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,340
You've finally met Yun.

870
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,520
What do you think?

871
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,740
She's even more powerful

872
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:29,960
than I thought.

873
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:30,780
Yes.

874
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,780
That's how she rules her world.

875
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,130
I have to learn from her.

876
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,010
No need.

877
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,320
For you,

878
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,730
your physical strength is already off the charts.

879
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,510
You don't need to improve your inner strength.

880
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,110
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to hold you down.

881
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,250
All right.

882
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,200
Go back to work.

883
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,290
I'm going back too.

884
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,670
Did you

885
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,290
forget something?

886
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,770
You're back.

887
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,960
I'm back.

888
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,410
How much sugar did Ye Han feed you?

889
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,560
You're so happy.

890
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,370
This is

891
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,700
the wonder of love.

892
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,050
It's not like you haven't experienced it.

893
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,150
By the way,

894
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,920
why hasn't Jiacheng come recently?

895
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,680
He must be busy.

896
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:52,560
Speak of the devil.

897
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:54,370
Alright.

898
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,040
I won't disturb you.

899
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,480
I'll go back first.

900
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:04,780
Wen.

901
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,800
You got the wrong person.

902
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,590
Wen.

903
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,490
I'm dad.

904
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,570
Wen.

905
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,940
I just want to see you.

906
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,550
I brought you some fruits.

907
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,390
What happened?

908
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,590
Just say it.

909
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,010
Something did happen to me.

910
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,930
The owner of the fishing boat ran away.

911
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,730
I was working at sea

912
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,220
and didn't get my salary for all those years.

913
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,190
I'm not familiar with Shanghai.

914
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,820
I don't have a place to live.

915
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,720
I don't have much money left.

916
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,300
I had no choice

917
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,360
so I came to you.

918
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,560
And then?

919
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,600
Wen.

920
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,730
Can you

921
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,240
lend me some money?

922
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,310
When I need help,

923
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,290
you never helped me.

924
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,060
You disappeared for so many years.

925
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,750
Once you showed up, it's to ask me for money.

926
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:11,850
Wen.

927
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,190
It was my fault.

928
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,590
But I was at sea.

929
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,930
It wasn't convenient to contact you.

930
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,150
I've always cared about you.

931
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,100
You live in such a good house

932
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,420
in Shanghai.

933
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,200
Why are you so talkative?

934
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,830
My life is my business.

935
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,870
Similarly, I don't care what you're doing.

936
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,670
Okay.

937
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,190
I understand.

938
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,830
I'll leave.

939
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,120
Take care.

940
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,200
Remember to eat the fruit.
