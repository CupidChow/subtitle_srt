00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,130
I'll be right there.

193
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,280
Thank you.

194
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,150
Bye.

195
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,440
Someone found him.

196
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,730
He's at the police station.

197
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,050
-Let’s go.
-Okay.

198
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,790
I want mommy.

199
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,510
Don't cry.

200
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,090
I've already informed your mom.

201
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,290
Mom will be here soon.

202
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,790
Don't cry. Be good.

203
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,720
Kaize.

204
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,830
Mommy.

205
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,080
What's going on?

206
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,340
Where did you go?

207
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,070
Do you know that Mom was very worried about you?

208
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,150
Okay, okay.

209
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,580
I think he's scared, too.

210
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,880
Excuse me.

211
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,580
Are you the child's guardian?

212
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,290
Yes.

213
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,470
As parents, you should keep an eye on your child.

214
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,270
Luckily, a good samaritan brought him here today.

215
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,480
I'm sorry.

216
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,030
Sorry for the trouble.

217
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,780
[What are drugs?]

218
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,470
Show me your ID.

219
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,440
Come over here to register with me.

220
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,650
[What are drugs?]

221
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,570
Okay, Kaize.

222
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,730
Boys can't shed tears easily.

223
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,390
But Mommy is angry.

224
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,560
That's because Mom is worried about you.

225
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,640
Next time, don't run away alone again.

226
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,930
But I didn't mean to.

227
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,340
The other kids were all

228
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,590
playing with their parents.

229
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,190
I was the only one.

230
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,570
I wanted to play with the kids too.

231
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,910
After playing with them for a while,

232
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,310
I came back and Mom was gone.

233
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,320
Don't be afraid if this happens again.

234
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,770
Stay where you are.

235
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,640
But don't leave with strangers.

236
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,680
Got it?

237
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,450
Okay.

238
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:36,850
Go to your mom.

[Qidao Street Police Station]

240
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,990
Mommy, I'm sorry.

241
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,910
No.

242
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,170
I was too anxious.

243
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,520
I shouldn't have gotten mad at you.

244
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,610
Next time, I won't make you worry.

245
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,510
I won't go anywhere by myself too.

246
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,990
Stop working.

247
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,110
Come and eat.

248
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,050
Dinner is ready.

249
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,610
Okay.

250
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,240
So many dishes?

251
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,110
Can we finish them?

252
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,760
This is a lot?

253
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,270
You should be nourishing your body now.

254
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,730
You should eat more.

255
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,910
Eat up.

256
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:26,980
Okay.

257
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,090
Let me help you.

258
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,020
No need.

259
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,910
Let me feed you.

260
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,780
No need.

261
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,150
It's not embarrassing to be fed.

262
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,700
You used to be like this when you were a kid, too.

263
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,030
Xu Jialin, you're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

264
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,360
Chicken feet, pig trotters, Chinese yam,

265
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,480
they're all super slippery.

266
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,200
How can I pick them up?

267
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,770
Yes, I did it on purpose.

268
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,230
So, which one do you want?

269
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,950
Chinese yam then.

270
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,880
It's good for vitality.

271
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,810
Open your mouth.

272
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,290
Little Xu, open your mouth.

273
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,760
Good boy.

274
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,700
Is it good?

275
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,200
Yes.

276
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,420
Have another pig's trotter.

277
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,880
It's good for your health.

278
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,810
Let me chew first.

279
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,090
I haven't swallowed it.

280
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,590
There are so many dishes. You need to take bigger bites.

281
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,470
Quickly, chew it and swallow it.

282
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,890
Let's have one more bite.

283
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,040
You have to eat well and grow well

284
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,910
so that your bones will recover soon.

285
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,430
Do you think I'm a kindergarten kid?

286
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,780
Forget it.

287
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,200
I forgot to remove the bones of the chicken feet.

288
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,490
Why don't I chew them for you?

289
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,590
Let the boss do it.

290
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,460
It'd be a good deal for him.

291
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,740
I'll be jealous.

292
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,290
Don't be disgusting, Xu Jialin.

293
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,590
My arm is broken,

294
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,230
not my teeth.

295
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,990
Really?

296
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,170
Then munch on a chicken feet for me.

297
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,870
I'm so bored.

298
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,030
Why is it so boring even at your place?

299
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,870
Yeah.

300
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,930
Why?

301
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,750
I'm asking you.

302
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,610
Don't you have a girlfriend?

303
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,440
She's working overtime.

304
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,430
She's probably doing that

305
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,520
to ignore me.

306
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,400
This isn't boring.

307
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,600
Tell me what's going on.

308
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,710
Do you want me to call Yun

309
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,110
to relieve your boredom?

310
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,770
Now that's boring.

311
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,150
What?

312
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,390
Why are you so excited?

313
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,710
I'm calling Jialin.

314
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,260
She hasn't come back yet.

315
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,800
She's not young anymore.

316
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,790
You should give her freedom.

317
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,990
Freedom, you know?

318
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,060
Do you want me to give you some freedom now?

319
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,080
I'll just continue to be bored.

320
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,720
Hello?

321
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
Where are you? It's so late already.

322
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,590
It's none of your business.

323
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,250
What kind of attitude is that?

324
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,640
I'm not going back tonight.

325
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,040
Where are you going then?

326
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,850
To live with a friend.

327
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,920
What friend?

328
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,730
My deskmate in high school.

329
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,760
Yiyi.

330
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,860
She's on a business trip in Shanghai.

331
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,090
I'll stay in the hotel with her.

332
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,550
That's it. I'm hanging up.

333
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,350
Have some fruits.

334
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,170
Have some of this.

335
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,000
It helps with digestion.

336
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,040
I can do it myself.

337
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,040
Thank you.

338
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,650
Well,

339
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,290
it's getting late.

340
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,260
You should go back.

341
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,590
I'll call a taxi for you.

342
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,440
Where's your phone?

343
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,520
You're going to sleep, are you?

344
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,910
Let me help you change into your pajamas.

345
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,130
It must be inconvenient with your arm like that.

346
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,190
What are you doing?

347
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,510
Don't be shy.

348
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,790
I'm taking care of a patient.

349
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,120
I'm very professional.

350
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,230
Stop messing around and go home.

351
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,020
No.

352
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,260
You had a caretaker to take care of you yesterday at the hospital.

353
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,750
Now you're alone at home.

354
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,950
How can you brush your teeth and change your clothes

355
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:51,950
and take care of yourself?

356
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,990
I have to stay.

357
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,440
I can take care of myself.

358
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,170
Although I only have one hand,

359
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,650
I can do many things.

360
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,510
-Give it to me.
-No.

361
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,950
I told Xu Jiacheng I won't go back.

362
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,579
I'll stay here to take care of you today.

363
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,619
I promise

364
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,980
not to take advantage of you.

365
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,579
Just treat me as a caregiver.

366
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:11,160
No.

367
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,190
Treat me as a kindergarten teacher.

368
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,910
I don't want you to stay home alone.

369
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,250
What if you hurt your hand?

370
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,109
You're already so old.

371
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:22,270
What if you fall and hurt your head?

372
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,369
I'll sleep in the living room.

373
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:25,400
I'll be here if you ask for me.

374
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,950
I won't go if you don't.

375
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,869
Is that okay?

376
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,210
Deal.

377
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,360
Eat the fruit first.

378
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,490
I'll squeeze some toothpaste for you.

379

Ye Han.

380
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,590
Thank you for today.

381
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,480
By the way,

382
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,790
I have a solo exhibition

383
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,230
coming up in two days.

384
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,400
Do you have time to come over?

385
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,660
I'm not free.

386
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:15,810
See you.

387
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:16,980
Wait.

388
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,870
I troubled you again.

389
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,480
I'm really sorry.

390
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,850
I know I shouldn't bother you anymore.

391
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,420
But...

392
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,820
It was a special situation.

393
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,330
I'm glad the kid's okay.

394
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,770
When I first left the country,

395
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,640
I was very sad too.

396
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
I felt incredibly lonely by myself.

397
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,400
During that time,

398
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,530
I met Kaize's father.

399
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,920
I thought I could rely on him.

400
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,420
But this kind of relationship

401
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,860
was a mistake from the beginning.

402
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,990
So when Kaize was two,

403
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,680
we separated.

404
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,180
At the time, I didn't think that

405
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,290
I wouldn't be able to take good care of him.

406
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,230
Because I thought I had my career

407
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,420
and I was capable.

408
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,970
I believed I could be a good mother.

409
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,850
But

410
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,650
later on,

411
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,090
I found that

412
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,940
I'm not the best mom.

413
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,940
Because I couldn't give him a complete family.

414
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,280
Now I understand that

415
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,130
there are things

416
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,720
only a father

417
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,460
can give a child.

418
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,190
Why are you telling me this?

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,250
I realised that I feel the same way about you

422
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,900
as I did six years ago.

423
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,060

567

If you do it like this, when will it be done?

589
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,260
I'll take care of the hard work.

I am your hand.

591
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,810

We have formatting requirements for this.

593

[IN WORK]

618
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,430
These companies will provide technical support

619
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,790
for our e-magazine and other platforms.

620
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,440
They'll have a team of technicians

621
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,960
who will write programs

622
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,870
and onboard clients.

623
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,790
But we'd have to be in charge of

624
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,220
content and operations.

625
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,200
As for this company,

626
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,610
they can provide technical support

627
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,500
and also manage operations.

628
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,700
We'll still be in charge of the content.

629
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,610
But the problem is,

630
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,540
the office location is in Beijing.

631
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,010
If we have to be responsible for operations,

632
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,410
we definitely don't have enough manpower.

633
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:32,100
Online operations is not our strength.

634
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,490
We need more people.

635
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,590
Personally,

636
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,120
I'll choose the latter.

Why?

638
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,030
Firstly,

639
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,370
there's less pressure.

640
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:42,960
Secondly,

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,230
the office is in Beijing

642
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,740
but I don't think it's a big problem.

643
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,200
We can send someone there.

644
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,710

666
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,650
it's nothing special.

667
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,060

668
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,250

00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,409

00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,409

Ye Han would fall in love with in the end.

690
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,920

00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,139
you are even more determined

692

00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,820
This is probably why

694
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,800
Ye Han chose you.

695
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:05,880
By the way,

696
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,760
I want to apologize to you.

697
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,780
I was too anxious yesterday.

698
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,920
So I asked Ye Han for help.

00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,190
♫I don't dare to love even if I long to♫

755
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,580
really over?

756
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,430
No one said it's over.

757
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:50,160
♫But how can I forget your tenderness?♫

758
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,840
So it can never end.

759
00:38:53,510 --> 00:39:00,050
♫How can I love like the way you do?♫

760
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,100
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

761
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,230
Are you hungry?

762
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,850
I'll cook something for you.

763
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,130
Where did you go yesterday?

764
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,660
I wanted to tell you last night.

765
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,610
Song Jinran's son went missing.

766
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,310
Then I...

767
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,320
I guess

768
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,060
she didn't lie to me.

769
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,490
You went to see her?

770
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,300
I went to her exhibition.

771
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,150
Why did you go?

772
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,130
There's nothing to see.

773
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,220
I saw your photos

774
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,550
and your past.

775
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,030
I didn't know.

776
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,790
Besides,

777
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,960
why did she put all this out

778
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,760
in public

779
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,380
without my permission?

780
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,270
The ring on the desk

781
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,160
was from your past, too.

782
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,650
I took the ring from her.

783
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,210
I don't want her to keep anything from before.

784
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,150
If you want me to throw the ring away,

785
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,530
I can do it anytime.

786
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,920
Because this ring

787
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,720
is meaningless to me.

788
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,040
Why would I ask you to throw it away?

789
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,560
It's not about throwing it away.

790
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:03,330
I don't care where you guys went yesterday.

791
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,910
I don't care about that ring either.

792
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,910
I just don't understand why your ex-girlfriend

793
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,950
always appears in my life.
