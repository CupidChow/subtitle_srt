00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,870
♫If I miss the chance to be brave♫

194
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,710
I learned how to part

195
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,549
♫Can we still reach the destination?♫

196
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,309
without badgering or begging the other party.

197
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,990
I also learned how to heal everything with time.

198
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,070
I've learned it all,

199
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,290

[Declaration]

201
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,950
so I won't resent

00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,880
♫No matter how far♫

203
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,940
or regret.

♫No matter how far away the place is, I'll go and find you there♫

205
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,390
I've learned too much,

206
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,890
so I know well

207
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,470
that in face of a parting,

208
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,600
we can't do anything.

209

♫I've met countless people♫

210
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,600
There won't be any tears

211
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,510

This is the line

215
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,290
that I can't cross.

216
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,930
That's how a secret crush is.

217
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,400
You can only observe her from afar.

218
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,350
You can't approach her at will.

219
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,410
Because today is the second day of my secret crush,

220
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,000
we should be closer.

221
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,880
I got to know him too late.

222
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,080
Now I'm going to cross the white line.

223
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,280
In fact, my heart

224
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,180
told me the answer long ago.

225
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,360
But I didn't admit it.

226
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,560
Mr. Editor, what are you doing?

227
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,110
What?

228
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,930
Feeling uncomfortable?

229
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,400
Mr. Editor, you've been

230
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,950
following me the whole afternoon.

231
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,560
I was just picking a font.

232
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,270
You've been following me like a shadow

233
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,320
and have been monitoring me.

234
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,450
It's a little scary.

235
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,900
It's not monitoring.

236
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,270
I was just showing.

237
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,680
Showing what?

238
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,730
How I'm working.

239
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,480
To whom?

240
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,270
To myself.

241
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,410
Why?

242
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,040
I want to tell myself

243
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,590
I'm fine,

244
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,720
I'm okay,

245
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,690
and everything is as usual.

246
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,520
Didn't you say there won't be any tears

247
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,710
for a quiet parting?

248
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,170
So I suggest that you go back and cry it out.

249
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,300
It's all because you didn't cry it out.

250
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,720
Why did you recite something

251
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,230
written on the paper?

252
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,350
And why did you tell me you had read it?

253
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,730
Mr. Editor, you've published your breakup

254
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,250
on the magazine.

255
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,610
And you don't allow me to talk about it?

256
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,670
Brother.

257
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,310

You're still up?

259
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,230
No.

260
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,350
I'm almost done.

261

Go to sleep.

262
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,350
It's late. Go to sleep.

263
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,590
Otherwise, you'll be too tired to work tomorrow.

264
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,510
Fine.

265
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,990
What kind of heartless company is that?

266
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,660
It's exploiting its employees too hard.

267
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,330
Brother,

268
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,470
it is quite heartless.

269
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,350
I'm reminding you,

270
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,430
you have no future staying in such a company.

271
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,470
Just resign.

272
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,070
Not necessarily.

273
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,530
I'm going back to work, anyway.

274
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,400
Hurry up.

275
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,600
I'll go to bed soon.

276

Have a good sleep.

277
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:03,830
Be good.

278
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,730
You'll become a beauty after sleeping.

279
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,770

I can adjust it now.

can arrange my schedule like that?

313
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,830
Do you demand your boss to work for you

314
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,830
just because you want a leave?

315
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,800
That's not what I meant.

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,940
Thursday and Friday.

384
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,540
I don't know which day yet.

385
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,830
What a coincidence.

386
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,090
Dinner's on Saturday.

387
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,640
Honey,

388
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,070
can I not go?

389
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,990
Why?

390
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,430
I don't have common topics

391
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,080
with your friends.

392
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,310
They always talked about

393
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,350
the global economy.

394
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,070
I...

395
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,470
What can I say about that?

396
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,070
And they are all arrogant.

397
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,230
They talk a lot of gossip.

398
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,470
It's all negative.

399
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,990
They all come

400
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,750
in couples.

401
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,170
You're not going?

402
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,230
I really don't want to go.

403
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,960
I don't know what to say to them.

404
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,350
Okay.

405
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,310
Then, don't go.

406
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,120
Good.

407
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,710
They are curious

408
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,200
when we'll get divorced anyway.

409
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,130
Look at your friends.

410
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,830
What are they thinking about?

411
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,270
Divorce?

412
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,650
Why are they so gossipy?

413
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:06,990
Just let them think

414
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,380
we're divorced.

415
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,329
Aren't they crazy?

416
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,640
I'm not going.

417
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,530
Are you going out later?

418
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,420
I'm going to start my career again.

419
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,849
I've got a job as a Fashion Week model.

420
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,660
Why do you start working so hard all of a sudden?

421
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,610
Look.

422
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,560
Since I got injured,

423
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,660
unemployed,

424
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,630
and unpopular,

425
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,160
my connection

426
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,110
and resources

427
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,530
disappeared so quickly.

428
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,220
But recently,

429
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,400
I've been enlightened by life.

430
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,900
I was crazy.

431
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,800
How could I entrust my fate

432
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,530
to others?

433
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,800
I can only rely on myself

434
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,280
to get the dignity and sense of safety I want.

435
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,730
That makes sense.

436
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,540
For your goal,

437
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,890
hurry up and eat more

438
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:00,960
to replenish your energy.

439
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,240
Those are all carbohydrates.

440
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,830
I'll just drink this.

441
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,360
Then why did you ask me to buy so many?

442
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,830
I'll be satisfied by looking at them.

443
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,840
Besides,

444
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,110
you and I are as close as one.

445
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,770
You eat them is like I eat them.

446
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,270
Is your injury

447
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,600
completely recovered?

448
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,870
I don't think it'll be a big problem.

449
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,720
I really think the runway

450
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,520
is the only place where I belong.

451
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,800
Okay.

452
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,100
I'll wait

453
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,550
to see your show.

454
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,990
These

455
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,050
are two stands for legal counseling.

456
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,000
Lawyer Xu is here.

457
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:43,930
Thank you.

458
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:44,950
Lawyer Xu,

459
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,200
let me introduce

460
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,230
today's volunteer,

461
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:47,790
Miss Xu.

462
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,550
Hello, Lawyer Xu.

463
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:52,990
Miss Xu.

464
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,070
If you need anything,

465
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,990
just ask him.

466
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,910
Lawyer Xu,

467
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,110
I'll get back to work.

468
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,240
I'm here to work.

469
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,370
Don't make trouble.

470
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,960
This is also my workplace.

471
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,210
What?

472
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,100
Do you think I'm just a troublemaker?

473
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,230
I have a serious attitude

474
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,430
towards work.

475
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,480
Look at the things you brought.

476
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
You're here just for fun.

477
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,080
Now you don't understand.

478
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,160
These will come in handy later.

479
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,180
Just wait and see.

480
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,750
Young man,

481
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,590
I just want to ask about this.

482
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,780
I can't

483
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,450
raise this child anymore.

484
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,580
Where are his parents?

485
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,200
His parents divorced a long time ago.

486
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,920
They went out to work

487
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,220
and don't care about their child anymore.

488
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,750
Sir, why don't you

489
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,880
consult the second male lawyer over there?

490
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,340
I'll take care of the kid for you, okay?

491
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,130
Okay.

492
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,000
Thank you, Miss.

493
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,470
Let me take you there.

494
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,310
Thank you.

495
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,600
Kid,

496
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,230
would you like to take a rest with me over there?

497
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,330
Let's go.

498
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,350
Hello, my name is Xu Yan.

499
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,580
Here you are, Sir. What's going on?

500
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,170
What's your name?

501
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,900
Have a seat.

502
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,130
Do you want some snacks?

503
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,520
Well then…

504
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,490
[Meticulous Service]

505
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,150
Do you want some drinks?

506
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,450
[Meticulous Service]

507
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,680
It's a puppy.

508
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,780
Here you are.

509
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,460
Tong.

510
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,220
[Meticulous Service]

511
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:57,990
Come on.

512
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,070
Let's go home.

513
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,310
Tong.

514
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,520
[Meticulous Service]

515
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,390
Take them back and enjoy them.

516
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,190
Thank you, Miss.

517
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,070
You're welcome.

518
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,040
Quick. Thank this lady.

519
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,990
Thank you.

520
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,070
Bye.

521
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,750
Bye.

522
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,610
-Okay, let's go home.
-Bye, Tong.

523
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,210
Bye.

524
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,120
So this is what the snacks are for.

525
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,320
How did you think of it?

526
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,520
When I worked as a volunteer before,

527
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,350
I ran into this kind of situation a lot.

528
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,910
The kid may be little,

529
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,910
but he can understand everything.

530
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,510
If we say his parents have abandoned him in front of him,

531
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,770
it's really cruel.

532
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,980
So,

533
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,090
I hope we can avoid the kids

534
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,920
when discussing these things.

535
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,520
Don't think I didn't notice you were peeking at me.

536
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,120
Are you shy?

537
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,080
I caught you.

538
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,070
Xu Yan.

539
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,220
How was the movie today? Was it good?

540
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,550
Yes. I was so touched in the end.

541
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,910
Are you satisfied with the food?

542
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,550
Not bad.

543
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,150
Well,

544
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,700
we have a dispute about the residence base

545
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,390
and a case where the children

546
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,870
refuse to support their parents.

547
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,710
Give me the files of these two cases.

548
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,390
I'll sort them out.

549
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:41,950
Okay.

550
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,240
Let me help you.

551
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,000
Thank you.

552
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,670
This is the case of the dispute
about the residence base.

553
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,030
The other…

554
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,000
Xu Yan!

555
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,830
Jialin?

556
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,510
Why are you here?

557
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,760
I'm here to bring you supper.

558
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,150
It is still hot.

559
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,470
So considerate.

560
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,280
I'm not as considerate as Mr. Xu.

561
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,150
You even carry Ms. Huang's bag.

562
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,080
Give me the rest materials.

563
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,200
Okay.

564
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,070
You must be tired after a day's work.

565
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,330
Go back and rest early.

566
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,660
I didn't sleep well last night.

567
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,080
I have been having a headache all day today.

568
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,890
There's a whole day tomorrow.

569
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,940
I'll get going, then.

570
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,620
Okay.

571
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,840
Jialin.

572
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,210
Aren't you going back?

573
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,630
I'll help Lawyer Xu

574

575
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,910
You should go back and rest.

576
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,870
I'm not tired.

577
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,220
I'm young.

578
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,200

579
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,830
I slept very well last night.

580
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,430
Well,

581
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,630
I'll leave the work to you two.

582
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,590
I'm leaving.

583
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,130
I'm considerate, too.

584
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,080
Can I help you with anything?

585
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:29,970
Just sit quietly.

586
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,200
That'd be a help to me.

587
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,550
Did you catch a cold?

588
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,480
Drink it while it's hot.

589
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,630
You're awake.

590
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,130
Because you were with me,

591
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,570
I slept soundly.

592
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,740
Look.

593
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,640
A new day

594
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,710
begins.

595
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,480
Do you remember

596
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,660
the last time we watched

597
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,950
the sunrise together?

598
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,410
Have we watched the sunrise together before?

599
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,660
Of course.

600
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,560
When I was in high school,

601
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,400
I didn't do well academically.

602
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,590
My brother asked you to tutor me.

603
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,500
At that time,

604
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,570
no one in my whole family believed
I could get into a good university.

605
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,630
You're the only one

606
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,370
who supported me

607
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,830
and encouraged me.

608
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,940
On the night before the first mock test,

609
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,440
I was so nervous that I couldn't sleep.

610
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,210
I called you.

611
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,800
Who'd expect

612
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,520
that you'd come to teach me all night?

613
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,950
And you even sent me to the exam the next morning.

614
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,160
That was the first time

615
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,460
we watched the sunrise together.

616
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,050
You even remember that?

617
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,420
Of course.

618
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,390
I remember everything

619
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,790
about you.

620
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,600
I still remember,

621
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,850
that morning, to thank you,

622
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,980
I specially added pork tenderloin

623
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,140
and dried meat floss

624
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,220
in your rice rolls.

625
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,900
It may be

626
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,880
insignificant to you,

627
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,170
but everything related to you

628
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,970
is very important to me.

629
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,200
You made me know

630
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,480
one will succeed if he works hard.

631
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,270
It's also you

632
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,540
who made me experience, for the first time,

633
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,970
the happiness of being trusted.

634
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,880
Grandma, I received your package.

635
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,720
I'll go back to see you
when my current work here is done.

636
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,560
Take care of yourself.

637
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,750
Okay, bye, Grandma.

638
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,170
Were you talking to Grandma?

639
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,820
She sent us honey.

640
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,590
So much?

641
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,090
That's for us.

642
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,680
The rest is for Ye Han and Jiacheng.

643
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,990
Grandma asked me

644
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,280
why I rejected Jiacheng.

645
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,550
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.

646
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,810
We talked about you that day.

It's okay.

648
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,870
Please bring it to them when you're free.

649
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,800
This is our local honey.

650
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,730
My grandma asked me to give this to you.

651
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,640
She said she was sorry

652
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,000
to let you go back empty-handed last time.

653
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,840
I'm the one who should be embarrassed.

654
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,320
She's too kind.

655
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,160
This is for Ye Han.

656

Please give it to him for me.

657
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,650
Why don't you give it to him yourself?

658

I don't think he's here.

or "I'm ready now"

673

The article explaining telepathy with science

she was right there,

00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,830
Moreover, I don't know how I'll be ignored.

763
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,860
What happened?

764
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,400
Let me tell you.

765
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,230
I realized

766
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,050
a very important principle.

767
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,830
What is it?

768
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,340
You can't part

769
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,730
during a vacation

770
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,740
when you have nothing to do.

771
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,750
Wait.

772
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,050
Whom did you part from?

773
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,110
I made it clear.

774
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,290
And I said goodbye to Ye Han.

775
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,930
But…

776
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,070
why can't I feel better?

777
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,560
Of course not.

778
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,250
Because you can't let go.

779
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,800
What can't I let go?

780
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,590
Ye Han.

781
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,480
No way.

782
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,820
Really?

783
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,000
But at least,

784
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,230
everyone has returned to the way it was.

785
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,220
It should be easier now.

786
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,620
Why are you always considerate for others?

787
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,670
You like Ye Han.

788
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,030
It doesn't matter whether I like him or not.

789
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,640
Most importantly,

790
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,220
when everyone is relaxed,

791
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,840
I can be relaxed.

792
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,470
How many times have I told you?

793
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:36,120
Think about yourself first.

794
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,680
Okay.

795
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,670
Go ahead.

796
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,020
Don't get too late.

797
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,220
Take it easy.

798
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,340
Think about it.

799
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,120
[Shanlu Restaurant]

800
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,860
Everyone is here.

801
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,360
Let's eat.

802
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,860
I'd like to propose a toast.

803
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,320
Thank you for your hard work these days.

804
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,820
On behalf of the village committee

805
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,370
and all the villagers,

806
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,350
I'll say thank you for your help.

807
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
I don't know what else to say.

808
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,950
I'll...

809
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,250
just drink the wine.

810
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,500
Bottoms up for me. Suit yourselves.

811
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,240
Cheers.

812
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,170
Come on, let's eat.

813
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Let's eat.

814
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,760
Eat.

815
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,840
Xu Yan,

816
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,420
you're caring about me.

817
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,230
Why would a kid drink?

818
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,730
Lawyer Xu, let's have a drink.

819
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,380
You've been working hard these days.

820
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,510
You too.

821
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,300
Jialin.

822
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,560
Let's have a drink, too.

823
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,020
You've also been working hard these days.

824
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,460
You can just drink juice.

825
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,500
How can juice show my sincerity?

826
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,130
Here's to you, Ms. Huang.

827
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,870
Thank you

828
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,630
for taking care of Xu Yan.

829
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,780
Bottoms up for me. Suit yourself.

830
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,870
Drink slowly.

831
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,960
Jialin seems like a good drinker.

832
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,780
I can drink a lot.

833
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,350
I just drank a little.

834
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,630
We'd better send you back.

835
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,920
Lawyer Xu, I'll take them back first.

836
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,550
Okay, thank you for the meal.

837
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,150
It's okay.

838
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,030
I'll contact you later.

839
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,870
Okay. Keep in touch.

840
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:40,910
Bye. Bye.

841
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,520
Aren't you leaving?

842
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,060
I'll wait for her to sober up.

843
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,420
Okay, I'm leaving.

844
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,670
Take care.

845
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,600
Xu Yan,

846
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,540
today,

847
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,590
you cared about me.

848
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,640
It's so good

849
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,610
that you care about me.

850
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
I'm so happy.

851
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,900
Xu Yan,

852
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,040
I really…

853
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,570
like you so much.

854
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,770
I like you.

855
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,730
I like you so much.

856
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,780
Can you

857
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,930
like me back, too?

858
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,730
Grandma.

859
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,900
Are you up?

860
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,120
Yes.

861
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,330
Have you received the honey I sent you?

862
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,050
Yes.

863
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,820
I already tried it.

864
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,980
It's delicious.

865
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:30,030
Did you give the honey to those two bad guys?

866
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,800
Yes.

867
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,510
Why do you care so much about them?

868
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,960
They came all the way here,

869
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,100
but I let them go home empty-handed.

870
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,500
I always felt bad about it.

871
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,700
We young people

872
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,280
are not that particular.

873
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,640
This is common courtesy.

874
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,940
Do you know?

875
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:50,900
Actually,

876
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,860
I have nothing important to say.

877
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,510
I just want to make sure you've got the honey.

878
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,810
Are you okay?

879
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,970
I'm hanging up.

880
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,280
Don't worry.

881
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,580
Bye.
