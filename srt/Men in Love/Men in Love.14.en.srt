Hello, Xiaoxiao.

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,070
Hello, you look taller.

8
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,230
We're going to buy some groceries.

It must be over 10,000 RMB.

16
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,270
Almost.

17

-Auntie Wang.
-You didn’t bring your boyfriend back?

20
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,510
I don't have a boyfriend.

21
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,370
Let me introduce someone to you.

My daughter is still not married.

Look at her.

28
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,790
What kind of life is she having?

29
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,900
Right, why is she proud of being single?

30
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,990
No one will look after her
when she's old if she do not get married.

Do you remember my nephew Wenguang?

91

You two often had fun together when you were children.

92
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,990
He used to be a little fat.

93
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,350
Oh, Wenguang.

94
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,480
Yes, I remember him.

95

He

96
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,790
is thin now.

97
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,159
He is very handsome.

98
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,550
He's also tall.

99
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,280
He should be around 1.75m tall.

100
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,830
No, 1.78m.

101
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,670
He's tall, right?

102
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,350
Yes.

103
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,720
He also works in Shanghai.

104
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,470
He's a finance guy

105
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,530
at a big company.

106
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,460

Again?

111
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,720
I am always a matchmaker.

112
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,120
They're young people. Let them decide for themselves.

113
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,000
No, Sis.

114
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,590
That's not right.

115
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,590
Let me tell you,

116
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,030
we have to help them.

117
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,390
I don't think so.

118
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,350
Young people don't like blind dates.

119
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,390
Okay.

120
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,520
Auntie Fang,

121
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,590
I agree to see your nephew.

122
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,470
You can introduce him to me.

123
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,350
Good.

124
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,270
See?

125
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,710
It's a good thing that they get to know each other.

126
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,590
Right?

127
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,710
He might be back now.

128
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,990
I'll go see him.

129
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,430
Wait for my good news.

130
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,390
Wait for my good news. I mean it.

131
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,909
See you, Auntie Fang.

132
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,860
What are you doing?

133
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,470
Grandma.

134
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,470
If I

135
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,110
don't agree to see her nephew,

136
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,390
she will keep coming to our home

137
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,250
until the Spring Festival comes.

138
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,590
You're right.

139
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,540
Let's go inside.

140
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,909
Let's take a break.

141
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,730
Let me help you.

142
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,140
No need.

143
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,350
Here's your oat latte.

144
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,550
Hot.

145
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,590
Half sugar. Half coconut milk.

146
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,710
Double espresso.

147
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,140
Here's your iced latte.

148
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,860
No sugar. Less ice.

149
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,210
Thank you.

150
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,710
Can you order the same thing next time?

151
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,790
Your likes are so different.

152
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,830
I can't remember all of them.

153
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,990
No.

154
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,890
You just enjoy making things difficult for me.

155
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,280
By the way,

156
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,010
we need a new coach for our basketball team.

157
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,240
Why?

158
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,520
Xiaoxiao is our coach.

159
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,230
She quit.

160
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,600
What?

161
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,190
You need to find a new coach.

162
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,590
I can't

163
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,060
be your coach anymore.

164
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Why so sudden?

165
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,150
Is something wrong?

166
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,580
The Bicycle Racing Classics is coming.

167
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,780
It's very important to my bicycle team.

168
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,680
It will be my first time

169
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,130
to lead the team alone and participate in the race.

170
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,140
I want to concentrate

171
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:53,010
on the training for the race.

172
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,920
What should we do?

173
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,130
Well.

174
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,680
I have to find Xiaoxiao

175
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,080
and talk to her in person.

176
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,510
Where can you find her?

177
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,520
You said you couldn't contact her.

178
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,960
But I have to.

179
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,890
Can you get in touch with her?

180
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,090
She asked me not to contact her, either.

181
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,090
You call her.

182
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,110
Xiaoxiao.

183
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,030
Grandma.

184
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,920
Are you preparing the vegetables?

185
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,990
You've thrown away many edible parts.

186
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,120
Are you absent-minded?

187
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,760
Has your problem solved?

188
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,570
I'm working on it.

189
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,480
So it's not solved.

190
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,610
I need to tell you,

191
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,130
you can't

192
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,240
hide everything from others.

193
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,360
You have to speak it out.

194
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,280
Understand?

195
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,840
Mrs. Wu, a bottle of soy sauce, please.

196
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,720
Coming.

197
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,670
I'll go.

198
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,690
Okay.

199
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,590
-Hello?
-Hello?

200
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,130
Is it

201
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,720
Li Xiaoxiao's phone?

202
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,860
Yes.

203
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,100
Xiaoxiao is serving a customer.

204
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,110
Customer?

205
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,790
You are?

206
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,380
I'm Xiaoxiao's grandma.

207
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,320
Hello, Grandma.

208
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
I have something

209
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,400
to tell her.

210
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,470
Should I put her on the phone?

211
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,860
No, thanks.

212
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,530
I want to talk to her in person.

213
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,400
Grandma, would you mind sending me your address?

214
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,640
My address?

215
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

216
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,260
Hangzhou.

217
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:45,010
Okay, I got it.

218
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,060
Thank you.

219
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,280
Goodbye, Grandma.

220
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,620
Xiaoxiao went back to her hometown.

221
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,620
[Zhuantang, Hangzhou]

222
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,850
What are you going to do?

223
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,090
I'm going to find her.

224
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,130
Listen.

225
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,470
I got the address.

226
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,350
Don't take my credit.

227
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,950
You're going to see her, too?

228
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,750
Why not?

229
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,950
Why are you going to see her?

230
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,140
None of your business.

231
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,440
Stop making things more difficult.

232
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,510
I'm making things more difficult?

233
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,950
Yes, it's you.

234
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,230
You caused all the problems.

235
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,470
So let me solve them.

236
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,960
You are the biggest problem.

237
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,620
Give it to me.

238
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,020
No.

239
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:14,630
Give it to me.

240
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,350
No way.

241
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,570
-Give it to me.
-No way.

242
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,220
Stop it, you two.

243
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,510
What's wrong with you two today?

244
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,220
None of your business.

245
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,470
How about

246
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,830
we go together?

247
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,410
Why are you going to see her?

248
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,690
She is avoiding you.

249
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,980
Don't you understand?

250
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,700
I caused the problem
so it has to be solved by me.

251
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,840
She said

252
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,750
she needed some time.

253
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,990
If I don't go see her,

254
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,750
will she come to see me?

255
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,320
It made me feel sorry

256
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,530
that she quit the team because of me.

257
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,470
You know

258
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,710
why she left.

259
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,470
Why did you

260
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,750
hurt her?

261
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,470
I didn't...

262
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,650
Forget it.

263
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,260
Then tell me

264
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,290
why you don't like Xiaoxiao?

265
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,190
Let me ask you.

266
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,350
Why do you like Xiaoxiao?

267
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,810
I asked my question first.

268
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,230
How should I put it?

269
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,750
Well,

270
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,410
I don't feel anything for her.

271
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,110
But I have feelings for her.

272
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,230
So I hope

273
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,110
you will leave

274
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,830
as soon as possible

275
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,030
after you talk to her.

276
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,750
Okay.

277
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,830
Do you want me to pull over now?

278
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,520
I'll take out my car key

279
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,580
and go back right away. You want this?

280
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,590
Tell me.

281
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,400
Since when did you start to have feelings for her?

282
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,490
Well...

283
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,190
I was smitten by her

284
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
when I saw her

285
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,210
for the first time.

286
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,760
Understand?

287
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,460
From the first time you saw her?

288
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,150
At the tenth anniversary party?

289
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,050
What happened that night?

290
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,130
Xiaoxiao.

291
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,080
Here's your favorite drink.

292
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:12,950
Here.

293
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,750
Give it to me.

294
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,130
Thank you.

295
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,590
What a hearty meal!

296
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:22,810
Try the vinegar fish.

297
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,710
You take a bite.

298
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,590
You, too.

299
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,350
Hello.

300
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,590
Hello, you two.

301
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,310
You're having a meal.

302
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,390
Hello, Auntie.

303
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,440
Take a seat. Join us.

304
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,780
No, thanks. I've had a meal.

305
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,650
You go on.

306
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,650
Xiaoxiao. Here.

307
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,980
This is Wenguang.

308
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,080
-Hello.
-Hello.

309
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,870
When you were little kids,

310
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,630
you two often

311
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,470
played games of make-believe together.

312
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,470
You played the mother and he played the father, right?

313
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,390
That was a long time a ago.

314
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,920
You really have a good memory.

315
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,640
Look.

316
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,990
How time flies!

317
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,990
Now,

318
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,110
you're old enough to get married.

319
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,070
Fang,

320
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:04,970
have a seat.

321
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,940
-Let’s talk while eating.
-Yeah.

322
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,780
Yes.

323
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,470
Let's leave.

324
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,830
Give the two young people some privacy.

325
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,160
I haven't finished yet.

326
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,050
-Let’s go.
-No.

327
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,350
Let's go.

328
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,360
Xiaoxiao,

329
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,040
you two have a nice chat.

330
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,010
Grandma.

331
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,470
Don't pull me.

332
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,830
Let's go. Let's go.

333
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,640
Xiaoxiao.

334
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,360
Long time no see.

335
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,260
Yes.

336
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,590
Have a seat. Let's eat.

337
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:29,750
Okay.

338
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,830
I'll get you chopsticks.

339
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,630
No need.

340
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,070
I don't eat fish.

341
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,530
You enjoy the fish.

342
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,640
-Have a seat.
-You drink this.

343
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,630
Okay, I like it.

344
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,850
I heard

345
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,370
you're the coach for a men's bicycle team.

346
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,790
This must be a tiring job.

347
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,180
That's fine.

348
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,460
The athletes are more tired than me.

349
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,710
Physically,

350
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,710
you're fine.

351
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,010
But financially,

352
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,190
you must be facing a lot pressure.

353
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,120
This isn't a well-paid job, right?

354
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,710
Not that bad.

355
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,770
Did you buy an apartment in Shanghai?

356
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,730
No.

357
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,870
I've bought one.

358
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,830
Good for you.

359
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,760
Congratulations.

360
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,090
Will you still work

361
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,760
after getting married?

362
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,630
Of course.

363
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,450
I'll keep working whether I get married or not.

364
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,840
Xiaoxiao,

365
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,280
I think we are a perfect match.

366
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,550
And I'm very satisfied with you.

367
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,660
Let's exchange our WeChat numbers

368
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,920
so as to know each other more.

369
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,710
I'm an accountant

370
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,510
at a state-owned enterprise.

371
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,790
It's a stable career.

372
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,080
I don't think

373
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,250
you need to work after we get married.

374
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,850
Actually, my earnings should be enough for us.

375
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,950
How much is enough?

376
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,510
If I had known this before,

377
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,280
I should have brought my helicopter here.

378
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,630
It would take only 15 minutes
to get here by helicopter.

379
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,590
Yes.

380
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,600
But there's no parking apron.

381
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,600
Then buy one.

382
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,630
It's not hard.

383
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,650
Right.

384
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,820
You are a nice guy.

385
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,190
There must be many girls chasing you.

386
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,870
I broke up a few months ago.

387
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,750
Now I want to find

388
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,830
a good and obedient girl

389
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,030
to spend the rest of my life with me.

390
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,690
Oh no.

391
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,450
This date sucks.

392
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,560
Stop.

393
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,090
I'm sorry.

394
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,980
I

395
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,260
am not that kind of girl you want.

396
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,630
We're unsuited to each other.

397
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,970
Then let's

398
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,520
not waste our time.

399
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,160
Goodbye.

400
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,310
See you.

401
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,880
You two, come here.

402
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,280
You were being absurd.

403
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,540
No.

404
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,660
Do you have a helicopter?

405
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,840
Can you afford a parking apron?

406
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,590
We were just kidding.

407
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,550
Why were you doing that stupid thing with him?

408
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,590
I couldn't stand him

409
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,990
showing off how much money he could make.

410
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,060
That's true.

411
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,910
What are you doing here?

412
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,450
You quit the job without telling us.

413
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,490
The basketball team needs you.

414
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,120
How can I

415
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
still be your basketball coach now?

416
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,630
You know why I came back.

417
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,870
For the blind date?

418
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,750
No, I came back to have a rest.

419
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,990
Recently,

420
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,680
so many complicated things have happened.

421
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,340
They're giving me a headache.

422
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,300
You two, go back.

423
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,750
I don't want to see you now.

424
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,700
How did you know my address?

425
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,530
I told them.

426
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,140
Grandma.

427
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,670
You shouldn't tell others our address easily.

428
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,000
What if they were bad guys?

429
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,120
Bad guys?

430
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,910
Are all the bad guys from the city so handsome?

431
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,920
Hello, Grandma.

432
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,050
I'm the captain of Xiaoxiao's basketball team.

433
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,110
My name is Xu Jiacheng.

434
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,590
Nice to meet you.

435
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,830
Nice to meet you, too.

436
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,750
Hello, Grandma.

437
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,680
My name is Ye Han.

438
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,430
We talked on the phone just now.

439
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,230
You're so tall.

440
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,990
And so handsome.

441
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,890
You must be tired.

442
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,980
Have you eaten yet?

443
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,350
Yes, we have.

444
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,870
You only had lunch, right?

445
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,580
Come, Xiaoxiao.

446
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,630
Show them around.

447
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,130
They are leaving soon.

448
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,430
Soon?

449
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,160
They have other things to do.

450
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,920
Actually,

451
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,610
there's nothing important to do for us now.

452
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,400
Right?

453
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,310
Yes.

454
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,590
He's right.

455
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,190
Then...

456
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,510
Since you have time now,

457
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,830
stay and have a meal with us.

458
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,590
Okay, Grandma.

459
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,590
I'll make two more dishes.

460
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,430
Okay.

461
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,870
No need

462
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,740
to do that.

463
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,170
It's for all of us.

464
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,670
We'll get them two more pairs of chopsticks.

465
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,620
Since Grandma has invited us,

466
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,790
we'll stay.

467
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,270
Thank you so much, Grandma.

468
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,470
You're welcome.

469
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,869
I'll go make more dishes.

470
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,660
Grandma.

471
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,650
Is there anything we can help with?

472
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:09,990
No, thanks.

473
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,750
We're young and strong.

474
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,950
We have a lot of strength.

475
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,069
You're strong.

476
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,990
Then there is one thing you can do.

477
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,500
You shouldn't have said you could help.

478
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,750
If I had known this,

479
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,360
I would've been be silent.

480
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,240
What are you waiting for? Go!

481
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,470
Why don't you do it first?

482
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,630
Because I

483
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,150
kept silent.

484
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,230
You got us this trouble. You go first.

485
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,240
Go.

486
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,870
Ye Han.

487
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,390
H-How about we just give up?

488
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,890
L-Let's catch a hen.

489
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,750
I-I think it might be easier

490
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,000
to catch a hen.

491
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,980
No.

492
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,620
Hens are kept to lay eggs.

493
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,090
Catch that rooster.

494
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,410
No, no, no. Ye Han.

495
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,150
I realize

496
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,010
I have a fear of chicken beaks.

497
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,710
I can't do this.

498
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,030
It's time for you

499
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,870
to overcome this fear.

500
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,430
-“Fight poison with poison”.
-No, no, no.

501
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,710
The bigger your fear is,

502
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,710
the more you have to overcome it.

503
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,390
Bro, no, no.

504
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:22,270
[Xu Yan]

505
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,230
Sorry.

506
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,880
The subscriber you dialed is not available now.

507
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,070
Please...

508
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,070
What's up?

509
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,310
Hey, I'm not going home tonight.

510
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:38,990
Let me tell you.

511
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,470
You'll have supper alone.

512
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,750
You're not coming home tonight?

513
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,190
Are you...

514
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,470
It's my business.

515
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,990
Stop gossiping, you kid.

516
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,390
Have a nice meal.

517
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,280
Bye.

518
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,710
[Xu Jiacheng]

519
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,150
Fine.

520
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,940
[Numbers]

521
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:08,050
[Xu Yan]

522
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,270
Sorry.

523
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,600
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

524
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,070
What is he doing?

525
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,990
I'm so bored.

526
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,990
Same spot. Come and have fun tonight.

527
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,330
He didn't answer my calls.

528
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,670
I'll have fun by myself.

529
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,350
Here.

530
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,480
Grandma.

531
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,040
Don't bother.

532
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,390
I'll find them a restaurant.

533
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,120
Your problem is still not solved.

534
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,520
It must have something to do with them.

535
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,070
The problem is there.

536
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,620
You can't avoid it forever.

537
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,380
Look.

538
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,270
They even came to find you.

539
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,830
Be brave and face it.

540
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,110
Grandma is here. Go.

541
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,210
Thank you, Grandma.

542
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,870
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

543
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,910
Let's eat.

544
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,140
After you.

545
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:19,840
Okay.

546
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,340
You're polite.

547
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
Let's eat.

548
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,740
Save your affectation.

549
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
What do you think?

550
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,390
The chicken is really good.

551
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,710
Homemade chicken, good.

552
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,430
Yes.

553
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,690
Homemade dishes are always the best.

554
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:36,890
Here.

555
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,380
Grandma.

556
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,550
We'll do it ourselves.

557
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,190
Okay.

558
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,230
Grandma.

559
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,430
They're going to drive.

560
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,890
They can't drink alcohol.

561
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,510
You can't drink?

562
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,910
We can. We can drink.

563
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,510
Yes.

564
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,800
Good wine should be served with good dishes.

565
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,880
Yes.

566
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,150
Here.

567
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:51,960
Okay.

568
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,350
Let me welcome you, our guests from afar.

569
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,820
Thank you, Grandma.

570
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,700
You like Xiaoxiao?

571
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,070
Grandma.

572
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,630
What are you talking about?

573
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,650
He likes Yiwen.

574
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,950
Grandma, here.

575
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,700
So you like Xiaoxiao.

576
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:26,760
Sorry, Grandma.

577
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,790
Sorry.

578
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,610
-What are you panicking about?
-I’m sorry.

579
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,990
Do you really like her?

580
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,560
Grandma.

581
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,290
Yes, I like her.

582
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,230
Good.

583
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,060
Cheers.

584
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,200
This is for Xiaoxiao.

585
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,810
Let's eat.

586
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,970
This is really good.

587
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,790
Are you okay?

588
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,870
Are you drunk?

589
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,270
No.

590
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,710
I drank

591
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,270
a little too much.

592
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,920
I need some fresh air.

593
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,690
Look at you.

594
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,160
He got so drunk.

595
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,820
I didn't make him drink.

596
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,860
He wanted to drink that much.

597
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,280
Because you wanted to drink. He was being polite.

598
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,190
Fine.

599
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:33,560
I'll make some mini rice balls with sweet rice wine.

600
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,010
It'll help you

601
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,950
sober up.

602
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,840
Thank you, Grandma.

603
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,770
You're welcome.

604
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,540
I need to use the bathroom.

605
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,480
Xiaoxiao,

606
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,990
I came here

607
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,020
because I was worried about you.

608
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,270
I'm sorry for making you worried.

609
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,610
I think

610
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,280
we need to

611
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:03,940
figure out

612
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,530
how to solve our problem.

613
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,230
I know.

614
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,990
But now,

615
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,470
I don't know how to face you

616
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,190
or Yiwen.

617
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,190
Sorry, I told Grandma

618
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,270
about you and Yiwen.

619
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,230
Sorry.

620
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,230
It's okay.

621
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,310
If that makes you happy,

622
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,950
you can tell everyone.

623
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,160
I should say sorry to you, Xiaoxiao.

624
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,710
It's not your fault.

625
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,880
I...

626
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,550
I

627
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,090
ignored the feelings that others might have for me.

628
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,710
I discovered them too late.

629
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,120
I hid my feelings from you.

630
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,370
It's not your fault.

631
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,860
You don't have to care about how I would feel.

632
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,940
When we meet,

633
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,480
you can choose to ignore me

634
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,150
if you feel awkward.

635
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,370
You can choose not to see me.

636
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,520
As long as it makes you feel easy,

637
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,120
just do it.

638
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,820
And if you need me,

639
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,500
I will always be there for you.

640
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,510
I hope you can be happy.

641
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,310
I'll always support you.

642
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,900
You're my good friend that I don't want to lose.

643
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,760
Got it.

644
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,990
Are you okay?

645
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,190
You're so drunk.

646
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,950
Not that drunk.

647
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,140
I'm fine.

648
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,750
You and my grandma

649
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,680
were happy when you were drinking.

650
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,670
You were happy too

651
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,730
when talking with Jiacheng just now.

652
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,810
How did you know?

653
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,820
So you didn't have a good chat?

654
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,430
Are you going back

655
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,260
to drink and feel sad again?

656
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,080
I wasn't sad.

657
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,990
I

658
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,860
wanted to say goodbye.

659
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,200
Say goodbye?

660
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,230
I wanted to say goodbye to my past.

661
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
Including me?

662
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,280
What?

663
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,780
Will you

664
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,040
say goodbye to me?

665
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,580
Do you know why I'm here?

666
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,680
I'm waiting for an answer.

667
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,430
You said you weren't ready to answer me.

668
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,300
Can you give me your answer now?

669
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,590
Grandma.

670
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,690
This can help you sober up.

671
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,940
You heard everything, right?

672
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,550
I'm sorry.

673
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,270
Don't be sorry.

674
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,930
If I were a man,

675
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,880
I would pick Yiwen too.

676
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,440
She's pretty.

677
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,850
She's a lady

678
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,210
and she is a supermodel.

679
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,980
Grandma, you misunderstood.

680
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,570
I was kidding. I got you.

681
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,180
But I meant it.

682
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,400
To me, Yiwen

683
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,970
is like my granddaughter.

684
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,510
I thought

685
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,870
they were just roommates in Shanghai.

686
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,730
Xiaoxiao and Yiwen grew up together.

687
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,590
Yiwen's parents

688
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,050
divorced

689
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,370
when she was a little girl.

690
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,550
After the divorce,

691
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,440
her mother passed away.

692
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,780
Her father was a sailor.

693
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,780
He was busy with his work and not at home all the time.

694
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,840
He didn't have time to look after her.

695
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,430
She was such a poor little girl.

696
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,600
Luckily,

697
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,430
Xiaoxiao and Yiwen

698
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,220
have been good friends since childhood.

699
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,400
I took Yiwen in

700
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,720
and she lived with us.

701
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,630
I haven't heard about

702
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,990
these things before.

703
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,580
Yiwen did a good job.

704
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,540
She survived all the difficult days.

705
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,920
Seeing her have a good friend like you,

706
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,630
I'm really

707
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:46,780
happy for her.

708
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,370
Grandma.

709
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,580
There're some problems

710
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,820
between me and Yiwen.

711
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,530
Every couple

712
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,770
has problems.

713
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,620
As long as you like each other,

714
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,680
you can solve the problems together

715
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,300
and overcome the difficulties together.

716
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,300
Am I right?

717
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,310
Yes.

718
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,280
But I don't know what to do now.

719
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,480
She keeps ignoring me.

720
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,540
Follow me.

721
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,620
Come.

722
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,870
Look.

723
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,200
Yiwen lived in the room when she was a child.

724
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,460
Look at these paintings.

725
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,340
Yiwen drew them in her childhood.

726
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,830
Yiwen

727
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,660
has loved beautiful things since childhood.

728
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,870
She had deft hands.

729
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,120
She liked drawing so much.

730
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,530
She enjoyed

731
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,120
making clothes for dolls.

732
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,750
She told Xiaoxiao

733
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,290
when she grew up,

734
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,990
she would be

735
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,730
a fashion designer.

736
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:51,870
Her major

737
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,390
was also fashion design.

738
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,130
Look.

739
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,130
Before she graduated,

740
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,530
there was a fashion show.

741
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,350
The model who was supposed to wear her clothes suddenly fell sick.

742
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,750
And she couldn't find another model to replace the old one.

743
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,790
So she had to wear the clothes and finish the show herself.

744
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,180
She was noticed by a talent scout

745
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,850
who came to watch the fashion show.

746
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,050
So

747
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:18,290
what a remarkable coincidence!

748
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,110
Yes.

749
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,580
She did a good job.

750
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,030
She

751
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,580
worked very hard.

752
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,510
At first,

753
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,790
she was not used to walking in high heels.

754
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,620
In order to get used to it,

755
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,630
she even wore high heels at home.

756
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,910
Her feet

757
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,330
were hurt because of it.

758
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,120
But she never gave up.

759
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,990
I never heard her

760
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,580
complain about it

761
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,310
and cry because of the pain.

762
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,350
She wanted to look strong.

763
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,520
She wanted to look strong badly.

764
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,270
Sometimes I could see

765
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,860
that the pain in her feet was huge.

766
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,400
But she pretended it was nothing.

767
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,380
So...

768
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,430
Look.

769
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,680
This

770
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,160
was

771
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,770
her favorite doll.

772
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,630
She made a lot of clothes for the doll.

773
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,520
Look.

774
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,450
Look.

775
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,470
Take it

776
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,400
and give it to Yiwen.

777
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:16,960
Me?

778
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,470
Yes.

779
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,150
If you give it to her,

780
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,740
she will be happy.

781
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,600
Take it.

782
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:21,850
Believe me.

783
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,710
Jiacheng.

784
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,320
If you really like Yiwen,

785
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,910
wait for her.

786
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,660
Give her more time.

787
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:36,690
Okay?

788
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,860
I know, Grandma.

789
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,370
I'm waiting for an answer.

790
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,470
You said you weren't ready to answer me.

791
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,300
Can you give me your answer now?

792
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,200
Should I

793
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,350
give him my answer?

794
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,680
I wanted to say goodbye to my past.

795
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,600
Will you say goodbye

796
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,230
to me?

797
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,760
Xiaoxiao.

798
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,430
You get up early.

799
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,920
Wait a moment.

800
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,680
I'll make breakfast.

801
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,400
Don't bother.

802
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,740
We won't have breakfast.

803
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,960
Sorry for disturbing you last night.

804
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,000
We should go now.

805
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,450
Please help me say thanks to grandma.

806
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,030
Okay.

807
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:53,170
Come back and be our coach.

808
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,940
Blue Dragon needs you.

809
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:06,090
[Gorgon Cake] [Yunpian Cake] [Tangerine Peel]

810
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,350
How about

811
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,989
you go first?

812
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,110
What about you?

813
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,260
How are you going back?

814
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,389
I'll take the high-speed train later.

815
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:18,230
See you at the company.

816
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:18,989
See you.

817
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:19,790
Go. Hurry.

818
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,719
Because of the glorious sunshine,

819
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,110
the darkness in my heart

820
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,580
is disappearing.

821
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,210
Why are you back?

822
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,890
I left my coat.

823
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,560
No.

824
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,970
I left my wallet here.

825
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,190
Xiaoxiao, I left my wallet here.

826
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,350
Help me find it.

827
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,390
Okay.

828
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,020
You young man.

829
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,330
Have you forgot your heart here?

830
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,080
I found it.

831
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:36,950
I found it.

832
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,230
-Here.
-It’s good that you found it.

833
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,830
Then...

834
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:39,660
Grandma.

835
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:40,990
Bye.

836
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,880
Xiaoxiao.

837
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,340
Grandma.

838
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,270
Half of your problem has been solved.

839
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,580
You need to solve the other half of the problem.

840
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,650
If you have something to say to him, say it.

841
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:00,780
Go.

842
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,810
Go.

843
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,690
What a nice day!

844
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,560
My grandma is straightforward.

845
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,760
Hope you don't mind.

846
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,860
Actually, I'm quite happy.

847
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,270
In my childhood,

848
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,270
I was always alone at home.

849
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,950
So it was rare for me

850
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,350
to have dinner with my family.

851
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,030
I will cherish this kind of experience.

852
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,590
And...

853
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,640
What?

854
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,360
I can stay with you a little longer.

855
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,870
I suddenly realized

856
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,150
when I was with you,

857
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,240
we experienced so many wonderful things.

858
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:04,960
Really?

859
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,900
We've created

860
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,050
a lot of wonderful memories together.

861
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,940
We wrote wish notes together.

862
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,830
Are you done?

863
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:25,050
You watched my first show where I was a model on the catwalk.

864
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,810
I set up a tent at your house.

865
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,760
Hello.

866
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,790
We went to Hawaii together.

867
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,510
I stalked you.

868
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,310
Now you admit that you were stalking me.

869
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,760
I won't forget

870
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,320
these wonderful memories.

871
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,880
Nice to meet you.

872
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,490
Thank you for making me so happy all the time.

873
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,800
So...

874
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,530
This is it?

875
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,460
This is the ending for us?

876
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,360
I'm sorry.

877
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,290
So

878
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,850
you've rejected me twice.

879
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,370
Your wish will come true soon.

880
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,850
Li Xiaoxiao,

881
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,400
don't be sad.

882
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,900
I should be sad.

883
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,420
You rejected me.

884
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,520
Ye Han.

885
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,170
Don't feel bad.

886
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,460
If this is your choice,

887
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,280
I respect it.

888
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,570
I hope this is a good farewell

889
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,560
that will get everything back to way it was at first

890
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,020
and give us a good start.

891
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,960
I won't say goodbye.

892
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,480
I should go now.

893
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,150
♫I want to say something♫

894
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,990
♫But I just stand there and stare for a long time♫

895
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,060
♫Maybe I don't want to leave♫

896
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,830
♫It still hurts♫

897
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,110
♫Looking back♫

898
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:06,710
♫I feel so much warmth again♫

899
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,270
♫I'll be with you♫

900
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,700
♫I'll see this through♫

901
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:20,480
♫If we can notice all the considerations♫

902
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:24,130
♫At the intersection of time♫

903
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:29,480
♫Let's not lose each other again♫

904
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,750
Replace

905
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,470
this one.

906
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,510
[IN WORK]

907
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,590
There.

908
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,310
Do it again.

909
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,190
Nice photo.

910
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,630
Yes.

911
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,750
Introduce the photographer to me.

912
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,790
No problem.

913
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,510
And this photo of mine was also taken by him.

914
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,840
This one looks good too.

915
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,320
Is that Tong Yiwen?

916
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,720
It seems to be her.

917
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,030
No way.

918
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,590
A supermodel like her

919
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,370
came for the group interview?

920
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,350
She's just a has-been.

921
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:13,080
Are you sure you want to do this?

922
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,610
This means you'll start over.

923
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,900
Many eyes will be watching you.

924
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,180
They'll say mean words behind your back.

925
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,110
She is over 30.

926
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,970
Why is she here preparing for the interview?

927
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,390
She must think she's as good as she was ten years ago.

928
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,080
Number 32 to Number 35, come in.

929
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,690
Didn't you buy an apartment before getting married?

930
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,180
You can just move in.

931
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,320
It was rented.

932
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,690
I signed a five-year tenancy agreement with the tenant last year.

933
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,040
If I ask him to move out,

934
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,460
I'll breach the agreement.

935
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,220
Ye Han and I have spare rooms in our apartments.

936
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,550
You don't need to live in a hotel.

937
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,620
Xu Yan just hates you two.

938
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,310
He hates us? Why doesn't he hate you?

939
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,470
Do you have a spare room in your apartment?

940
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:58,830
I do.

941
00:42:58,830 --> 00:42:59,830
And Yun is also there.

942
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:00,890
Do you want to come?

943
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,270
Don't exaggerate.

944
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,760
I'm fine staying in a hotel.

945
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,360
But,

946
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:08,320
your friends have spare rooms.

947
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,980
Why do you still want to live in a hotel?

948
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,510
You are wasting your money.

949
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,310
Xu Yan.

950
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,830
Go to Jiacheng's place.

951
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,430
Yes.

952
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:16,760
You can live in my apartment.

953
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,840
Don't bother.

954
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,780
It's more convenient for me to live in a hotel.

955
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,380
