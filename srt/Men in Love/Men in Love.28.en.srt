00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,250
Xiaoxiao,

6
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,900
though Ye Han looks tall and strong now,

7
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,190
he was short and thin

8
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,750
when he was little.

9
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,840
He sat in the first row

10
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,390
in the first grade.

11
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,910
I didn't expect...

12
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,060
Son.

13
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,400
I thought you had a training this afternoon.

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,930
Did you come here directly?

15
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,950
I want to have a talk with Xiaoxiao

16
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,070
before I leave.

17
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,510
Sure.

18
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,610
You guys talk.

19
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,990
We were talking about you just now.

20
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,870
I was saying you learned how to cook

21
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,550
before you reached the height of the stove

22
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,750
when you were little.

23
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,950
I could eat your supper

24
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,010
when I came back late from rehearsal.

25
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,640
Xiaoxiao,

26
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,380
have you tried his cooking?

27
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,579
Yes, a few times.

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,280
Son,

29
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,270
you should show Xiaoxiao your cooking skills more often.

30
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:42,950
Okay.

31
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,010
Don't worry, mom.

32
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,200
I have so many talents.

33
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,800
I have to show them one by one.

34
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,430
Unfortunately,

35
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,079
I've just stayed for a short time.

36
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,910
I didn't get to eat your food.

37
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,460
When I come to Shanghai next time,

38
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,600
let's invite Xiaoxiao to our home.

39
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,420
Let him cook for us.

40
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,490
Okay, Auntie..

41
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,950
Tell me in advance when you come back to Shanghai next time.

42
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,550
I can pick you up from the airport.

43
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,230
No need.

44
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,020
I fly

45
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,810

46
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,030
You don't have to make it so formal.

47
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,120
It's getting late.

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,270
I should go.

49
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,270
Let me see you off.

50
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,910
No.

51
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,450
I've brought all the luggage downstairs.

52
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,160
I'll call a taxi when I go out.

53
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,010
Let me see you off to the door.

54
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,420
How about this?

55
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,660
Son,

56
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,350
take me to the hotel entrance and call me a taxi.

57
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,000
Stay here.

58
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,140
Ye Han will take you home.

59
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,510

61
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,160
be careful on the road.

62
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,620
Text me when you arrive.

63
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,610
Okay.

64
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,560
Bye, Xiaoxiao.

65
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,550
Bye.

66
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,990
Son,

67
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,380
I've always hoped

68
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,160
you can find your happiness.

69
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,330
After all, you have a weird personality.

70
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,820
But I'm to blame, too.

71
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,850
I take it after you.

72
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,930
And I think I have a good personality.

73
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,920
You...

74
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,880
All right.

75
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,830
No matter who you're with,

76
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,680
your current happiness is the most important thing.

77
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,210
You're a smart kid.

78
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,630
You must know

79
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,659
-who is the most important person to you.
-Hello.

80
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,040
I know

81
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,630
what you mean.

82
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,990
What do you know?

83
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,790
Xiaoxiao seems to be still mad.

84
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,580
Show me what you know.

85
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,890
I'm going to.

86
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,400
Don't just talk.

87
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,650
I've created an opportunity for you.

88
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,780
It's up to you

89

next.

90
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,070
Cherish it.

91
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,150
I'm leaving.

92
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,430
Take care.

93
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,870

[Zeus Hotel]

95
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,700
Actually,

96
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,590
I've thought a lot

97
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,790
these days.

98
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,909
You did experience

99
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,350
a painful

100
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,600
and sad relationship.

101
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,140
But if you hadn't experienced all that,

102
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,620
you wouldn't be who you are now.

103
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,240
You wouldn't have come to me.

104
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,480
That's what I thought.

105
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,300
Actually,

106
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,710
I'm grateful to her.

107
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,340
If she didn't abandon you,

108
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,050
you wouldn't have

109
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,070
come to me no matter what.

110
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,870
Then, I was thinking

111
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,050
whether I could stay in your heart.

112
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,890
After all,

113
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,920
you've been together for so long

114
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,250
that you were getting married.

115
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,300
But I advise myself

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,320
not to think too much.

117
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,480
Be generous.

118
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,400
Although I've never seen her,

119
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,930
nor do I know what she looks like,

120
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,030
I can't help but think too much.

121
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,909
I thought about it

122
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,409
while worrying

123
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,350
if you'll leave me to go back to her

124
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,080
if she

125
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,370
comes back someday.

126
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,030
Do you understand

127
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,270
my feelings?

128
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,520
I do.

129
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,970
I didn't want you to think too much.

130
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,230
That's why I didn't tell you.

131
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,350
But no matter what happens,

132
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,970
I won't choose to leave you.

133
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,010
But these days,

134
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,430
I've figured it out.

135
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,090
I've really figured it out.

136
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,970
If you leave the wound alone,

137
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,409
it'll get inflamed

138
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,030
and leave scars.

139
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,900
I can't just see the scars

140
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,560
and ignore the rest.

141
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,270
Scars will fade as time goes by

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,400
and even disappear.

143
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,570
Your scar that I see now

144
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,810
has faded a lot,

145
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,640
but it's still there.

146
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,470
I think

147
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,270
if I'm with you when the wound is healing,

148
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,570
it'll heal faster, right?

149
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,850
At least it'll be faster

150
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,710
than if you were alone.

151
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,120
Right?

152
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,440

00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,230
Not at all.

381
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,910
What could I possibly do?

382
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,430
Yiwen did a good job.

383
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,390
OK.

384
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,720
I'll leave you two alone.

385
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,270
I'm going upstairs to sleep.

386
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,470
8 a.m. tomorrow.

387
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:08,990
Bye.

388
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,470
Bye.

389
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,310
Why are you here?

390
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,230
If I say

391
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,510
that I just miss you,

392
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,070
so I caught the first flight in the morning

393
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,440
to see you

394
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,630
and wait for you all day here

395
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,890
to give you a surprise,

396
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,050
will be you touched?

397
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,270
Not really.

398
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,610
Aren't you touched?

399
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,990
Very touched!

400
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,150
I'm excited, too.

401
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,310
You've gone bad during the days I wasn't here.

402
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,510
I learned it from you.

403
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,720
Let's go.

404
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,620
Where to?

405
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,240
I'll take you

406
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,040
somewhere where your boyfriend can show off.

407
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,170
I didn't expect you to come.

408
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,440
I came to pick up my girlfriend.

409
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,250
How did you find the place?

410
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,310
Take a look.

411
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,310
Do you like it?

412
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,530
It's so beautiful!

413
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,880
You must be tired these days.

414
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,630
I'm not afraid of tiredness.

415
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,270
I'm afraid I can't do it well

416
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,450
and will lose.

417
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,940
♫The sky is getting dark♫

418
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,340
No one will always win.

419
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,310
♫Moonlight is the monologue of my heart♫

420
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,710
Other people's boyfriends would say, "I believe you.

421
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,800
♫It's always there♫

422
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,060
You will definitely win."

423
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,070
♫It's always there♫

424
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,740
But you...

425
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,370
So that's other people's boyfriends.

426
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,010
♫It makes my heart race♫

427
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,540
But I want to say,

428
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,390
♫I wasn't waiting for anyone♫

429
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,000
I can't guarantee that you'll win.

430
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,820
♫You happened to come following the light♫

431
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,800
But I can promise you one thing.

432
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,640
Even if you lose,

433
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,590
♫But the conversation was pleasant♫

434
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,990
I'll show up by your side ASAP

435
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,710
and tell you it's okay.

436
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,400
♫I'm a little overjoyed♫

437
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,230
Others

438
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,360
♫At the places where you can't see♫

439
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,270
laugh when they win,

440
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,530
and cry when they lose.

441
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,840
But even if you lose,

442
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,070
I'll still make you laugh.

443
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,360
♫My love keeps increasing♫

444
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,540
♫It accumulated into the most beautiful surprise♫

445
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,230
This is your boyfriend's determination.

446
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,160
Why do I feel like I've won already?

447
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,860
Then we're the winners of life.

448
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,770
♫Can you hear me?♫

449
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,210
♫The first time I feel that I miss you every night♫

450
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,270
Fireworks!

451
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,290
♫Can you see me?♫

452
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,590
♫Come to me; hold me tight♫

453
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,360
♫Will you love me more?♫

454
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,270
It's for you.

455
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,910
♫At times of sadness or joy♫

456
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,300
♫Let's go through together♫

457
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,750
♫Every moment of it♫

458
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,860
♫Because you're with me♫

459
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,310
♫I'm a little overjoyed♫

460
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,790
♫Is the most beautiful accident♫

461
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,470
Honey.

462
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,510
Get me some water.

463
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,110
Honey.

464
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,940
Shengyun.

465
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,710
Shengyun.

466
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,960
Honey.

467
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,540
Honey.

468
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,000
Shengyun.

469
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,990
Sorry,

470
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,800
the subscriber you dialed is not available.

471
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,390
Please try again later.

472
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,070
Hello.

473
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,000
Did Ms. Guo go to the company today?

474
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,880
Call me when she arrives.

475
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,550
Thank you.

476
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,990
Let me tell you, Mary badmouthed me in front of me.

477
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,230
How could I bear it?

478
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:39,980
I had to…

479
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,550
Are you blind?

480
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,630
Let me dry it for you.

481
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,910
No need.

482
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,750
I'm sorry.

483
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,720
You waved too fast just now.

484
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,710
I didn't have time to react.

485
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,040
How dare you talk back to me?

486
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,880
As a waiter,

487
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,470
can't you see the guest here?

488
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,510
Shall I wash it for you?

489
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,630
Wash?

490
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,710
I can't wear it

491
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,910
after I wash it.

492
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,870
I don't want to waste time on you.

493
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:00,630
Pay me.

494
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,470
How much?

495
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,390
30,000 yuan.

496
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,470
30,000 yuan?

497
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,430
I can't afford it.

498
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,430
Are you going to settle it with that?

499
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,390
Or I'll post it online

500
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,230
and give you a bad review.

501
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,870
Don't. I'm sorry.

502
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,990
Please don't post it.

503
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,670
Your service is so poor.

504
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,470
What kind of attitude is that?

505
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,990
Sorry.

506
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,950
Post it.

507
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,870
Stop it, Jialin.

508
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,510
I'd like to see who'd be a disgrace:

509
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,510
-the waiter who spilled coffee by accident…
-Stop it.

510
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,870
or the customer who pretends to be noble

511
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,510
by wearing a fake brand name.

512
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,000
What did you say?

513
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,950
You stained the clothes.

514
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,230
Are you going to deny it?

515
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,910
No.

516
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,040
Here it is 300 yuan.

517
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,150
It's enough for your dry cleaning.

518
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,150
It even covers the taxi fare for you.

519
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:43,910
Don't worry.

520
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,150
It's enough.

521
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,950
It's my bad luck.

522
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,950
Let's go.

523
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,420
Bye.

524
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,710
See you.

525
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:56,990
Thank you.

526
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,790
You're welcome.

527
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,230
I hate people like them.

528
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,560
I'll give you the 300 yuan after I get paid.

529
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,470
It's okay.

530
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,870
It's just 300 yuan.

531
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,230
Welcome home.

532
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,780
You're welcome.

533
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,960
Do you want to go out and eat something?

534
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,290
Don't you want to eat spicy food recently?

535
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,060
I want to eat at home.

536
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,390
Okay.

537
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,960
That's better.

538
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,900
See

539
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,030
what you want to eat.

540
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,990
Hello, Mom.

541
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,990
What?

542
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,650
Do you really want to break off with us?

543
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,160
Of course not.

544
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,470
I called you so many times,

545
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,550
but you didn't call me back

546
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,230
or answer my calls.

547
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,520
I've been busy.

548
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,230
Busy?

549
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,720
Are you busy dating Tong Yiwen?

550
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,750
Mom.

551
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,480
All right, you don't have to say anything.

552
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,480
How about this?

553
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,950
Set up a time

554
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,340
for me to meet her.

555
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,300
Okay.

556
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,840
I'll call you later.

557
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,310
It was my mom.

558
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,700
She wants me to arrange a meeting for you two.

559
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,070
It's okay if you don't go.

560
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,480
You're tired after just coming back.

561
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,640
I'll tell her

562
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,040
to wait until you have time.

563
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,320
Let's meet.

564
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,280
Are you sure?

565
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,650
I don't want to see you being stuck in the middle.

566
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,780
I feel sorry for you.

567

What did you do this time?

589
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,800
I didn't do anything.

590
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,220
You know how well I've behaved recently, right?

591
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,140
Could it be

592
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,150
that your WeChat friends

593
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,240

594
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,710
Impossible.

595
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,430
I haven't talked to anyone suspicious recently.

596
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,430
Besides, she'll let me go if I make a mistake

597
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,380
or if I have a problem.

598
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,130

I don't know.

601
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,520
Could it be that you've committed some heinous crime,

602
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,150
and she left

603
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,210
to prevent herself from killing you?

604
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,280

606
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:00,940

00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,180
I can't find her.

I think now that Yun has a job,

610
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,390
she won't leave Shanghai.

611
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,960
If she's in Shanghai,

612
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,910
there'll be no more than ten possible hotels.

613
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,160

614
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,790

00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,080
I'm in great pain.

757
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,150
My love is painful to you, right?

758
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:55,710
Yes.

759
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,870
Very painful, right?

760
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:57,550
Yes.

761
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,950
Then let's get a divorce!

762
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,060
But let me tell you,

763
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,740
I don't feel in pain

764
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,330
when I'm with you.

765
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,750
I think it's good.

766
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,910
There's no compromise.

767
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,460
There has never been any compromise.

768
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,330
I think it's a good thing

769
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,240
that we don't have a child.

770
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:32,680
[Perfect]

771
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,300
What crime did you commit?

772
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,430
Explain it to me.

773
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,470
On the day we went to the hotel,

774
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,300
didn't you make it clear?

775
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,660
Yun's assistant brought it here.

776
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,120
It's the divorce agreement.

777
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,650
You're supposed to sign it.

778
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,440
Don't be stupid.

779
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,150
Are you really going to divorce Yun?

780
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,470
Why did she do that?

781
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,670
You asked her, right?

782
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,780
We can only help you

783
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,910
if you tell us.

784
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,690
It's just a divorce.

785
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,310
[Perfect]

786
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,280
-Hi.
-Hi.

787
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,440
One iced Americano.

788
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:14,530
I'm not here for coffee today.

789
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,880
Where is your boss?

790
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,690
[Perfect]

791
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:22,929
Touch my head.

792
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,510
Touch my head like in idol dramas. Touch it.

793
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,870
[Perfect]

794
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,760
[Perfect]

795
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,800
Where's my brother?

796
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,719
He's busy. Why are you here?

797
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,239
Give it back to Shengyun for me.

798
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,750
She's too busy to answer my calls.

799
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,390
And thank her for me.

800
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,410
What card is this?

801
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,040
A VIP card of Feishun Bar.

802
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,640
I heard there were many handsome guys there.

803
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,160
So I went to have fun.

804
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,470
It's not bad.

805
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,000
I plan to get one, too.

806
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,550
What's wrong with him?

807
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,020
I advise you

808
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,810
not to provoke him now.

809
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,550
Lu Zheng.

810
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,730
I don't know what happened to you.

811
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,860
But in this situation,

812
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,450
you can do some square dancing.

813
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,810
It should help.

814
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,110
Bye.

815
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,870
[Perfect]

816
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,480
[Perfect]

817
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,110
You're leaving already?

818
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,710
Mission accomplished.

819
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,830
Why don't you stay with the man you like a little longer?

820
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,310
You found out.

821
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,540
It's so obvious.

822
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,590
Didn't you ask me to touch your head…

823
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,120
To make him jealous?

824
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,480
I wonder

825
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,720
if it'll work.

826
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,200
What? Is it not going well?

827
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,350
He rejected me.

828
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,320
But I just can't give up.

829
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,240
What should I do?

830
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,470
What?

831
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,200
I'm returning your last favor.

832
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,490
Smile at me.

833
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,510
He's looking in this direction now.

834
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:13,950
Go.

835
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,680
Thank you.

836
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,470
You're welcome.

837
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:15,990
Bye.

838
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,770
Take care. Tell me when you get home.

839
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,460
Okay.

840
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,250
[Perfect]

841
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,600
Do you think they'll get divorced?

842
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,830
Lu Zheng was looking terrible just now.

843
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,670
They've always been quarreling.

844
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:39,950
But I never saw

845
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,350
Lu Zheng so quiet.

846
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,240
Tell me.

847
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,280
Why is it?

848
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,870
They won't get divorced so easily

849
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,280
for the usual reasons.

850
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,080
I guess it's because of the child problem.

851
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,280
Child?

852
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,890
They haven't got pregnant for so many years.

853
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,670
I don't think they'll divorce

854
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,070
because of the child now.

855
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,680
Didn't they plan

856
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,110
to make a test tube baby?

857
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,510
Did she find out

858
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,630
that she couldn't get pregnant because of her?

859
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,910
No way.

860
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,700
But it's been a while.

861
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,090
Has Lu Zheng kept it from her?

862
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,970
If Lu Zheng has kept it from her,

863
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,650
Yun's pride

864
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,400
must be greatly hurt.

865
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,010
What should we do?

866
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,990
This is huge.

867
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,530
We should help them.

868
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,210
We can't just watch them get divorced.

869
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,620
Why not

870
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,110
let Jiacheng ask about it?

871
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,550
I'll tell him.

872
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,120
By the way,

873
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,450
what do you think about Song Jinran?

874
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,310
What should I think?

875
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,630
Nothing.

876
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,590
You can't keep running away.

877
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,260
I'm not running away.

878
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,300
She has completely

879
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,480
left my life.

880
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,550
So, this is not

881
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,360
something I should worry about.

882
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:00,990
But...

883
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,910
Stop.

884
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,010
What happened between you and Jialin today?

885
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,430
What do you mean?

886
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,480
The more

887
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,320
you care about something,

888
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,280
the less you seem to care.

889
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,050
I have experience in that.

890
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,950
What do I care?

891
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,570
It's normal for young people to change easily.

892
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,480
But she has liked you for ten years.

893
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
Ten years?

894
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,740
That's right.

895
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,610
We are almost forty.

896
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,550
[Closed]

897
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,760
Is Yun still in the hotel?

898
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,910
Let her stay in the hotel for the rest of her life.

899
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,270
Don't be impulsive.

900
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,310
You've been married for years.

901
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,520
She has forgiven you

902
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,560
for bigger mistakes.

903
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,790
You've experienced everything.

904
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,940
This time it is different.

905
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,020
How?

906
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,820
She asked you for the divorce agreement?

907
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,660
She didn't even contact me.

908
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,700
The divorce agreement

909
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,160
was given to Xu Yan by her assistant.

910
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,790
Looks like she's made up her mind.

911
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,120
Take a look

912
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,780
if she has blocked you.

913
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,920
Do you purposely rub salt in my wound?

914
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,150
There must be a reason

915
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,670
that Yun's angry with you.

916
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,990
You kept something huge from her.

917
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,020
The kid is a sensitive topic.

918
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,760
How did you know?

919
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,480
It is?

920
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,680
We made a deduction.

921
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,610
You're good at it.

922
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:14,310
If you ever make a decision in the future,

923
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,750
can you discuss it with us in advance?

924
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,950
There's nothing to discuss.

925
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,800
I'd still do the same if I could do it again.

926
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,190
Even if you'd divorce in the end?

927
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,710
It's to avoid the divorce.

928
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,050
I don't want Shengyun

929
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:32,140
to feel like a sinner

930
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,110
and feel sorry for me.

931
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,420
If she's upset, I'll be more upset.

932
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,690
How do you know she's upset?

933
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,670
She's not as strong

934
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:41,900
as you think.

935
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,450
She'd be so frustrated

936
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,970
if she knew

937
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,640
we couldn't have kids

938
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,200
because of her.

939
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,670
She is Guo Shengyun.

940
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,920
I can't bear to see her so frustrated.

941
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,200
Look at what you just said.

942
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,980
You don't want to see her frustrated.

943
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,480
That means you still love her.

944
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,880
Right?

945
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,760
Hello?

946
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,670
Did I scare you?

947
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,650
Yes, a little.

948
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,510
You disappeared for so long

949
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,470
and suddenly showed up.

950
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,880
And you contacted me.

951
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,750
I thought

952
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,950
you wouldn't change your phone number.

953
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,470
How have you been?

954
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:52,130
I'm asking the four of you.

955
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,810
Not bad.

956
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,570
We still hang out every day.

957
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,790
Nothing has changed.

958
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,120
That's good.

959
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,180
It should still be the same.

960
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,730
Why do you want to see me?

961
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Because if Ye Han knows I'm here, he...

962
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,400
He might be angry.

963
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,180
Lu Zheng.

964
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,750
I need your help.

965
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,030
Are you asking me for help?

966
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,880
Mommy.

967
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,940
Kaize.

968
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,930
Let me introduce you to a handsome uncle.

969
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,170
Say hello to Uncle.

970
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,440
Hello, Uncle.

971
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,300
This is my son, Kaize.

972
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,400
Is he your son?

973
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,430
You're so handsome, young man.

974
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,130
Sit down.

975
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,120
Do you want some cake?

976
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,320
Do you want cake?
