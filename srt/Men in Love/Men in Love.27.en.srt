00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,230
As long as you two are good together,

194
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,350
I'll be happy.

195
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,420
Slow down.

196
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,300
Walk straight. Walk straight.

197
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:28,820
All right.

198
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,030
No, I'm not drunk.

199
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,180
-I haven't said goodbye to Auntie yet.
-Bye, Auntie.

200
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,350
Goodbye, Auntie.

201
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,860
Okay. Be careful.

202
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,670
Be careful. Look out.

203
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,110
The wine just now… One sip was worth 70 yuan.

204
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,740
70, 70, Okay.

205
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,950
Auntie, we're leaving.

206
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,030
Okay.

207
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:43,860
Be careful.

208
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,310
I'll make Shengyun kneel down when I go back.

209
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,030
You know?

210
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,500
That kid...

211
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,670
Son.

212
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,940
You guys go back first.

213
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,740
I have an appointment later.

214
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,240
Didn't you just get together yesterday?

215
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,790
Do you have another gathering today?

216
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,909
It was with my old friends yesterday.

217
00:07:58,909 --> 00:07:59,909
Today it's with my new friends.

218
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,180
You just came back. Where did you get new friends?

219
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,550
I could make friends even if I was not here.

220
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,990
Okay.

221
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,860
Come back early.

222
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:12,420
Son, take Xiaoxiao home.

223
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,550
Xiaoxiao.

224
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,670
See you next time.

225
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,030
Bye.

226
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:22,670
Bye.

227
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,380
-Bye, Auntie.
-Take care.

228
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,340
Okay.

229
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,980
Are you still worried?

230
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,210
Maybe I was too nervous.

231
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,440
Actually, you did very well before.

232
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,350
You don't need to think too much

233
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,230
about getting along with my mom.

234
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,020
I think

235
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,150
your mom is cool.

236
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,620
Maybe we can

237
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,780
be friends in the future.

238
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,740
Friends?

239
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,310
Will you become the kind of friends

240
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,970
who go out to drink together and don't come home?

241
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,930
I think that'll be good, too.

242
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,870
Look at this.

243
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,320
What?

244
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,450
[Flight information]

245
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,850
Air tickets?

246
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,940
You've even bought the air tickets?

247
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,240
We can go out again.

248
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,510
Give me a reward.

249
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,590
What?

250
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
You wish.

251
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,620
Let's go.

252
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,720
Are you drunk?

253
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,290
I'm not. I was taking care of Lu Zheng.

254
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,870
Is he feeling better?

255
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,660
Is he sober now?

256
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,740
No, don't worry.

257
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,070
I've sent him home.

258
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,910
I guess he won't be sober

259
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,310
until tomorrow morning.

260
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,460
I saw the photo you posted on Moments.

261
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,200
Is the one in the middle Ye Han's mother?

262
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,080
Yes.

263
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,980
She's so young.

264
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,940
I'd believe it even if you told me she was Ye Han's sister.

265
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,270
Does she like Xiaoxiao?

266
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,730
She likes her so much.

267
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,920
She almost regards her as her own daughter.

268
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
That's great.

269
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,710
Xiaoxiao

270
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,780
is the kind of girl that parents would like.

271
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,500
Yes.

272
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,380
Ye Han is also very happy tonight.

273
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,690
Xiaoxiao and his mother get along well.

274
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,420
It'll save him a lot of trouble.

275
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,110
That's great.

276
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,360
How are you?

277
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,270
Are you tired?

278
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,720
I'm fine.

279
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,350
I have to study every day.

280
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,280
It's very fulfilling.

281
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,600
Wait a minute.

282
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,830
Someone is knocking.

283
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,620
Are you still up?

284
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,860
I'm going to bed soon.

285
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,520
I packed some supper for you.

286
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,420
Thank you.

287
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,240
Bye.

288
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,420
Good night.

289
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,560
Who is it? It's so late.

290
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,760
Eric.

291
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,590
He's here to send me some supper.

292
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,470
By the way, when are you coming back?

293
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,700
We'll have nothing to do on Thursday afternoon.

294
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,770
But we didn't want to rush,

295
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,030
so we booked a ticket for Friday morning.

296
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,260
Okay.

297
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,110
Go to sleep.

298
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,780
Good night.

299
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,900
Good night.

300
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,250
Why have supper in the middle of the night?

301
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,090
It's my first meal today.

302
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,380
I'm not talking about you.

303
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,500
Eat away.

304
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,690
You might not be able to
wear your skirt tomorrow.

305
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,390
You eat so much.

306
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,300
You're so mean.

307
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,610
Who are you?

308
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,540
We're looking for Zhong Zixuan.

309
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,140
Outsiders can't go in.

310
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,630
Listen.

311
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,840
Don't be unreasonable.

312
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,260
Who is unreasonable?

313
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,070
The school has its rules.

314
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,590
Not everyone can enter.

315
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,460
Bye.

316
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,690
His teacher is here.

317
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,990
Ask his teacher.

318
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,530
What's wrong?

319
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,760
They are looking for

320
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,290
someone in your bicycle team.

321
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,090
He said he was looking for Zhong…

322
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,760
Zhong Zixuan.

323
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,440
Why are you looking for him?

324
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,090
Ask him to pay the money back.

325
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,940
He's just a student.

326
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,660
How could he owe you money?

327
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,140
It's not him.

328
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,690
It's his dad.

329
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,540
Now, his dad is hiding away and nowhere to be found.

330
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,110
We had no choice but to come to him.

331
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,020
We signed an agreement.

332
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,380
It's expected for a son to pay his father's debt.

333
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,440
Is there a problem?

334
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,670
He's not at school.

335
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,360
Where else can he be?

336
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,390
Let us in.

337
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,540
We'll look for him ourselves.

338
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,200
-Outsiders can't enter the school.
-You're not allowed to enter.

339
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,280
You stop us like this.

340
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,040
There must be something wrong.

341
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,200
After all,

342
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,230
the money wasn't borrowed by Zhong Zixuan.

343
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,760
It's no use looking for him.

344
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,710
Just leave.

345
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,970
Why should we listen to you?

346
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,100
Aren't you leaving?

347
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,240
I'll call the police now.

348
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,790
You've seriously disrupted the school's order.

349
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,500
How dare you!

350
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,840
Forget it.

351
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,240
We will definitely find him today.

352
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,190
You're his teacher, right?

353
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,840
Let's see how many times you can protect him.

354
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,400
Let's go to his house.

399
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,990

Mom,

487
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,260
let me ask you a question.

488
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,490
Do you think one should

489
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,550
be 100% honest in a relationship?

490
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,340
I...

491
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,760
can be honest.

492
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,220
But

493
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,570
I can't be 100% honest.

494
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,480
But

495
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,310
if you are hiding something,

496
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,240
there will surely be conflicts.

497
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,940
Yes.

498
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,270
I'm just afraid that if I'm honest,

499
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,950
there will be more conflicts.

500
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,470
If you were the other person,

501
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,400
would you want to know the truth?

502
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,980
If I were the one

503
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,760
who's been kept a secret,

504
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,430
I would be sad for sure.

505
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,130
But sometimes,

506
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,190
the truth is more heartbreaking.

507
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,890
So,

508
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,770
whether you say it or not,

509
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,330
the result will be the same.

510
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,730
If you don't tell,

511
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,340
you'll have to bear

512
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,870
the pain of hiding it.

513
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,130
If you tell,

514
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,450
you'll have to solve

515
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,550
the conflicts

516
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,100
after being honest.

Not only

520
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,710
does she have a good personality,

521
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,360
but also, more importantly,

522
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,900
I see the joy you have

523
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,130
when you're with her.

524
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,460
It's the kind of joy
you feel from the bottom of your heart.

525
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,570

533

No.

or not,

538
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,710
it doesn't matter.

539
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,530
Will she

540
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,510
change your mind?

541
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,630
No.

nobody had ever lived there before.

570
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,720
♫But I just stand there and stare for a long time♫

571
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,670
She just disappeared.

572
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,820
♫Maybe I don't want to leave♫

573
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,640
She didn't leave a word and…

574
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,430
That's right.

575
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,610
♫It still hurts♫

576
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,180
If I could hear her say goodbye,

577
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:26,670
♫Looking back♫

578
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,220
I wouldn't have been in pain for so long.

579
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:33,610
♫I feel so much warmth again♫

580
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,910
When did this happen?

581
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,110
♫I'll be with you♫

582
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,090
Six years ago.

583
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,200
How long had you been together?

584
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,380
♫You know it's true♫

585
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,160
Five years.

586
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,980
♫Memories are endless♫

587
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,350
Five years is a long period of time.

588
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,260
I'm sure

589
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,250
♫But why♫

590
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,930
you've thought about getting married.

591
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,690
♫We've been with each other♫

592
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,580
I proposed to her.

593
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,820
And she agreed.

594
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:59,500
♫But why can't we have each other?♫

595
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,500
But she still left without saying goodbye.

596
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,510
♫I'll be with you♫

597
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,460
Did you

598
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,840
♫I'll see this through♫

599
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,440
go look for her after that?

600
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,510
No news about her at all?

601
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:14,700
♫If we can notice all the considerations♫

602
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,020
About three years ago,

603
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,510
I got news about her by chance.

604
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,290
♫At the intersection of time♫

605
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,990
You went to look for her?

606
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,760
I bought the ticket,

607
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:23,280
♫Let's not lose each other again♫

608
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,280
but I didn't go.

609
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,140
Why not?

610
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,760
Actually, seeing each other

611
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,110
is just a matter of a ticket.

612
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,860
But she never thought of

613
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,550
♫On the snowy streets♫

614
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,990
such a simple thing.

615
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,830
♫I'm wandering alone again♫

616
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,360
So it's not that she couldn't come.

617
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:39,830
♫If we can meet♫

618
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,200
Instead, she didn't want to come at all.

619
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,580
♫And change our destiny♫

620
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,430
Anyway, it's been six years.

621
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,810
♫I'll go far away with you♫

622
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,940
Time

623
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
should have blunted the damage.

624

♫In the future I've been dreaming of♫

625
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,180
Don't worry.

♫Love is like a lost ark♫

♫Where is the entrance to dreams♫

630

Even if it does,

631
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,380
I'll try my best to stop you.

I'm sorry.

646

I made a lot of detours.

658
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,080
But please trust me.

659
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,790
On this road,

I'll wait for you.

663
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,190
What took you so long to go to the toilet?

664
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,390
It's so hard to find a toilet, honey.

665
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,540
Let's go.

666
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,870
Where are you going?

667
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,910
It's too sunny. I'll get spots.

668
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,500
Wait a minute.

669
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,840
Why? Who are you waiting for?

670
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,710
Wait. Trust me.

671

Close your eyes.

672

Why should I?

You won't fall, I promise.

Can't I open my eyes yet?

680
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,670
Almost.

Come on, Big Sister.

688
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,800
Blow out the candle and make a wish.

689
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,700
I'm gonna make a wish.

690
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,630
No gift?

Where's the gift?

692
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:55,680
Of course there's a gift.

693
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,750
Guess what it is.

694
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,160
Purse!

695
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,330
Do you lack purses?

696
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,530
Cosmetics!

697

Jewelry!

701
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,280
You lack it even less!

702
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,530
What do I lack, then?

703
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,510
What you lack

704
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,490
is a smile.

705
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,190
Do I lack it?

706
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,630
You lack company.

707
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,430
What is that?

708
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,300
Come on, let's squirt it in her together!

709
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,580
How dare you!

710
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,200
Hello, who is it?

711
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,870
It's me, Zhong Zixuan.

712
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,670
Zixuan?

713
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,910
Where did you go?

714
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,390
Where are you?

715
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,340
Why didn't you call me until now?

716
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,060
Xiaodong.

717
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,400
I may need your help.

718
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,230
Where in the world are you?

719
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,220
I'll go find you.

720
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,470
Where have you been recently?

721
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,510
Don't mention it.

722
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,890
I've been hiding everywhere.

723
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,810
I just made do.

724
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,430
This is all I have in my pocket.

725
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,740
Just make do with it.

726
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,580
Thank you.

727
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,360
I'll pay you back.

728
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,050
It's okay.

729
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,970
We'll see.

730
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:40,780
Have a drink.

731
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,940
Okay.

732
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,330
This should be enough for you

733
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,360
to last a few days.

734
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,540
Do I look terrible?

735
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,480
Look at how miserable you look.

736
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,360
It's okay.

737
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,890
But you can't always be like this.

738
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,480
If you stay here,

739
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,400
can you stay here forever?

740
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,960
Certainly I can't go back to school.

741
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,490
They even went to my school.

742
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,920
Did your dad contact you?

743
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,010
No.

744
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,950
I can't reach him either.

745
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,530
Everyone is worried about you.

746
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,160
Everyone is looking for you.

747
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,250
Your teacher

748
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,720
even came to me.

749
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,400
I have no choice.

750
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,960
I'm too ashamed to see them.

751
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,630
At least you should call Miss Xiaoxiao

752
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,630
to let her know you're safe.

753
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,450
She even went to Jinshan to look for you.

754
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,160
Let's talk later.

755
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,880
I'm going.

00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,500
Okay.

947
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,740
I'm not going out.

948
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:00,720
Mr. Ye.

949
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,120
Is today the day?

950
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,200
What day?

951
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,470
The day to upgrade your equipment.

952
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,640
That day.

953
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,690
No.

954
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,820
Impossible.

955
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,500
We're going to fight in a gang battle today.

956
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,910
Let's go together, Mr. Ye.

957
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,870
Without Yiwen,

958
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,550
I suddenly have nothing to do.

959
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,100
No.

960
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,330
Isn't work something you should do?

961
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:32,110
There are so many important things waiting for us to do.

962
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,490
Work. Work.

963
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,600
I'm too efficient.

964
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,130
When Yiwen was gone,

965
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,550
my mind was full of work.

966
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,580
So I finished all my work very quickly.

967
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,670
You can go out for dinner if you're free.

968
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,180
Right?

969
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,940
We just opened a column about delicacies.

970
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,340
You can visit the stores and make a comment.

971
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:50,980
By the way,

972
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,030
a restaurant that serves Sichuan cuisine is very popular recently.

973
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,950
You can queue up if you have time.

974
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,400
I know about that restaurant.

975
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,700
But Yiwen really wants to go there.

976
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,990
I want to go with her.

977
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,520
Can you stop talking about Yiwen?

978
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,240
Can you stop being so clingy?

979
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:06,990
If you really miss her

980
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:07,870
so much that you can't bear it,

981
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,020
just buy an air ticket

982
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,140
to see her.

983
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,580
It won't take long.

984
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,540
What day is she off?

985
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,480
I can really consider it.

986
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,900
Are you really going?

987
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,380
Can I take a leave?

988
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,460
[Send Mom to the airport]

989
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,430
Where are you going?

990
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,030
No.

991
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,620
Isn't my mom going back?

992
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,990
I'll send her to the airport.

993
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,090
I'll go with you.

994
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,080
Stay here.

995
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,630
Say hello to her for me.

996
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,520
[Zeus Hotel]
