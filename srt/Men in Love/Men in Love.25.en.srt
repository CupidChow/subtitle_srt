that was the beginning of our happy life.

could not be shared,

00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,530

Got it.

194
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,270
That's it?

195
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,470
Aren't you going to think of ways to cope with it?

196
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,830
For example, add new sections

197
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,430
and create some new content.

198
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,600
I'm working on it.

199
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,950
It's useless to be anxious.

200
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,350
And this is one month's data.

201
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,810
It doesn't mean anything.

202
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,320
Let's wait for the data for the next month.

203
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,630
Okay.

204
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,710
You're the Editor-in-Chief. If you say so.

205
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,710
How could it be?

206
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,310
Hello?

207
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,590
Xiaoxiao.

208
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,960
I feel better every time

209
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,830
I hear the telephone bell.

210
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,110
It's like magic.

211
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,070
Then you should date your telephone bell.

212
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:23,990
Really?

213
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,510
Then won't you be jealous?

214
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,100
I'm not that petty.

215
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,630
Have you finished your classes?

216
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,990
What's your plan for this afternoon?

217
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,190
The class ended just now.

218
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,120
I don't have class this afternoon.

219
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,470
Then let's hang out.

220
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,350
Where?

221
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,120
How about going cycling?

222
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,590
But you don't know how to ride a bicycle.

223
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,120
You can teach me.

224
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,870
What a coincidence.

225
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,510
My girlfriend happens to be a bike coach.

226
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,630
What?

227
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,990
Are you not confident enough to teach me?

228
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,390
Of course I'm confident.

229
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,470
If I want to,

230
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,990
there is no one that I can't teach in this world.

231
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,590
But you don't have to work this afternoon?

232
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,080
Well,

233
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,870
I'd say learning how to ride a bike

234
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,350
is more important now.

235
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,330
Your realization

236
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,190
came a bit too late.

237
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,170
OK.

238
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,230
I'll find a beautiful place then.

239
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,030
See you later.

240
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
Okay.

241
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,190
Come on.

242
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,720
Here.

243
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,170
I'll hold the bike for you.

244
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,470
You can ride slowly.

245
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,090
Hold tight and don't let go.

246
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:57,750
Keep your eyes on the road.

247
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,630
Eyes forward.

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,750
Be careful.

249
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,630
Hold tight.

250
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,010
I'm holding tight.

251
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,990
Not bad. Not bad.

252
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,990
Hold tight.

253
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,870
Be careful.

254
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,510
Ye Han.

255
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,110
Are you alright?

256
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,880
Are you hurt?

257
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,270
I know you are okay.

258
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,620
It hurts.

259
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,190
I feel much better.

260
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,120
One more kiss.

261
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,920
Come on.

262
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,950
It hurts everywhere after I fell.

263
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,110
Why did you push me?

264
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,230
Li Xiaoxiao.

265
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,710
You liar!

266
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,230
Didn't you say you won't let go?

267
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,350
If I don't let go,

268
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,060
you can't learn how to ride.

269
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,350
Alright.

270
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,360
Hurry up.

271
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,880
Get up and continue.

272
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,990
Hurry up.

273
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,520
I really can't learn it.

274
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,360
I didn't expect

275
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,020
there to be a student I can't teach in this world.

276
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,350
It's boring to always win.

277
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,950
You should experience the feeling of failure.

278
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,220
Are you happy?

279
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,120
Of course I am.

280
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,990
My girlfriend is so great.

281
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,470
Why should I be upset?

282
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,310
I envy you.

283
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,940
What's there to envy?

284
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,350
I envy you.

285
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,080
You have such a good boyfriend.

286
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,110
My boyfriend

287
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,210
doesn't know how to ride.

288
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,350
He holds grudges.

289
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,870
He is a neat freak.

290
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,830
What's there to envy?

291
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,750
Is he really that bad?

292
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,590
If that's the case,

293
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,480
why are you dating him?

294
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,470
Because he has a good personality.

295
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm back.

296
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,590
How's your date?

297
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,360
Have you had dinner?

298
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,710
Yes.

299
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,650
What are you doing?

300
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,710
The beauty salon project proposal.

301
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,630
You're not opening a beauty salon, are you?

302
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,110
And a nail salon, a milk tea shop, and a jazz bar.

303
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,710
Then what are you doing?

304
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,870
These are projects my friends suggested.

305
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,590
I found that after I quit being a model,

306
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,520
there are many things I can do.

307
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,510
There are so many business options.

308
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,830
Friends?

309
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,590
What friends?

310
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,630
Men or women?

311
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,870
Why would you ask me this question?

312
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,870
I...

313
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,480
I'm curious.

314
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:02,990
Tell me.

315
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,560
What do you need to know?

316
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,470
I want to know

317
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,190
whether you got hurt

318
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,810
when you were working out.

319
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,350
I want to know if you choked on your food.

320
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,670
I want to know

321
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:19,070
if any unfamiliar man

322
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,350
picked you up.

323
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,710
Anyway,

324
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,230
I've always cared about you.

325
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,590
They sound like Jiacheng's questions.

326
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,920
I have to tell him

327
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,950
you eat well

328
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:38,030
[She eats well and sleeps well. Don't worry]

329
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,750
and sleep well.

330
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,580
How much did you get from being a spy?

331
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,740
Spy? I didn't do anything secretly.

332
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,630
I'm a messenger.

333
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,990
A messenger of your love.

334
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,540
I'm relieved then.

335
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,400
Were you with Xue today?

336
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,190
I saw the photo of you two

337
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,510
in her WeChat Moments.

338
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,710
The beauty salon project is from her.

339
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,830
She gave me a very good offer.

340
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,230
It sounds like a profitable business.

341
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,710
Then you should think it over.

342
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,840
But

343
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,630
I think this suits you.

344
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,630
But I don't think it's that simple.

345
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,190
I met another person today.

346
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,110
What a coincidence.

347
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,230
Hello.

348
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,120
Are you alone?

349
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,740
No, my friend just left.

350
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,770
Can I sit here?

351
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,860
Please have a seat.

352
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,630
Actually, I'm here because I'm going to interview a designer.

353
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,490
But the designer hasn't arrived.

354
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,750
I heard you're recruiting people.

355
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,510
Yes.

356
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,990
I'm running my own brand.

357
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,950
Congratulations.

358
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:47,830
Thank you.

359
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,110
Actually, I'm preparing for

360
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,510
this year's fashion week but I'm running out of time.

361
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,510
So, I am trying to

362
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,110
find as many excellent designers

363
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,950
in China.

364
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:58,850
By the way,

365
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,270
the theme of my first season

366
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,710
is Cloud Brocade.

367
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,390
It matches the dress you wore

368
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,990
in the restaurant last time.

369
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,150
Is this Eric

370
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,150
the designer you mentioned before?

371
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,470
Have you ever thought about

372
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,190
being a fashion designer?

373
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,550
You often design clothes yourself.

374
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,710
But I do that to kill time.

375
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,310
I can't do it as my job.

376
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,240
I knew that many famous models

377
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,470
became fashion designers later on.

378
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,670
And you have your advantages.

379
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,990
I think

380
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,990
you can do it.

381
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,750
But

382
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,470
he's a top designer.

383
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,030
I don't think he'll hire an inexperienced person like me.

384
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:44,790
How are you inexperienced?

385
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,310
You've been in this circle for so long.

386
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,550
You are immersed in it for so long.

387
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,390
You pick up a thing or two.

388
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,550
But I was a model.

389
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:54,970
Models and designers are different.

390
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,760
How do you know if you don't try?

391
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,760
I think you can do it.

392
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,070
Actually,

393
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,030
after I decided to quit being a model,

394
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,230
I wanted to stay away from this circle as much as possible.

395
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,630
But if I am about to be a designer,

396
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,750
I have to deal with them again.

397
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,670
So, you don't want to

398
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,520
meet your former colleagues anymore?

399
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,510
Yes.

400
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,510
I don't know.

401
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,250
Don't be upset about this.

402
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm free tomorrow.

403
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,990
How about we try the new Cantonese restaurant

404
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,390
in the mall nearby?

405
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,670
Sure.

406
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,750
It's a deal.

407
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,550
Let me show you.

408
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,470
Okay.

409
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,230
Come to my house tomorrow.

410
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,690
I've had things arranged.

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,710

Hello, ladies.

415
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,270
What would you like to drink?

416
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,430
A cup of mocha, a latte, and an Americano.

417
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,320
All hot.

418
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,990
No cream for mocha.

419
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,470
Latte with low-fat milk.

420
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,630
Some espresso for your Americano.

421
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,720
You have such a good memory.

422
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,660
I have no choice.

423
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,950
It's a competitive era.

00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,740

Boss,

431
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,910
I've worked for 28 days this month.

432
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,190
I'm not that short of money.

433
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,230
Can I take a few days' leave?

434
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,150
We've been too busy lately.

435
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,390
Hang in there.

436
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,410
I don't care.

437
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,470
No matter what happens tonight,

438
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,670
I need to take a leave tonight.

439
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,230
How can I handle all the things all by myself?

440
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,140
Do you agree or not?

441
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,640
No.

442
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,990
If you don't agree, I'll file a complaint to the Labor Bureau.

443
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,790
Then...

444
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,510

Leave now.

448
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,270
Or I'll regret it.

00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,070
Are you hiring a part-timer?

450
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,910
Yes.

00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,230

453
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,990
Of course.

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,910

00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,440

456
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,000
Hello.

00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,880
Finally.

458
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,190
Are you still mad at me?

459
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,910
I want to take you somewhere.

460
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,610
Can you give me a chance to apologize?

461
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,870
Come on.

462
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:54,960
Have a seat.

463
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,310
Have a taste.

464
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,150
Have a taste, please.

465
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,390
I've reflected on myself.

466
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,810
Whether it's about the blind date

467
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,690
or the contract termination,

468
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,190
I was wrong.

469
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,710
I was too selfish.

470
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,500
I didn't think about those things

471
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,870
from your point of view.

472
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,830
I promise

473
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,030
I will

474
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,650
respect your opinion.

475
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,590
I'm sorry.

476
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,210
By the way,

477
00:21:58,890 --> 00:21:59,970
your favorite.

478
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,410
Xiaoxiao told me.

479
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,380
You didn't answer my call.

480
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,350
I was worried about you.

481
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,680
So, I could only ask her.

482
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,170
Li Xiaoxiao, that traitor.

483
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,410
Then why did you bring me here?

484
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,310
This place

485
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,030
is very special

486
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,790
to me.

487
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,270
This is where the dream of

488
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,710
Ye Han and me started.

489
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,130
Here?

490
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,550
Follow me.

491
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,290
Do you see the building in front?

492
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,470
There used to be nothing there,

493
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,960
only a shabby house.

494
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:49,990
We took it

495
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,190
as our first office.

496
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,080
Over there?

497
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,950
Yes.

498
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,260
Too much wind in winter and too much rain in summer.

499
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,210
But the rent was cheap.

500
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,640
We were poor back then.

501
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,070
We didn't want money from our family.

502
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,540
When we were hungry,

503
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,330
we could only eat sweet potatoes.

504
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,860
Because we could only afford sweet potatoes.

505
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,630
I remember every time we submitted the manuscript,

506
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,790
we would buy many sweet potatoes

507
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,160
and eat them together.

508
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,380
At that time,

509
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,840
Ye Han and I were at a loss.

510
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:22,910
We wanted to find our own place

511
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,870
in an established magazine circle

512
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,380
and wanted to build a new world there.

513
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,990
Now that I think about it,

514
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,790
you were too young to be afraid.

515
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,190
But we worked hard.

516
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,710
We couldn't make sure we could do it.

517
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,700
I didn't expect we'd get better and better.

518
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,010
We often come back here

519
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,990
and eat sweet potatoes

520
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,150
to remind ourselves.

521
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,670
This place

522
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,580
was where our dream started.

523
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,510
Don't run away from yourselves.

524
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,370
Do it if you like it.

525
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,390
What are you worried about?

526
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,870
But I'm afraid I can't do it well.

527
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,330
How do you know if you don't try?

528
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,400
You never let things end

529
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,690
before they start.

530
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,190
Go for it.

531
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,740
Remember.

532
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,590
I'm your strong support.

533
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,790
If you fail one day,

534
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,190
I'll lend you my shoulder.

535
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,790

00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,430
That's how I am.

572
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,630
I will run away

573
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,870
and avoid you.

574
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,510
I'll always hurt you.

576
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,710

Good job, Zhong Zixuan.

586
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,320
You've improved a lot.

587
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,130
You made progress in physical fitness.

588
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,550
That's because you pushed me very hard.

589
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,350
Now you blame me for pushing you.

590
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,070
When you have a good performance

591
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,520
in the competition,

00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,470
you'll thank me.

593
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,310
Watch your diet and get enough rest.

594
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,790
Don't stay up.

00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,030
Don't worry.

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,910
I won't let you down.

All the issues of this month are here.

00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,190
Okay.

600
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,990
Put them here.

601
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,700
Anything else?

602
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,630
No.

603
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,380
Okay. Bye.

604
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,220
Okay.

Song Jinran?

609
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,430
El Capitan.

610
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,880
She said

611
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,650
she wanted to take photos of El Capitan the most,

612
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,230
exactly from the angle on the cover.

613
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,670
It is too dangerous

614
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,160
and she didn't get the chance.

615
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,710
But she's a born adventurer.

616
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,750
She can do anything she wants.

617
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,520
You're right.

618
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,910
We all liked her back then

619
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,270
because of her personality.

620
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:51,790
But

621
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,870
it may not be her.

622
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,630
Many people want to take photos of El Capitan.

623
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,990
How is that possible?

624
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,070
Isn't Jasmine her English name?

625
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,910
You said it too.

626
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,950
English name.

627
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:06,150
There are more people with the same name in English.

628
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,470
You're deceiving yourself.

629
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,990
S is Song.

630
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,870
Jasmine S.

631
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,930
That's how she wrote her name before.

632
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,070
All these years,

633
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,230
no news about her at all.

634
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,870
Now, suddenly a cover for domestic magazines.

635
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,070
What's going on?

636
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,230
Is she back?

637
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,990
Ye Han.

638
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,190
No matter what,

639
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,990
it's been so long.

640
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,310
Haven't you let it go?

641
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,030
Think about how she hurt you.

642
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,230
Since you are in a relationship with Xiaoxiao,

643
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,150
don't think too much.

644
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,430
Alright.

645
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,950
I got it.

646
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,710
Leave me alone.

647
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,150
Don't think too much.

648
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,710
Everything I've been through

649
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,750
is slowly simmered

650
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,430
by the heat of time.

651
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,330
The past wounds

652
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,420
have been changed into scars by time.

653
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,340
The past feelings

654
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,840
have been turned into a calm sea by time.

655
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,570
As long as there is a gentle breeze on the sea,

656
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,370
there will be ripples and waves.

657
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,250
No.

658
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,360
That's not the sea.

659
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,700
It's dead water.

660
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,590
No ripples again.

661
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
No.

662
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,920
Now,

663
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,450
I'll only be enthusiastic about this person.

664
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,860
My whole heart

665
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,590
is for her.

666
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,890
I'm so tired.

667
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,650
But luckily,

668
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,690
fate brought me a gift.

669
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,290
Thank you.

670
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,440
Are you tired recently?

671
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,060
You have dark circles under your eyes.

672
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,970
Yes.

673
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,570
I'm exhausted.

674
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,910
What are you doing at school?

675
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,040
Why are you so tired?

676
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,900
I enhanced Zixuan's physical training today

677
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,180
for the upcoming national competition.

678
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,800
That kid again?

679
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,510
Kid?

680
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,860
He's my student.

681
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,260
He had a fight with me before.

682
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,600
Every time we talked about him,

683
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,120
you had to mention this.

684
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,680
So petty.

685
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,770
Have you had dinner?

686
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,610
Not yet.

687
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,150
I made beef bone soup.

688
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,300
I'm going to cook some noodles with it.

689
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,350
Do you want some too?

690
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,820
I'm sure it's okay to go up and watch a movie.

691
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,910
I was going to buy some noodles.

692
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,120
Have a good rest.

693
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,320
I'll go buy some.

694
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,150
See you later.

695
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,150
I'll wait for you.

696
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,030
This girl in front of me

697
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,710
is the one who can make me keep a clear head.

698
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,260
I won't abandon her

699
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,850
and I will forgive no matter what happens.

700
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,310
And she's the one

701
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,699
that I can't lose no matter what.

702
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,840
When did I fall asleep?

703
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,000
What happened today?

704
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,470
You look weird.

705
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,560
Did something happen

706
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,090
recently?

707
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,660
No.

708
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,630
I finally won your heart.

709
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,860
I'm really happy.

710
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,040
So it's because of me?

711
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,430
Of course.

712
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,460
Love can change people.

713
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,780
For example,

714
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,470
there is some hair on your bed sheet

715
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,380
but I didn't take it off.

716
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:43,030
Before I liked you,

717
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,670
you already liked me

718
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,500
very much, right?

719
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,420
Yes.

720
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,310
Because of you,

721
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,620
I was lovesick for a very long time.

722
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,130
You don't need to be in the future.

723
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,400
Yiwen is back.

724
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,750
So what?

725
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:12,900
Hide.

726
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,090
Why should I hide?

727
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,910
If Yiwen sees you,

728
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:18,670
it'll be embarrassing.

729
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,470
Hurry up.

730
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,470
We are a real couple.

731
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,110
And my shoes are still outside.

732
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,470
Just go out and say hello.

733
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,350
No.

734
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,050
That's not my style.

735
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,820
And,

736
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,290
she'll overthink.

737
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,790
I'm back.

738
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,250
But you can just ignore me.

739
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,370
Look.

740
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,310
She's definitely overthinking.

741
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:37,750
No.

742
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,470
She's not overthinking.

743
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:39,830
She already understands.

744
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,830
If you don't hide,

745
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,340
then I'll go.

746
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,330
Remember,

747
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,840
you're alone in this room.

748
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,800
See you later.

749
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,830
Yiwen.

750
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:08,880
Hello.

751
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,240
Hello.

752
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,200
Where's Xiaoxiao?

753
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,480
She...

754
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,160
She's not in her room.

755
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,290
Then why are you here?

756
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,410
I...

757
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,850
It's hard to explain.

758
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,140
But she's not here.

759
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,360
What are you looking at?

760
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,300
Why are you here?

761
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,800
I drove Yiwen home.

762
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,030
I was about to leave

763
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,340
when I saw you.

764
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,960
You're wearing so little and you're barefoot.

765
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,490
I heard

766
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,460
you can meet your true love

767
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,870
in the middle of the night if you are barefoot outside.

768
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,480
Me?

769
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,210
You're really here.

770
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,160
Did you really go out?

771
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,130
You're so capable.

772
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,020
Did you go out through the window?

773
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,210
I went out for some fresh air.

774
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,050
Couldn't I?

775
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,140
You see?

776
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,030
We were caught anyway.

777
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,400
It's all because of you.

778
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,720
What's going on?

779
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,790
Why did you use the window

780
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,950
when there's a door?

781
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,360
Just now,

782
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,420
Ye Han and I were in the room.

783
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,610
Then Yiwen came back suddenly.

784
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,110
I got nervous.

785
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,260
And you caught me.

786
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,730
Is she blaming me?

787
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,870
I stood barefoot outside

788
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,550
on such a cold day.

789
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,870
And you're making fun of me.

790
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,180
Well,

791
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,670
I've met you in the hotel.

792
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,790
Do you have to do this?

793
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,910
Xu Jiacheng,

794
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,220
go back now.

795
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,020
And you.

796
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,390
When you come in next time,

797
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,190
remember to bring your shoes in.

798
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,740
Why do you think

799
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,540
these two have to live together?

800
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,590
Can we separate them?

801
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,430
Don't you live alone?

802
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,740
Why don't you let Xiaoxiao move into your house?

803
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,470
Also,

804
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,870
Xiaoxiao and you were...

805
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,880
Yiwen came back too early.

806
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,680
I apologize to you on her behalf.
