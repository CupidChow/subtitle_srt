♫Can you see me?♫

191
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,270
♫Come to me; hold me tight♫

192
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,270
♫Will you love me more?♫

193
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,870
♫At times of sadness or joy♫

194
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,240
♫Let's go though together♫

195
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,830
♫All the images♫

196
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,429
♫Will be kept in place by tenderness♫

197
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,730
♫The promise was made from the heart♫

198
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,900
♫I'm a little overjoyed♫

199
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,370
♫Because love♫

200
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,650
♫Is the most beautiful accident♫

201
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,990
Aren't you going to grad some food with me?

202
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,390
Let's go some other time.

203
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,450
Then, head back home.

204
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,180
I'll watch you go.

205
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:01,880
Go.

206
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,010
You go first.

207
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,270
You go first.

208
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,390
You go first.

209
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,630
Xiaoxiao?

210
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,330
We keep running into each other.

211
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,470
Yes.

212
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,850
What a coincidence.

213
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,090
You keep running into each other?

214
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,310
Yeah, we've bumped into each other 3 or 4 times this week.

215
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,990
By the way,

216
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,250
I was going to call you.

217
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,310
There's a cocktail party of the Basketball Night Event in a few days.

218
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,060
Let's go together.

219
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,170
Your celebrity crush will be there, too.

220
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,070
Jeremy?

221
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:30,690
Yeah.

222
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,920
You can even get his autograph there.

223
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,870
Are you going?

224
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,610
I'm not interested in basketball.

225
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,020
When is it?

226
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,190
Friday at 6 p.m.

227
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,600
I might not

228
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,190
be able to make it that day.

229
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,990
I have a meeting at school,

230
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,330
and I'm not sure when it will be over.

231
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:45,960
How about this?

232
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,180
I'll keep the ticket for you.

233
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,110
Just tell me in advance if you can't make it.

234
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,640
Okay.

235
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,790
Go home now.

236
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,570
Let's go.

237
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,110
Bye.

238
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:53,710
Bye.

239
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,500
[IN WORK]

240
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,410
I've pretty much secured the deal with this sports brand.

241
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,310
We're still ironing out the contract details.

242
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:05,990
Take a look.

243
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,610
The good news is

244
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,190
they've already invited our magazine

245
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,630
to their Basketball Night Event.

246
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,280
So, it's almost like an official announcement.

247
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,470
Do you need me to go with you?

248
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,670
No need. I've already invited someone.

249
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,840
Why are you using my glass again?

250
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,300
Don't make a fuss about it.

251
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,950
You invited someone?

252
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,710
Is it that model?

253
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,580
It's Xiaoxiao.

254
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,830
Xiaoxiao?

255
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,870
The brand ambassador is Jeremy,

256
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,110
and she's a fan of Jeremy.

257
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,990
So I'm taking her to get an autograph.

258
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,830
But I'll have to wait and see if she's available or not.

259
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,830
Available?

260
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,330
She's not going?

261
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,460
She didn't say that.

262
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,340
So she's going.

263
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,830
She's not sure about that.

264
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,840
Is she going or not?

265
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,510
I don't know.

266
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,990
How could you not know?

267
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,630
Why do you care so much?

268
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,110
What?

269
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,950
If you want to go with me, just tell me.

270
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,110
I'll take you there.

271
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,110
I was just asking.

272
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,830
Just now I saw someone from the advertising department

273
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,230
seeking you for your signature.

274
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,240
It seemed pretty urgent.

275
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
You should go now.

276
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
I saw you sneezing all this morning,

277
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,990
so I brought you this.

278
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,390
Thank you.

279
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,760
Maybe because I got caught in the rain yesterday.

280
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,020
Got caught in the rain?

281
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,310
Xiaoxiao,

282
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,230
if there's any change in the plan,

283
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,110
let me know.

284
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,430
What's the matter?

285
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,890
Why are you sighing again?

286
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,470
Well,

287
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,870
does the academic affairs meeting

288
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,590
have to be on this Friday?

289
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,590
It was scheduled at the beginning of the month.

290
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,950
Is it possible

291
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,940
to postpone it to a later date?

292
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,790
Sure,

293
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,290
if you were the principal.

294
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,710
Can I not go then?

295
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,470
You don't seem to have a choice.

296
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,100
What should I do?

297
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,930
What's wrong?

298
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,530
Are you going on a blind date?

299
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,960
I might miss the only chance in my life

300
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,240
to see Jeremy.

301
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,820
Look who that is.

302
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,600
Hi, teacher.

303
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,200
Zhong Zixuan!

304
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,360
Skipping class again?

305
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,200
Again?

306
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,830
I didn't skip class.

307
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,950
I was just hungry,

308
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,990
so I went to buy some food.

309
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,880
But there were so many people queuing up,

310
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,310
and that's why I... I came back a bit late.

311
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,670
You were hungry, huh?

312
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,830
All the others are training there,

313
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,840
while you're slacking here!

314
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,980
Don't, please don't.

315
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,040
-See you in the training room.
-Stop!

316
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,250
Get him!

317
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,430
What's wrong, handsome?

318
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:52,950
Xu Yan.

319
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,630
I used to believe

320
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,540
once someone reaches their 30s,

321
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,610
they won't let anyone

322
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,990
or anything sway their emotions,

323
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,040
or find themselves

324
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,310
in awkward situations

325
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,450
or dilemmas anymore.

326
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,790
But now, I've come to realize that

327
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,000
it's not like that.

328
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,590
I have a client,

329
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,190
who is 60 years old

330
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,620
and still behaves as childishly as a kid.

331
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,380
So,

332
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,520
as long as people are alive,

333
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,780
they keep adding new episodes to their history of follies.

334
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,990
What if they die?

335
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,930
Do you have any property to leave to me?

336
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,690
You know what?

337
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,840
I really like chatting with you.

338
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,930
Alright.

339
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,460
I have a meeting.

340
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,050
Thanks for the coffee.

341
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:47,990
Bye.

342
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,310
Xu Yan.

343
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,710
I brought the parcel back for you.

344
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,600
Okay.

345
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,460
The meal is almost ready.

346
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,480
Thank you.

347
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,870
You're welcome.

348
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,060
Why did you go dancing today?

349
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,480
It's not a weekend.

350
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,150
Today, the community

351
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,950
is going to participate in a square dance competition,

352
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,000
so we went for a rehearsal.

353
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,840
Good.

354
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,630
It helps you keep fit and allows you to make friends,

355
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,830
which is better than staying alone at home.

356
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,710
Right?

357
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,290
You know that too?

358
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,830
Then why do you stay at home all day?

359
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,910
Are you

360
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,480
gong to live alone

361
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,420
for the rest of your life?

362
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,340
Who's ever heard of a mother-in-law

363
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,740
pressuring her son-in-law to get married?

364
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,920
Jie has been gone for so many years.

365
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,920
As her mother,

366
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,810
I have to think about your future.

367
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,520
I think I'm doing pretty well now.

368
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,700
Mom,

369
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,270
I steamed this rice using an open flame today,

370
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,220
and there's even some crispy rice at the bottom.

371
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,730
Come on.

372
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,630
Dig in.

373
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,110
Alright.

374
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,340
I'll go get changed first.

375
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:15,980
Okay.

376
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,570
Last week, I took a trip to San Francisco.

377

748
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,750
But it's much better than before.

749
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Why did you

750
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,190
come to pick me up today?

751
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,630
I'm...

752
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:04,990
the main culprit behind your waist injury.

753
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,140
So I feel like I bear a tiny bit

754
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,880
of responsibility for your pain.

755
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,670
I'll shoulder the responsibility that's rightfully mine.

756
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,930
It's not that serious.

757
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,110
Actually,

758
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,510
I should thank you.

759
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,590
For what?

760
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,310
Hello.

761
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,130
You're here. Hurry up.

762
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,270
How did you two get here together?

763
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,630
He...

764
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,220
came to campus to pick me up out of the blue.

765
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,280
I don't mind.

766
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,700
I'm happy

767
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,350
that there's a handsome guy with us.

768
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,230
Mr. Ye,

769
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,110
I didn't get the chance to say hello to you properly.

770
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,520
Hello.

771
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,080
That interview was 10 years ago,

772
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,350
and you still remember he was the editor-in-chief?

773
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,830
It's hard to forget such a handsome face, right?

774
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,889
I even remember you interviewed me yourself back then.

775
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,690
You can see the professional quality of a female star.

776
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,050
You had at least ten interviews a day.

777
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,260
Actually there was no way you remembered me.

778
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,330
I mean it.

779
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,190
I even praised your handsome looks back then.

780
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,909
But then your staff told me

781
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,810
you were about to get married.

782
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,370
I was a little disappointed when I heard that.

783
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,219
Don't get me wrong.

784
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,630
That happened many years ago.

785
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,500
Get you wrong?

786
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,510
Me?

787
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,469
Why did you say that to me?

788
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,810
So you're not married.

789
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,100
And you're dating her?

790
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:51,010
We're not dating!

791
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,110
Don't talk nonsense.

792
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,870
There's nothing between us.

793
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,989
Trust me.

794
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,070
Absolutely not.

795
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,350
You can't be so sure about a relationship between a man and a woman.

796
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,910
Weren't you two

797
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,230
all dressed up for your date a few days ago?

798
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,950
That's not what you think.

799
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,300
Besides,

800
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,860
we can't possibly develop into that kind of relationship,

801
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,850
can we?

802
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,670
Why not?

803
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,560
You and I don't have any family feuds.

804
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,430
Or to say the least, we're not

805
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,140
biological siblings, right?

806
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,020
Don't be so sure about a relationship

807
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,420
between a man and a woman.

808
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,900
We are just...

809
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,680
We are just good friends.

810
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,870
Good friends.

811
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,940
Understand?

812
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,440
Calm down.

813
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,580
Good friends. Fine.

814
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,490
Who is your crush then?

815
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,710
Nobody.

816
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,480
I don't have a crush.

817
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,830
Hold on,

818
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,540
isn't it that guy?

819
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,200
So you know who her crush is?

820
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,890
That was many years ago.

821
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,960
And it passed very quickly.

822
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,950
Not bad, Xiaoxiao.

823
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,380
It seems that

824
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,480
your relationship with Mr. Ye

825
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,300
is even better than ours now.

826
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,140
Are you jealous of him?

827
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,240
I'm leaving.

828
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,360
-Bye.
-Bye.

829
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,470
Watch your steps.

830
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,630
Take care.

831
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,350
Why did you bring that up?

832
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,190
Because you always tend to say

833
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,780
that we're not in any kind of relationship.

834
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,250
So I just helped you explain.

835
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,380
Isn't that what you want?

836
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,770
But you can't bring that up.

837
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,830
Don't you know my current situation?

838
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,590
Is it fun to keep making those jokes?

839
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,930
And you even said that in front of Yiwen.

840
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,030
Childish.

841
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:53,950
Childish?

842
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,190
You're right.

843
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,710
I also think I'm childish

844
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,760
and stupid.

845
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,900
I'm always like this when I see you.

846
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,020
To be honest, I've had enough.

847
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,330
Look.

848
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,830
I've retrieved the magazine with typos,

849
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,990
had the photoshoot for the magazine,

850
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,690
signed the settlement agreement,

[Ryuuginn Izakaya]

852
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,280
and even got the gaming equipment back.

853
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,460
Do you know what all this means?

854
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,000
It means we have no reason to meet again.

855
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,660
So it's probably best

856
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,550
if we don't meet each other again.

857
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,330
I guess I won't be able to send you home now.

858
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,480
Get well soon.

859
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,570
Bye.

860
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,180
I'm talking to it.

861
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,190
I'm happy to see you again.

862
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,430
Thank you for saving me,

863
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,540
both for today

864
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,950
and for the day at that party.

865
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,130
Thank you.

866
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,760
Lean on me.

867
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,760

Are we really not going to see each other again?

Coming.

878
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,020
Grandma!

879
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,380
Why are you here?

880
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,490
I miss you so much.

881
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,960
If you miss me, come back home more often.

882
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,690
Come in.

883
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,020
Should I change my shoes?

884
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,470
No, no need. Come in.

885
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,380
I

886
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,340
came to Shanghai for some business,

887
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,820
and decided to drop by to visit you.

888
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,280
I'll take it. Give it to me.

889
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,990
What are you carrying?

890
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:57,750
They're so heavy.

891
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,750
These are all the dishes that you and Yiwen love to eat.

892
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,080
Yiwen is not home?

893
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,770
She's not here. She usually comes back late.

894
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,350
Don't buy so much stuff next time.

895
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,750
It's heavy to carry them.

896
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,670
We can buy anything here.

897
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,470
What you buy can't compare to what's homemade.

898
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,200
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

899
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,970
I'm fine. Have a seat.

900
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,480
Are you sure?

901
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,860
What's this about?

902
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,840
Nothing.

903
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,200
Stop pretending.

904
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,240
-Be gentle.
-You kids…

905
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,910
Sit down. Hurry.

906
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,580
How did you get hurt?

907
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,400
I accidentally

908
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,730
strained my waist.

909
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,170
But it's fine. I've asked the doctor.

910
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,750
He said I would recover in a few days.

911
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,820
It seems

912
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,120
I came at the right time.

913
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,910
You can't always keep problems to yourself.

914
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,860
What's the point of playing tough?

915
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,630
I don't want you to worry about me.

916
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,080
The more you don't tell me, the more worried I become.

917
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,910
I live far from you,

918
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,780
and maybe I can't help you much,

919
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:57,750
but I can always give you some

920
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,950
ideas or tips.

921
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,110
Actually,

922
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,240
I do have one thing on my mind.

923
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,860
Is it troubling you?
