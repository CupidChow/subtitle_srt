00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,270
Actually,

5
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,600
I'm not Xu Yan's mother.

6
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,970
I'm Jie's mother.

7
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,970
I know you're still young

8
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,580
and immature,

9
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,830
but you went too far today.

10
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,840
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,670
I didn't expect that.

12
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,010
I only know you live with your mom.

13
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,900
I didn't expect that it would be Jie's mother.

14
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,880
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,430
Saying sorry

16
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,030
is not enough to settle this.

17
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,390
You've hurt three people.

18
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,400
No.

19
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,260

21
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,480
It's your business

22
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,220
if you like me.

23
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,840
I have no right to interfere.

24
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,020
But please don't do anything

25
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,370
that affects my life anymore.

26
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,410
Everything you did bothered me.

27
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,070
They were useless.

28
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:09,900
So,

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,840
please don't do them again.

30
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,120

Where are you from?

41
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,390
From...

00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,230
Why are you here?

44
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,270
I thought you didn't bring an umbrella, so I came to pick you up.

45
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,910
Go.

00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,130

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:05,690
Okay.

48
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,960
So, he didn't contact me all-day

49
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,870
just for this moment.

50
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,860
But,

51
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,680
how did he know I was here?

52
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,590

Jiacheng invited you to dinner.

56

He sent you the location.

57

You two don't have to take care of me in turn.

58
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,470
I'm not a kid.

59

Don't take care of me

60
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,900
just because I'm a girl.

61
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,120
It's natural

62
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,720
to take care of an old friend.

63
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,550
How is Jiacheng now?

64
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,370
Will I not recognize him later?

65
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,730
Probably.

66
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,470
He's old now.

67
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,060

74
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,250
I mean it literally.

Where was I?

91

How would I know?

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,180
Were you following me?

93
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,540
I was not.

00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,140
I was just passing by.

95
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,390
Then, I saw you.

96
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,850
I just took a look out of curiosity.

97

What did you see, then?

We worked hard

127

I don't want you to misunderstand.

00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,990
We used to shoot for a magazine together.

162

163
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,440

Declaration.

165
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,230
It's been ten years.

166
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,870
So you're a colleague starting the business

167
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,470
with Ye Han and the others?

168
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,250
You have a good memory.

169
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,360
But it's probably because your photos

170
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,340
were in the initial issue.

171
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,110
Actually, I've only recently learned about

172
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,320
your magazine and your initial issue.

173
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,180
What a coincidence.

00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,750
I haven't been back for five years.

175
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,090
I'm here with Jiacheng and others today.

176
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,320
You should know Ye Han and Jiacheng, right?

177
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,830
I've known them before.

178
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,170
Why don't we...

179
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,340
I have something else to do.

180
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,850
I'm leaving.

181
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,190
Yiwen said

182
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,320
she had to leave for something urgent.

183
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,120
How can she go home so early?

184
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,730
We finally get together.

185
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,290
How can she do that?

186
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,560
Forget it.

187
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,550
Let's drink.

00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,170
Here.

189
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,610
Yiwen left her lipstick

190
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,760
in the bathroom.

191
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,460
You saw her?

192

If we walk arm in arm like this,

329

it's like we're a newlywed couple
looking for a house.

330
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,150

-Okay, let's go in.
-Please come in.

347

This is Mr. Liu, the tenant.

00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,570
He's still staying here.

349
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,970
It might take some time before he moves out.

350

351
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,310

-Take a look.
-Thank you.

353
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,690
The apartment faces south.

354
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,970

359

But Mr. Liu can't move out

360
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,310

361
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,590
Can you move in later?

362
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,390
I'm going to sell my house.

363
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,990
And the moving date is set.

364
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,990
There's a gap of

365
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,670
about a dozen days.

366
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,470
If you like this apartment,

367
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,560
you can wait for a dozen more days.

368
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,860
You can stay in the hotel for a few days

369
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,920
or stay at your friend's home.

370
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,940
We've seen several apartments.

371
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,890
Actually, this one is really good.

372
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,960
The space is ample,
and the structure is reasonable.

373
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,150
It also has a wide view

374
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,430
and high water pressure.

375
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,770
There aren't many good apartments like this.

376
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,200
But there's one more thing I need to check.

377
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,630
Can I see the bathroom?

378
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,130
Sure.

379
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,540
It's inside. Take a look.

380
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,340
Thank you.

381
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,670
What's going on?

382
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,360
Hurry up.

383
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,370
Did I do something bad out of kindness again?

384
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:01,950
Why are you so careless?

385
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,160
You'll catch a cold.

386
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,950
Let's go.

387
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,110
Hand, Xu Yan.

388
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,680
Hand. Can you hold my hand?

389
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,300
Let's go.

390
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,420
Where are you going?

391
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,850
I don't think I need to
report my schedule to you.

392
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,390
Let's go

393
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,990
to an Italian restaurant tonight.

394
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,230
The one you want to go.

395
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,620
The one I want to...

396
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,580
Could it be...

397
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,900
the one you...

398
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,960
have been wanting to go

399
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,470
for a long time?

400
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,190
Thank you for the invitation,

401
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,430
but I'm busy.

402
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,470
Maybe next time.

403
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,950
I don't want to eat alone.

404
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,710
You're over 30.

405
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,550
Almost 40.

406
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,190
Yet you're still not used to eating alone?

407
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,740
You're not going with me?

408
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,140
You have no conscience.

409
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,140
I guess it is pitiful to eat alone.

410
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,760
Hello?

411
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,710
Xiaoxiao.

412
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,430
I want to eat Italian food.

413
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,190
Okay, I'll send you the address.

414
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,200
See you later.

415
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,800
I'm such a good sister.

416
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,290
Hello, Jialin.

417
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,520
I'm here.

418
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,620
Where are you?

419
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,690
Do you still have this?

420
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,500
Yes.

421
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:05,530
Xiaoxiao?

422
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,280
I'll deal with you later.

423
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,390
Hold on.

424
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,650
Why are you here?

425
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,070
What a coincidence.

426
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,260
You're alone?

427
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,990
You're alone, too?

428
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,840
Let's eat together. Come on.

429
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,810
Good. I don't want to eat alone.

430
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,610
Hurry up.

431
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,670
Thank you.

432
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,640
Have a seat.

433
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,710
Work and love.

434
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,550
It's good.

435
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,410
Where are you?

436
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,650
I don't want to see your photos anymore.

437
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,340
Kids nowadays

438
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,950
can't play an adversarial game anymore.

439
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,750
They're nothing like we were back then.

440
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,070
Time is changing.

441
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,890
The popular lineup now is

442
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,380
one major player and four assistants.

443
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,480
Sometimes, the lineup

444
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,210
can be five resistant players.

445
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,270
You always

446
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,560
argue for the sake of argue whenever you can't persuade me with reason.

447
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,090
I can't lose in this aspect.

448
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,330
I'm the coach.

449
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,650
Yes, Coach.

450
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,170
You're the only one who can talk with me about this.

451
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,450
Actually, we should meet more often.

452
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,580
You want to meet more often

453
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,240
for other reasons, don't you?

454
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,250
You haven't asked you about Yiwen today.

455
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,460
Go ahead.

456
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,780
I won't ask about her anymore.

457
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,460
Even if we don't talk about her,

458
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,190
we're still having a good time.

459
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,460
Whatever you want to talk about,

460
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,920
come to me anytime.

461
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,440
I'm always available.

462
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,440
Thank you, Xiaoxiao.

463
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,780
Do you want something else?

464
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,060
No, thanks. I'm full.

465
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,200
You're done?

466
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,950
Waitress, check please.

467
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,690
Let me pay this time.

468
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,210
How can I let a girl pay?

469
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,430
Can I pay by phone?

470
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
If you need to pay by phone,

471
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,470
come with me to the reception.

472
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,670
Stop fighting for it.

473
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,650
It's always your treat.

474
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,380
Give me a chance today.

475
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,580
Pay by credit card. There's no password.

476
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,290
Okay.

477
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,960
I need to use the bathroom.

478
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
Let me do it.

479
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,330
-Thank you.
-Okay.

480
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,390
You're back?

481
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,670
I parked my car downstairs.

482
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,990
You just got off work?

483
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,200
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

484
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,070
Ye Han.

485
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,870
Does Xiaoxiao like me?

486
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,910
Does she?

487
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,510
I'm asking you.

488
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,990
I don't know.

489
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:32,990
What do you mean?

490
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,510
Aren't you close?

491
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,460
We're not close enough

492
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,020
to talk about that.

493
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,080
Why do you think so?

494
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,950
I saw something.

495
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,680
But I haven't figured it out yet.

496
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,300
What did you see?

497
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,410
Nothing. Forget it.

498
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,240
I'm leaving.

499
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,270
Will it affect you?

500
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,860
I mean,

501
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,470
if Xiaoxiao likes you,

502
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,770
will it affect you?

503
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,540
Of course.

504
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,470
Don't tell her

505
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,030
that I know she likes me.

506
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,810
Forget

507
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,000
what I just said.

508
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,470
Why?

509
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,540
To protect our relationships.

510
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,640
What are you going to do?

511
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,840
I don't know yet.

512
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,080
But I don't want to lose this friend.

513
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,690
Bye.

514
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,470
Don't tell her

515
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,270
that I know she likes me.

516
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,300
To protect our relationships.

517
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,210
[Album of the 52nd Graduates of No.108 High School]

518
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,430
Stop.

519
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,740
Come here.

520
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,070
Explain it to me.

521
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,430
What's going on?

522
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,750
Your photo doesn't look good.

523
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,760
I threw it away that day.

524
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,630
Xu Jialin.

525
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,720
Do you think I will believe you?

526
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,470
Actually, it's not that
the photo doesn't look good.

527
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,830
It's that you don't look good.

528
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,750
Didn't anyone tell you?

529
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,050
You'd better tell me the truth.

530
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,140
I already know where the photo went.

531
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,150
How could you know about it?

532
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,710
Because I saw it.

533
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,370
Why did you look at her wallet?

534
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,720
Did you know that Xiaoxiao likes me long ago?

535
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,840
Did you scheme

536
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,670
behind that dinner just now?

537
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,070
I admit I did all those.

538
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,790
It has nothing to do with Xiaoxiao.

539
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,510
Don't tell her you know.

540
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,870
Xu Jialin.

541
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,720
When will you grow up?

542
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,670
You always do these useless things.

543
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,430
No, that meal is really for you.

544
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:56,870
This photo...

545
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,240
Don't you think about the consequences?

546
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,370
I'm sorry, Brother.

547
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,420
I'm sorry, Brother.

548
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,710
Don't play this on me.

549
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,430
Go back to your room now and pack up.

550
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,150
Go home.

551
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,670
Please…

552
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,070
Take care of your own problems.

553
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,630
Brother.

554
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,990
Wish you good luck.

555
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,620
I know I was wrong.

556
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,430
I'm doomed.

557
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,710
If Xiaoxiao knows that my brother finds out

558
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,990
she likes him because of me,

559
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,120
she'll kill me.

560
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,010
I'll die anyway, I might as well kill myself.

561
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,950
Come in!

562
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,630
I'm dead, Brother.

563
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,400
I'm back.

564
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,070
I'm so thirsty.

565
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,290
What are you doing?

566
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,990
My training shoes are broken.

567
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,270
I'm fixing them.

568
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,310
You work too hard.

569
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,910
Be careful.

570
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,970
Don't be too tired.

571
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,670
Your feet are injured.

572
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,990
The interview for the Fashion Week
is about to begin.

573
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,280
I can't slack off anymore.

574
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,630
Interview?

575
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,920
Only newbies do interviews.

576
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,140
You were...

577
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,760
I was famous before, right?

578
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,230
If we consider my past fame as the red color,

579
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,220
it became rose last year

580
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,810
and faded to light pink

581
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,070
this year.

582
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,910
With my previous grades,

583
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,190
the brands won't use me directly anymore.

584
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,230
But interviews are good for me.

585
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,090
I regard it as a warm-up training.

586
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,510
I think

587
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,640
you will be very popular in the future.

588
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,070
You'll be popular

589
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,470
among all brands.

590
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,370
Are you so confident in me?

591
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,380
Of course.

592
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,080
I'm your biggest fan.

593
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,070
I think I'll keep my snacks

594
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,670
to myself.

595
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,470
Don't eat too much.

596
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,650
Don't worry. I'll drink this.

597
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,620
Let me ask you.

598
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,190
When I went out a few days ago,

599
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,990
I found a line at the door.

600
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,740
But it became two lines the next day.

601
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,430
They were getting closer to the door.

602
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,840
Was someone targeting us?

603
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,050
This time,

604
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,490
I'm being targeted.

605
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,630
Who is it?

606
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,540
It's Ye Han.

607
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,110
He must be

608
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,130
planning something.

609
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,150
Let me impart my valuable experience to you.

610
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,360
Be easy

611
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,030
on men.

612
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,800
Don't show too much curiosity.

613
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,960
As you know,

614
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,400
I don't have much experience in love.

615
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,660
And I've met Ye Han,

616
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,640
a man who doesn't follow the rules.

617
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,670
For my simple brain,

618
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,410
it is already Mode Difficult.

619
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,000
That's what makes it fun.

620
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,430
Besides,

621
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,300
I'm an expert in love and relationships.

622
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,720
I'll definitely help you reach the top level.

623
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,470
You just need to figure out

624
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,100
whether you want to be with him or not.

625
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,940
But I don't know.

626
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,560
Take your time, then.

627
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,820
I wonder if your Mr. Ye

628
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,310
will give you enough time.

629
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,620
What are you talking about?

630
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,159
We're not in a relationship yet.

631
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,290
Don't make fun of me.

632
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,920
Why are you here?

633
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,060
You have a competition today?

634
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,620
Don't go.

635
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,510
Why?

636
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,820
I don't want you to see Jiacheng.

637
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,929
What do you mean?

638
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,110
What's wrong?

639
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,949
Are you still into him?

640
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:50,460
How many times have I told you?

641
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,659
Don't talk nonsense.

642
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,989
Have you ever had a crush on me?

643
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,850
What's wrong?

644
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:58,670
Are you drunk early in the morning?

645
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,470
No.

646
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,670
Answer me.

647
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,010
Yes.

648
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,550
One moment.

649
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,710
Can you go with me?

650
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,310
Now.

651
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,170
With this moment's crush,

652
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,650
go with me.

653
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,700
Why should I go with you?

654
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,850
Where are we going? You have to tell me.

655
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,210
I don't know why you don't want to tell me.

656
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,970
Today's competition is very important.

657
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,870
I'm leaving.

658
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,560
Jiacheng?

659
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,390
When did you come?

660
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,670
Just now.

661
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,260
You're early.

662
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:13,890
Yes.

663
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,060
Today's competition is so important.

664
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,720
Of course I have to come early.

665
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,460
We've lost four games out of five. I'm so nervous!

666
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,780
Plus, Xu Yan is not here today.

667
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,270
It's bad for us.

668
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,220
That's right. Blame him if we lose.

669
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,820
Do you want me

670
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,440
to take part in disguise?

671
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,170
You?

672
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,480
If we work together,

673
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,810
we'll definitely win.

674
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,010
I was thinking,

675
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,670
you seemed to be the one who put the pads on me

676
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,070
every time we play a game.

677
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,950
Yes.

678
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,310
Shouldn't you do something?

679
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,290
How?

680
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,570
Pay me.

681
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,510
Sure.

682
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,880
Why are you here?

683
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,810
I want to

684
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,530
find a kind of sport

685
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,280
to consume

686
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,730
my extra hormones.

687
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,880
So, I'm here to see your team.

688
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,890
It will start in ten minutes.

689
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,110
Keep your warm-up.

690
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,070
I'll go check on others.

691
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:14,850
Okay.

692
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,410
How's the warm-up going?

693
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,770
-Coach.
-Hello, Coach.

694
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,990
Warm up your body.

695
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,520
Don't get hurt later.

696
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,270
Defend him. Defend him.

697
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,270
Defense!

698
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:43,180
♫I want to say something♫

699
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,950
♫But I just stand there and stare for a long time♫

700
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,920
♫Maybe I don't want to leave♫

701
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,930
♫It still hurts♫

702
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,510
♫Looking back♫

703
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:05,240
♫I feel so much warmth again♫

704
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,970
♫I'll be with you♫

705
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,170
♫I'll see this through♫

706
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:18,950
♫If we can notice all the considerations♫

707
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,720
♫At the intersection of time♫

708
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,820
♫Let's not lose each other again♫

709
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,650
We'll have some beer.

710
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,570
Foie Gras with Black Truffle.

711
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,110
Spanish Shrimp.

712
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,790
I remember you like shrimp,

713
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:45,720
right?

714
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,190
You're quite considerate.

715
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,270
Really?

716
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,310
Yes.

717
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,910
One for that table, too.

718
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,830
-Okay.
-Here. Thank you.

719
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,030
Please wait a moment.

720
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,790
Your last shot

721
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,510
was so great.

722
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,560
You know what?

723
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,020
One more shot this year,

724
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,350
you will contribute 500 points for our Blue Dragon.

725
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,790
500? That much?

726
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,830
Of course.

727
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,430
Coach, how did you know?

728
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,490
Have you counted his shots one by one?

729
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,550
Jiacheng is the lead player.

730
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,330
I record his scores.

731
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,970
Isn't that what I should do?

732
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,130
I can do it myself.

733
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,390
Do you remember

734
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,650
my scores at Blue Dragon, Coach?

735
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,390
No.

736
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,750
Coach.

737
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,510
You are too biased.

738
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,240
You only remember Jiacheng's.

739
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,180
It's okay. I can do it myself.

740
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,510
Jiacheng.

741
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,440
Jiacheng, watch the video review.

742
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,450
I'll review it.

743
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,170
Kaijie, come and watch.

744
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,880
-I'm coming.
-So handsome!

745
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,590
Come on, cheers.

746
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,670
Come on.

747
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,640
Come with me.

748
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,340
Come on.

749
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,540
Blue Dragon will win!

750
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,720
What are you doing?

751
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,290
Why can't we talk inside?

752
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,350
As long as we're not inside,

753
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,430
anywhere is okay.

754
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:56,910
What's wrong with you today?

755
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,110
You've been acting weird since this morning.

756
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,510
You didn't say anything.

757
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,070
What on earth do you want?

758
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,350
What do I want?

759
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,150
I don't want you to be in there

760
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,270
like a fool.

761
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,330
Why am I like a fool?

762
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,960
I don't mean that.

763
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,750
Tell me. Why am I like a fool?

764
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,430
Does Jiacheng know?

765
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,150
How did he know?

766
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,310
I'm not sure.

767
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,570
But yesterday he asked me

768
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,760
if you liked him.

769
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,830
Then, I did look like a fool.

770
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,820
Jiacheng

771
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,420
told me not to tell you.

772
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,750
He said he wanted to solve it himself.

773
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,880
You're the person I like.

774
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,200
He's my friend.

775
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,920
It's hard for me.

776
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,340
I see.

777
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:31,480
Hello?

778
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,550
Hello, Ye Han. Where did you go?

779
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,380
We have something to do.

780
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,390
We had to leave early.

781
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,010
♫I'll be heartbroken no matter how careful I am♫

782
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:06,200
♫We could only blame that we didn't have time to prepare for it♫

783
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,190
I was thinking,

784
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,870
you seemed to be the one who put the pads on me

785
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,390
every time we play a game.

786
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,430
♫If missing is a misunderstanding♫

787
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,250
♫The contradictory emotions are also shaky♫

788
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,410
I can do it myself.

789
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,070
Coach.

790
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,430
You are too biased.

791
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,990
You only remember Jiacheng's.

792
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,790
♫The traffic lights are like tears♫

793
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,350
It's okay. I can do it myself.

794
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,820
♫Twinkling in my heart♫

795
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:27,000
♫Time has stolen blossoms♫

796
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,640
♫Like a silent monologue♫

797
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:31,850
♫But my heartbeats♫

798
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:37,020
♫Turn the past pages♫

799
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,450
♫We met by chance and missed each other; I look forward to seeing you again♫
