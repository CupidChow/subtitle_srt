00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,040
are you free tonight?

195
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,030
I want to treat you to a meal

196
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,030
as a celebration.

197
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,980
It's not necessary.

198
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,650
Let's all have a meal together.

199
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,490
My treat.

200
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,580
Sure.

201
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,030
-Where's Xu Yan? -You can't go in.

202
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,780
We're looking for Xu Yan.

203
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,670
If you keep acting like thism I'll call security!

204
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,670
Go away.

205
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,170
I'm sorry, Lawyer Xu, they...

206
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,860
I couldn't stop them.

207
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,260
Go out first.

208
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,000
It's okay.

209
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,659
Big shot lawyer.

210
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,220
I'm sorry.

211
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,450
We came uninvited.

212
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,070
Since you said on the phone

213
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,360
that you're Zixuan's attorney,

214
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,330
Then let's sit down and talk.

215
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,360
Okay.

216
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,190
We can sit down

217
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,350
and talk.

218
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,480
[Natural Planet]

219
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,390
What's wrong?

220
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,840
Why are you still here?

221
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll leave soon.

222
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,620
The employees complained.

223
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,550
About what?

224
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,470
Their boss is too diligent,

225
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,790
so they dare not get off work earlier than their boss.

226
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,200
Bro, it's Friday.

227
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,710
Do you want them

228
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,230
to work overtime with you on a Friday night?

229
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,310
It's too cruel.

230
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,580
Got it. You're rushing me away.

231
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,750
Go on a date.

232
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,450
Okay.

233
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,860
Thank you, President Xu.

234
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,200
Leave within the next 5 minutes.

235
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,250
What are you doing?

236
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,470
I'm packing my clothes.

237
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,590
This goes against ergonomics principles, doesn't it?

238
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,090
Don't tell me you actually wore those.

239
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,260
These were my combat boots.

240
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,640
When I put them on, I felt so powerful.

241
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,780
How did you manage not to fall?

242
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,690
Look at the soles.

243
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,110
I put glue on them

244
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,950
so they were very steady.

245
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,490
You're amazing.

246
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,120
One truly becomes outstanding through enduring hardships.

247
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,890
Put it in that box for me.

248
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,640
I'll sell them all later.

249
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,250
You're getting rid of all this?

250
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,600
Yes.

251
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,150
I won't wear them again.

252
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,040
I have to make room for my new tools.

253
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,500
Look. What do you think?

254
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,300
Not bad, Tong Yiwen.

255
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,740
You look a bit like a real designer now.

256
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,750
Just a bit?

257
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,680
No.

258
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,560
You're Tong Yiwen, the future great designer.

259
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,100
Yes.

260
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,390
Are you meeting Jiacheng's mother tomorrow?

261
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,240
Yes.

262
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,830
Are you nervous?

263
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,230
I'm fine.

264
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,170
You must control your emotions.

265
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,120
Actually, I've figured it out.

266
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,260
Whether it's my love life or career,

267
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,680
it's a choice that I made.

268
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,870
So, I won't waiver

269
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,350
because of what his mother says.

270
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,460
That's right.

271
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,210
I have faith in you.

272
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:39,870
Come on.

273
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,280
So...

274
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,020
what do I need to do?

275
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,610
Just take these out for me.

276
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,830
Got it!

277
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,490
No problem.

278
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,290
Hey, do you want to hang out?

279
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,430
Okay.

280
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,710
It's me, Jialin.

281
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,980
When did you get a boyfriend?

282
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,420
Fine, you two have fun.

283
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,170
Hello?

284
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,840
Long time no see.

285
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,870
Don't you run a bar?

286
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,470
Do you want to go out tonight?

287
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,190
It closed down?

288
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,330
Sorry.

289
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,600
I've blocked you.

290
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,590
Why do you have no response at all?

291
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,900
I'm so annoyed.

292
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,350
This won't do.

293
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,800
I'm going crazy.

294
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,110
Ye Han, let's talk.

295
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Ye Han, I have something to tell you.

296
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,310
Stop avoiding from me.

297
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,310
What did you say?

298
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,390
I said, stop avoiding me.

299
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,360
How could you say that to me?

300
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
Right.

301
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,190
You can avoid me,

302
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,220
but I can't avoid you, right?

303
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,830
What about the years

304
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,090
you spent avoiding me?

305
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,210
You disappeared for so many years.

306
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,830
Then you suddenly appeared in front of my house

307
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,430
and told me not to avoid you.

308
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,090
What a joke!

309
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,030
Ye Han, I'm sorry.

310
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,880
I'm really sorry.

311
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,640
I know whatever I say now is useless.

312
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,000
But you must trust me.

313
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,280
In this time,

314
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,700
I've been suffering, just like you.

315
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,720
Okay.

316
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,130
Keep suffering then.

317
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,220
But don't ever come to me again.

318
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,400
I don't want to hear anything from you either.

319
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,250
Why are you here?

320
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,090
I missed you.

321
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,230
So I came to look for you,

322
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,620
and found you asleep

323
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,010
so I waited for you here.

324
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,530
You're smiling like that because you saw me?

325
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,690
Yes.

326
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,990
Otherwise, would it be because you look funny?

327
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,510
As long as you're happy.

328
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,910
Well,

329
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,340
pretend to be a pig

330
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,300
to make me happier then.

331
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,660
So this is how it feels

332
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,290
to see you once I open my eyes.

333
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,890
How does it feel?

334
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,710
I feel blessed.

335
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,570
It's a bit

336
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,470
unreal to me.

337
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,980
What are you going to do this weekend?

338
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,300
I don't know.

339
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,730
It's good to stay like this.

340
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,590
Well,

341
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,580
let's go on a trip, okay?

342
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,970
A trip?

343
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,480
Where?

344
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Camping.

345
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,340
Camping?

346
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,550
Okay.

347
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:52,990
When?

348
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,990
Now.

349
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,050
Now?

350
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,310
Are you okay?

351
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,900
I'm a little nervous.

352
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,430
I got you.

353
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,790
Because we met here last time as well.

354
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,470
It's okay.

355
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,460
Mom, you're here.

356
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,640
Hello, Auntie.

357
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,810
Have a seat.

358
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,110
If I offended you last time,

359
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,360
or caused you discomfort,

360
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,640
I'm sorry.

361
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,590
I've ordered the dishes.

362
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,920
Your favourite dishes.

363
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,950
No need.

364
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,160
Have a seat.

365
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,620
I just have a few words,

366
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,780
so I'll say them now.

367
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,380
Tong Yiwen.

368
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,220
Since you're so straightforward,

369
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,000
I won't beat around the bush.

370
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,150
Do you remember,

371
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,900
last time, we were here too?

372
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,550
You told me

373
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,770
that you do everything on your own

374
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:15,980
and you won't rely on my son to help you.

375
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,619
But as far as I know,

376
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,589
you didn't handle the termination of your contract

377
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,819
with the company through your own efforts.

378
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,980
-Auntie, I can explain...
-Mom.

379
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,750
If you're here today

380
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,190
to tell us this,

381
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,520
then save it.

382
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,820
Good. You mentioned 'us'.

383
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,680
Tong Yiwen.

384
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,930
I have a question.

385
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,770
Do you want to be our Xu family's daughter-in-law?

386
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,080
It's not that easy

387
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,250
to be our daughter-in-law.

388
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,040
Jiacheng doesn't want to manage the company.

389
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,560
We want our daughter-in-law to take over the company

390
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,110
and manage the hotel.

391
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,520
You are just a model.

392
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,260
Do you know how to run a hotel?

393
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,250
Can you do it?

394
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,850
Auntie,

395
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,230
I haven't been with Jiacheng for long.

396
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,620
We haven't talked about marriage yet.

397
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,130
Besides, both of us

398
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,300
are working hard for our own careers.

399
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,110
Although I quit being a model,

400
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,170
I'm also working in the field of design.

401
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,000
Enough, enough.

402
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,150
Say no more.

403
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,790
I understand.

404
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,800
I didn't plan to let you

405
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,550
be of help to our company anyway.

406
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,510
Mom, this is between us.

407
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,180
Why are you saying this?

408
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,760
In that case,

409
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,310
let me tell you again.

410
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,080
Yiwen and I will not break up,

411
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,710
no matter what you try to do.

412
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,940
Must it be her?

413
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,030
Yes.

414
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,560
I'm happy with her.

415
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Are you satisfied with this answer?

416
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,830
Jiacheng, do you know her?

417
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,300
Do you know her family?

418
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,590
I don't care.

419
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,420
But we do.

420
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,850
Jiacheng, you are already in your 30s.

421
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,490
You should be more mature, you know?

422
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,320
Marriage is a big thing.

423
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,370
Is it a decision you can make

424
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,640
without thinking about both families?

425
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,470
Mom.

426
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,390
I know

427
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,870
I let you down.

428
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,050
But what you said today

429
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,400
has let me down too.

430
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,480
How did I let you down?

431
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,740
Do you think I came here

432
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,430
to chat with you?

433
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,040
I'll do anything

434
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,430
to break you guys up.

435
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,560
I'm here today

436
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,360
to tell you

437
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,580
that I will never allow you two to be together.

438
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,860
Let's go.

439
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,340
There's no need to listen.

440
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Stop right there.

441
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,530
You leave

442
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,140
when I say you can leave.

443
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,100
You don't have the right.

444
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,750
Sorry, I...

445
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,270
When my mom gets angry, she talks without thinking.

446
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,310
But she's not usually like this.

447
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,820
Don't worry about me.

448
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,430
Before I came,

449
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,010
I was already expecting to get splashed,

450
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,560
or slapped in the face.

451
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,110
So I'm fine.

452
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,280
Don't worry.

453
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,500
Thank you.

454
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,540
How could you let her finish her speech?

455
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,430
It's because you're sitting next to me.

456
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,010
Trust me.

457
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,330
No matter what my mom says,

458
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,870
I won't change my mind.

459
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,270
I trust you.

460
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,990
Where are we going?

461
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,160
You'll know when we get there.

462
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,700
A place where you can relax.

463
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,240
We'll be there in an hour.

464
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,630
Why do I feel like

465
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,040
you're a little quiet today?

466
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,860
Really?

467
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,880
Maybe I'm too focused on driving.

468
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,760
After all, I'm your exclusive driver.

469
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,100
Well, Ye,

470
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,840
play a song for me then.

471
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,040
Sure.

472
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,520
Are you really not going out?

473
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,880
It's good to relax.

474
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,830
I have to finish the drawing first.

475
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,190
How about I go up and accompany you?

476
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,610
Xiaoxiao seems to be at home.

477
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,760
Forget it then.

478
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,510
Go home.

479
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,440
Don't be upset.

480
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,090
Tell me if you're unhappy.

481
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,810
Roger that, Mrs. Xu.

482
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,360
Bye-bye.

483
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,290
Bye-bye.

484
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,540
Is that your boyfriend?

485
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,080
He looks pretty nice.

486
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,630
It's none of your business.

487
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,170
I'm just trying to show some care for you.

488
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,770
You're out of money already?

489
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,890
I have no choice in Shanghai. I only...

490
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,430
So the only solution you can come up with

491
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,530
is to have me, your daughter,

492
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,770
be your ATM.

493
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,410
I've made it very clear to you last time.

494
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,230
That was the first time I helped you

495
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,640
and the last time.

496
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,480
I'm still trying to find a job.

497
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,210
I'll definitely pay you back the money from last time.

498
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,640
Can you...

499
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,070
No way.

500
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,290
Everything in the past

501
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,450
was all my fault.

502
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,970
Don't come to me again.

503
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,030
I hope

504
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,270
I had never met you.

505
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,020
[Fish Pot, Flower Field Kitchen]

506
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,920
It's not ready yet. It'll take a while.

507
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,690
It smells so good.

508
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,310
I'm drooling.

509
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,500
You must be a foodie cat.

510
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,310
Why do you only know how to sneak a bite?

511
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,750
I can grill too.

512
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,520
I dominated the barbecue industry back then.

513
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,590
Really?

514
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,720
I'll leave these skewers to you then. Show me your skills.

515
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,890
No problems.

516
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,340
It smells great.

517
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,580
Master Li,

518
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,390
don't you use oil for barbecue?

519
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,510
Right.

520
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,390
I know I should use the oil.

521
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,910
I have my own pace.

522
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,070
Don't make trouble.

523
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,600
How did it catch fire?

524
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,920
Too much oil.

525
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,390
It seems that you didn't rule the barbecue world

526
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,780
with your skills, but your appetite.

527
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,210
It was just a small mistake.

528
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,480
It seems like Master Li hasn't practiced for a long time.

529
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,030
When barbecuing,

530
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,800
remember to flip the food regularly

531
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,660
to ensure they're evenly cooked.

532
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,610
I can do it myself.

533
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,420
You're still being stubborn.

534
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,420
I'm not.

535
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,560
I won't talk back again.

536
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,540
What's that smell?

537
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,640
It's burnt.

538
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,860
It's delicious.

539
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,050
My cooking is really good.

540
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,800
Yes, you're right.

541
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,280
How do you know I like this flavor?

542
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,440
I know everything.

543
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,000
This feels so good.

544
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,000
We're having barbecue

545
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,900
and watching the stars together.

546
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,190
It feels like there are only two of us

547
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:52,680
under this sky.

548
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,230
We came here just for that.

549
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,140
Why did you want to come here suddenly?

550
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Well...

551
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,800
I had a flash of inspiration.

552
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,750
What's wrong?

553
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,560
Nothing.

554
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,100
I'm just surprised.

555
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
You don't seem like someone

556
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,310
who goes out without plans.

557
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,190
You're right. In fact, most of the time, I'm like that.

558
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,780
But today I wanted

559
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,300
a trip that belongs 100% to Li Xiaoxiao.

560
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,940
In Shanghai,

561
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,670
do you not belong 100% to me?

562
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,220
I just want the two of us

563
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:40,220
to be in a place where there are no outsiders.

564
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:43,870
Because with you,

565
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,470
I can forget many things.

566
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,960
I'm much happier.

567
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,420
It looks like today is a day

568
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,080
that you want to forget something.

569
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,380
No.

570
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,670
Today is a day that I want to see you.

571
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,960
Alright.

572
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,830
Let's go.

573
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,250
Where?

574
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,810
Back to Shanghai?

575
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,310
What are you thinking? It's cold outside.

576
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,460
Let's go inside.

577
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,080
I'm done.

578
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,560
Go ahead.

579
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,780
Why are you

580
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,440
suddenly so quiet?

581
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,780
It's not our first time staying in a hotel together.

582
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,910
I know the rules.

583
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,080
You sleep downstairs,

584
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,640
and I'll take the upstairs.

585
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,360
Well,

586
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,930
I'm going to wash up.

587
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,050
Okay.

588
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,140
Don't run off.

589
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,680
Did I wake you up?

590
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,240
I told you

591
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,740

592
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,210
It seems that

593
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,710

594
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,310

595

596
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,350
No.

597
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,480

598
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,560
It's written on your face.

599
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,560
Did something happen?

600
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,030
It's nothing important.

601
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,050
Don't worry.

602
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,550
Is it something

603
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,810

604
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,680
I don't want you to drink alone.

605
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,430
And I don't want you

606
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,270
to be sad secretly in a place I can't see.

607
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,090
I promise you.

608
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,040
Why do I feel like

609
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,080
you're leaving me?

610
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,350
You'll leave me, right?

611
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,070
It's not what you think.

612
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,720
Don't think too much.

613
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,030

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,900
And she's still so pretty.

631
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,719
Also,

632
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:18,030
Ye Han knows that Song Jinran is back.

633
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,590
You know that Ye Han met Song Jinran?

634
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,850
You all know they met?

635
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,620
Why didn't I know?

636
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,590
That man and I are together

637
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,110
for 12 hours every day.

638
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,280
Why didn't he tell me?

639
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,940
Does he even see me as a friend?

640
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,090
He hasn't seen you as his friend for many years.

641
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:39,920
Why did Song Jinran suddenly appear this time,

642
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,980
what does she want?

643
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,949
Didn't she know how much

644
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,030
she hurt Ye Han back in the day?

645
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,389
Obviously, she didn't.

646
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,370
She came back this time

647
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,730
because of work.

648
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,310
Besides,

649
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,469
she has a child.

650
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,110
A child?

651
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,500
A son.

652
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,690
But Ye Han doesn't seem to know about this.

653
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,210
Song Jinran is married?

654
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,250
Who's her husband?

655
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,310
She didn't tell me.

656
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,830
Bro, aren't you usually gossipy?

657
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,920
How old is the child?

658
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,120
Five or six years old.

659
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,000
Five or six?

660
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,280
I don't have kids, so I don't know.

661
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,860
Besides, don't the kids at his age

662
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,860
all look the same?

663
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,530
Bro, there's a big difference.

664
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,620
Five or six years old would mean a different father.

665
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,860
What do you mean?

666
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,050
Impossible.

667
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,840
He doesn't look like Ye Han.

668
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,640
But now that you mention it,

669
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,880
he kind of does.

670
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,380
Well, does he look like him or not?

671
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,730
I just saw him once.

672
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,450
I don't really remember.

674
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,530
has been gone for six years, right?

675
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,530
So should we tell Ye Han about this?

676
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,340
No.

677
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,230

678
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,660

There's no what if.

If this really happened,

682
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,520
it's not our place to tell Ye Han.

683
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,800
I'll go back first.

684
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,340
What's going on?

685
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,110
It's too hot.

759
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,330
I've always said I love you very much.

760
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,730
But I couldn't help but

761
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,610
suspect you

762
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,080
and stalk you.

763
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm tired.
