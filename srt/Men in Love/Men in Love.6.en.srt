I didn't want you to worry about me after seeing the news,

Why should I invite him?

My waist has almost recovered,

so I didn't ask him to send me.

261
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,930
I think he's much easier to get along with than before.

262
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,120
He was famous for being a weirdo.

263
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,710
The first time I met him is

264
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,340
because he wanted to interview me.

265
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,420
I prepared for it all night.

266
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,880
When I saw him,

267
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,380
he had draft papers,

268
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,070
a voice recorder, and a computer on his desk.

269
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,120
Even the handle of the mug was facing the same direction.

270
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,600
Back then, I thought,

271
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,950
he must be abnormal.

272
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,860
He's almost the same now.

273
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,260
He even saw the thinnest strand of hair

274
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,680
that fell on my shoulder.

275
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,730
So when we heard he was getting married,

276
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,550
we were all very curious.

277
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,110
We wondered which girl managed to change him.

When I first met her,

00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,080
would never consider marriage.

285

What kind of person is he?

286
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,110
He is

287
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,370
a little childish sometimes.

But sometimes,

00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,960
I think he has many secrets in his heart.

Other times,

291
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,240
he's good at taking care of others.

292
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,520
But most of the time,

293
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,030
he's a little selfish.

294
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,760
In short,

295
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,330
he is a man who yearns for

romance and freedom.

297
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,730
So, it must have been someone he really loved.

Otherwise,

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,760

Stop kidding. Are you drunk?

380
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,330
I'm not kidding.

381
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,870
Are we breaking up?

382
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,470
Why, Yiwen?

383
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,380
Because you're too dangerous.

384
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,240
You're like a flame.

385
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,340
But a flame can be immediately extinguished by cold water.

386
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,900
What makes you think it'll be extinguished?

387
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,640
In this world,

388
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,590
there's no love that's passionate forever.

389
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,990
How would you know if you don't try?

390
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,480
Why should I waste time on trying?

391
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,790
I might as well

392
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,610
live a happy day today

393
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,910
and end it here.

394
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,470
I never thought being with you

395
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,640
was a waste of time.

396
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,380
But you think

397
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,740
we're just wasting time being together?

398
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,700
That's not what I meant.

399
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,060
I've enjoyed our time together too.

400
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,410
Jiacheng,

401
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,930
Yiwen is drunk.

402
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,360
Don't take it seriously.

403
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,980
Stop drinking.

404
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,940
I understand.

405
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,920
It's not happy for me to be with someone

406
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,590
when we have no future together.

407
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,270
I'm leaving, Xiaoxiao.

408
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Jiacheng.

409
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,970
Jiacheng.

410
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,050
Are you crazy?

411
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,050
Do you know what you're doing?

412
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,760
You're just gonna let him go like that?

413
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,450
He's right.

414
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,450
How can you be happy when there isn't a future?

415
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,810
Sorry for letting you see this.

416
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
Jiacheng is serious about you.

417
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,440
Have you been toying with his feelings this entire time?

418
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,640
Who said I was toying with his feelings?

419
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,770
I pushed him away precisely because

420
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,210
I started to like him.

421
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,010
You like him but you pushed him away?

422
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:32,900
Yes.

423
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,520
Xiaoxiao,

424
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,210
love is too extravagant for me.

425
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,480
I cannot afford to disregard

426
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,090
the sacrifices and my future

427
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,130
just to love someone again.

428
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,400
Jiacheng is serious about you.

429
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,180
He is also a precious friend of mine.

430
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,850
You shouldn't have hurt him like that.

431
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,840
I'm sorry.

432
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,670
It must be him. I can't be wrong.

433
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,710
Xu Jiacheng is famous in the circle.

434
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,910
Do you mean... the magazine producer?

435
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,300
Yes, that's him.

436
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,340
I have a friend who dated him before.

437
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,320
But for some reason,

438
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,710
they broke up very soon.

439
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,760
What other reason could there be?

440
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,850
Your friend is over 30 years old, right?

441
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,090
She must have pushed him too hard for marriage

442
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,480
and scared him away.

443
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,310
Listen.

444
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,870
Men are different from women.

445
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,630
He's handsome and rich.

446
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,930
Of course he won't get married.

447
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,300
[Perfect]

448
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,730
I want whiskey. Bring me the whole bottle.

449
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,130
What's wrong?

450
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,500
[Perfect]

451
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,940
That's the look of a heartbroken man.

452
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,740
He got dumped.

453
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,550
Quit being the editor-in-chief.

454
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,750
You should be a fortune teller instead.

455
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,550
Who dumped you?

456
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,570
Where's the wine?

457
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,350
There's only coffee but no wine.

458
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,980
[Perfect]

459
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,520
Tong Yiwen.

460
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,320
And it was in front of Li Xiaoxiao.

461
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,350
Tong Yiwen.

462
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,570
This name sounds familiar.

463
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,210
Who is Li Xiaoxiao?

464
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,070
Why was Xiaoxiao there?

465
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,270
We had dinner near her house,

466
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,550
so I invited her, too.

467
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,470
Just because you had dinner near her house, you had to invite her?

468
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,750
Yes.

469
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,560
I really...

470
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,310
I haven't been this upset in a long time.

471
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,470
I'm leaving.

472
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,080
Are you not going to comfort me?

473
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,810
There's someone who needs comfort more than you.

474
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,980
Sir! Your sandwich!

475
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,560
Sir, that sandwich...

476
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,080
Let him have it.

477
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,500
Come back.

478
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,560
Put it in the fridge.

479
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,510
[Mr. Ye]

480
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,390
[Mr. Ye]

481
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,330
[Mr. Ye]

482
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,720
[Mr. Ye]

483
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,610
♫I'll be heartbroken no matter how careful I am♫

484
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,490

♫But how can I forget your tenderness?♫

502

♫I just found that you're irreplaceable♫

514
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,680
You're drunk again.

515
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,100
I've merged with the wine

516
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,310
and we become one.

517
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,520
Why are you here?

518
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,460
Actually, those answers...

519
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,170
I found…

520
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,710
were all found by me.

521
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,570
What did you find?

522
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,110
I had no doubt,

523
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,840
so I never asked.

524
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,560
I found you.

525
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,560
Didn't you say

526
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,350
not to see each other again?

527
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,660
I don't know why I came to you.

528
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,470
I've retrieved the magazine with the typo,

529
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,940
shot the photos for the poster,

530
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,300
and even signed the settlement agreement.

531
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,180
Do you know what that means?

532
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,370
You told me.

533
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,700
It means that we don't have to see each other again.

534
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,410
No.

535
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,820
It means I have exhausted all the excuses

536
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,020
I have made up to meet you.

537
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,950
There's only one reason left.

538
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,760
I miss you.

539
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,230
When the answer appears,

540
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,950
the question you forgot will also emerge.

541
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,400
But when you realize the question,

542
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,640
the answer will become more certain.

543
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,040
I never doubted it.

544
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,990
Not even once.

545
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,510
Then I'll let you take a good look at me.

546
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,490
Li Xiaoxiao.

547
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,260
Wait.

548
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,670
Where am I?

549
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,690
Why am I in a tent?

550
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,330
What is this?

551
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,790
Aloha.

552
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,130
What are you doing?

553
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,410
I'm sunbathing.

554
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,250
Where are you sunbathing?

555
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,630
In Hawaii.

556
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,360
What Hawaii is this?

557
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,510
You don't remember?

558
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,370
Where am I?

559
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,560
This is my home.

560
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,030
You're in my bed.

561
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,120
I'll go down in a minute.

562
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,240
You can sleep here.

563
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,390
No.

564
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,980
How can I sleep at a man's place?

565
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,930
I'm not that kind of person.

566
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:53,770
No.

567
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,280
Li Xiaoxiao, I'm tired.

568
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,700
Can you shut up

569
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,470
and go to bed?

570
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,270
No.

571
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,270
I can't sleep in a man's place.

572
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,910
No.

573
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,430
Never.

574
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,870
Let's go out and play then.

575
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,240
Let's go to Hawaii.

576
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,010
Let's go to Hawaii.

577
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,230
Aloha!

578
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,070
Aloha, aloha.

579
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,130
Hawaii. Hawaii.

580
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,010
The plane is a bit bumpy.

581
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,070
We'll be in Hawaii soon.

582
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,000
Seeing you again…

583
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,600
really made me happy.

584
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,580
I thought I'd never see you again.

585
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,120
It's not easy for me

586
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,130
to meet you.

587
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,110
Ye Han.

588
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:55,990
I...

589
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,730
I...

590
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,520
I want to vomit.

591
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,750
No!

592
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,770
Congratulations. You finally remember.

593
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,410
What have I done?

594
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,810
How embarrassing!

595
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,570
Why did you drink so much alone?

596
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,250
That was a farewell wine.

597
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,890
Forget it.

598
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,310
Since we're in Hawaii,

599
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,050
let me tell you about it.

600
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,320
At first,

601
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,710
I thought Yiwen didn't like Jiacheng.

602
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,570
That's why I pretended to meet Jiacheng by accident.

603
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,370
But today, I found out that

604
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,580
Yiwen really likes Jiacheng.

605
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,270
They like each other.

606
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,420
It's my fault.

607
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,210
No one is at fault here.

608
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,420
You are kind.

609
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,110
You're just a little dumb.

610
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,910
No.

611
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,500
That's not kindness.

612
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,990
I blame myself.

613
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,730
Yiwen is my best friend.

614
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,250
She told me everything,

615
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,440
but I kept things from her.

616
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,550
It's time

617
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,330
to end these painful

618
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,760
and complicated feelings.

619
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,160
When I'm sad,

620
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,130
I like to drink alone

621
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,620
to vent some frustration.

622
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,250
I guess I was trying to clear my mind with wine.

623
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,260
Be it a crush or a relationship,

624
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,750
this bit remains the same,

625
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,990
and only this bit is the same.

626
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,810
Why are you looking at me like that?

627
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,680
What's that look?

628
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,420
You're very cool right now.

629
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:23,990
Li Xiaoxiao.

630
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,790
What time is it now?

631
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,780
Three o'clock.

632
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,680
I thought you would sleep until dawn.

633
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,040
It's three o'clock?

634
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,210
I have to go.

635
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,040
Are you okay? Do you need a ride?

636
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,080
No.

637
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,150
I can go by myself.

638
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,520
I can go on my own.

639
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,500
I'm sober.

640
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,010
I'm very sober.

641
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,100
I saw the lights on.

642
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,730
I thought you were home.

643
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,889
You didn't go home

644
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,100
because you thought

645
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,989
I was at home?

646
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,800
Where have you been?

647
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,100
It's three o'clock.

648
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,920
Hawaii.

649
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,920
What?

650
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,889
Just kidding.

651
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,010
I want to apologize to you.

652
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,110
Thank you

653
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,110
for reminding me when I was willful.

654
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,199
Is this an apology?

655
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,440
Yes.

656
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,770
Without you,

657
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,030
I would never understand

658
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,730
what self-reflection means.

659
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,130
So don't leave me again.

660
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,460
Don't leave me.

661
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,200
Okay.

662
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,020
I won't leave you anymore.

663
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,240
But

664
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,620
I did something wrong too.

665
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,680
I'll apologize to you another day.

666
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,150
You didn't do anything wrong.

667
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,870
I was wrong today.

668
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,210
Don't you really like Jiacheng?

669
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,890
Then be with him.

670
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,950
If it were Tong Yiwen five years ago,

671
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,110
I would choose to be with him.

672
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,700
But now,

673
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,500
I won't choose that path anymore.

674
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,550
What path is that?

675
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,190
A bitter and sweet path.

676
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,580
At the age of 30,

677
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,870
I just want a stable relationship.

678
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,410
I just want to go to work with someone hand in hand.

679
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,870
We can go to the park together

680
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,080
and stand under the starry sky together.

681
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,620
That's all I want right now.

682
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,420
I don't want anything else.

683
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,990
I slept all night.

684
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,640
My head still hurts.

685
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,000
As the saying goes,

686
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,310
coffee is the best cure for hangover.

687
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:31,970
Thank you.

688
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,190
Again, as the saying goes,

689
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,810
a woman with a hangover

690
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,580
must have drunk wine with a man.

691
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,010
All these sayings must come from you.

692
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,940
If you didn't drink with a man,

693
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,990
who did you drink with?

694
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,780
As the saying goes,

695
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,390
it's easier to get drunk

696
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,860
when drinking alone.

697
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,070
What happened?

698
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,520
No, wait.

699
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,470
Hold it first. I'm going to class.

700
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,370
Talk later.

701
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,080
Sorry.

702
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,590
I accidentally smeared something on you.

703
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,750
In my opinion,

704
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,060
the one that best suits our style is...

705
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,510
the second one.

706
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,720
The third one.

707
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,040
We're done!

708
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,420
Thank you.

709
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,700
We're done.

710
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,880
While everyone is working hard,

711
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,840
I have good news

712
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,430
to share with you.

713
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,440
Our "Declaration" magazine

714
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,090
has been nominated for the

715
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,760
Best Writing Award

716
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,970
at the China Publishing Culture Award.

717
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,910
We all worked hard to get this honor.

718
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,070
Congratulations, Mr. Ye.

719
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,280
Congratulations, Mr. Ye.

720
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,620
Give us a raise!

721
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,850
There's a raise and a company trip!

722
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,890
Oh, right. We need to attend the award ceremony.

723
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,180
Are they giving us the award?

724
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,980
We won't know until we get there.

725
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:04,440
Is that ceremony held in Zhejiang every year?

726
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,810
If the time is near the time

727
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,410
of the basketball winter camp,

728
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,970
you can go for me.

729
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,670
I think they are about the same time.

730
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,700
But the editor-in-chief

731
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,580
should attend the award ceremony in person.

732
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,330
By the way,

733
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,090
"His Story" was nominated too.

734
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,960
Really.

735
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,110
How long haven't you seen Bai Sha?

736
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,590
You should go and say hi.

737
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,150
You think it's fun, right?

738
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,200
Yes.

739
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,140
I really like the way you compete

740
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,810
and look down on each other.

741
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,600
Stop.

742
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,630
The word "compete"

743
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,580
doesn't apply to the two of us.

744
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,750
Our capabilities have to be neck-to-neck

745
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,630
for you to call us competitors.

746
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,660
People like Lin Dan and Lee Chongwei are competitors.

747
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,230
You have a point.

748
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,460
"His Story" is the best in our field.

749
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,980
We are indeed no match for them.

750
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,940
You...

751
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:57,860
I see.

752
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,490
You keep attacking me

753
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,270
to relieve your pain

754
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,470
of being dumped, right?

755
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,440
You didn't have to bring that up.

756
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,130
You can attack me as much as you want.

757
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,700
But only for today.

758
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,000
Straighten your backs.

759
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,810
Go lower.

760
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,730
I think you have the team's fund card.

761
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,250
I can't leave today.

762
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,760
If you have the time,

763
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:38,060
please bring the card to my office.

764
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,570
Gosh.

765
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:42,000
Are you telling me to sneak into the enemy's camp?

766
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,960
[Mr. Ye]

767
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:47,840
[Mr. Ye]

768
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,560
What are you looking at?

769
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,750
Are you done with your 50 sets?

770
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,570
The national competition is about to begin.

771
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,130
Focus on your state!

772
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,680
You're so lazy.

773
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,850
Zhong Zixuan.

774
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,020
Squat lower.

775
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,000
Keep your back straight.

776
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,830
Hurry up. Faster!

777
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,950
[IN WORK]

778
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,730
[Chief Lawyer's Office]

779
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,470
Why are you dressed like this?

780
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,960
I heard

781
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,640
as long as a dog's mouth is warm,

782
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,670
its entire body will be warm as well.

783
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,490
I don't mean I'm a dog.

784
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,340
I've paid for

785
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,400
the uniform.

786
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,510
Thank you.

787
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,910
I've booked

788
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,940
the hotel

789
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,070
and the train tickets.

790
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,730
All that's left to do is leave.

791
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,050
Xu Yan.

792
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,880
Does the magazine office

793
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,990
end work on time?

794
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,560
Jiacheng should be off work by now.

795
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,770
Others

796
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,710
should be off work too, right?

797
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,900
Not necessarily.

798
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,840
It seems to be their deadline lately.

799
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,840
They'll probably work overtime.

800
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,160
Are you looking for someone?

801
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,000
No.

802
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,660
I was just asking.

803
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,130
You scared me.
