[Episode 10]

4
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,210
Why did you block me?

5
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,539
That means we shouldn't see each other again.

6
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,620
Do you know how worried I've been?

7
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,440
If you don't worry about me, that's the greatest help to me.

8
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,960
What do you mean?

9
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,020
I told your mother

10
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,980
I wouldn't disturb your life anymore.

11
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,230
So you and your mother,

12
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,260
please stop disturbing my life too.

13
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,750
What happened?

14
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,460
Can you make it clear?

15
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,270
The variety show I was going to

16
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,000
got me replaced all of a sudden.

17
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,820
Do you think my mom is involved in this?

18
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,329
What else can it be?

19
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,110
Okay.

20
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,570
I'll confirm it for you.

21
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,690
Hello.

22
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,400
Do you know about Yiwen being replaced in the variety show?

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,970
What variety show?

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,750
Didn't she dump you?

25
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,840
What's wrong?

26
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,240
Did she ask for your help?

27
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,120
No.

28
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,260
I'll call you later, Mom. Bye.

29
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,570
Has your misunderstanding gone?

30
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,900
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
Let go of me.

32
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,820
Why am I so embarrassed every time I see you?

33
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,680
I don't think it's embarrassing.

34
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,930
It's my fault

35
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,470
that the misunderstandings happened.

36
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,280
So let's not see each other again.

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,740
There won't be any more misunderstandings.

38
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,220
I'm back.

39
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,270
Mom.

40
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,940
I'm back.

41
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,640
Mom.

42
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,730
You're back.

43
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,970
What are you doing here?

44
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm packing Jie's stuff.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,920
Why are you doing it so suddenly?

46
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,710
It's time.

47
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,900
We can't leave it here forever.

48
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,670
If Jie knew it,

49
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,730
she wouldn't like to see this.

50
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,329
Stop packing.

51
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,420
Why do you have to do this?

52
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,850
No one is staying here.

53
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,890
She has been gone

54
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,320
for over four years.

55
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,600
You've been living with me.

56
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,500
Do you think Jie would like to see this

57
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,870
if she knew?

58
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,230
She'd say,

59
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,430
“Mom,

60
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,870
Even so,

61
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,880
do you think it'll work?

62
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,600
Can I be brought back to life?”

63
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,910
Although

64
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,380
she always spoke the truth,

65
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,590
it still

66
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,320
made people feel uncomfortable.

67
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,150
She

68
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,890
spoke

69
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,350
harshly.

70
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,800
Yeah.

71
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,120
After she was finished,

72
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,610
she had to add

73
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,420
“You need to…”

74
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,510
“Analyze the problem rationally.”

75
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,670
My daughter was so beautiful.

76
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,300
She had all her parents' strengths.

77
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,530
Mom,

78
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,690
I'm not bad, either.

79
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,130
Of course.

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,200
That's why I agreed to your marriage.

81
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,560
When two people get married and form a family,

82
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,680
it's inevitable to quarrel.

83
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,670
But if the other half is nice,

84
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,720
you won't be so angry.

85
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,220
So

86
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,930
it's because of this.

87
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,250
You are good.

88
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,950
But

89
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,850
if you keep getting old,

90
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,850
no one will marry you.

91
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,430
Mom, what are you talking about?

92
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,790
By the way,

93
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,930
I plan to sell this apartment

94
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,150
and live with Mr. Hu.

95
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,550
Why do you suddenly want to sell the apartment?

96
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,820
Actually,

97
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,670
it's not that sudden.

98
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,130
I've been with Mr. Hu for many years.

99
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,990
We've discussed this for a long time.

100
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,180
We are planning to get married

101
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,250
so that you don't have to worry about me.

102
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,440
Besides,

103
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,470
I'm afraid

104
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,980
I'll never be brave enough

105
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,160
to make the decision

106
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,810
if I don't do it now.

107
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,070
I hope

108
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,140
you can look forward

109
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,650
and have a new life.

110
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,590
You need to

111
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,590
analyze everything rationally.

112
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,090
I'm going to cook.

113
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,760
Why are you here?

114
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,480
Are you bored?

115
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,790
Yes.

116
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,730
Very bored.

117
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,640
It's good to move out.

118
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,410
Your mother-in-law is right.

119
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,480
You have to move on.

120
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,850
You can't make up your mind.

121
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,650
she did it for you.

122
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,480
I understand.

123
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,350
But it's just

124
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,420
so sudden.

125
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,370
You still can't get used to parting.

126
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,870
How can I get used to it?

127
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,720
Can you?

128
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,409
No.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,020
Maybe none of us

130
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,720
has experienced a real parting.

131
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,600
What is a real parting?

132
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,170
It's like riding a car.

133
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,420
You know where the destination is.

134
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,180
So you prepare a lot of words along the way.

135
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,660
You may persuade someone to stay.

136
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,030
But in the end,

137
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,350
you can look into the person's eyes

138
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,570
and say goodbye decently.

139
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,620
We had no chance to say goodbye.

140
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,010
So we were left in the car.

141
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,409
You still can't let it go.

142
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,320
I did let it go.

143
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,030
I'm just a little upset.

144
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,549
So every time I want to start again,

145
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,170
I always think of a question.

146
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,850
What is it?

147
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,890
If this person also leaves you,

148
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,430
will you still want to be with her?

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,660
Even if you know the answer,

150
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,190
I think you'll still do the same thing.

151
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,300
But Xu Yan,

152
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,240
why do I still want to approach her

153
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,730
even if I know the result may remain the same?

154
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,380
Ask yourself.

155
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,030
Even if the result is the same,

156
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,730
I still want to take this path.

157
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,360
Because

158
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,480
we have hope.

[Zeus Hotel]

160
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,250
Alcohol can't solve any problem.

161
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,250
But at least I can forget my worries.

162
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,590
What you're worried about now

163
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,600
will become insignificant

164
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,430
after five or ten years.

165
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,730
No.

166
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,170
It's unforgettable.

167
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,620
You're coming.

168
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,320
You didn't ask me here

169
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,090
just for a drink, did you?

170
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,870
Save it.

171
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,240
Let's drink.

172
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,490
Is Tong Yiwen okay?

173
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,560
What's wrong with you two?

174
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,480
I don't know.

175
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,920
I always make things awkward.

176
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,050
You think too much.

177
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,530
I know her personality.

178
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,670
Sometimes,

179
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,870
many things are out of my control.

180
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,400
I want to make up for it.

181
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,640
But it's hard.

182
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,040
Anyway, it's all my fault.

183
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,380
Alright, don't drink that much.

184
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,380

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,010

00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,050
She's such a good girl.

383
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,250
Why don't you seize the chance?

384
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,350
Xiaoxiao is my sister.

385
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,260
And we're close.

386
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,710
Closer than you.

387
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,670
All right.

388
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,340
Men are so confident.

389
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:33,790
What?

390
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,390
I'm going.

391
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,210
Xu Jialin.

392
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,000
Hello, Auntie.

393
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,310
Hello.

394
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:49,900
Mom.

395
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,330
Why are you here?

396
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,020
Have a seat.

397
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,860
No.

398
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,510
I didn't see you these days,

399
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,950
so I came to you.

400
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,270
This is

401
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,690
the contract of selling the house.

402
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,080
I think I should let you read it.

403
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,750
This...

404
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,350
What's the rush?

405
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,300
Of course, I need to prepare the contract.

406
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,740
We can sign the contract

407
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,370
if someone likes the house.

408
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,600
Okay.

409
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,620
All right, I'm going to buy groceries.

410
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,800
Let me know when you're done.

411
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,190
Okay.

412
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,870
I'll go back early tonight.

413
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,870

414
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,810

415
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:30,230

416
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,310

417
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,380
I'm relieved.

418
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,530
Here's the water fountain.

419
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,800
A water fountain?

420
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,610
I didn't order a water fountain.

421
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,800

422

Your name is on the delivery order.

425
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,690
Why did you give me a water fountain?

426
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,600
You got it?

427
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,490
Just take it and don't ask too much.

428
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,460
Lu Zheng.

429
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,500
What's wrong with the water fountain?

430
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,960
He also bought one for you?

431
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,750
Did you do something bad again?

432
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,660
Let's take a selfie.

433
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,900

434
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,470
Delete it.

435
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,200
This is not the time to study selfies.

437
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,190
It's just a gift.

438

Why are you overreacting like that?

439
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,870
Is it because no one sends you gifts?

440
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,740
By the way,

441
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,810
where is Ye Han?

442
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,150
Shouldn't he come to thank me now?

443
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,310
Do you think we're here to thank you?

444
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,820
You're not?

445
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,410
He bought 20 water fountains from that person?

446
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,460
I didn't know.

447
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,280
I heard it from the delivery man.

448
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,500
Do you think

449
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,430
he's involved in a pyramid scheme?

450
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,390
No way.

451
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,960
Lu Zheng can't be that stupid.

452
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,610
I think

453
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,600
he bought it from a woman,

454
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,140
because it's impossible for him to spend money on men.

455
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,870
Yeah.

456
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,500
He never spends money on me.

457
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,590
This woman

458
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,740
should

459
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,690
have a bad sales performance this month

460
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,010
or she's a newbie in the industry.

461
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,110
Do you think it's possible

462
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,810
she's a college friend or a friend of his?

463
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,710
Probably.

464
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,220
I'm not mistaken, am I?

465
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,710
Yes.

466
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,090
And I'm glad I'm on your side.

467
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,670
Are you sure you're on my side?

468
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,750
Yes.

469
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,610
And I hope I can use my honesty

470
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,480
to exchange for your trust.

482
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,840
I was just passing by, so I brought them to you.

483
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,080
Thank you.

484

Where is she now?

498
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,020
If you want to see her,

499
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,560
you need to plan for it.

500
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,530
I did plan,

501
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,010
but I always failed.

502
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,010
That's because your plan was wrong.

503
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,960
You'll most probably fail

504
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,670
if you come unprepared.

505
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,090
What should I do then?

506
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,010
How should I put it?

507
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,170
Do you have time?

508
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,850
I'd like to treat you to a meal.

509
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,230
You didn't tell me

510
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,150
he'd be here for dinner, too.

511
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,230
Yeah.

512
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,350
Originally, I planned to

513
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,230
have dinner with him.

514
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,440
I told you

515
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,930
someone would have dinner with me.

516
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,330
That person is Xiaoxiao.

517
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,450
Anyway, you know about me and Yiwen.

518
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,470
If you don't like Ye Han,

519
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,710
I'll let him go.

520
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,800
I'm still here.

521
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,880
Maybe I don't like her.

522
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,990
So,

523
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,220
if you don't like her, just leave.

524
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,670
It's okay.

525
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,260

your plan

534
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,480
was unclear.

535
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,350
You didn't know

536
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,570
when and where

537
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,800
to meet her.

538
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,710
But I don't know

539
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,330
where she is.

540
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,790
How come?

541
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,390
Take today as an example.

542
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,320
You came to me

543
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,340
without asking me if Yiwen was home.

544
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,510
You're right.

545
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,160
That makes sense.

546
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,120
And then?

547
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,460
You need to spend time

548
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,700
and make plans

549
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,240
in a relationship, right?

550
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,290
Then, you have to work hard.

551
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,490
For example,

552
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,560
from now on,

553
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,390
you have to pay attention to Yiwen's Weibo.

554
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,490
Read her posts once every hour.

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,120

A chance encounter

557
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,320
is not really by chance.

00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,360
she doesn't update her Weibo,

574
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,240
what does it mean?

575
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,150
It means

576
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,330
she's been in a boring place all day long.

577
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,010
I see.

578
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,030
Looks like

579
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,850
I have to work hard.

580
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,290
It's hard

581
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,880
to love someone.

582
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,440
Sometimes you'll be missed,

583
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,680
and sometimes

584
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,140
you'll be ignored.

[Art is life, IN WORK]

586
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,310
Sometimes,

587
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,370
you'll never get the answer you want.

588
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,080
But even if it's so hard,

589
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,310
you still like her

590
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,930
and you still want to see her.

591
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,840
That is love.

592
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,280
So,

593
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,240
you must stick to it.

594
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,610
Why are you so quiet?

595
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,800
Usually at this time,

596
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,430
you'd call me stupid,

597
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,820
hypocritical,

598
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,880
and too kind.

599
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,580
Actually, I'm not angry at all.

600
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,220
Really?

601
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,340
Do you mean it?

602
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,900
Yes.

603
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,180
Then why do you look like that?

604
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,400
I just feel a little sad.

608
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,100
Aren't you going back?

609
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,300
I'm leaving.

I'm afraid you'll reject me again.

616

I'd better go back first.

You bought a lot of water fountains.

683
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,389
Yes, I did.

684
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,070
Where did you buy them?

685
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,070
From Zhou Yi, my college classmate.

00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,929
Why did you buy so many?

00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,989
My college classmate Zhou Yi

688
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,219
just divorced and took care of her child by herself.

689
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,770
Her family was poor.

690
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,949
So I wanted to help her.

691
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,949
There was no way

692
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,800
she'd accept my money.

693
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,520
So I bought

694
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,280

You can't violate the principle.

hang in there.

00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,550
Although my brother is not so good,

765
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,110
I'd like you

766
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,700
to be my sister-in-law.

767

I don't want it. Take it back.

770
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,300
Keep it.

771
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,540
It's good to ward off evil spirits.

772
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,320
I need to use the bathroom.

00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,560
I have to be

Tomorrow is the New Year.

Where are you having fun

780
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,550
tonight?

781
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,970
I'm not going anywhere.

782
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,700
-I'll be training.
-No, no, no.

783
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,430
Actually today

784
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,810
is the same as usual.

785
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,460
But people love

786
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,220
to give it a special definition

787
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,710
and to create a ritual

788
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,200
on this day.

789
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,400
Why?

790
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,380
It's a festival.

791
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,290
It's an excuse for us to have fun.

792
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,560
It's for commemorating the passing of time.

793
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,510
Yeah.

794
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,650
Because

795
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,430
we only have one life.

796
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,660
Every day is unique.

Every day

798
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,470
is an important node
