So we were born in different times.

20
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,760
No wonder you are still reading such an old novel.

21
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,460
I like this book

22
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,270
because I'm a cultured man.

23
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,820
So you're old and cultured.

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,640
He's a little different

49
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,360
from the heroes in other books.

50
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,760
He's quite unfortunate.

But I lost to the opponent I hate the most.

it's better that your magazine is not the winner.

92
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,230
Have you ever heard people say

93
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,600
if a person has watched the sky,

94
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,760
falling leaves,

95
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,960
flowing water and fireworks

96
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,990
and can feel romance

97
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,340
in these little things,

98
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,890
then nothing in the person's life can hurt him or her?

99
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,650
We've watched

100
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,270

Nothing in our life can hurt us.

102
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,790
You are too strong

103

to get hurt by anything in your life.

104
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,570
You're so mean.

105
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,990
I'm serious.

106
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,390
I hope nothing in your life can ever hurt you.

107
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,000
Even when you're in your seventies or eighties,

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,010
you'll still be a strong old woman.

109

When I'm old,

110
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,690
I'll go back to my hometown

111

where I'll pick tea-leaves, sunbathe,

112
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,040
and sit with my husband at the door of my house,

113
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,800

114
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,350

116
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,990

117
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,900
It has nothing to do with you.

118
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,200

120
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,770

Look, fireworks.

122
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,990
Now we've watched the fireworks.

Can you write?

130
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,909
No one understands sign language at the reception?

131
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:44,430
Oh, you can speak.

132
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,010

-Okay.
-Why?

148
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,760
I booked a double bed room.

149
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,720
You are the daughter of our president.

So,

152
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,250
if any of my relatives comes here,

153
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,430
you will upgrade the rooms for them?

154
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,310
Of course.

155
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,880
It shouldn't happen next time.

156
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,630
Please tell

157
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,470
other managers,

158
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,590
do not offer free upgrade to my relatives

159
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,830
ever again.

160
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,090
Still double bed room, thanks.

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,430

Yiwen.

164
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,590
Bei, you can talk to me on the phone.

165
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,160
Why do we have to meet at the company?

166
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,630
I have good news for you.

167
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,150
I must tell you in person.

168
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,300
Please, have a seat.

169
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,410
The crew of the show, I'm a Supermodel,

170
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,120
has sent me the contract.

171
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,460
Great.

172
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,260
Did they say when they would begin filming?

173
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,790
On the 5th of the next month.

174
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,700
This is a good opportunity.

175
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,280
You may not be the last winner,

176
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,970
but the show can get more people to know you.

177
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,390
I've decided to join the show.

178
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,250
I'll give my best to be the winner.

179
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,180
In the TV shows nowadays,

180
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,280
the most popular are not necessarily the most capable.

181
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,870
Remember to behave yourself in the show.

182
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,220
Don't be too frank

183
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,650
and don't be too unique.

184
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,970
The most important thing is to get the audience to like you.

185
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,810
Understand?

186
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,390
Yes.

187
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,660
Show me the contract.

188
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,930
I'll get it for you.

189
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,100
By the way, Bei,

190
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,650
will anyone else at our company join the show?

191
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,190
No, only you.

192
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,510
It's such a good opportunity.

193
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,860
I only want you to have it.

194
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,730
Thank you, Bei.

195
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,800
You're the best.

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,250
Jialin is back?

197
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,830
No, she didn't tell me.

198
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,650
She might just stay for a few days.

199
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,330
Don't tell my parents.

200
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,270
Okay, I got it.

201
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,930
Jialin is back?

202
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,360
The hotel manager said she was checking in.

203
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,770
She should be studying for a PhD abroad.

204
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,500
Why did she suddenly come back?

205
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,100
I guess she was homesick.

206
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,250
She missed you.

207
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,950
If she missed her family,

208
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,150
why didn't she tell me that she was back?

209
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,110
I guess

210
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,070
she has a boyfriend in China.

211
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,310
Wasn't she studying abroad?

212
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,130
How come she has a boyfriend in China?

213
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,390
Although she was studying abroad,

214
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,720
she could have a Chinese boyfriend there.

215
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,360
I guess

216
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,190
his boyfriend

217
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,940
graduated first.

218
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,670
So he came back before she did.

219
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,620
They're in a long-distance relationship.

220
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,300
Xu Jialin was feeling insecure.

221
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,750
I know it.

222
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,510
She came back this time

223
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,370
to give her boyfriend a surprise.

224
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,310
You're such a good brother.

225
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,760
Hollywood directors are not as imaginative as you.

226
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,450
She's not your sister. You know nothing about her.

227
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,290
Xu Yan.

228
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,690
Do you know what I am thinking?

229
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,940
I think the family

230
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,080
of his boyfriend

231
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,520
is not as rich as mine.

232
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,600
But he should be good-looking.

233
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,240
I guess he's not very tall.

234
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,470
He

235
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,570
seduced Xu Jialin

236
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:51,700
and made her obsessed with him.

237
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,020
They will come to my family and beg us.

238
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,400
Just wait and see.

239
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,290
In the end, I'll have to handle it.

240
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,160
Jialin is so unlucky to have you as her brother.

241
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,940
I think

242
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,730
Jialin won't fall in love with bad boys easily.

243
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,730
Don't worry.

244
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,170
Why do you think so?

245
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,110
When Jialin was younger,

246
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,730
she used to have a crush on me.

247
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,030
Can you be more persuasive?

248
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,530
Think about it.

249
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,860
Of the three friends of yours,

250
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,040
Ye Han and Lu Zheng didn't attract her.

251
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,250
Now you believe me?

252
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,430
Ye Han.

253
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,260
Lu Zheng.

254
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,510
You have a point.

255
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,110
Hello.

256
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,690
Tong Yiwen.

257
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,430
I'm Jiacheng's mother.

258
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,710
Please cut to the chase.

259
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,230
Tong Yiwen.

260
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,050
What do your parents do?

261
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,870
Your father is Tong Guoqiang.

262
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,470
He's a sailor.

263
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,840
Your mother was Li Shufen.

264
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,350
She worked part-time

265
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,080
and wasn't in good health.

266
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,620
She died from illness

267
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,610
a few years ago,

268
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,080
right?

269
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,610
My parents

270
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,910
used to work in the factory.

271
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,640
They didn't know any big names or rich people.

272
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,070
After I married Jiacheng's father,

273
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,770
we started from scratch.

274
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,750
We achieved success step by step.

275
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,900
We've earned every penny of ours

276
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,390
through hard work.

277
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,110
Why are you telling me this?

278
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,020
I don't want you to be interested in my son.

279
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,560
I heard

280
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,980
you

281
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,370
are unemployed now.

282
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,250
Of course.

283
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,690
It's difficult

284
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,860
to work in your industry.

285
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,330
Auntie,

286
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,630
it seems

287
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,280
you spent a lot of time finding information about me.

288
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,610
But you misunderstood.

289
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,880
Xu Jiacheng and I are just friends.

290
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,030
Friends?

291
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,250
Weren't you seeing each other?

292
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,770
But now we broke up.

293
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,290
I dumped him.

294
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,600
You dumped him?

295
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,020
Why?

296
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,420
Because your son is not charming at all.

297
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,090
He is also immature.

298
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,930
Auntie,

299
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,430
I don't know

300
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,490
how you've found the information about me.

301
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,350
But today,

302
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,470
let me introduce myself.

303
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,060
My name is Tong Yiwen.

304
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,190
I participated in Fashion Week when I was 20.

305
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,980
All brands you wear

306
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,870
hired to me to show their outfits.

307
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,450
What are you trying to say?

308
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,520
I want to say

309
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,500
I'm better than you think.

310
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,060
I wasn't born into a rich family

311
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,870
but I'm still doing well.

312
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,030
I don't need help from Xu Jiacheng.

313
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,190
Just like you,

314
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,990
I have earned every penny

315
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,340
through hard work.

316
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,570
Well said.

317
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,290
I hope

318
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,110
you can remember every word you said today.

319
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,180
Hello, Mom.

320
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,870
What's up?

321
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,310
I want to tell you

322
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,610
I saw her.

323
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,590
She was being arrogant.

324
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,520
Who?

325
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,030
Who else could it be?

326
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,650
Yiwen?

327
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,710
Interesting.

328
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,190
Don't be angry.

329
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,580
Hello, Yiwen.

330
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,030
I...

331
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,750
I heard it from my mom.

332
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,900
I want to apologize to you on her behalf.

333
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,410
I should thank you

334
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,670
for letting me know

335
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,520
what would happen if I were to marry a rich man.

336
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,310
It's even more dramatic than a TV show.

337
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,470
I'm really sorry.

338
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,870
I promise

339
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,170
it won't happen again.

340
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,960
Of course it won't.

341
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,680
I told your mom

342
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,290
that I had dumped you

343
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
because you're not charming at all.

344
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,550
Bye.

345
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,140
Have fun.

346
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,090
Okay, I see.

347
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,900
Keep in touch.

348
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,930
Thank you.

349
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,020
Bye.

350
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,590
What's the message from the high-speed rail station?

351
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,870
Should we go there now?

352
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,120
No one has contacted them yet.

353
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,800
We have to wait some more time.

354
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,130
What are you looking for?

355
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,570
I want

356
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,320
to see if there are any clues.

357
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,400
Are there any?

358
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,090
Yes.

359
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,280
He's here to attend a wedding.

360
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,750
The wedding starts in an hour.

361
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,120
We should go now.

362
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,730
It's a wedding in medieval style.

363
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,670
It feels like we were in the Middle Ages.

364
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,490
There are so many people.

365
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,090
Which one is our knight?

366
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,750
Look.

367
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,420
Could it be him?

368
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,130
I think he is different

369
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,040
from others.

370
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,550
That headband is mine! It has a sheep pattern on it.

371
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,560
It's him.

372
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,830
You used the same suitcase as his.

373
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:00,910
You two

374
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,100
have a bad taste.

375
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,140
You're so mean.

376
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,310
He's coming to us.

377
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,380
He looks frightening.

378
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,050
Go forward.

379
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,120
It's time for you to shine.

380
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,850
Use your strong muscles to protect us.

381
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,420
Go!

382
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,490
You are thinking too much.

383
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,040
Hello.

384
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,490
I broke my phone when I got off.

385
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,180
I didn't get a chance to fix it.

386
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
I was thinking

387
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,700
after the wedding,

388
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,390
I would try to find my luggage.

389
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,080
I didn't expect you to come here first.

390
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,130
Thank you so much.

391
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,290
Thank you.

392
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,460
It's okay.

393
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,340
Thank God we got our luggage back.

394
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,750
Your headband...

395
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,190
Oh, this is my friend's wedding.

396
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,450
I have little hair and had no wig.

397
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,630
That's why

398
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,230
I'm wearing this headband.

399
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,150
I'll give it back to you now.

400
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,230
That's okay.

401
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,170
Keep it.

402
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,790
The sheep pattern suits you well.

403
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,910
Really?

404
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,850
The wedding is going to begin.

405
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,530
If you're free,

406
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,680
you can join us.

407
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,700
In our childhood, we all read fairy tales

408
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,990
about the love stories

409
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,030
between a prince and a princess.

410
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,010
Today's wedding

411
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,880
is lovely and touching.

412
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,380
It makes us believe that true love will last forever.

413
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,630
From now on...

414
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,830
It's really special.

415
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,540
I've never been to a wedding like this before.

416
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,300
It's cool not to care about

417
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,740
what others think

418
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,520
but just to be yourself.

419
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,510
I promise you

420
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,290
whatever happens,

421
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,320
I will

422
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,990
always stand by your side.

423
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,550
All of us

424
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,310
are witnesses of their love.

425
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,630
We also believe

426
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,860
fairy tales can happen in real life.

427
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,610
Next,

428
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
please exchange rings.

429
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,790
Are you going to cry

430
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,960
at the wedding?

431
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,100
I don't know why

432
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,920
I get so emotional

433
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,860
at every wedding.

434
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,060
At this moment,

435
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,730
I feel love is so beautiful.

436
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,030
Yes.

437
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,180
It's so beautiful.

438
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,470
They will be a happy couple.

439
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,680
They're soulmates with each other.

440
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,660
Do you know what flowers you are holding?

441
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,810
No.

442
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,480
They are lisianthus.

443
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,070
The flower symbolizes

444
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,680
eternal love that never changes.

445
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,140
They're usually used to decorate weddings.

446
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,230
I once gave the flowers to someone.

447
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,670
Do you want to tell me

448
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,520
why you broke up?

449
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,480
We didn't break up.

450
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,640
She dumped me.

451
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,880
Don't pity me.

452
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,090
I don't like being pitied.

453
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,070
How time flies!

454
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,070
A year has gone by.

455
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:48,670
What's your plan for New Year's Eve?

456
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,270
On December 31st every year,

457
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,560
I will go to the Bund of Shanghai to watch the New Year countdown.

458
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,070
That's so boring. I always want to know

459
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,630
what kind of people will

460
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,060
go to such a noisy place on New Year's Eve.

461
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,820
So you are one of them.

462
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,220
It's not boring at all.

463
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,520
For me,

464
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,040
it's very romantic

465
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,350
to welcome a new year

466
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,290
with a group of people.

467
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,340
We share happiness together

468
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,730
and we become happier.

469
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,790
Really?

470
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,750
Yes.

471
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,950
Look.

472
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,590
Wish notes.

473
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,430
You're not a child anymore.

474
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,460
You still believe the note can make your dream come true?

475
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,820
Are you kidding me?

476
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,550
Of course I do.

477
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,060
I firmly believe it.

478
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,930
I'll write two notes.

479
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,300
You can write the note against my body.

480
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,570
Fine.

481
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,990
Turn around.

482
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,900
My back is very muscled.

483
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,090
So many muscles.

484
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,240
Is it convenient for you to write the note?

485
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,400
Be quiet.

486
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,980
Your turn.

487
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,770
Why aren't you writing?

488
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,580
Well,

489
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,200
I need to write the note against your shoulder.

490
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,710
Go ahead.

491
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,600
What are you waiting for? Just write.

492
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,240
♫The footsteps follow the second hand♫

493
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,150
It's getting late. Let's go.

494
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,620
♫I'm willing to be in your story♫

495
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,260
♫No matter how long♫

496
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,960
♫No matter how far♫

497
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:00,740
♫No matter how faraway the place is, I'll go and find you there♫

498
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,670
I know what I want now.

499
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,560
♫I've met countless people♫

500
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,120
♫You're still♫

501
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,690
♫The only answer♫

502
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,800
It happened so suddenly.

503
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,790
He just kissed me.

504
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,050
Mind your feet.

505
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,510
You look weird.

506
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,730
What? No.

507
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,650
What are you talking about?

508
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,120
Why are you holding a pillow? What are you thinking?

509
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,980
You almost buried your face in it.

510
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,970
Are you in love?

511
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,820
Nonsense.

512
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,750
Why do we have to

513
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,190
sleep in the same room?

514
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,930
There's no privacy at all.

515
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,880
You're a freeloader. Don't complain.

516
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,980
The basketball team has a limited budget.

517
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,980
You are lucky to share a room with me.

518
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,650
But this hotel belongs to your family.

519
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,670
Do you know

520
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,390
in the peak season,

521
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,390
how much it costs to book a room here?

522
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,680
The richer you are, the more stingy you are.

523
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,010
I shouldn't have told others you are rich.

524
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,960
So, Mr. Ye, we need to

525
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,950
make our magazine the No.1 in terms of sales.

526
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,290
Then we can have one room each.

527
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,780
You can even have a presidential suite.

528
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,020
Sounds great, right?

529
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:03,240
Work harder. I'm going to bed.

530
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,420
By the way, the basketball team

531
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,350
will have a group activity tomorrow. Are you coming?

532
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,100
Group activity?

533
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,740
I'll come.

534
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,330
I was just being nice.

535
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,580
You really want to come?

536
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,900
Yes.

537
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,310
Go to bed early.

538
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,150
Let's go.

539
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,530
Let's go over there.

540
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:42,950
Let's go and eat.

541
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,890
Ye Han.

542
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,880
You are almost 34.

543
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,370
Don't act like a teenager who wants to look cool.

544
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,630
You didn't bring one with scissor doors.

545
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,030
You've grown up.

546
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,630
You know that'll be too much.

547
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,570
I wanted to rent one with scissors doors,

548
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,770
but they were all rented by others.

549
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,170
This is the only one left.

550
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,150
Xiaoxiao.

551
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,710
I'll take that car.

552
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,070
Coach, here.

553
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,150
Wait.

554
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,270
Come on.

555
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,040
Don't take that car.

556
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,920
Get in our car.

557
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,720
There is still a seat not taken in that car.

558
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,650
Why don't you want to get in our car?

559
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,290
Get in.

560
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,170
Let's go.

561
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,840
Let's go.

562
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,740
Please, take the passenger seat.

563
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,500
I can sit in the backseat.

564
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,460
It's a convertible.

565
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,020
It's dangerous to sit in the passenger seat.

566
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,830
Dangerous?

567
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:44,920
How about I sit there?

568
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,210
Yes, you two are tall.

569
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,230

00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,380
Just now, that was an accident.

758
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,340
If the person who got hurt were you, Xu Yan,

759
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,670
or anyone else, I would have done the same.

760
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,880
Do you feel

761
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,220
I'm being annoying?

762
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,600
Yes.

763
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,040
I'm doing this on purpose.

764
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,430
I'm feeling mad.

765
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,790
I'm feeling upset.

766
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,090
You know why I didn't dare to look at you.

767
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,560
Why are you questioning me?

768
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,880
Do you think

769
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,990
you can say these things to me

770
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,290
after what happened last night?

771
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,250
Last night, I...

772
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,060
It was just an accident last night.

773
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:07,320
It was because of the atmosphere. We were being impulsive.

774
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,100
Impulsive?

775
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,030
♫Even the air is silent♫

776
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:17,210
♫There's no place for my heart to hide♫

777
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,860
You think

778
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,990
♫The world stops, like an illusion♫

779
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,820
it was because of the atmosphere?

780
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,760
You think we were being impulsive?

781
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:23,670
Yes.

782
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,110
Of course not.

783
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,780
♫I thought you were calling me♫

784
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,840
Let me tell you,

785
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,470
it's not because of the atmosphere.

786
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:35,130
♫The hand I reached out touches nothing again♫

787
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,110
I wasn't being impulsive.

788
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,700
It's because of you.

789
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,670
♫I want to say something♫

790
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,470
♫But I just stand there and stare for a long time♫

791
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,090
I was being brave because of you.

792
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,470
♫Maybe I don't want to leave♫

793
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,370
♫It still hurts♫

794
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,400
♫Looking back♫

795
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:03,350
♫I feel so much warmth again♫

796
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,880
♫I'll be with you♫

797
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:10,280
♫You know it's true♫

798
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:15,460
♫Memories are endless♫

799
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,070
♫But why♫

800
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,490
♫We've been with each other♫

801
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:29,120
♫But why we can't have each other♫

802
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,190
♫I'll be with you♫

803
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,650
♫I'll see this through♫

804
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,000
♫If we can notice all the considerations♫

805
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,640
♫At the intersection of time♫

806
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:53,370
♫Let's not lose each other again♫

807
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,210
Let me tell you,

808
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,820
it's not because of the atmosphere.

809
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:57,200
I wasn't being impulsive.

810
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,030
It's because of you.

811
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,890
I was being brave because of you.

812
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,990
♫On the snowy streets♫

813
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,660
♫I'm wandering alone again♫

814
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:10,070
♫If we can meet♫

815
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:13,740
♫And change our destiny♫

816
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,880
♫I'll go far away with you♫

817
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:24,990
♫In the future I've been dreaming of♫

818
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,450
♫Love is like a lost ark♫

819
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,790
♫Where can I go into the dream?♫

820
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:42,120
♫I don't know what to do♫

821
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,120
♫I'll be with you♫

822
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,920
♫I'll see this through♫

823
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:56,530
♫Let's greet with a smile♫

824
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,190
♫At every intersection♫

825
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:04,980
♫I'll be with you♫
