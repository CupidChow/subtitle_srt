00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,450
I believe you trust me.

196
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,600
Don't let me down.

197
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,780
I'm leaving.

198
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,530
I have a class tomorrow.

199
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,960
By the way,

200
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,780
sign the settlement agreement,

201
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,140
and I'll trust you more.

202
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,090
Did she agree to give me her number?

203
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,000
Why are you here?

204
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,340
Didn't I tell you I'd come to your place?

205
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,430
Why didn't you change your shoes again?

206
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,290
Where were you at this hour?

207
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,690
I thought you were coming home straightaway.

208
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,090
Where did you get a scarf?

209
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,420
It smells like perfume.

210
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,020
This perfume smells so familiar.

211
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,880
Why can't I remember?

212
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,440
Forget it if you can't.

213
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,810
Where have you been?

214
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,740
Change your shoes first.

215
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,200
I suddenly thought of a theme.

216
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,700
"Where should those models

217
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,810
who were all the rage go now?"

218
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,040
What do you think?

219
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,680
It seems

220
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:09,070
you want to know what they're doing.

221
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,420
No.

222
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,040
I'm asking about the theme.

223
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,190
Pretty good.

224
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,950
You can interview some supermodels

225
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,160
who are already married and have children.

226
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,070
and ask them how they're doing.

227
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,200
The title can be

228
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,220
"Under high heels:

229
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,340
their second lives."

230
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,850
Look, the idea just flew out of my mouth.

231
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,950
It's quite creative,

232
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,810
but we can't find married models.

233
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,460
Otherwise, we won't be able to interview them.

234
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,310
Looks like you have a crush on someone.

235
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,610
Tell me, who do you like?

236
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,870
None of your business.

237
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,140
What does he do?

238
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,390
He's the publisher of "Declaration".

239
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,480
He invited me

240
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,120
to the event that day.

241
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,860
Does he know me?

242
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,430
I don't think

243
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,890
he recognized me that day.

244
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,620
He saw you in my Moments

245
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,810
and asked me

246
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,000
if I knew you.

247
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,590
Actually,

248
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,180
I saw you two that day.

249
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,060
I wanted to tell you when I came back,

250
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,280
but I forgot.

251
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,880
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

252
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,450
I was so embarrassed.

253
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,220
He's your friend.

254
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,190
Are you familiar with him?

255
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,810
He's

256
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,340
the captain of the basketball team I coach.

257
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,860
But the magazine publisher

258
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,870
is better than I thought.

259
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,830
Well,

260
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,190
will you consider him?

261
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,720
I like his looks,

262
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,960
but you know

263
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,870
my standard.

264
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,010
Magazines don't make much money now.

265
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,800
Tell me.

266
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,050
What do the girls who like you

267
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,360
see in you?

268
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,960
What do you think?

269
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,700
Indeed.

270
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,480
Money is an important bonus.

271
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,200
What is this?

272
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,910
A human face.

273
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,800
Shouldn't you introduce her to me?

274
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,640
Well,

275
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,700
this is an artist's jointly-designed jacket. I just bought it.

276
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,460
The artist just printed her face on the jacket?

277
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,480
Yeah, body art. Isn't it advanced?

278
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,270
Which girl?

279
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,540
My goodness.

280
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,630
Tong Yiwen's contact information.

281
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,070
He's quite active.

282
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,860
I'm going to bed.

283
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,560
Okay.

284
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,870
Good night.

285
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,780
Good night.

286
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,400
Xiaoxiao,

287
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,690
thank you for your help.

288
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,620
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

289
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,040
Do you like Jiacheng?

290
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,480
I can't let Jiacheng know.

291
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,850
That cursed Ye Han

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,240
is so dangerous.

293
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,230
Mom, I'm back.

294
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,040
Listen.

295
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,480
Don't rush back to eat as soon as you get off work.

296
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,130
Hang out with Ye Han and others,

297
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,550
so that you can meet girls.

298
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,240
But why should I think about that?

299
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,760
You're not young anymore.

300
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,980
You have to hurry up.

301
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,710
If you really care about me,

302
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,250
cook for me every day.

303
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,150
That's good.

304
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,560
To be honest,

305
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,950
the daughter of our dance team's Zhang

306
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,280
is very pretty.

307
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,840
Let me introduce her to you.

308
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,870
The soup is delicious.

309
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,830
What fish is this?

310
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,100
Isn't it fresh?

311
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,990
I bought it alive

312
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,170
early in the morning.

313
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,310
Really?

314
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,230
Is this a catfish?

315
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,230
Why are you changing the subject again?

316
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,950
These fish balls should be good.

317
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,470
Here, one for you and one for me.

318
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,860
Sit down. Come on.

319
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:03,990
Have a seat.

320
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,510
Come on.

321
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,950
Come, have a seat.

322
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,700
Let me get you some food.

323
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,710
Sweet and sour ribs.

324
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,720
[IN WORK]

325
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,060
Mr. Ye,

326
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,990
are you free now?

327
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:21,150
I have something to discuss with you.

328
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,220
It seems urgent.

329
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
It's lunchtime for the school.

330
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,900
You came here without eating.

331
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,550
I get hungry easily.

332
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,940
I had lunch after the third class.

333
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,880
It's good to get hungry easily.

334
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,380
It means good digestion.

335
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,980
I'm giving this copy

336
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,370
back to you.

337
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,910
Why are you willing to release the hostage?

338
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,310
You said you'd give it to me after I sign the settlement.

339
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,040
It's not about the settlement.

340
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,670
It's about…

341
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,490
your speculation last night.

342
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,840
I admit it.

343
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,970
Are you really from the Beggar Sect?

344
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,650
I'm not joking.

345
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,990
Mr. Ye,

346
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,250
I sincerely beg you

347
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,910
not to tell Jiacheng.

348
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,270
He is an important friend to me.

349
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
I don't want to ruin our friendship.

350
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,960
Friendship?

351
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,130
Yes.

352
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,830
I've decided to take it

353
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,250
as a friendship.

354
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,080
-Ye Han.
-Jiacheng.

355
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,480
They said they were not going to advertise.

356
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:53,320
Can you knock before coming in next time?

357
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,560
What if I'm doing something secretive

358
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,860
in there?

359
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,610
What can you do with her?

360
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,690
I can tell it's Xiaoxiao from behind.

361
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,690
Xiaoxiao.

362
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,890
Jiacheng.

363
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,280
Take a look.

364
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,120
You've been close lately.

365
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,030
Are you…

366
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,500
doing business in secret?

367
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,270
What's so good about business?

368
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,160
Why can't we be in a relationship?

369
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,520
Xiaoxiao can't like you.

370
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,230
I'm here

371
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,290
to return the copy with the misprint.

372
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,990
You must have something to talk about.

373
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,680
I'll get going.

374
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,520
Wait.

375
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,710
Yiwen's phone number.

376
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,770
Thank you.

377
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,430
It's nothing.

378
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,260
You guys talk.

379
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:39,490
Bye.

380
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,470
Bye.

381
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,340
Take care.

382
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,730
Did she tell you

383
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,410
the model's phone number?

384
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,860
Yeah. They are friends.

385
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,780
What's wrong?

386
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,300
I don't know what to say about you.

387
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,080
What? What's wrong?

388
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Say no more.

389
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,610
I know

390
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,930
I'm stupid

391
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,360
and silly.

392
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,130
Then why do you have to make yourself so stupid?

393
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,410
Just take it as I'm talking to myself.

394
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,670
I heard it.

395
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,030
[Art is life, IN WORK]

396
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,100
Then keep listening.

397
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,250
Who is your hypocrisy for?

398
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,310
That's not hypocrisy.

399
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,090
I'm just doing it

400
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,830
for my friend.

401
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,710
No one will know

402
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,470
your one-sided consideration

403
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,410
for others.

404
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,950
So what?

405
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,270
Even if there weren't Yiwen,

406
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,150
would he come to me

407
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,570
and fall in love with me?

408
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,070
I like him,

409
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,910
so I can only think for him.

410
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,830
Then why haven't you ever confessed your love?

411
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,580
It's not that I haven't thought about it.

412
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,140
I was just afraid.

413
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,900
If I don't tell him,

414
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,320
we can still be friends.

415
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,440
But if it doesn't work out,

416
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,140
we can't even be friends.

00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,630
[Art is life, IN WORK]

418
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,190
I see.

419
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,210
I've answered all your questions.

420
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,660
If you pity me,

421
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,350
please make some time

422
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,300
to sign the settlement agreement.

423
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,290
Let bygones be bygones.

424
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:35,870
Okay?

425
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,620
Sure.

426
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,370
Wear the "Carpe Diem" skirt

427
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,450
to the basketball game this weekend.

428
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,650
I'll go there too.

429
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,540
Are you asking me to play basketball in a skirt?

430
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,890
Are you trying to trick me?

431
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,370
It'd be so narrow-minded if you think me like that.

432
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,600
Why are you so obsessed

433
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,100
with that skirt?

434
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,650
What's so special about it?

435
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,390
Just wear it.

436
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,250
Weirdo.

437
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,910
Do you want to reconcile or not?

438
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,510
Fine.

439
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,470
I'll wear it.

440
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,570
I'll wear it, all right?

441
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,250
That's the plan for next month.

442
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,400
Remember to update it on your social media accounts.

443
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,310
Customers nowadays value that.

444
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,220
Okay.

445
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,070
I'll walk you out.

446
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,130
It's okay. Go back to work.

447
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:40,890
I can go myself.

448
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:41,570
Okay.

449
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,460
Don't you think

450
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,330
Yaoyao looks like Yiwen?

451
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,440
The young version.

452
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,230
Right?

453
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,370
Yeah.

454
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,820
Look at her expression and posture.

455
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,310
She's like Wen.

456
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,240
How dare I compare to Yiwen?

457
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,480
She was the first model

458
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,870
to appear on an international runway.

459
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,080
I think

460
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,430
Yaoyao is nothing like Yiwen.

461
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,400
Yiwen is not a good example.

462
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,620
And she has no work to do now.

463
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,310
She can only make some money through live streaming.

464
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,390
Of course.

465
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,820
Do you watch the show?

466
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,630
Yaoyao's got

467
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,130
a full schedule.

468
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,600
Really, Yaoyao?

469
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,270
It's not like that. You're exaggerating.

470
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,990
-Amazing.
-Yeah.

471
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,470
-So beautiful.
-Really beautiful.

472
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,820
Why are you here?

473
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,020
You didn't reply to my messages.

474
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,260
You just want me to come to you, don't you?

475
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,990
If I don't reply to your message, it means I don't want to talk to you.

476
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,710
What are you doing later?

477
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,660
What?

478
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,220
I want to treat you to a meal.

479
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,620
President Xu.

480
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,120
Do you do this to all the girls you've kissed?

481
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,790
No.

482
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,420
I've never been so reckless.

483
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,490
But that's not the case for me.

484
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,350
I just thought the vibe was good.

485
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,180
I see.

486
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,980
The vibe is good too now.

487
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,800
I'm not in the mood

488
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,480
to play an idol drama with you.

489
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,160
Okay, I'll leave

490
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:07,950
after giving you the present.

491
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,350
It's right behind my car.

492
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,580
I'm looking for a boyfriend on the premise of marriage.

493
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,510
Your financial strength

494
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,140
can't meet my requirements.

495
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,980
How do you know

496
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,080
before you see it?

497
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,320
Balloons or a thousand roses?

498
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,950
Are you crazy?

499
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,250
They're from Yangcheng Lake.

500
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,650
Every one of them weighs 200 grams.

501
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,310
What do you think? How is my financial strength?

502
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,170
It depends on your appetite.

503
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,120
Let's go.

504
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,710
[CLOUDS CAFE]

505
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,890
One mocha, with two potions of milk and half a sugar.

506
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,240
Mocha.

507
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,120
Isn't she pretty?

508
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,360
She has a nice figure too, right?

509
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,540
But it has nothing to do with a married man like you.

510
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,330
Do you discriminate against married people?

511
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,460
So what I'm married?

512
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,230
I don't even have the right to appreciate beauty because of it?

513
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,000
Yes, you do.

514
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,590
But put on the wedding ring first.

515
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,960
Don't lose it.

516
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,240
Do you think I took off the ring on purpose?

517
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,280
Of course.

518
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,590
You need to see the big picture.

519
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,990
My hands were slippery

520
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,400
when I was washing the cups.

521
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,260
The ring might fall into the sink.

522
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,290
I don't know why

523
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,120
I always feel happy

524
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,150
being with you.

525
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:06,830
Why?

526
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,090
Maybe it's because of the comfort

527
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,160
a married man like you brings me.

528
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,070
Anyway,

529
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,330
I can't communicate with you.

530
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,400
But this may be the main source of your charm.

531
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,600
Is that a compliment?

532
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,820
Sort of.

533
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,590
Add more sugar for me later.

534
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,470
It's meaningless for you to quit smoking like this.

535
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,960
Aren't you afraid of diabetes?

536
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,320
I think it's fine.

537
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,090
I'm just consuming the health

538
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,710
brought by giving up smoking

539
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,910
with eating sugar in advance.

540
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,020
It makes sense.

541
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,470
What are you doing?

542
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,610
Are you waiting for me for dinner?

543
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,650
We are.

544
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,390
Let's go have hairy crabs later.

545
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,570
Forget about hairy crabs.

546
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,930
Go eat with Xu Yan.

547
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,070
Xu Yan said he was having T-bone steak

548
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,130
and wasn't coming.

549
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,720
T-bone Steak?

550
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,000
The one at the Bund?

551
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,360
That's the only one.

552
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,990
He spent his anniversaries there with Jie every time, didn't he?

571
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,420
♫I'll see this through♫

572
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,260
I kept you waiting every time.

573
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,690
♫If we can notice all the considerations♫

574
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,960
Now,

575
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,100
it's my turn to wait for you.

576
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,310
♫At the intersection of time♫

577
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:23,500
♫Let's not lose each other again♫

578
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:35,310
♫Happy birthday to you♫

579
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,840
♫Happy birthday to you♫

580
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:43,590
♫Happy birthday to you♫

581
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,890
♫Happy birthday to you♫

582
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,950
Why didn't you invite us

583
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,620
to celebrate Jie's birthday together?

584
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,820
That's not what a good friend should do.

585
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,230
Indeed.

586
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,400
What are you waiting for?

587
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,720
Blow out the candles for her.

588
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,950
Hurry up.

589
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,550
We're waiting to eat the cake.

590
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,610
What are you doing?

591
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,810
Thank you.

592
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,680
Actually,

593
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,460
we just want to drink with you

594
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,340
on the pretext of Jie's birthday.

595
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,250
Yeah, don't overthink.

596
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:28,650
Right.

597
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,390
Don't get us wrong.

598
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,410
We're just here to drink.

599
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:31,650
Come on, cheers.

600
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,450
Cheers! Cheers!

601
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,940
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

602
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,430
There are

603
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,700
different excuses to drink every time,

604
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,230
but the only thing that hasn't changed

605
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,090
is the true heart that's hidden behind the excuses,

606
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,530
which is

607
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,840
"It's okay.

608
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,070
We're here with you."

609
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,700
But sometimes I don't even know

610
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,520
what the true heart hidden in the excuses is.

611
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,320
What are you doing here?

612
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,860
To play basketball, of course.

613
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,550
To play basketball?

614
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,570
Come on. Let's play.

615
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,320
No.

616
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,080
What I'm wearing is not fit for sports.

617
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,760
I can be your coach though.

618
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,890
Coach?

619
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,760
Sure, Coach.

620
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,620
Tell us

621
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,580
what our strategy should be today.

622
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,250
Make a 4-3-3 formation first.

623
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,120
4-3-3?

624
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,470
Tell me the truth. What are you doing here?

625
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,290
I'm looking for your coach.

626
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,740
Is there a secret here?

627
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,190
No.

628
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,210
No.

629
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,190
You have to wait until the game is over

630
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,710
even if there is.

631
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,310
Let's go, Xiaoxiao.

632
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:59,630
Pass it to him.

633
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,760
Pass the ball.

634
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,950
Give it to him.

635
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,150
-Nice shot!
-Nice shot!

636
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,360
Defend.

637
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,680
Defend.

638
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,220
Jiacheng, defend.

639
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,640
Nice shot.

640
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,970
Come on.

641
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,630
Come on.

642
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,310
Nice shot.

643
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,890
Qiao Feng, remember to defend.

644
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,160
We'll win if we defend against the rebounds.

645
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,100
-Jiacheng, you have to defend him from here.
-Okay.

646
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,380
Cover me from here. Come on.

647
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,440
One, two, three, Blue Dragon will win!

648
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,430
Let's go.

649
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,810
How is it?

650
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,280
Awesome.

651
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,640
Not bad, right?

652
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,970
I can't tell you're approaching forty years old.

653
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,410
Thank you, brother.

654
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,350
Where is Xiaoxiao?

655
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,590
I don't know.

656
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,260
I didn't see her just now.

657
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,170
That is the new design for autumn and winter next year, right?

658
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,630
You have foresight on the fashion next year.

659
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,190
Let's go.

660
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,120
Xiaoxiao,

661
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,270
I heard you live with Yiwen.

662
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,730
You two are so close.

663
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,480
Did Yiwen tell you that?

664
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,560
Tell me what else she likes.

665
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,900
Don't worry.

666
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,920
I won't tell her it's you who tells me that.

667
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,450
I'll treat you to a big meal.

668
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,620
I need to talk to her.

669
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,850
We're leaving.

670
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,790
I'm leaving, Jiacheng.

671
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,890
They do have a secret.

672
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,850
Why are you looking at me?

673
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,430
You're not good at acting.

674
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,220
I don't need to act so well

675
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,020
in front of someone who doesn't like me.

676
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,870
Do you really want to give up?

677
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,070
I've been trying to give up all the time.

678
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,820
Winter is coming to an end, too.

679
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,680
It's time to let go.

680
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,100
Carpe Diem.

681
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,640
It's the name of this dress.

682
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
Did you forget it?

683
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,370
People wearing it

684
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,870
shouldn't be so sad.

685
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,720
I'm wearing it as promised.

686
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,430
Really?

687
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,400
It seems different from what I remember.

688
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,080
I've torn apart

689
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,100
your "Carpe Diem" dress.

690
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,010
Now,

691
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,640
it's Li Xiaoxiao's version.

692
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,160
Anyway,

693
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,750
I'm wearing it as promised.

694
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,300
You should sign

695
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,850
the settlement agreement.

696
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,920
Actually, I wanted to sign the settlement agreement long ago.

697
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,840
But now I find

698
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,330
that what I care the most is not the dress.

699
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,300
What is it then?

700
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,030
I just want to see you again.

701

757
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,990

760
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,960

♫Is extremely precious♫

768
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,650
It's okay.

769
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,160
A stage accident.

770
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,300
I can handle it.

771
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,310
Congratulations,

772
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,830
lucky Mr. Ye.

773
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,860
You saw my first model show.

774
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,460
Being a model is amazing.

775
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,240
If I got the audience

776
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,780
staring at me,

777
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,800
I couldn't even take a step.

778
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,790
Why are you looking at me?

779
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,950
Because you're pretty.

780
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,870
Many people praised me.

781
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,220
Some praised me

782
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,170
for my strength.

783
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,970
Some praised me for riding fast.

784
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,560
Some praised me for my quick response.

785
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,890
But you're the first one

786
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,900
who praised me for looking pretty.

787
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,620
Everyone is beautiful in their own unique way.

788
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,560
You too.

789
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,860
Do you know what the exhibition is tomorrow?

790
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:15,970
Wedding dress?

791
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,470
Bingo.

792
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,340
That's great.

793
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,270
I just wonder

794
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,480
when I can wear the wedding dress.

795
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:27,200
Why?

796
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,750
Haven't you thought about when you'll get married?

797
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,840
Not for the time being.

798
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,940
What about you?

799
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,910
I don't know, either.

800
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,640
After all, marriage

801
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,520
is an important decision in life.

802
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,120
I don't have courage to make this decision yet.

803
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,420
Maybe I'm not mature enough.

804
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,350
You're almost 40

805
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,030
and you're not mature enough?

806
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,880
When I was a student,

807
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,570
I thought

808
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,670
a 20-year-old should be very mature.

809
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,230
But when I turned 20,

810
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,330
I thought

811
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,620
one could only be considered mature when he was at least 30.

812
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,600
In a blink of an eye, I'm over 30.

813
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,000
But I still think I'm a child.

814
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,070
I also feel that way.

815
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,000
Right?

816
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,220
Tell me.

817
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,650
Actually, we're no different from those teenagers

818
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,090
who wait for class to end

819
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,430
to go to the kiosk

820
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,660
after school, right?

821
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,220
Yeah.

822
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,610
There's no difference.

823
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,700
We're not mature like them.

824
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,690
Yes.

825
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,090
So in that sense,

826
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,620
we are still teenagers.

827
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,200
Who's inside?

828
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,600
You've rented this place, haven't you?

829
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,480
No.

830
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,020
Then run.

831
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,450
Hurry up.

832
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,650
Get in.

833
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,680
Why do I feel like

834
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,250
we did something bad?

835
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,740
Didn't we?

836
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,680
Let me show you how it feels to do bad things.

837
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:09,800
I've felt it.

838
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,110
Who turned on the light?

839
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,650
He's here.

840
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:20,720
Did he leave?

841
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,200
Let me see.

842
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,530
Has he left?

843
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,560
I think so.

844
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,670
♫No matter how hard♫

845
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,190
♫No matter how rough♫

846
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:08,910
♫No matter how faraway the place is, I'll go and find you there♫

847
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:14,250
♫I've met countless people♫

848
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:20,370
♫You're still the only one♫
