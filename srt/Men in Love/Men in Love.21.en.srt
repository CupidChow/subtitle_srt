Don't you see how drunk she is?

192
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,030
No, we...

193
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,360
I'm taking her away now.

194
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,900
If any of you have her contact information,

195
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,980
delete it.

196
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,050
Hey, buddy.

197
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,110
Who are you?

198
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,200
Are you her boyfriend?

199
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,860
I'm her lawyer.

200
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,860
Lawyer?

201
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,450
Xu Yan.

202
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,320
No, wait…

203
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,720
Is that really her lawyer?

204
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,320
Xu Yan.

205
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,679
Why are you here?

206
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,919
What were you thinking?

207
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,309
How do you dare

208
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,330
drink with strangers?

209
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:46,010
Xu Yan is worried about me!

210
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,320
I'm worried about you every day.

211
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,880
I hope you can be happy every day.

212
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,540
Get in the car.

213
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,630
Be careful.

214
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,760
Watch your head.

215
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,140
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,170
Actually, I'm not drunk.

217
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,320
I noticed it just now.

218
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,860
Why didn't you nail my lie, then?

219
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,440
Even if you keep pretending you don't care about me,

220
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,160
my feelings for you won't change.

221
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,820
I'm serious.

222
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,470
I know you're serious.

223
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,640
But…

224
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,440
it's just impossible.

225
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,230
Go to sleep.

226
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,790
Didn't you go on a business trip?

227
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,650
Brother, it's not like what you think.

228
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,180
What do I think?

229
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:51,990
I was drunk.

230
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,110
He ran into me by accident,

231
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,430
so he sent me back.

232
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,980
That's all.

233
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,470
Xu Jialin.

234
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,320
Didn't I tell you

235
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,780
not to bother Xu Yan again?

236
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,690
You make everyone embarrassed.

237
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,540
Xu Yan is our guest.

238
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,050
If you do this again,

239
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,430
move out of here and move back home.

240
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,240
Do you hear me?

241
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,550
Sorry, I was wrong.

242
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,250
Sorry for the trouble.

243
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,430
Go back to sleep.

244
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,210
Jialin is immature.

245
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,130
Sorry for the trouble.

246
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,440
I'm leaving.

247
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,260
Okay.

248
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,140
You even abandoned your house?

249
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,140
Didn't you stay at home yesterday?

250
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,340
Not that serious.

251
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,980
I've called the construction team.

252
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,150
As long as the ceiling is torn down

253
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,800
and the whole house is disinfected,

254
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,920
it'll be fine.

255
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,180
It turns out that I'm on a date with a lunatic.

256
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,840
If you're talking to yourself,

257
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,000
you might as well keep your voice down.

258
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,970
Oh, I forgot

259
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,720
that you're petty.

260
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,430
What did you say?

261
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,140
Nothing.

262
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,080
I don't want to rile you.

263
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,200
No.

264
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,780
You have to tell me.

265
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,710
Am I petty?

266
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,100
In what way?

267
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,920
It seems that you don't know well enough

268
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,040
about yourself.

269
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,510
What about the party?

270
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,310
Shall we just cancel it?

271
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,450
Of course not.

272
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,940
We can hold it in the hotel.

273
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,500
It is no different from holding it at home.

274
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,890
How is that the same?

275
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,510
A hotel is a hotel, after all.

276
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,420
Anyway, I can't go home now.

277
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,640
Nowhere is as good as a hotel.

278
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,210
You're back.

279
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,880
I came back to get a file.

280
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,450
It's so late. Why haven't you gone to work yet?

281
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,190
I worked late last night.

282
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,140
My boss said I could go to the office three hours late.

283
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,360
Have you had breakfast?

284
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,970
If you haven't, let me…

285
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,760
No need.

286
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,580
Xu Yan,

287
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,920
where did you sleep

288
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,030
last night?

289
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,820
I made do in the company.

290
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,290
Did you sleep there

291
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,520
because of me?

292
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,470
I'm staying with my parents tonight.

293
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,970
My mom said she missed me.

294
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,310
So I won't come home today.

295
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,310
You can come back.

296
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:20,839
Jialin.

297
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,579
Whatever you do,

298
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,089
don't consider me.

299
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,140
You don't have to do anything for me.

300
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,910
Didn't you say

301
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
it was my freedom to fall for anyone?

302
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,470
Don't fall for me anymore.

303
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,170
I told you before

304
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,560
that the way you pursue me

305
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,310
is bothering me.

306
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,680
♫Even the air is silent♫

307
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,190
♫There's no place for my heart to hide♫

308

Now,

309
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,800
I'm sick of everything

310

♫The world stops, like an illusion♫

311

Am I making you sick, too?

♫On the snowy streets♫

317
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,800

♫I'm wandering alone again♫

319
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,800

I couldn't get close to you.

♫I'll go far away with you♫

325
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,890

♫Love is like a lost ark♫

329
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,830

please bear with it.

I think they are very suitable for you,

347
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,730
so I bought them.

348
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,440
Have a look.

349
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:10,980
Let's see.

350
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,520
This...

351
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,250
Does it suit me?

352
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,240
I won't have a chance to wear this.

353
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,930
It's not that you need a chance to wear it,

354
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,460
but that the chance will come when you wear it.

355
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,510
What are you doing tomorrow?

356
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,770
What's wrong?

357
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,330
Jiacheng wants to treat everyone to a meal

358
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,270
and introduce his friends to me.

359
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,860
I have plans tomorrow.

360
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,200
With whom?

361
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,420
Do you have other friends besides me?

362
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,480
Yes.

363
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,030
Ms. Zhang from our school.

364
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,990
She said she was pregnant

365
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,520
and wanted to buy me a drink.

366
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,120
A pregnant woman wants to buy you a drink?

367
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,720
She is pregnant, so she can't drink.

368
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,000
But I can.

369
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,360
Li Xiaoxiao, you are not honest.

370
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,610
Tell me the truth.

371
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,950
That's the truth.

372
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,020
Is it because of Ye Han?

373
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,600
Is he the reason
why you don't want to eat with us?

374
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,910
Anyway, meeting with her now

375
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,090
still makes me restless.

376
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,910
Still?

377
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,530
Didn't you see Xiaoxiao the day you went to Beijing?

378
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,580
She suddenly rushed out.

379
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,350
I thought

380
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,910
you two made up at that time.

381
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,640
I also thought we made up that day.

382
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,280
Then, why are you still...

383
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,090
Wait.

384
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,130
Why are you suddenly so gossipy?

385
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,110
Do you still care about her?

386
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,490
You are so petty.

387
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,660
I just want you to meet up properly

388
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,170
and make up.

389
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,630
I don't think she'll come.

390
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,400
Still restless?

391
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,760
Why?

392
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,150
Beauty,

393
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,590
are you here alone?

394
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,290
Do you have a boyfriend?

395
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,870
Let's go to my place.

396
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,230
Let's go.

397
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,620
To my place.

398
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,880
Wang Ning.

399
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,580
Yiwen, you're here.

400
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,990
Nice move.

401
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,850
Aren't you going to introduce us?

402
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,850
Auntie,

403
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,210
why did you assume

404
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,940
I have something to do with him?

405
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,170
Auntie?

406
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,140
Don't talk nonsense.

407
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,880
She is a famous model.

408
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,500
Tong Yiwen!

409
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,410
I don't know her.

410
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,600
Auntie, didn't I address you right?

411
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,860
Wang Ning,

412
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,590
why is your taste getting worse?

413
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,800
Why did you pick such a rude girl?

414
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,560
What's the point of saying that?

415
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,070
Are you angry already?

416
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,180
Where's that attitude

417
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,640
when you called me Auntie?

418
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,390
Bad luck.

419
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,030
I was in a bad mood.

420
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,180
And now I met a bunch of cows and snakes.

421
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,680
Yiwen.

422
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,310
It's okay.

423
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,470
Yiwen, I'm sorry.

424
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,230
She's not…

425
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,960
Are you leaving?

426
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,830
I'm just here to relax.

427
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,840
I have things to do tomorrow.

428
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
Happy birthday.

429
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,300
Wait.

430
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,750
Will you just let me stand here?

431
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,620
I want that, too.

432
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,920
It's an important occasion.

433
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,850
Cut it yourself.

434
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,470
It's a pity that Ye Han didn't come.

435
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,310
Where did he go?

436
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,210
I don't know.

437
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,370
He might be doing something bad.

438
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,490
I'm waiting for you to turn to me.

439
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,790
Well,

440
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,900
to be honest,

441
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,230
this isn't the first time we've met,

442
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,390
right?

443
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,510
But every time I see you,

444
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,070
I think you are dazzling.

445
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,710
Having dinner with you

446
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,230
makes me very proud.

447
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,880
But I have a question.

448
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,910
You are so excellent and beautiful.

449
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,320
Why do you want to be with Xu Jiacheng?

450
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,880
You mean Jiacheng doesn't deserve me?

451
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,190
You're way out of his league.

452
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,950
Just eat.

453
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,480
You're such a sweet talker.

454
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,840
Honey, from now on,

455
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,260
don't talk to him again.

456
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,210
He has always been glib-tongued.

457
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,290
Listen to my advice.

458
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:28,790
Yes.

459
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,840
I've always been honest.

460
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,740
No wonder you are friends.

461
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,230
Interesting.

462
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,950
It's true

463
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,470
I raised my sense of humor myself.

464
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,330
-We're still eating.
-I'll kill you with the knife.

465
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,870
Look, he tends to be violent.

466
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,780
You deserve it.

467
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,310
I envy you

468
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,610
that you can bring your girlfriend

469
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,010
to eat with your friends.

470
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,740
Really?

471
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,220
You can also bring your girl…

472
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,900
What are you talking about? Yiwen is here.

473
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,120
Bring your female friends

474
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,160
to come out for dinner with Yun.

475
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,740
I'm already kicked out.

476
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,190
How could you still scare me with Yun?

477
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,720
What kind of friend are you?

478
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
By the way, Yiwen,

479
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,270
do you have any friends

480
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,710
who are single and nice?

481
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,950
Please introduce some girls to us.

482
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,790
No.

483
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,240
There's a lot of tension between Shengyun and I.

484
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,770
Are you dreaming? I wasn't talking about you.

485
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,900
I was talking about Xu Yan.

486
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,470
What do you do?

487
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,820
I'm a lawyer.

488
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:28,220
What type of girls do you like?

489
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,660
Cute ones or sexy ones?

490
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,420
Any way is fine.

491
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,220
He's not picky.

492
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:35,910
He's never picky.

493
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,700
You have a wide range of choices.

494
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,960
I have a friend to introduce to you.

495
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,520
Let's have dinner together sometime?

496
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,040
Okay.

497
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,530
You dragged me in so hard just now

498
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,380
just to let me see you work?

499
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,040
It's cold outside.

500
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,620
In that case,

501
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,370
you can ask me to come later.

502
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,270
But I like to have someone watching me

503
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,440
when I work.

504
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,550
It's finally over.

505
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,020
Did you notice that?

506
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,540
When did you see it?

507
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,220
I saw it when you just entered.

508
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,170
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

509
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,830
Let me take a shower first.

510
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,830
I haven't washed up since I got up.

511
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,150
It's so embarrassing.

512
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,430
So embarrassing.

513
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,270
Emergency notice.

514
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,680
There's a fire at the hotel.

515
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,240
Everyone, please leave your room

516
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,400
and go to the corridor quickly.

517
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,330
Follow the instructions of the staff.

518
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,790
Emergency notice again.

519
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,150
There's a fire alarm.

520
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:20,990
Let's…

521
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,440
There might be a fire.

522
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,390
Hurry up.

523
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,600
Let's go.

524
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,970
How could there be a fire?

525
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,440
We came out dressed like this.

526
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,790
I'll be embarrassed to death.

527
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,410
What are you thinking about?

528
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,870
We're really sorry.

529
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,900
A guest

530
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,900
accidentally triggered the smoke alarm.

531
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,410
The firefighters have checked.

532
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,660
They've proved that there was no fire.

533
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,770
I'm really sorry

534
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,550
for having startled you.

535
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,090
Thank you for your cooperation.

536
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,450
You can go back.

537
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,000
We climbed

538
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,790
28 floors to get down here.

539
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:18,440
♫With the little girl♫

540
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,180
♫With the knight♫

541
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,290
Why are you two together?

542
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,550
Plus, you're at the hotel.

543
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,510
Did you really make up?

544
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,070
And it seems

545
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,900
it's more than that.

546
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,760
It's not like what you think.

547
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,920
Really.

548
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,540
No…

549
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,220
It's too late.

550
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,550
Yes.

551
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,200
As you can see,

552
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,210
I hereby announce

553
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,800
I'm together with

554
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,100
Li Xiaoxiao.

555
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:23,280
Didn't you say you had an appointment with Ms. Zhang?

556
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,990
Who is Ms. Zhang?

557
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,720
Hello, Ms. Zhang.

558
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,610
Who is Ms. Zhang? Li Xiaoxiao.

559
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,700
Alright, Ms. Zhang. You are a big liar, too.

560
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,670
Come on. Don't sit with the liars.

561
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,750
Come here.

562
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,580
Okay.

563
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,120
Didn't you tell me that you'd become restless

564
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,020
when you saw Li Xiaoxiao?

565
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,750
Are you restless?

566
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,760
I am.

567
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,730
It's just because I'm too excited.

568
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,610
You'll wear a bathrobe if you're too excited.

569
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,690
Remember that.

570
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,570
Ye Han, you are so annoying.

571
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,430
You make me embarrassed.

572
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,310
You're disgusting.

573
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,310
Why did you hide

574
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,790
the fact that you're together from us?

575
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,480
Yeah.

576
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,760
Yeah.

577
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,960
It's not a big deal that you're together.

578
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,130
We don't care.

579
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,640
Is that so?

580
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,620
But you're even holding a hearing to interrogate me now.

581
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,540
We're not interrogating, just concerned.

582
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,030
Yes.

583
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,290
We want to know when you got together.

Really.

You stay at a hotel,

589

holding hands and dressed like that.

590
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,610
-And you told us it's been just a few days.
-Just a few days.

591

How many days exactly?

592
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,360
Not many days, really.

593
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,950
It's just that my girlfriend is open.

594

Shut up.

595

Stop laughing.

596
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,400
It's all your fault.

597
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,030
So you two

598
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,550
wanted to meet at home?

599
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,910
You had no choice, so you came to the hotel?

600
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,790
I'm sorry.

601
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,750
It's not like what you think.

602
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,900
Will you just sit here and watch?

603
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,520
You planned this secret relationship.

604
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,900
You should be responsible for your plan.

605
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,260
You're really responsible.

606
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:04,970
A good man.

607

I don't want

608

this boyfriend anymore.

609

I can't stay in this situation.

610
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,340
I'm leaving, guys.

611
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,470
It's so boring. I can't stay here anymore.

Where are you going?

Sit down.

614

don't make it clear today,

616
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,560
no one can leave.

617
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,510
They saw through us.

618
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,750
Fine.

in my life.

624

When the alarm rang,

625
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,330
God wanted to destroy me.

626
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,320
I don't think it was that bad.

627
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,150
I remember seeing you being even more embarrassed.

No way.

Forget about it, even if there is such a thing.

630
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,640
Why are you laughing?

631
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,910
Because I'm recalling

632
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,310
all the embarrassing things Li Xiaoxiao experienced.

633
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,860

You're a girl. Aren't you afraid?

You're always so impulsive.

I can't just stand by.

I suddenly want to deny myself.

Why?

Judging from the contract

692

you signed with the model company,

693
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,210
if you want to terminate
the contract unilaterally,

694
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,450

00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,260
Sure.

755
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,240
You traveled on your birthday last year.

756
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,040
Can you change to something new?

757
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,610
Okay, let's change to something new.

758
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,770
How about this?

759
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,420
Let's exchange gifts for each other.

760
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,420
How about that?

761
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,650
Okay.

762
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,080
I think

763
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:14,590
that is our good tradition.

764
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,000
We should keep it up, right?

765
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,910
But this year,

766
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,660
we'll have it

767
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,950
in a completely different way.

768
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,760
What about not celebrating it at all?

769
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,930
No, Bro, it's my birthday.

770
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,910
It's only once a year.

771
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,210
Every day is once a year.

772
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:27,810
Look.

773
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,030
January 1st is once a year.

774
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,310
January 2nd is also once a year.

775
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,830
It seems that I have one day to teach you a lesson

776
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,430
once every year.

777
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:32,990
Let's do it today, then.

778
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:33,630
Come on.

779
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,840
Xu Yan, tell him it's illegal.

780
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,500
I don't want to be beaten every day.

781
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,900
You get beaten every day?

782
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,690
By Xiaoxiao?

783
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,290
We are in the same boat.

784
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,350
You're getting tougher and tougher.

785
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,050
I think there's no need for variety and novelty.

786
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,190
Let's just have a meal outside.

787
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,910
Right?

788
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,510
We'll decide later.

789
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,380
I'm leaving.

790
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,190
We're discussing your birthday.
Where are you going?

791
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,190
Sorry, everyone.

792
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,660
I have an appointment with my girlfriend.

793
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,480
Bye.

794
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,250
Do you think you're the only one with a girlfriend?

795
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,000
Seriously.

796
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,560
Yes.

797
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,580
We're the only two having a girlfriend.

798
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,960
Xu Yan.

799
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,320
Beat him.

800
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,460
I'm here. Where are you?

801
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,860
Is your girlfriend here?

802
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:21,950
I have something to do later.

803
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,070
I need to go to my friend.

804
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,840
Say sorry for me to your girlfriend.
