[Episode 2]

4
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,540
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,170
It's okay.

6
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,990
Are you okay?

7
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,200
W-What happened?

8
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,730
Your skirt

9
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,240
caught on my cufflink.

10
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,100
This is a special kind

11
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,590
of fate between us, right?

12
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,310
Fate my foot!

13
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,930
Come with me.

14
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:57,880
All done!

15
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,590
Carpe Diem.

16
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,270
What?

17
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,070
That's the name of this dress.

18
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,670
I hope happiness will always be with you.

19
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,720
I...

20
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,580
Perfect.

21
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,850
Thank you.

22
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,000
Mr. Editor.

23
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,230
It's your turn to give a speech.

24
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,480
Okay, let's go.

25
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,650
I've liked him for so long.

26
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,930
I even planned to confess my love today,

27
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,770
but they kissed the first time they met.

28
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,740
Li Xiaoxiao, good for you.

29
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,950
You are quite charming after all.

30
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,850
You are...

31
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,560
No need to say anything.

32
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
Have a drink.

33
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,260
Thank you, Miss Li.

34
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,200
Miss Li,

35
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,670
don't you remember me?

36
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,950
I'm Zhang Wen. I graduated two years ago.

37
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,520
Zhang Wen!

38
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,830
How could I not remember you?

39
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,650
Why else would I drink with you?

40
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,810
What a coincidence

41
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,360
to meet you here.

42
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,820
Yes.

43
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,090
What a coincidence.

44
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,650
I have some friends over there.

45
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,880
They are also from our school.

46
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
Do you want to have a drink with them?

47
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
No, thanks.

48
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,140
I just remembered I have something to do.

49
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,510
I have to go.

50
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,930
Miss Li.

51
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,070
Well,

52
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,500
do you come here often?

53
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,130
It's my first time.

54
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,470
My first time.

55
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,200
Let's get together sometime
if there's a chance.

56
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,810
Yes, if.

57
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,100
How about I give you a ride?

58
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,420
No, I'm okay myself.

59
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,400
You guys have fun.

60
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
It's okay.

61
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,700
Enjoy yourselves.

62
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,390
See you next time, Miss Li.

63
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,280
Bro.

64
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,150
Aren't you cold?

65
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,750
You are not wearing any clothes.

66
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,990
The moment I saw you,

67
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
I knew

68
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,660
you must have something on your mind.

69
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,680
In that case,

70
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,400
I'll tell you my troubles

71
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,870
to make you happy.

72
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,690
I saw my best friend

73
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,210
and the person whom I have a secret crush on

74
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,630
kissing.

75
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,850
What?

76
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,230
What did you say?

77
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,820
You said I'm a coward?

78
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,950
I'm definitely not!

79
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,110
I was ready

80
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,840
to confess my love to him today.

81
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,720
I even wrote a love letter

82
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,600
to read to him face-to-face.

83
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,780
Who would know…

84
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,000
It's so cold.

85
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,010
Bro.

86
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,200
You are really tough.

87
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,010
How about this?

88
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,800
I'll give you my scarf.

89
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,670
You're welcome.

90
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,690
We are…

91
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,110
We're both in the same boat.

92
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,480
We need to keep each other warm.

93
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,570
I have to go home.

94
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,660
I haven't introduced this to you yet.

95
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,010
It's called "Carpe Diem."

96
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,470
Hello?

97
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,000
Hello?

98
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,840
Isn't the light on?

99
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,900
Why is it so dark?

100
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,780
Is the light broken?

101
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,160
Is the door broken, too?

102
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,110
What's this?

103
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,510
Why has it to be Monday today?

104
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,480
Who can turn the time back one day?

105
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,560
What happened to you last night?

106
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,140
I had something to do, so I left early.

107
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,780
Why didn't you tell me?

108
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,360
I was waiting for you there.

109
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,420
What are you wearing?

110
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,470
It's called…

111
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,740
"Carpe Diem."

112
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,700
What?

113
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,460
Nothing.

114
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,090
Did you have fun yesterday?

115
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,120
Not bad.

116
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,320
Yesterday,

117
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,910
I kissed a boy.

118
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:42,960
Well,

119
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,290
do you like him?

120
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,130
Wake up.

121
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,290
It's just a kiss.

122
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,030
We didn't even exchange our contact details.

123
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,630
Why not?

124
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,670
Beautiful impulse is only suitable
to stay in the memories.

125
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,700
Isn't it boring to make it a reality?

126
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,510
Actually,

127
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,580
I know that man…

128
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,850
I need to take this.

129
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,200
Hello, Bei.

130
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,190
I'm at home.

131
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,070
Come on.

132
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,350
Everyone, come and have a look.

133
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,310
Come here.

134
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,950
Come here.

135
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,330
At the party last night,

136
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,640
did anyone see

137
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,010
such a girl?

138
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,110
Excuse me.

139
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,150
I have to interrupt.

140
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,930
Are you looking for an alien?

141
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,380
What alien?

142
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,670
Look how pretty she is.

143
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,230
Last night at our party,

144
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,510
was there a girl

145
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,350
whose eyes occupy half of the face like this?

146
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,630
No, no.

147
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,290
Well, because I...

148
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,100
I usually draw

149
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,010
in the style of Picasso.

150
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,790
It may be a little exaggerated.

151
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,210
But last night, this girl

152
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,490
was wearing a red dress.

153
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,860
OK, Mr. Picasso.

154
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,900
Here's the thing.

155
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,090
There were a dozen of women

156
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,380
wearing a red dress last night.

157
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,610
Not ordinary red.

158
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,650
The color number for the shade of red is CC0303.

159
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,150
It's exactly the same as in the drawing.

160
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,270
Look more closely.

161
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,710
Come on, friends.

162
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,310
Here's the thing.

163
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,310
If anyone saw

164
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,480
someone like this

165
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,930
at the party last night,

166
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,680
please tell our Mr. Editor.

167
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,460
Okay?

168
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,240
-Okay.
-Come on.

169
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,910
Get to work.

170
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,030
Dismiss.

171
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,070
How could no one recognize her?

172
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,510
Doesn't my drawing look real?

173
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,880
Speaking of looking for someone,

174
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,290
actually, I also want to look for a person.

175
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,840
Would you help me while you're at it?

176
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,880
Who?

177
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,220
A woman, of course.

178
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
A woman?

179
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,900
I suddenly remembered I had something to do.

180
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,720
And it's urgent.

181
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,310
I'm off.

182
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,110
I...

183
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,200
Are you going on a blind date again?

184
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,870
How about this guy?

185
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,360
Isn't he handsome?

186
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,580
Not bad.

187
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,240
I told you

188
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,750
I'm going to get married this year.

189
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,160
I'll pick someone good

190
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,800
when I still have the chance.

191
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,200
I don't want to be left,

192
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,760
and then I can only wait to be picked by others.

193
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,630
Let me ask you something.

194
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,590

195
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,710
I have a friend.

196

She's always liked someone.

197
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,660
No.

198
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,330
Actually,

199
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
she's had a secret crush on someone.

200
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,110
One day,

201
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,400
she found

202
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,810
the person she had a crush on

203
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,520
and her best friend

204
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,800
were

205
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,579
flirting with each other.

206
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,740
And they had physical contact, too.

207
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,500
For example,

208
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,040
kissing.

209
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,869
But then she found

210
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,250
her best friend

211
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,000
didn't seem to take this person seriously.

212
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,730
Do you think

213
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,520
she should continue

214
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,600
to like the person she had a crush on?

215
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,560
So complicated.

216
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,320
Yes, it's quite complicated.

217
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,830
I think as long as

218
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,360
your best friend

219
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,950
has no feelings for him,

220
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,300
you can continue.

221

It's not me.

222
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,460
It's a good friend of mine.

223
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,790
A good friend of yours?

224
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,110

-Of course.
-Sure thing.

388
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,580
We know that.

389
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,590
Speak with one voice.

390
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,430
One voice!

391
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,750
My wife is the best.

392
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,760
She doesn't raise your rent.

393
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,160
Thank Yun now.

394
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,650
Forget it. I'll thank her for you.

395
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,860
Thank you, Yun.

396
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,760
Enjoy yourselves.

397
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,670
I'm leaving.

398
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,120
OK. Take care, Yun.

399
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,190
-Be careful, Yun.
-See you.

400
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,850
You go ahead. I'm leaving too.

401
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,350
It's okay. You can stay.

402
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,730
Look at Shengyun.

403
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,370
Sit.

404
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,640
She's so reasonable.

405
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,060
She doesn't raise the rent for you.

406
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,710
Come on. Let's continue.

407
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,470
Let me tell you.

408
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,360
If you bully me,

409
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,930
I will tell Shengyun

410
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,910
all the lies you told for me

411
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,170
and see if she'll raise your rent.

412
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:10,960
Are you lying more

413
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,070
or are we?

414
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,710
Don't you dare

415
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,030
use us as an excuse to go have fun

416
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,510
and not answer Yun's call again!

417
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,710
Be ready that we'll betray you any time.

418
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,380
I'll answer her call.

419
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,470
I will.

420
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,350
Forget it.

421
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,510
Now that we're here,

422
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,770
let's play for a while.

423
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,260
I was in a meeting.

424
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,410
It was all because of Lu Zheng.

425
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,160
I have to go back to the meeting.

426
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,020
I'll get going.

427
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,040
By the way,

428
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,620
I haven't finished reviewing an article.

429
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,630
I have to go, too.

430
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,510
Wait…

431
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,450
I think Shengyun

432
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,860
is just turning a blind eye.

433
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,090
She must know everything.

434
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:54,880
I still have to go home,

435
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,760
or I'll be dead.

436
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,650
I'm going, too.

437
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,600
You old men are so boring.

438
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,220
Let's go.

439
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,400
Bye.

440
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,870
Bye.

441
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:22,950
They scattered.

442
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,610
Shall we follow them, Ms. Guo?

443
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,680
Wait a minute.

444
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,280
Hello, Yun.

445
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,790
We've separated.

446
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,560
Do you think you've really separated?

447
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,790
What do you mean?

448
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,180
How close do you think

449
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,840
you are?

450
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,150
Little Shrimp, step back.

451
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,000
Heal him.

452
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,500
I've been healing him all the time.

453
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,820
Don't block me.

454
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:14,690
I...

455
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,040
Where am I? I can't find myself.

456
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,690
Which one is me?

457
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,170
One more round.

458
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,100
One more round.

459
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,150
What are you doing?

460
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,220
I can't believe this.

461
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,290
How could you do

462
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,980
such a heartless thing?

463
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,270
You know clearly my Young Master Yibai's

464
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,350
equipment was stolen here.

465
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,650
Yet you still play games here

466
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,010
behind my back.

467
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,700
Sorry, Ye Han.

468
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,050
I know you're sad.

469
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,790
But

470
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,220
you have your Young Master Yibai,

471
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,410
and I have my Little Shrimp.

472
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,570
And there's Innocent Man, too.

473
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,010
We did this

474
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,110
so that you won't be upset.

475
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,150
The Chain Blade pieces through Heaven and Earth.

476
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,240
The Sect Huangyu will shock the world.

477
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,360
My Hero Xu needs to be upgraded too.

478
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,310
Listen.

479
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,660
What are you talking about?

480
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,450
After what happened to Young Master Yibai,

481
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,810
yet you still want to play games.

482
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,500
Who asked you to gamble with others?

483
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,360
What did you say?

484
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,200
I said,

485
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,270
who asked you to gamble with others?

486
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,360
Do you dare to look into my eyes

487
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,000
and say that again?

488
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,330
Stop arguing.

489
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:52,920
Get out!

490
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,600
Fine!

491
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,340
Your basketball coach is a girl?

492
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,590
How do you know?

493
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,550
She has

494
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,760
the copy of the magazine with misprints which I want.

495
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,020
What a coincidence. Why does she have it?

496
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:21,780
Who?

497
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,240
It's none of your business.

498
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,050
Remember,

499
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,170
all the women in this world

500
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,380
have nothing to do with you, except Yun.

501
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,680
[Come here!]

502
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,900
Found you!

503
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:39,990
What did you find?

504
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,250
You're even more agitated than just now.

505
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,230
I've found the robber

506
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,860
who robbed my Young Master Yibai's equipment.

507
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,300
I've been monitoring
this Weibo account for a long time.

508
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,040
He finally posted something today.

509
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,440
There's a location, too.

510
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,260
Location.

511
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,750
Location.

512
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,620
Found it.

513
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,200
We can finally go to the Internet cafe again.

514
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,040
-We're saved.
-I'm so happy.

515
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,750
See?

516
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,250
I'm the best friend.

517
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,310
When you're in trouble,

518
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,210
I'm the only one who stayed by your side.

519
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,070
I think you are the one in trouble.

520
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,710
Did Yun investigate you again?

521
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,630
Or do you lack an alibi?

522
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,250
Is this how you treat your bro?

523
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,680
I'll be sad then.

524
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,410
Cut the crap.

525
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,120
Where is the parking lot?

526
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,510
Show me the way.

527
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,660
Just drive forward.

528
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,090
But the road forks ahead.

529
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,650
Left. Left.

530
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,050
No, right, right, right.

531
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,130
Turn right?

532
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,330
Young man, are you okay?

533
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,640
How did you drive?

534
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,480
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

535
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,320
You were hesitant when driving.

536
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,430
Who knew where you were going?

537
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,230
-I'm sorry.
-Are you okay?

538
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,990
Are you okay?

539
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,320
It's you.

540
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,260
You know him?

541
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,250
I do.

542
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,380
I know him even if he's burned to ashes.

543
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,280
He's the one who robbed
Young Master Yibai's equipment.

544
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,440
-Don't go.
-Wait. Wait.

545
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,400
It's you?

546
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,850
Don't drag me.

547
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,130
I'm telling you.

548
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,930
Now that you meet us today,

549
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:06,960
don't even try to leave!

550
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,890
I advise you not to ask for trouble.

551
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,110
What?

552
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,120
Do you want to try some moves?

553
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,600
Right?

554
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,160
Listen.

555
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,660
Behave yourself.

556
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,370
Don't force us to fight.

557
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,280
What? You want to fight?

558
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,470
Bring it on!

559
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,800
[Police]

560
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:21,980
Does it hurt?

561
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,840
It hurts!

562
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,170
It's swollen.

563
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,360
It hurts for me too.

564
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,620
What should we do?

565
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,170
Xu Yan.

566
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,960
You're here.

567
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,510
Actually, you didn't have to rush here.

568
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,350
It's nothing.

569
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,970
Close your mouth if it hurts.

570
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,150
Hello.

571
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,020
I'm their attorney,

572
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,170
Xu Yan.

573
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,600
This is my business card.

574
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,710
It was just bickering

575
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,030

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,490
Let's have lunch together.

765
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,540
Yes, I'm free.

766
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,380
Is it okay to eat near my company?

767
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,040
Near your company? Okay.

768
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,800
I'll be there soon.

769
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,790
Bye.

770
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,510
Let's go.

771
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,140
I'm going back to my company.

772
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,800
Aren't you going to eat?

773
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,150
What about the reconciliation?

774
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,480
Did you bring the copy

775
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,300
with misprints?

776
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:10,990
No.

777
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,490
I'll give it to you

778
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,530
whenever you agree to sign.

779
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,770
You're smart.

780
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,320
You've learned to detain a hostage.

781
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,890
Stop worrying.

782
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,400
Ye Han will definitely
sign the settlement agreement.

783
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,500
I'll talk to him again later.

784
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,730
Don't worry.

785
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,580
I hope so.

786
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,670
Why do I feel like

787
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:49,970
he's playing tricks on me on purpose?

788
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,520
How could it be?

789
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,350
He's always like that.

790
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,390
I know him well.

791
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,180
Sometimes, I can't do anything with him.

792
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,970
Enough talking about him.

793
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,590
Why did you suddenly

794
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,930
treat me to a big meal?

795
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,810
I need a favor.

796
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,640
Take a look.

797
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,990
What's it with my photo?

798
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,800
It's not about you.

799
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,300
Look here. Zoom in.

800
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,270
Look here.

801
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,520
♫I'll be heartbroken no matter how careful I am♫

802
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,090
♫Maybe you have nothing to say♫

803
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,970
I want to ask you

804
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,060
if you know Tong Yiwen.

805
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,810
♫Our love takes a roundabout route♫

806
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,160
You can even tell that?

807
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,430
Of course.

808
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,750
I met her at the party last time,

809
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:54,950
♫We could only blame that we didn't have time to prepare for it♫

810
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,220
but we didn't exchange our contact details.

811
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,350
I was wondering

812
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,770
how to find her.

813
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,950
I didn't expect to see her in your Moments.

814
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,230
Are you close?

815
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,320
♫If missing is a misunderstanding♫

816
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,980
Can you give me her contact information?

817
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,350
♫The contradictory emotions are also shaky♫

818
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,740
Okay.

819
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,830
♫The traffic lights are like tears♫

820
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,550
I'll ask her later.

821
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,670
Great.

822
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,960
♫Twinkling in my heart♫

823
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:15,720
♫Time has stolen blossoms♫

824
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,770
♫Like a silent monologue♫

825
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,180
♫But my heartbeats♫

826
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:25,770
♫Turn the past pages♫

827
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:30,120
♫We met by chance and missed each other; I look forward to seeing you again♫

828
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,350
♫I don't dare to love even if I long to♫

829
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,390
♫But how can I forget your tenderness?♫
