At the age of thirty,

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,710
a man should always remind himself

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,060
that he needs to be mature all the time.

00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,920
Only when I'm with my best friends

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,920

00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,830

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,190
No, it isn't.

00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,150

Xu Yan.

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,470
Why were you fooling around with them?

40
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,980
And you.

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,200
Ye Han.

42
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,970
You are tall and handsome but it doesn't mean

43
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,960
that you can do everything you want to.

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,420
Sorry, I won't do it again.

45
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,289
Since the school was established,

46
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:43,800
no one else, except you guys,

47
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,789
has had a hotpot on the sports field.

48
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,440
You are really hotpot enthusiasts.

49
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,150
Are you trying to piss me off?

Think about what you did.

What do you want to be when you grow up?

55
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,940
I wish I were a grow-up now.

56
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,970
If so, I can have hotpot

57
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,240
wherever I want to.

58
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,640
It was your idea.

59
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,560
Why did the teacher blame us for having a bad influence on you?

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,750
How many times have I told you?

61
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,230
Don't eat hotpot.

62
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,560
The smell is too strong.

63
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,480
What the teacher said makes some sense.

64
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,940
What do you think we will be

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,750

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,710
Of course.

It is Lu Zheng. Lu Zheng.

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,990
Lu Zheng's dream

71
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,760

Be quiet.

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,110
Can I take a photo with you, Lu Zheng?

76
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,880
Can I have your autograph?

77
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,760
Sure.

However, like many other people,

81
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,840
his dream was just a dream.

82
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,710
Jiacheng's dream was to become a hacker.

83
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,790
15 billion RMB transferred successfully.

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,990
Why do I always forget my password?

85
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,640
Was it reset by the system automatically?

86
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,670
Jiacheng admitted

87
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,550
that he didn't even know

88
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,560
why he had such a dream back then.

When I was travelling around the world,

the most important lesson I learnt

93
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,470
is to forgive.

94
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,870
Forgiveness

95
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,680
is the key to world peace.

97
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,990
your forgiveness

98
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,430
will not solve the problem.

99
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,440
You must sue him.

100
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,320
So you can get your property soon

101
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,870
and start a new life.

102
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,850
This is what you should do.

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,160
Xu Yan, who wanted to maintain world peace,

104
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,770

00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,380
Luckily,

193
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,820
I can help them realize their dreams.

194
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,110
So, turning thirty

195
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,770
is just the beginning of a new chapter of my life.

196
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,350
I think

197
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,790
the prime of a man's life

198
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,920
is in his thirties.

199
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,480
Because that's the time when we know

200
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,360
how to support ourselves, how to handle pressure,

201
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,040
and how to deal with everything with ease.

202
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,040
As the saying goes,

203
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,690
at thirty,

204
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,000
a man

205
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:34,309
should be able to think for himself.

206
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,110
So, I think these two colors

207
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,960
are very suitable for daily use.

208
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,840
I use this one more often.

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,190
I'm live streaming.

210

211
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,710

It's not just a spelling mistake.

570
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,160
Nothing?

571
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,340
Tell us what happened

572
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,730
or keep silent.

573
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,560
What do you mean by "nothing?"

574
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,300
I had an argument with someone just now.

575
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,670
Did you win?

576
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,700
He wouldn't be so upset if he had won.

577
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,520
I may

578
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,810
have won the argument.

579
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,320
But I still feel bad.

580
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,490
Don't you enjoy debating with others?

581
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,470
I'm getting older and older

582
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,440
so I can understand others better now.

583
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,890
When a man is over thirty,

584
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,970
he will suffer a hormone imbalance.

585
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,890
The change of hormones

586
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,070
is the evidence that I'm getting old.

587
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,700
Nonsense.

588
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,270
I still feel quite good about myself.

589
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,030
Me too.

590
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:49,730
Cheers.

591
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,390
Getting old has now influenced my emotional stability.

592
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,110
I can't even

593
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,910
have some quiet time for myself.

594
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,580
Now I don't want

595
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,740
to hang out with you old guys anymore.

596
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,310
Did you meet Bai Sha today?

597
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,540
Were you talking about

598
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,020
the rankings of your magazines,

599
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,410
the readers' needs,

600
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,040
or something about responsibility,

601
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,560
right?

602
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,560
It's been so many years.

603
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,420
Why do you still care about those?

604
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,280
If you don't pick a side,

605
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,250
just drink your wine.

606
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,730
Of course I'll pick a side.

607
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,870
I think I should stand with Bai Sha.

608
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,510
Don't you think so?

609
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,880
Come on, cheers.

610
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,280
After all,

611
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,390
his magazine is the No.1 in the industry.

612
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,700
Don't you think

613
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,320
he can give us some good advice?

614
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,580
Do you really think so?

615
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,550
I agree our Declaration is a good magazine.

616
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,570
But it's not very successful

617
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,970
in generating profits.

618
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,590
I also agree good magazines should sell well.

619
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,640
And now

620
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,360
our magazines are indeed selling well.

621
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,630
Our magazine remains the No. 2 in the industry.

622
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,840
But

623
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,590
have you ever thought about

624
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,870
how much the No. 1 magazine can earn

625
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:00,910
from its advertising services?

626
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,350
If you really want to make money,

627
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,390
why did you choose to make magazines?

628
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,670
Just go to your dad.

629
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,880
Alright, I'll stop.

630
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,800
Anyway, you can't win this argument with me.

631
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,070
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

632
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,640
Cheers.

633
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,550
Cheers.

634
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,800
Okay.

635
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,380
That’s all for today.

636
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,160
Go home and get ready

637
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,280
for tomorrow's efficiency test.

638
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,360
Okay.

639
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,190
Thank you.

640
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,600
Thank you.

641
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,120
Ding Zhuang.

642
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,190
Bye, teacher.

643
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:30,720
Where is Zhong Zixuan?

644
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,200
I don't know.

645
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,300
Maybe

646
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,350
he overslept.

647
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,780
Zixuan,

648
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,790
don't you have classes of required courses this afternoon?

649
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,260
It's just physical training. Boring.

650
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,240
I don't want to go now.

651
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,120
So you're indeed the top student.

652
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,830
Tell me if you need anything.

653
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,570
Amazing!

654
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,400
It's really amazing.

655
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,270
Hello?

656
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,870
Hello, where are you?

657
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,920
In a world where I can breathe freely,

658
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,450
I'm having a bloody battle.

659
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,880
You've finished your work. You are free now.

660
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,120
But we are still working tirelessly.

661
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,160
Okay.

662
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,880
I came to the Internet cafe

663
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,280
so that I won't be able to interrupt your work.

664
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,030
Let me tell you,

665
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,350
with my character, Young Master Yibai,

666
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,840
I had an incredible game just now.

667
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,160
I should have recorded a video

668
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,280
and show it to you.

669
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,360
Bye.

670
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,390
Hello?

671
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,520
You're just a rich gamer. Don't brag about your skills.

672
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,430
Are you talking to me?

673
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,200
Yes, you old man.

674
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,910
I'm talking to you.

675
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:41,350
Me?

676
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,190
Your level is so low.

677
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,590
I can defeat you

678
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,560
with my Refined Blade only.

679
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,590
You kids

680
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,300
are so arrogant.

681
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,310
Let's have a battle now, will you?

682
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,280
And

683
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,560
mind your language.

684
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,670
Don't call me old man.

685
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,840
Okay.

686
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,040
If I win,

687
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,270
what can I get?

688
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,510
What do you want?

689
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,120
I want your equipment

690
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,360
and your Blood Star Jade.

691
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,750
Is it okay for you?

692
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,200
You can still change your mind.

693
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,280
No more talking.

694
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,080
See me on the Cultivation Peak.

695
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,560
[Wu]

696
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,790
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

697
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,300
I'm sorry.

698
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:37,970
Well.

699
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,320
What's wrong with you?

700
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,340
I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

701
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,640
Are you okay?

702
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,410
No.

703
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,080
Well, you lost.

704
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,850
Sometimes, you are bound to lose.

705
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,050
The victory belongs to the lucky guy.

706
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,390
Fine.

707
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,940
As a man,

708
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,840
I'll keep my word.

709
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,550
My equipment is now yours.

710
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,630
Good.

711
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,790
I helped you so much.

712
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,310
Shouldn’t you give me some of the equipment?

713
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,840
I’ll give you

714
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,350
the Blood Star Jade.

715
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,670
Good.

716
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,510
But for me...

717
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,590
You two know each other?

718
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,160
Go.

719
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,440
How dare you trick me!

720
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,000
You rascals.

721
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,040
He has been playing with Young Master Yibai

722
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,310
for four years.

723
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,120
Four years!

724
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,800
I can even be seen

725
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,320
as Young Master Yibai's uncle.

726
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,520
Forget about it.

727
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,160
The Blood Star Jade

728
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,110
was a birthday present

729
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,240
he got from me.

730
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,400
I don't even have that.

731
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,750
It is so difficult to get a Blood Star Jade.

732
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,400
Hello.

733
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,820
Don't you need to appear in court tomorrow?

734
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,440
The case is not that important.

735
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,600
Did he really lose

736
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,110
the equipment he had kept for four years?

737
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,880
Yes.

738
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,630
Where is the equipment now?

739
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,040
How can I know?

740
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,170
Did he cry?

741
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,850
He's been silent since he came back.

742
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,970
You guys are so annoying.

743
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,470
I want to be alone.

744
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,500
You all leave.

745
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,290
Okay.

746
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,070
Let's go.

747
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,280
Bye, Ye Han.

748
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,630
Let's go.

749
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,800
Go.

750
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,560
You go too.

751
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,840
Just go.

752
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,910
It's not just about my gaming equipment.

753
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,560
It's about my dignity.

754
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,460
The dignity of a 30-year-old man.

755
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,720
Xiaoxiao's Love,

756
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,040
I will find you whatever the cost.

757
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,600
Hey.

758
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,090
Which one looks better?

759
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,790
What's this?

760
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,720
Neither is good?

761
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,740
No.

762
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,950
I wasn't talking to you.

763
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,590
Look.

764
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,490
[Beauty Section-What Will Be the Trend in the Year of Pigg?]

765
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,750
There's a typo in the magazine.

766
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,910
Are you going out?

767
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,060
I'm going to do some grocery shopping.

768
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,060
So,

769
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,840
the copy with the typo is on the market?

770
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,890
Yes.

771
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:13,930
Good.

772
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,370
Are you trying to make me angry deliberately?

773
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,260
Just one copy.

774
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,250
Mr. Editor,

775
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,120
relax.

776
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,600
Let them handle it.

777
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,950
The stylist is waiting for you.

778
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,460
The celebration will start in less than six hours.

779
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,260
It's not that important now.

780
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,630
Do you think our celebration is more important than the magazine?

781
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,600
We have to find that copy

782
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,670
with the typo.

783
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,680
It is on the market now.

784
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,070
We don't know which bookstore it is in.

785
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,550
How can we find it?

786
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,870
Well,

787
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,110
we can launch a campaign

788
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,680
on our official account.

789
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,120
How about

790
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,590
"Find the unique copy of Declaration".

791
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,760
We tell our readers

792
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,910
there is a copy of Declaration that has a typo in it.

793
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,120
The reader who finds it

794
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,550
will get some sort of gifts

795
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,190
or coupons.

796
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,910
Anyway, we must find it.

797
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,110
Look how smart our editor is.

798
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,150
Move.

799
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,520
Okay.

800
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,600
I'll go now.

801
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
Wait.

802
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,760
Take one.

803
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,600
This is your punishment.

804
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,040
I hope you've learnt your lesson.

805
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,870
Mr. Ye,

806
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,550
why are you as childish as a three-year-old?

807
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,280
Fine.

808
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,760
I'll give him a more severe punishment.

809
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,700
How about I deduct his salary?

810
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,450
Being scared by a cockroach is enough.

811
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,910
I'll go find that copy now.

812
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,320
Let's get changed.

813
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,750
Don't you want my advice?

814
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,590
Fine.

815
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,880
I'll listen to you.

816
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,830
Let's go. Hurry up.

817
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,600
We don't have much time now.

818
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,440
Let's go.

819
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,120
Have you decided?

820
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,750
Which one do you want to wear?

821
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,320
Well.

822
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,160
They are all good.

823
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,360
Any of these will do.

824
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,870
Listen to me.

825
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,650
I think

826
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,480
this one

827
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,230
looks good.

828
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,060
This one.

829
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,010
No, I think

830
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,830
this one in general is better.

831
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:16,790
This one is better, really.

832
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,469
Really?

833
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,080
What do you think?

834
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,880
Pick a tie then.

835
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,679
Not bad, right?

836
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,389
This one.

837
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,830
No.

838
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,350
I think this tie is better.

839
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,889
This one is better.

840
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,080
What do you think?

841
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,870
I take your advice.

842
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,750
What about the shoes?

843
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,750
Black leather shoes?

844
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,270
I definitely need brown shoes.

845
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,199
Black shoes don't match my outfit.

846
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,389
Bro, it's been two hours.

847
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,870
I'm here with you for almost two hours.

848
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,239
Since you can make your own choices,

849
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,800
why did you want me to be here?

850
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,840
Why?

851
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,320
Well, you are...

852
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,030
You are really impatient.

853
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,440
So impatient.

854
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,030
The most important thing

855
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,560
is to pick a pair of nice cufflinks.

856
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,750
I'll try to find you a boyfriend

857
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,510
on the 10th anniversary event.

858
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,730
On that special day,

859
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,040
I must tell him that I love him.

860
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,830
Xiaoxiao,

861
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,010
when will you go out?

862
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,850
Now.

863
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,280
Look.

864
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,230
How do I look?

865
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,810
Is it too much?

866
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,130
You look great.

867
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,910
So beautiful.

868
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,360
It's a piece of haute couture that Tong Yiwen

869
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,270
made for you.

870
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,930
Okay.

871
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,000
I should go now.

872
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,590
You forget one thing.

873
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,680
What?

874
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,620
Me.

875
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,140
You said you didn't want to go just now.

876
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,600
I got stood up.

877
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,990
Now I want to go to the party and find some handsome boys.

878
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,030
Great.

879
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,440
Go get changed.

880
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,790
I need an hour to get prepared.

881
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,600
Then it'll be too late.

882
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,040
How about this?

883
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,150
I give you the invitation letter.

884
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,080
Here you are.

885
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,520
I have a friend there.

886
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,350
I can go to the party without the invitation.

887
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,560
Call me when you arrive.

888
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,710
Bye.

889
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,320
Bye.

890
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,690
You'd better hurry up.

891
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,350
Bye.

892
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,280
See you later.

893
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,000
See you later.

894

[Declaration]

895
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,200
Hello, Miss.

896
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,000
Please show me your invitation.

897
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,820
I have the invitation.

898
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,300
But I forgot to bring it here.

899
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,150
Sorry.

900
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,920
You can't go in without an invitation.

901
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,190
But I have a friend here.

902
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,160
Who is your friend?

903
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,240
Me.

904
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,330
Jiacheng.

905
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,010
She is my friend.

906
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,650
Can't you tell

907
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,880
she is my VIP from her beautiful eyes?

908
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,760
Sorry.

909
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,230
Xiaoxiao, you look...

910
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,080
Strange, right?

911
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,150
No, you look great.

912
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,320
Do you think so?

913
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,480
Yes.

914
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,030
Look, everyone thinks you look great.

915
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,960
Mr. Xu.

916
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,550
This is

917
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,350
your girlfriend?

918
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,830
Nonsense.

919
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,920
Xiaoxiao is just my good friend.

920
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,920
My bro.

921
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,960
My basketball coach.

922
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,040
Do you know?

923
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,350
Mr. Xu.

924
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,560
Am I late?

925
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,790
No, no, no.

926
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:24,710
I'll go in first.

927
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,320
Okay, Xu Yan is there.

928
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,400
See you later.

No, please come in.

00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,790
I'll come later.

932
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,270
Okay, tell me if you need any help.

933
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,400
Okay, see you later.

934
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,960
Mr. Xu.

935
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,870
I can let people in

936
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,310
if they say they know you?

937
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,680
Of course not.

938
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,860
Whoever comes to the celebration

939
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,350
must have an invitation.

940
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,750
Keep this in mind. Otherwise I'll fire you.

I didn't recognize you.

944
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,510
I thought it was some celebrity

945
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,870
who was greeting me.

946
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,470
You lawyers are good at flattering girls.

947
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,680
Lawyers' words are based on facts.

00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,130

00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,860
Show your invitation.

952
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,030
Mr. Xu said

953
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,950
no one can enter without an invitation.

954
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,070
I'll be fired if I just let you in.

955
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,630
Can I bring someone with me with this invitation?

956
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,930
Yes.

957
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,400
Then let him in.

958
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,250
Hello.

959
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,050
Thank you for bringing me in.

960
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,080
You're welcome.

961
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,190
Thank you.

962
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,200
You're welcome.

963
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,920
Let's have a drink.

964
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,110
I don't drink with strangers.

965
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,540
People who can come here

966
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,970
are all very good people.

967
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,430
You don't even have an invitation.

968
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,630
Are you a fraud?

969
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,920
You can see me as a fraud.

970
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,310
There are so many pretty girls here.

971
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,840
You should flirt with them.

972
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,280
As you said,

973
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,480
there are so many beautiful girls here.

974
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,590
Why can't I stay with you?

975
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,120
Cheers.

976
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,720
Sorry.

977
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,200

978
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:25,290
