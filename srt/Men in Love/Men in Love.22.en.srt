[Episode 22]

4
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,560
I'm already here. Where are you?

5
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,030
Is your girlfriend here yet?

6
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,030
I have something to do later.

7
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,190
I need to go to my friend.

8
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,910
Tell your girlfriend for me.

9
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,130
Auntie.

10
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,510
Why did you assume that I had something to do with him?

11
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,470
Don't say that.

12
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,170
This is a famous model.

13
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,740
Tong Yiwen!

14
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,090
I can't believe

15
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,990
I can see the woman here.

16
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,280
Why are you looking at me?

17
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,230
Who are you?

18
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,440
Jialin.

19
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,470
You're here.

20
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,940
Brother.

21
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,660
My girlfriend.

22
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,930
My sister, Jialin.

23
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,790
Do you know each other?

24
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,460
Of course.

25
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,130
Aren't you…

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,410
the model I saw on TV that day,

27
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,430
Tong Yiwen?

28
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,140
Have a seat.

29
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,210
Hi, Jiacheng's sister.

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,210
I'm Yiwen.

31
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,160
Nice to meet you.

32
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,010
Hello, I'm Xu Jialin.

33
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,390
You must try their steak.

34
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,100
Their steak is very good.

35
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,060
Here.

36
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,450
Brother.

37
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,610
That piece is too fat.

38
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,550
Aren't you on a diet?

39
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,950
You need to eat lean meat.

40
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,030
This piece is perfect for you.

41
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,320
Eat it while it's hot.

42
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,760
I need to take a call.

43
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,310
Enjoy your meal.

44
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,350
I let you go.

45
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,480
You know that, right?

46
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,870
It won't do you any good if my brother knows

47
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,150
you're a girl who loves bars.

48
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,360
I appreciate your kindness.

49
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,430
But…

50
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,410
I don't care.

51
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,020
I don't think your brother cares, either.

52
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,640
You don't care?

53
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,000
Then why did you put up a show just now?

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,530
You thought you could be the best female lead?

55
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,030
Your brother knows

56
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,240
I'm not a dutiful stay-at-home wife and mother.

57
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,350
So,

58
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,610
you must be afraid he'll find out you were out at a bar.

59
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,670
That's why you put up the show with me.

60
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,940
I knew my first impression was right.

61
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,630
Tong Yiwen, you're such a jinx.

62
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,100
Talk nicely.

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,810
If you want me to keep your secret,

64
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,820
shut up.

65
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,720
Why is it my brother?

66
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,390
You don't lack for pursuers, do you?

67
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,790
Why don't you find a young and handsome man?

68
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,610
Do you want our family's money?

69
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,880
I advise you not to talk.

70
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,570
Shut up.

71
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,690
Otherwise, I won't keep your secret.

72
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:48,659
What can you do?

73
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,070
I can't do anything.

74
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,040
I just hope that you can put on a smile

75
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,180
when your brother comes back

76
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,950
so that I can buy you a cup of coffee.

77
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,800
Okay.

78
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,890
I'll reject you politely.

79
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,190
Anyway, I don't want to spend another second with you

80
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,950
just like you.

81
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,770
I have an appointment with my friend. I'm leaving.

82
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,870
Have some more fat.

83
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,320
I hope you'll get fat!

84
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,940
When Jialin came, she told me

85
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,300
she had something to do and had to go early.

86
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,980
Don't take it to heart.

87
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,740
She has always been like that.

88
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,340
She's spoiled by our family.

89
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,730
I didn't.

90
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,560
How could I be so petty?

91
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,920
I saw you two…

92
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,720
I think she has a good personality.

93
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,550
I prefer to be with someone like her,

94
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,360
compared to those

95
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,170
who hide everything in their heart.

96
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,720
Do you really think so?

97
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,480
Yes.

98
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,270
That's good.

99
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,920
Do you want anything else?

100
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,950
I'm full.

101
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,830
I'll pay the bill first.

102
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,080
Take your time.

103
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,910
Tong Yiwen.

104
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,290
Hello.

105
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,670
I wanted to say hello

106
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,730
at the party that day.

107
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,660
I didn't expect you to leave early.

108
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,900
Your dress

109
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,210
is beautiful.

110
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,120
Very unique.

111
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,810
Thank you.

112
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,360
Have a seat.

113
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,830
You're a popular model now.

114
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,090
Why are you still worried?

115
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,130
Models are supposed to be young.

116
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,830
Look at Tong Yiwen now.

117
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:42,020
I heard that Tong Yiwen was going to terminate the contract

118
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,280
and quit being a model.

119
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,820
Who knows?

120
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,470
I don't know if she can afford

121
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,150
the penalty.

122
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,360
I don't understand

123
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,960
why she wants to terminate the contract with the company.

124
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,540
The company treats her well.

125
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,650
Yeah.

126
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,190
The restroom is over here.

127
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:56,909
Let's go.

128
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,670
Back then,

129
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,310
I was pissed off.

130
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,250
I designed it,

131
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,580
but he included it in his work of the season.

132
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,710
And my name

133
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,090
wasn't even mentioned.

134
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,150
I was little known.

135
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,470
He went too far.

136
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,190
His inspiration was exhausted at that time.

137
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,760
He could only exploit the designers of his company.

138
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,280
And

139
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,350
he wouldn't give anyone a chance to get promoted.

140
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,880
Why wouldn't you quit?

141
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,710
So, I cut all three of

142
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,270
my elaborately designed outfits

143
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,690
at the backstage of the show.

144
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,360
Then, I was fired.

145
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,050
Awesome.

146
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,110
What are you talking about?

147
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,020
Let me introduce you two.

148
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,940
I know him.

149
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,850
Eric.

150
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,400
Your work has been very popular recently.

151
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,260
I'm flattered.

152
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,370
I'm Xu Jiacheng.

153
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,950
Hello.

154
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,300
The boss of "Declaration."

155
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,620
I read your magazine a lot.

156
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,590
I'm a loyal reader.

157
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,690
It's an honor.

158
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,220
We didn't meet at the party last time.

159
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,020
I didn't expect to meet you here.

160
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,909
What a coincidence.

161
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,159
I had an appointment with some friends

162
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,500
and ran into Yiwen.

163
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,830
You had a good chat.

164
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,270
We've only met for the second time,

165
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,270
but it feels like we're old friends.

166
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,770
Actually, we...

167
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,910
Sorry, I called a designated driver.

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,440
I won't bother you, then.

169
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,680
See you later.

170
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,380
Okay.

171
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,470
President Xu.

172
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,260
There's a long way to go.

173
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,370
I hope we can work together someday.

174
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,730
Of course.

175
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,090
Why are you here again?

176
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,530
Don't you like the place you live now?

177
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,240
A little…

178
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,160
depressing.

179
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,150
Depressing?

180
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,940
Jiacheng's family is like a manor. Is it still depressing?

181
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,070
It seems that Jialin is torturing you.

182
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,370
How could that be?

183
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,090
I think

184
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,500
it's me

185
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,420
who's torturing Jiacheng.

186
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,640
Did something happen between you two?

187
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,560
It didn't feel right just now.

188
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,570
You can tell it?

189
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,690
If I couldn't even see this,

190
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,120
do you think our relationship

191
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,470
would be so harmonious?

192
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,780
Really?

193
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,570
Normally,

194
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,980
when two people have conflicts,

195
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,160
the third person will come out to play the peacemaker.

196
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,190
I'm different.

197
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,670
I'm a weathercock.

198
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,120
I turn to you when I'm in front of you,

199
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,310
and I turn to Jiacheng when I'm in front of him.

200
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,920
So, both of you will think

201
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,820
I'm on the same side as you.

202
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,900
And our relationship will be better.

203
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,790
So,

204
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,640
whose side are you on?

205
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,340
I...

206
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,040
I'm on my side.

207
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,540
And I think my judgment is always right.

208
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,850
I'm the smartest among us, after all.

209
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,070
For so many years,

210
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,480
it's the first time

211
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,280
that I think you're the smartest.

212
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,150
So,

213
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,720
as the smart guy,

214
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,180
I have a sincere suggestion for you.

215
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,340
Love is the most important thing.

216
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,960
I hope you can ask yourself

217
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,490
what you think,

218
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,800
not what Jiacheng thinks.

219
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,110
I'm serious.

220
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,550
Sometimes, being selfish is not a bad thing.

221
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,550
At least you can be happier.

222
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,150
As a friend,

223
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,640
I hope you can be happy.

224
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,190
Rest early.

225
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,160
I'm going back.

226
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,310
Don't take Jialin's matter to heart.

227
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,160
Are you jealous?

228
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,370
No.

229
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,930
Who am I jealous of?

230
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:58,870
Why would I be jealous of him?

231
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,630
So funny.

232
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,100
How do you know who I'm talking about?

233
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,220
And you said you weren't jealous.

234
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,330
He just praised me for my beautiful dress.

235
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,690
I did, too.

236
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,710
I also praised you for being pretty.

237
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,470
But you never praised

238
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,470
the dress I designed.

239
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,490
The dress designed by Miss Tong Yiwen

240
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,080
is unique.

241
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,650
Xu Jiacheng likes it very much.

242
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,380
Happy?

243
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,670
I like it.

244
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,240
I gotta go.

245
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:25,940
Bye.

246
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,610
Bye.

This is the time

253

when you found the payment on my phone.

254
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,370
Look.

255
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,660
I was going to check in.

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,750
Not yet.

257
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,110
Ye Han kicked you first.

258
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,730
Then, you patted Ye Han's shoulder.

259
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,290
How...

260
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,470
How did you know?

261
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,170
If I didn't love you,

262
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,750
I wouldn't have gone to the hotel owner

263
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,820
and asked for the surveillance footage.

264
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,990
People might think

265
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,470
I keep an eye on my husband every day

266
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,950
and may gossip about me.

267
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,380
But

268
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,890
it must have taken you a lot

269
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,650
to get the video, right?

But no matter what I did,

277
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,620
I couldn't get close to you,

278
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,240
not even a little bit.

279
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,750

she had a blind date who was 2 years younger than her.

There's more than one blind date. Look.

The one who was 2 years younger was not enough. She still needed someone who was 4 years younger.

Could there be more

570
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,680
That's just courtesies.

571
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,280
Do you want to have dinner with him?

572
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,830
Of course…

573
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,060
I don't.

574
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,310
Of course not.

575
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,490
Then why didn't you introduce me to him?

576
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,110
It's not important.

577
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,370
I mean him.

578
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,010
Are you jealous?

579
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,290
Jealous?

580
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,260
How is that possible?

581
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,160
Being jealous

582
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,850
is an act of very childish men.

583
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,280
A mature man like me

584
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,100
has seen all kinds of hardships.

585
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,620
How could I be jealous?

586
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:56,860
Fine.

587
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,010
So, you're here...

588
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,400
To see you, of course.

589
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,440
Now that we've met,

590
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,210
I'm going back to work.

591
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,810
Why are you still here?

592
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,660
The company has agreed to terminate the contract.

593
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:30,070
You just need to sign the termination contract,

594
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,190
and you'll be free.

595
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,070
Okay.

596
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,210
Have you decided what to do next?

597
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,410
After this, it's my own life.

598
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,830
I'll make a good plan

599
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,580
and be responsible for myself.

600
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,900
I wish you a smooth journey ahead.

601
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,850
Thank you.

602
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,630
Bei.

603
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,240
Actually,

604
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,990
we've been working together for so many years.

605
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,800
I've brought you a lot of trouble.

606
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,570
I sincerely want to

607
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,730
thank you.

608
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,590
You've worked hard these years.

609
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,360
I hope you can continue to be so lucky.

610
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,290
Go now.

611
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,280
My car is downstairs.

612
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,550
The driver is waiting for you inside.

613
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,580
Don't try to run away again.

614
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,940
Do you think you can hide

615
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,720
the fact that you asked Mr. Sun for help?

616
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
Can you hide it from your mother?

617
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,380
All these years,

618
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,870
you've always wanted to be independent.

619
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,190
You didn't even want our family to help you

620
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,510
when you had so much trouble

621
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,600
starting your own business.

622
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,510
How could you beg others for a woman?

623
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,780
What about your pride?

624
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,320
What about your principle?

625
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,360
She drags you down all the time

626
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,220
Is she really a match for you?

627
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,730
Let me tell you.

628
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,400
You have to

629
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,140
go to the blind date today

630
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,360
whether you want it

631
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,410
or not.

632
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,320
Auntie.

633
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,800
Actually,

634
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,310
Jiacheng is...

635
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,390
Shut up.

636
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,930
I'm teaching my son a lesson.

637
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,530
I'll go, okay?

638
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,330
That's right.

639
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,520
Because you're not good enough,

640
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,470
I have to beg

641
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,160
all my friends

642
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,900
to choose these girls for you.

643
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,680
Alright, Mom, stop it.

644
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,600
I'll go now.

645
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,040
What's that attitude?

646
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,790
Who did he learn it from?

647
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,280
Probably

648
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,510
from the other two.

649
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,550
Auntie,

650
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,790
it occurred to me that I had something to do.

651
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,190
I gotta go.

652
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,190
Wait a minute.

653
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:07,990
Don't leave.

654
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,820
Listen.

655
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,410
You should just sit here

656
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,400
before Jiacheng comes back.

657
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,680
You can't go anywhere.

658
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,990
I've been practicing piano since I was a kid.

659
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,710
But I liked jazz in middle school.

660
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,070
I remember my mom found out

661
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,800
when I practiced jazz secretly

662
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,510
and got beaten up.

663
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,950
It's fine that she didn't hit me.

664
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,910
But the fact that she hit me

665
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,760
made me more rebellious.

666
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,390
So, later,

667
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,070
I played Chopin's Etude

668
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,390
in the style of jazz at a competition.

669
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,250
The 25th Etude.

670
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,920
And then?

671
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,030
One word.

672
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,840
Terrible.

673
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,190
At least you won spiritually.

674
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,310
So,

675
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,540
you lost?

676
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,250
What do you mean?

677
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,200
Judging from your look,

678
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,230
you must have lost the fight with your mom.

679
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,560
That's why you came on a blind date, right?

680
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,050
Don't feel sorry.

681
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,340
I was forced here, too.

682
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,030
Here's the thing.

683
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,870
I like my girlfriend very much,

684
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,080
but my family is against it.

685
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,190
That's great.

686
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,190
Let's just say

687
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,400
I don't like you on this blind date.

688
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,830
In my experience,

689
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,700
you'll have no future trouble

690
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,460
if I don't like you at this time.

691
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,760
Thank you.

692
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,450
I won't forget

693
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,680
your kindness today.

694
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,150
I had a good chat with you today.

695
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:46,990
Well,

696
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,470
I'm leaving.

697
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,450
Bye.

698
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,820
Bye.

699
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,480
-Sorry, I'm late today.
-You scared me.

700
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,530
This meal is on me.

701
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,760
Thank you.

702
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:13,770
By the way,

703
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,270
I went to

704
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,550
AU's show,

705
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,550
but I didn't get to say hello to you.

706
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,640
It's okay.

707
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,320
Everyone knows you're busy.

708
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,380
What project have you been busy with recently?

709
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,250
Are you still working as a career woman?

710
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,610
Don't mention it.

711
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,470
My mom has been nagging me lately.

712
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,760
She told me

713
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,200
if I didn't get married,

714
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,480
I shouldn't come to the company anymore.

715
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,120
She's threatening you?

716
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,400
Now, I'm being urged to go on blind dates every day.

717
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,850
I'm going crazy right now.

718
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,200
I just finished a blind date before I came.

719
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,420
What do you think of him?

720
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,550
You can think about him if he's not bad.

721
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,470
He's not bad.

722
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,860
But

723
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,430
I don't feel anything.

724
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,800
And I heard

725
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,590
that his mother seemed to be anxious, too.

726
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,320
But she's also very demanding.

727
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:58,990
Now,

728
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,850
she's looking for a girlfriend for his son.

729
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,260
It sounds like your moms get along.

730
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,040
You're right!

731
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,030
My mom

732
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,590
has spas, coffee, and tea

733
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,440
at their hotel every day.

734
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,170
And what?

735
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,520
Now, she is

736
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,310
a good friend of his mother's.

737
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:15,920
And

738
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,300
they asked us to go on a blind date.

739
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,810
Why does your mom always go to the hotel?

740
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,250
Because they run a hotel.

741
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,110
Zeus Hotel.

742
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,550
What's wrong?

743
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,870
Nothing.

744
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,970
It sounds like you two are a good match.

745
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,040
It's all right.

746
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,090
There is no chemistry between us, so what can I do about it,

747
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,060
right?

748
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:53,970
Hello?

749
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,270
Hello? Where are you?

750
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,130
I'm at home.

751
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,570
I'll go pick you up.

752
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,530
I'm going over there now at the right time.

753
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,230
Don't worry.

754
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,270
It's too much trouble.

755
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,740
I'll go with my friend later.

756
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,650
Your friend?

757
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,830
Didn't you say you wanted to introduce a girlfriend to Xu Yan?

758
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,440
I'll bring her there later.

759
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,220
Okay.

760
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,120
See you later.

761
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,270
You haven't done yet?

762
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,370
You're half the star today.

763
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,060
Don't be late for your boyfriend's birthday.

764
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,070
Okay.

765
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,510
Chop chop.

766
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,310
I'll go now.

767
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,240
[Happy birthday]

768
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,170
Put it on.

769
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,610
It's your 80th birthday.

770
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,360
Bro.

771
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,190
I...

772
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,820
I'm eighteen, okay?

773
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,650
Don't mess around.

774
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,640
Where is Xiaoxiao?

775
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,390
She's coming.

776
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,160
Where's Yiwen?

777
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,310
She's on her way.

778
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,890
What about Yiwen's friend?

779
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,840
Yiwen's friend is a date for Xu Yan.

780
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,200
Why are you so excited?

781
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,310
Yun is not here. Don't be cocky.

782
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,390
Set up the wine.

783
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,410
We're here.

784
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,850
Xiaoxiao.

785
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,410
Happy birthday, Jiacheng.

786
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,180
Thank you.

787
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,310
You even brought me a gift.

788
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,150
Thank you.

789
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,990
Why are you here, too?

790
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,990
Can't I come to your birthday party?

791
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,780
Happy birthday.

792
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:09,449
Thank you.

793
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,850
Have a seat.

794
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,630
Why are you two here together?

795
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,889
Do you know each other?

796
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:18,520
We know each other very well.

797
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,540
But I know Shengyun better.

798
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,159
We know each other well, right?

799
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,150
Sit down.

800
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,989
Don't wait for them.

801
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:28,110
Let's have a drink.

802
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:28,989
Cheers.

803
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:29,870
Cheers.

804
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,440
Happy birthday to Jiacheng.

805
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:34,510
Happy birthday.

806
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,030
Thank you, guys.

807
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,440
Jialin.

808
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,469
Don't drink too much.

809
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,429
I made an exception for you today.

810
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,389
Go home soon.

811
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,880
I'll leave early even if you don't tell me.

812
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,080
I just want to

813
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,000
say happy birthday to you.

814
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,470
Sorry.

815
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,300
We're late because of the traffic.

816
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,070
You're here.

817
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,380
Sit here.

818
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:04,960
You sit.

819
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:05,950
I'll sit here.

820
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,000
Let me introduce you guys.

821
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,310
This is the owner of a beauty shop,

822
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,910
my best friend, Yang Xue'er.

823
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,080
-Hello, everyone.
-Hello.

824
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,920
This is my best friend, Xiaoxiao,

825
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,920
and her boyfriend, Ye Han.

826
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,080
-Hello.
-Hello.

827
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,860
This is Jiacheng, the birthday boy.

828
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,390
Hello.

829
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,040
Happy birthday.

830
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,080
And his sister.

831
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,860
This is...

832
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,650
Lu Zheng.

833
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,080
My wife is not here.

834
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,020
This is your main goal today,

835
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:27,850
Xu Yan.

836
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,670
Hello, nice to meet you. My name is Xue'er.

837
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,020
Hello, nice to meet you. My name is Xu Yan.

838
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,970
It's a couple's gathering today.

839
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,180
You two, and you two.

840
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,620
Whose girlfriend is she?

841
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,790
You have a bad memory

842
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,320
because of your age, right?

843
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,660
She just introduced me.

844
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,830
I'm the birthday boy's sister.

845
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,780
Sister?

846
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,020
Hello.

847
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,140
Isn't today my brother's birthday party?

848
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,780
Why is a stranger here?

849
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,270
Isn't that what friends are like? You get familiar little by little.

850
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,660
What's wrong with that?

851
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,530
It's okay

852
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,290
if you're here to make friends.

853
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,510
But if you're here for a blind date...

854
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,540
Jialin.

855
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,350
What?

856
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,960
Am I wrong?

857
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,150
Go home first.

858
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,920
Why should I go home?

859
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,530
Didn't you hear me?

860
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,630
I told you to go home now.

861
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,000
I won't leave.

862
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,920
Are you going to kick me out

863
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,750
just because I like Xu Yan

864
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,970
and I'm in the way of their blind date?

865
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,280
-Jiacheng.
-Jiacheng.

866
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,610
-Jiacheng.
-Jiacheng.

867
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,300
Let go of me.

868
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,420
I'm not leaving.

869
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,230
Let go.

870
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,700
You can talk to me.

871
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,120
I'll listen on behalf of Jialin.

872
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,950
Enough.

873
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,840
It's your birthday.

874
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,860
What are you doing?

875
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,790
Jialin.

876
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,740
Let's go.

877
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,570
Go.

878
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,780
I'm sorry, today...

879
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
-We're leaving.
-It's a bit sudden.

880
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,070
Let me see you off.

881
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,070
-Jiacheng.
-I'm fine.

882
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:40,990
I'm sorry.

883
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,110
Xiaoxiao.

884
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,230
You brought me here for fun,

885
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,820
but I ruined the birthday party.

886
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,170
You've grown up.

887
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,400
You are already so sad,

888
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,810
but you still worry about others.

889
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,650
Am I ugly now?

890
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,810
My eyeliner is messed up.

891
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,600
The ingredients of tears are not only water.

892
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,680
Of course your makeup would be messed up.

893
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,890
What else is there?

894
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,620
Sadness, longing, grievances,

895
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,840
and so on.

896
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,890
No matter how good the cosmetics are, they can't resist them.

897
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,460
Stop talking nonsense.

898
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:15,690
Just

899
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,800
comfort her.

900
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,390
Let me take her home.

901
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,260
I can comfort her with my actions.

902
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,160
I don't want to go home.

903
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,820
I don't want to see that jerk, Xu Jiacheng.

904
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,780
Don't say that about your brother.

905
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,950
How about this?

906
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,250
Come to my place today.

907
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,960
I'll take care of her.

908
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,140
Is that okay?

909
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,010
I'll listen to my girlfriend.

910
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,780
Here.

911
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,720
Sorry.

912
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,510
Jiacheng.

913
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,980
I should say sorry, too.

914
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,270
But I can only say this.

915
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,290
Xu Yan, I trust you.

916
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,170
Please understand me.

917
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,440
I understand you.

918
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,400
I understand you.

919
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,040
But...

920
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,490
Do you understand me?

921
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,370
I fell in love with Jialin.

922
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,470
I don't want to lie to you.

923
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
So,

924
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,130
don't blame Jialin anymore.

925
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,800
It's enough

926
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,820
that I'm the one who hurt her.

927
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,990
Don't be sad.

928
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,150
Have some water.

929
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,600
You're back.

930
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,860
I'm back.

931
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,070
Why are you here?

932
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,590
Now I even have to

933
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,910
take care of Jiacheng's sister?

934
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,390
I'll take care of her.

935
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,580
Shanghai is so big.

936
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,740
Why can't I escape my brother's grip?

937
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,180
I finally found a place to hide.

938
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,240
But it's my brother's girlfriend's house.

939
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:43,040
Why is she my brother's girlfriend

940
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,750
instead of her?

941
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,440
Stop talking nonsense.

942
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,530
Use water

943
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,000
to shut your mouth.

944
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,180
If I knew you like Mr. Xu,

945
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,870
I wouldn't have introduced him to a girlfriend.

946
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,430
Do you think

947
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,330
you can repair the damage by saying so?

948
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,980
You're just like my brother.

949
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,410
You're all in this.

950
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,950
What's wrong with you?

951
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,270
His sister likes a man

952
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,870
who is ten years older than her and was once married.

953
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,940
Which big brother would

954
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,370
leave his sister to this kind of man

955
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,770
and wish them happiness?

956
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,660
He doesn't like the person I like.

957
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,550
I don't like the person he likes, either!

958
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,310
What did I say?

959
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,630
Enough.

960
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,980
Stop it.

961
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,470
She's been

962
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,230
working out.

963
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,780
Do you want a beating?

964
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,770
Xiaoxiao.

965
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,750
All right.

966
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,480
Don't be sad.

967
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,040
I sent Jialin to Xiaoxiao's house.

968
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,410
She'll stay there tonight.

969
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,370
Don't worry.

970
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,970
Thank you.

971
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,590
Yiwen and her friends

972
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,320
should be sent back by Lu Zheng.

973
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,310
Okay, I got it.

974
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,570
Are you home?

975
00:41:58,830 --> 00:41:59,710
What

976
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,120
did you talk about?

977
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,670
Nothing.

978
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,990
Xu Yan has nowhere to go tonight.

979
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,900
I don't know where he'll stay.

980
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,140
Go ask him.

981
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,620
Don't worry about that.

982
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,930
He's a grown man.

983
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,500
He can find a place to stay.

984
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,010
Leave him alone.

985
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,690
Ye Han.

986
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,050
I've never seen Xu Yan like that.

987
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,440
You know

988
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,040
he is the calmest among the four of us.

989
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,170
I can feel that Jialin is interested in him.

990
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,550
But the way he looked at me today...

991
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,280
I was worried.

992
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,280
He also fell in love with Jialin.

993
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,370
It's hard for him not to fall

994
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,950
when Jialin is so determined.
