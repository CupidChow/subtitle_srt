Yiwen.

192
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,530
You don't have to do this.

193
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,010
I won't give up.

194
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,750
I finally met you today.

195
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,030
As long as I can see you, it'll be fine.

196

Even if you reject me 100 times,

[Hi, Shanghai]

200
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,710
Compared to yesterday,

201
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,230
December 31

202
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,710
is a very normal day.

203
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,520
But people give this day a special meaning.

204
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,559
The last day of the year

205
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:38,169
is also the easiest day to remember.

206

♫Even the air is silent♫

207
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,870
♫There's no place for my heart to hide♫

♫It still hurts♫

216

On December 31 every year,

217
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,830
I go to the Bund to countdown.

Liking someone

222
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,200
is tough.

223
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,780
♫You know it's true♫

224
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,890
Sometimes, you'll be missed.

225
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,180

♫Memories are endless♫

227
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,900
you'll be ignored.

Other times,

229
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,770
you can never get the answer you want.

230
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,960

♫But why♫

232
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,290

♫We've been with each other♫

235
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,670

♫But why can't we have each other?♫

238
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,320

Two, she'll hate me more.

Three, I'll never be able to see her again.

♫I'll see this through♫

Five.

248
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,170

Two.

Happy New Year.

256
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,840
Is this a chance encounter?

257
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,100
No.

258
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,490
How did you find me?

259
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,000
Because I didn't hesitate.

260
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,160
Don't hesitate.

261
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,340
That's the wish I made under the wishing tree.

262
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,410
I know you've thought about it for a long time

263
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,820
and rejected me.

264
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,080
But now,

265
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,580
I still want to say my first new year's resolution.

266
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,480
From now on,

267
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,580
I'm going to start a secret crush on someone.

268
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,040
That person is you,

269
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,910
Li Xiaoxiao.

270
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,460
I'll assume you

271
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,440
heard that.

272
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,450
I must have heard it wrong.

273
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,160
You didn't.

274
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,560
You said

275
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,310
you wanted to love me secretly?

276
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,110
But secret loves

277
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,260
should be kept in your heart, shouldn't they?

278
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,390
That's your way of loving secretly.

279
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
My way is different from yours.

280
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,600
You know

281
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,110
you're a weirdo, right?

282
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,610
I know.

283
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,410
But you don't have to do anything.

284
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,250
Just support me.

285
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,800
Support you?

286
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,560
Support you

287
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,720
to love me secretly?

288
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,870
Yes.

289
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,720
Cheer me on

290
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,600
sometimes.

291
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,770
Happy New Year.

292
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,510
Happy New Year.

293
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,060
Happy New Year!

294
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,470
How have you been?

295
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,320
I'm fine.

296
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,210
I'm not very good.

297
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,390
I've been thinking a lot lately.

298
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,560
Tong Yiwen.

299
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,630
I'm serious.

300
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,070
I like you.

301
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,780
I like your directness

302
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,290
and your candor.

303
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,230
I even like every moment

304
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,830
that you find embarrassing.

305
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,280
I think about you every day.

306
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,450
I never doubted you about that.

307
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,080
You never thought about getting married, right?

308
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,140
Why do you ask?

309
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,700
I met two girls

310
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,290
who were talking about you at the drinking session.

311
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,120
One of the girls' friends

312
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,430
dated you before.

313
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,290
She said

314
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,000
you broke up with her

315
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,680
once she brought up marriage.

316
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,130
I admit that

317
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,060
at this stage,

318
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,140
I've never considered marriage.

319
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,870
But I'm not someone

320
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,350
who would break up with someone

321
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,550
just because they brought up marriage.

322
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,300
Then let me ask you now.

323
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,450
Will you marry me?

324
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,930
I'm sorry. I can't answer you.

325
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,830
I don't want to make empty promises

326
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,420
just because I want you to be with me.

327
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,710
And I don't want to lie to you.

328
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,220
I also like your honesty.

329
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,880
This is your life.

330
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,420
You have your own views.

331
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,470
I won't force my views onto you

332
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,110
like your mother.

333
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,880
Actually,

334
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,240
I used to think the same way.

335
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,230
I don't understand why

336
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,160
people have to date with a purpose.

337
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,920
But I don't think that way anymore.

338
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,480
Because

339
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,030
I've had enough of the joys and sorrows of love

340
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,790
and its uncertainty.

341
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,710
I don't want to waste our time

342
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,290
because I know

343
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,250
we will eventually break up

344
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,720
because of our different goals.

345
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,440
I can see the pain.

346
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,990
I like how things are now.

347
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,950
I like you taking me to the aquarium.

348
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,230
I like the hairy crabs you gave me.

349
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,000
Maybe it's related to my family.

350
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,630
I'm too afraid of loss.

351
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,510
So,

352
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,480
I'd rather not have it in the first place.

353
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,090
Jiacheng,

354
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,070
I liked you.

355
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,599
Happy New Year.

356
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,119
Happy New Year.

357
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Yiwen.

358
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,800
Why are you sitting here?

359
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,340
Did you celebrate New Year's Eve together?

360
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,600
We bumped into each other.

361
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,590
Thank you for sending me home.

362
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,680
Go home first.

363
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,950
Take care.

364
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,050
I'm going back.

365
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,230
Ye Han.

366
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,390
Can I ask you for a favor?

367
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,760
This "appearance" will erase the pain of your breakup.

368
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,820
Because your brothers

369
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,630
will always stand by you.

370
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,300
This is a box of fireworks.

371
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,230
It will take away all your sorrows.

372
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,850
Take my Sugar-coated haws.

373
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,040
From now on,

374
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,790
your life will be all but sweet.

375
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,270
A bunch of idiots.

376
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,830
Who are you calling idiots?

377
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,050
I didn't expect

378
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,130
that you'd come to the internet cafe after you broke up.

379
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,320
Are you playing alone?

380
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,390
Hero Xu.

381
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,000
Little Shrimp

382
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,330
will be mad.

383
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,380
It's the new year.

384
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,980
You can't be alone.

385
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,240
Right.

386
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:30,910
You're playing alone?

387
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,190
-Enough.
-Are you playing alone?

388
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,710
What's going on?

389
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,760
I suddenly feel like

390
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,120
I'm really an adult.

391
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,630
Just now,

392
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,070
I went through an adult breakup.

393
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,270
It was a clean and decisive breakup.

394
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,400
Really decisive.

395
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,760
Neither of you is wrong.

396
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,060
You both have your own convictions.

397
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,780
It's good to be decisive.

398
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,230
In the adult world,

399
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,090
you can't afford to be otherwise.

400
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,120
Yes.

401
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,870
I'm not the only one in the world who broke up anyway.

402
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,280
There are so many people with me.

403
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,880
Why should I be hurt?

404
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,880
But knowing that everyone has experienced a breakup

405
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,720
doesn't comfort me.

406
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,540
Every breakup

407
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,630
makes you feel the pain again.

408
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,770
Happy New Year,

409
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,050
guys.

410
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,010
Right.

411
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,120
Today is the first day of the new year.

412
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,940
What are we doing?

413
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,060
Let's leave all the unhappiness behind.

414
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,000
Today is the new year's day.

415
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,090
A new day.

416
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,620
Happy New Year.

417
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,390
They all look like traitors.

418
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,790
What are you looking at?

419
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,850
Looking at my sons.

420
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,560
Our first dawn as 33-year-olds is approaching.

421
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,970
But we're still at such a loss

422
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,090
on how to deal with our friend's pain.

423
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,020
We'll remember this morning forever.

424
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,710
Some people finished something

425
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,110
while some others just started something.

426
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,040
What are you doing here so early in the morning?

427
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,080
I'm loving you secretly.

428
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
You can ignore me.

429
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,490
Why don't you look at me?

430
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,830
Why are you acting like a little girl?

431
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,270
Did you draw this line?

432
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,410
Yes.

433
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,110
This is a line

434
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,500
I can't cross.

435
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,070
That's what having a crush is like.

436
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,570
You can only observe your crush from afar.

437
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,390
You can't approach them at will.

438
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,360
You want to love me secretly, yet you told me about it.

439
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,990
Now, you're even acting.

440
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,670
You're the one being loved.

441
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,690
How can you understand my feelings?

442
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,970
I got hurt by you again just now.

443
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,880
I'm sure you didn't know.

444
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,900
But it can't be helped.

445
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,560
That's how low one stoops to when having a crush.

446
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,270
Your acting

447
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,800
is getting better.

448
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,530
Check your phone.

449
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,550
What did you send?

450
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,660
[Coffee Coupon for all our products]

451
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,150
A coffee coupon?

452
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:26,810
Yes.

453
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,040
You can use it on cold or hot drinks.

454
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,350
You can drink whatever you want after exercising.

455
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,930
Normally in this situation,

456
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,970
you should have bought it and sent it to me.

457
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,260
If I bought it and sent it here to you,

458
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,080
you would feel embarrassed.

459
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,120
Loving someone secretly

460
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
requires such deep consideration.

461
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,510
Interesting.

462
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,980
Actually,

463
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,870
I have a lot more

464
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,090
that I'd like to say to you.

465
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,330
But I have to leave.

466
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,680
Because secret love

467
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,290
should be so silent.

468
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,390
Consultation?

469
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,230
What do you need to consult me about?

470
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,260
Well,

471
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,820
you are an absolute authority in this aspect.

472
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,860
What aspect?

473
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,150
Having a secret crush on someone.

474
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,210
It's the first time

475
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,880
I was loved secretly by someone.

476
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,140
You mean

477
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,460
your friend?

478
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,090
Yes.

479
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,320
My friend

480
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:34,710
has been

481
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,150
troubled by this.

482
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,640
I want to consult you on her behalf.

483
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,350
Because

484
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,720
you are an absolute authority on this issue.

485
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,590
In the past ten years,

486
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,190
Jialin has had a crush on you.

487
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,510
But why do you want to ask about that?

488
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,140
Because I

489
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,420
have a crush on someone, too.

490
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,300
You're over 30, and you still have a crush?

491
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,110
I don't know if I can help you.

492
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,990
What do you want to consult about?

493
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,550
I want to ask

494
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,690
if someone has a secret crush on you,

495
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,350
shouldn't he keep it a secret?

496
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,100
You should let her know.

497
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,470
If you don't let her know,

498
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,990
she will never know.

499
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,840
Your first step was right.

500
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,770
Good job.

501
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,800
Great.

502
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:19,880
Well,

503
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,440
What about the second step?

504
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,550
You should

505
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,640
chase her for a while and then, rest for a while.

506
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,680
At first,

507
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,810
be extremely gentle and considerate.

508
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,850
Act like you would die without her.

509
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,380
Then,

510
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,280
stop contacting her suddenly.

511
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,640
She hasn't contacted me these few days.

512
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,840
I feel that it's good.

513
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,070
She needs space to think about

514
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,790
what she really wants.

515
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,100
Yes.

516
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:42,800
I...

517
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,980
My friend thinks so, too.

518
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,760
I didn't do this

519
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,930
to get him to contact me.

520
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,560
After all, I'm the one who has a crush on him.

521
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,710
When you love someone,

522
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,310
you feel really inferior.

523
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,910
If you put all your energy

524
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,390
on the other person,

525
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,580
you'll gradually lose yourself.

526
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,370
They'll feel stressed, too.

527
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,460
When I'm with my friends,

528
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,000
I find myself again.

529
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,510
When I return to Xu Yan later,

530
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,510
I can feel like we are equal.

531
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,740
All of us should figure out

532
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,220
whether the person we like

533
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,000
is the person in our imagination

534
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,710
or the real him.

535
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,720
Do you think

536
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,540
I can never leave Xu Yan,

537
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,410
and I pursue Xu Yan crazily?

538
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,750
Yes.

539
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,300
You like him so much

540
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,490
that he could call the police on you.

541
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,450
I wonder how Xu Yan became a lawyer.

542
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,630
I haven't contacted Xu Yan for three days.

543
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,630
He must miss me a little now.

544
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,860
Your friend

545
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,740
must be having a hard time lately.

546
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,760
Yes.

547
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
What do you think

548
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,690
she should do?

549
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,100
Don't let that person

550
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,890
affect your normal life.

551
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,740
Well,

552
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,760
it's not like I don't like it.

553
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,120
It's a bit complicated.

554
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,860
Then...

555
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,330
There's only one move left.

556
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,050
What?

557
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,520
Live your life.

558
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,060
As for the rest,

559
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,510
let it be.

560
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,180
[WeChat]

561
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,460
Who should I consult?

562
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,470
Today's fortune.

563
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,970
Four stars.

564
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,910
Lucky color.

565
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,440
Yellow.

566
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,710
You'll meet interesting people

567
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,440
and interesting things today.

568
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,470
You'll also hear good news about people around you.

569
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,650
With someone who likes you,

570
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,960
you should…

571
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,810
just stay calm and act normal.

572
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,480
You're closer

573
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,120
than you were yesterday.

574
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,910
Yes.

575
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,290
Because today is the second day of my crush.

576
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,820
We should be closer.

577
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,130
Then, on the third day,

578
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,810
will you wait for me at my door?

579
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,820
You never know.

580
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,310
We're getting closer like this every day.

581
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,390
What if in the end,

582
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,950
we end up in the same coffin?

583
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,330
Do you plan to

584
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,530
come here every day?

585
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,530
Not really.

586
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,530
I won't come if it rains.

587
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,690
Because this thing

588
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,000
is water-soluble.

589
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,010
It'll get washed away when it rains.

590
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,460
What are you looking at?

591
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,820
Your scarf.

592
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,090
I always thought

593
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,530
that you have great taste in dressing.

594
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,030
Yellow

595
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,450
is my lucky color.

596
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:24,390
I brought it

597
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,270
not for warmth

598
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,500
or fashion.

599
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,990
I just want to have more luck.

600
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
Give me your hand.

601
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,330
Okay.

602
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,740
Are these for me?

603
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,590
I'm afraid you'll get cold.

604
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,430
Besides,

605
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,220
these gloves are yellow, too.

606
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,570
Double luck.

607
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,190
Actually,

608
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,340
my lucky color today

609
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,370
is also yellow.

610
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,390
In order to repay you,

611
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,710
I'll take you to work today, then.

612
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,610
Let's go.

613
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,010
Can I ask you

614
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,350
something

615
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,990
as someone

616
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,530
you're having a crush on?

617
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,590
Go ahead.

618
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,290
Why do you like me?

619
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,180
I mean,

620
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,840
what do you like about me?

621
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,260
There are many things.

622
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,990
Your expression when you talk,

623
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,750
your smiling eyes,

624
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,610
your figure when you're angry,

625
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,120
your rough voice,

626
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,340
your strong biceps,

627
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,450
and your unrestrained brain.

628
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,930
Enough.

629
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,270
You are upright and don't like to trouble others.

630
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:51,220
You have a healthy mindset, and you're kind of funny.

631
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,330
That's about it.

632
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,040
This looks nice

633
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,120
hanging here.

634
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,160
I almost forgot.

635
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,820
And the way you talk nonsense

636
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,900
whenever you're nervous.

637
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,350
I'm not doing that.

638
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,070
Bye.

639
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,320
He proposed?

640
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,650
Is it beautiful?

641
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,790
Not bad.

642
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,900
I told him

643
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,730
I didn't want him to propose to me

644
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,840
after I turned 30.

645
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:33,670
So he proposed to me

646
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,230
on my last day of being 29.

647
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,530
But

648
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,230
are you really going to marry him?

649
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,120
You've only known each other

650
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,640
for less than two months.

651
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,920
Why do you care so much?

652
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,450
Hurry and congratulate me.

653
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,620
Okay.

654
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,810
Congratulations.

655
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,310
May you grow old together

656
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,500
and have a baby soon.

657
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,920
When will you hold the wedding banquet?

658
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,800
We'll see.

659
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,430
If you're in a hurry to give me wedding cash,

660
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,160
you can transfer the money now.

661
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,510
-Miss Li.
-No problem.

662
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,470
There is a package for you.

663
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,030
I brought it in for you.

664
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,990
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

665
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,030
What did you buy?

666
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:04,970
Take a look.

667
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,120
I don't remember.

668
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,470
The necklace is high-end.

669
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,710
Open it.

670
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,570
What is this?

671
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,440
What is this?

672
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,500
A whistle?

673
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,310
To celebrate your first day at work in the new year,

674
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,260
here's a whistle.

675
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,300
Interesting.

676
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,930
How is it interesting?

677
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,040
It's a whistle in a luxury necklace box.

678
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,240
This box is probably more expensive than the whistle.

679
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,030
Why are you so happy?

680
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,590
Yeah.

681
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,720
Why am I so happy?

682
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,290
I really don't understand you.

683
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm going to class.

684
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,440
[IN WORK]

685
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,880
[IN WORK]

686
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:32,730
You go first.

687
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,010
Okay, I'm leaving.

688
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,120
[IN WORK]

689
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,280
Honey, you're still up?

690
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,370
You want me to go to bed early so badly?

691
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,340
What are you talking about?

692
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,550
Was it fun?

693
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,670
What was fun?

694
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,550
Your elementary school reunion.

695
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,780
What reunion?

696
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,840
Elementary school reunion.

697
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,840
I'll have dinner

698
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,370
with my high school classmates tomorrow night.

699
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,640
I heard the pretty belle is coming, too.

700
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,920
I must go.

701
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,540
What are you talking about?

702
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,410
Why didn't I know

703
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,480
that we were having a high school reunion?

704
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,140
Oh, they're… my elementary school classmates.

705
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,050
Yes.

706
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,390
Yes.

707
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,080
My elementary school reunion.

708
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,190
Looks like none of the pretty girls were there.

709
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,850
Otherwise, you wouldn't have come back so early.

710
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:31,930
I'm here

711
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,600
to see my beautiful wife.

712
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,690
That's why I came home early.

713
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:35,490
Stop lying.

714
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,770
I'm so old.

715
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,120
Elementary school reunion.

716
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,230
Okay.

717
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,540
I have something to do.

718
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,100
I'll be back soon.

719
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,230
Where are you going?

720
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,080
Looking for my high school classmates.

721
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,880
High school classmates?

722
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,240
Today will be a romantic day.

723
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,640
Today's fortune.

724
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,990
Five stars.

725
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:58,390
Lucky color.

726
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,980
Gray.

727
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,050
Grayish blue.

728
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:05,770
Grayish dark blue.

729
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,969
Did I come down too early?

730
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,380
No.

731
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,750
What lucky color?

732
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,550
It's not accurate at all.

733
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,280
Don't ask anything.

734
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,370
I'll stay at your place for two days.

735
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,510
Also,

736
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,200
I didn't sleep all night. I need to sleep.

737
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,740
Please be quiet.

738
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,940
Mom, why are you here?

739
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,000
Why didn't you tell me?

740
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,600
I guess you haven't moved in together yet.

741
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,220
What are you talking about?

742
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,180
Aren't you in a relationship with Tong Yiwen?

743
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,310
I know all about it.

744
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,470
You know

745
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,590
I don't approve of the two of you.

746
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,790
You have to go against me, right?

747
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,870
I'm not dating her.

748
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,900
Someone saw you two dating.

749
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,580
I'll pack up and go to work.

750
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,650
What are you talking about?

751
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,970
I said you won.

752
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,430
You won.

753
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,750
I can't go to her anymore.

754
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,990
Are you satisfied?

755
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,790
Shut up, Mom.

756
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,430
Why won't you let me sleep?

757
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,810
Why do you wake up so late?

758
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,410
You've gone too far.

759
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,020
I've gone too far?

760
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,050
Go find a child who's not gone too far then.

761
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,870
How could you say that to your mom?

762
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:14,780
Listen.

763
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,390
Wash your face and come with me.

764
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,050
Don't stay with your brother.

765
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,190
No.

766
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,450
What do you mean no?

767
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,640
Pack up and go home with me. Okay?

768
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,670
In my opinion,

769
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,150
Xu Jiacheng is old.

770
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,100
Leave his love life alone.

771
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,640
What are you talking about?

772
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,790
Who's old?

773
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,690
You're not young yourself.

774
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,690
You're always dreaming anyway.

775
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:35,990
I am

776
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,910
young and beautiful now.

777
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,950
When I really get old,

778
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,470
you'll be listening to kids call you uncle.

779
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,070
Don't forget

780
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,110
whose place this is.

781
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,190
If you don't want to live here, move out.

782
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,110
Don't forget

783
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,350
who begged me to stay here.

784
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,590
I had already found a place at that time.

785
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,550
Then move out now.

786
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,830
No problem. I'll...

787
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,150
Stop arguing, okay?

788
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,200
Jialin,

789
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,950
at your age,

790
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,680
I had already married your dad.

791
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,030
And Jiacheng.

792
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,380
You

793
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,940
are already at this age,

794
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,950
yet you're still not sensible.

795
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,270
My life

796
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,370
has always been steady.

797
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,540
But because of you two, it's getting disrupted.

798
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,540
I'm old enough to have a grandchild.

799
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,820
But I don't see any signs of a grandchild.

800
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,940
-Hello.
-Hello.

801
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:44,990
Hello.

802
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:45,990
Good morning.

803
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,580
Are you done with warm-up exercises?

804
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,700
Yes.

805
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,150
Start the functional training.

806
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,720
-Okay.
-Okay.

807
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,470
Okay.

808
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,070
Sorry, miss.

809
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
That's mine.

810
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,190
Why are you checking your phone during class?

811
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,760
Yeah!

812
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,050
Sorry, I turned it off.

813
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,310
Don't you think our teacher is

814
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,460
weird today?

815
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,430
Yeah.

816
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,050
Coming.

817
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,580
Who are you?

818
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,750
Hello, Auntie.

819
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,500
I'm Xu Yan's girlfriend.

820
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:06,970
My name is Xu Jialin.

821
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,230
Xu Yan has a girlfriend?

822
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,640
This is for you.

823
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:12,970
Thank you.

824
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,920
Please come in.

825
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,110
Thank you.

826
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,480
Where's the USB?

827
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,670
I heard from Xu Yan

828
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,580
that he lives with his mom.

829
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,360
I came uninvited,

830
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,060
but I've been wanting to visit you.

831
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,260
It's okay.

832
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,830
I've been asking him if he has a girlfriend,

833
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,030
but he always said no.

834
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,700
I'm quite worried.

835
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,280
I'm really happy

836
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,380
to see you.

837
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,890
Auntie, you're so nice.

838
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,150
I was so nervous before I came today.

839
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,420
But I can tell

840
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,250
you must be Xu Yan's mother.

841
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,920
Xu Yan is so handsome.

842
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,420
He takes after you.

843
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,450
Really?

844
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,670
But actually,

845
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,730
I'm not Xu Yan's girlfriend yet.

846
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,330
He keeps rejecting me.

847
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,640
But I've always liked him.

848
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,830
Really?

849
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,800
How could he refuse such a beautiful girl?

850
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,650
I don't know.

851
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,630
Jie has been gone for years,

852
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,820
but he's still very sad.

853
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,480
My brother and I have always wanted to help him

854
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,960
get out of it.

855
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,240
I agree with you.

856
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,340
So we're on the same page, Auntie.

857
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,480
You left something behind?

858
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,360
Why are you here?

859
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,830
I'm here to see Auntie,

860
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,680
not you.

861
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,130
Let's talk outside.

862
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,360
Didn't you hear that?

863
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,830
She said she came to see me.

864
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,840
Why are you so rude to her?

865
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Besides,

866
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,740
it's not her fault that she doesn't know.

867
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,390
I'm really happy

868
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:16,870
she's here to see me.

869
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,250
Actually,

870
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,600
I'm not Xu Yan's mother.

871
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,960
I'm Jie's mother.
