00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,040
I just don't want you

193
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,560
to start a new life with that man.

194
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,650
Are you going out with that man?

195
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,060
I just had one meal with him.

196
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,280
Really?

197
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,760
You can believe me or not.

198
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,510
You won't believe me anyway.

199
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,280
What you just said

200
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,360
sounds so familiar.

201
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,800
Didn't I

202
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,000
say those words all the time in the past?

203
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,650
You didn't believe me.

204
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,170
Then let me tell you,

205
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,000
from beginning to end,

206
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,970
I only loved one woman.

207
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,090
Her name is Guo Shengyun.

208
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,640
Guo Shengyun.

209
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,200
You...

210
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,340
♫I'll be heartbroken no matter how careful I am♫

211
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,600
I don't know

212
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,960
why I fell in love with you.

213
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,690
♫Maybe you have nothing to say♫

214
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,410
You're older than me.

215
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,170
You have a worse temper than me.

216
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes, you're rich.

217
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,510
♫Our love takes a roundabout route♫

218
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,760
But I don't want your money.

219
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,680
I'm old?

220
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:30,690
♫We could only blame that we didn't have time to prepare for it♫

221
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,070
I have a bad temper?

222
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,170
We're divorced.

223
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,040
We're too close right now.

224
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,910
♫If missing is a misunderstanding♫

225
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,440
Keep a distance.

226
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,200
We shouldn't touch each other.

227
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,470
♫The contradictory emotions are also shaky♫

228
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,900
♫The traffic lights are like tears♫

♫Twinkling in my heart♫

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,240
I know you.

♫Time has stolen blossoms♫

232
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,280
You look

233
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,450
strong and tough.

234
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,650
But you have a soft heart.

235
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,120
♫Like a silent monologue♫

236
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,770
You need someone to rely on.

237
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,840
♫But my heartbeats♫

238
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,940

239
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,640
Don't act tough.

240

♫We met by chance and missed each other; I look forward to seeing you again♫

241

Don't force yourself to drink.

♫I don't dare to love even if I long to♫

243
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,880
I want to drink, understand?

244
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,160
♫But how can I forget your tenderness?♫

245
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,200
I know how much you can drink.

246
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,920
You can't drink much.

247
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,840
You'll have a stomachache if you drink too much.

248
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,500
♫Distance makes people retreat♫

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,040
Listen.

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,350
You're alone now.

♫Can I still face it if I turn around?♫

252
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,580
You need to learn to take care of yourself

253
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,640
and protect yourself.

254
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,440
In the past,

255
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,500
♫I want to hug you 'cause you're precious♫

256
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,720

♫I always doubt myself and take myself as a humble person♫

258

But now,

259
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,920
you have to rely on yourself.

♫The denial hit my sore point♫

00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,560

♫Time has stolen blossoms♫

Don't forget to eat when you are busy at work.

266
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,360
You shouldn't do that.

267
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,480
Understand?

268
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,280

Take good care of your stomach.

Stop it.

-Wake up, Guo Shengyun.

297
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,840
I want to sleep.

Explain it.

What did we do?

What do you mean?

302
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,060
Why were you sleeping in the same bed with me?

303
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,040
I remember now.

304
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,720
You made me drink yesterday.

305
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,369
Then you put me on the bed.

306
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:20,650
That's it. How could you do that?

307
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,329
I didn't make you drink.

308
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,040
You did.

309
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,319
I was asking you to stop drinking

310
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,800
all the time last night.

311
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,930
You didn't listen.

312
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,680
By the way,

313
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,960
did you kiss me first yesterday?

314
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,530
Me?

315
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,800
Did you kiss me first?

316
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,920
I think you just wanted to kiss me.

317
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,210
Tell me, you...

318
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,520
What did you do?

319
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,680
-What?
-What did you do?

320
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,880
What do you mean?

321
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,000
Okay.

322
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,520
We're adults, right?

323
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,360
Let's pretend nothing happened.

324
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,840
Good idea.

325
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,920
Nothing happened.

326
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,520
We're divorced.

327
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,690
Why did you sleep in the same bed with me?

328
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,120
Is it funny?

329
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,120
You think I wanted to sleep with you?

330
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,640
The national league is coming.

331
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,360
We have been waiting for it for a long time.

332
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Are you nervous?

333
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,640
Yes.

334
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,720
No.

335
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,840
The national league is very important

336
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,120
to you now.

337
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,200
But compared with

338
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,660
all the things that will happen in your life,

339
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,960
it's just an insignificant event.

340
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,010
I'm not saying it's not important.

341
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,330
In the coming two days,

342
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,640
your ability

343
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,600

dramatically improved.

345
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,760
So take it easy and keep working hard.

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,160
Do your best.

00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,960

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,280
-Yes.
-Yes.

349
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,240
Okay, cheer yourselves up.

350
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,520
Good luck.

351
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,130

353
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,240
I've been so busy lately.

354
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,840
Our executive editor is like you.

355
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,120
He's like a patient with serious OCD.

356
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,400
Well done.

357
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,960
How are things going with you?

358
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,250
Is everything going well?

359
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,320
Not bad.

360
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,320
But without you,

361
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,740
I feel there is something missing.

362
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,000
After so many years,

363
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,200
you finally realize how important I am.

364
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,280
During this Beijing trip,

365
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,720
I met many big shots in the industry.

366
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,720
And companies in Beijing started doing

367
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,520
electronic magazines earlier than those in Shanghai

368
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,000
and they develop faster.

369
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,530
Everyone here is talented.

370
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,410
Come on, I just praised you. Be confident.

371
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,040
I'm not saying I'm not confident.

372
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,930
I mean,

everyone here is talented,

374
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,560
but we are also great.

375
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,360
Our content is our advantage.

376
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,600

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,920
There's no sender's information.

564
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,650
We can't know who the sender is.

565
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,850
I've been really troubled lately.

566
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:08,850
It is something worth celebrating.

567
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,970
But I'm not in the mood to do that.

571
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,560
Hello?

572
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,280
Hello?

573
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,480
Ye Han.

574
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,290
I'm eating. Bye.

575
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,720
Don't hang up.

576
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,800
Can't you tell that I'm sad?

577
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,330
You are my bro.

578
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,000
Let me tell you.

579
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,760
I'm alone in the cafe.

580
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,130
What is it?

581
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,330
Guo Shengyun.

582
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,300
She went too far, you know?

583
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,800
She did something very unacceptable.

584
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,140
That night, she...

585
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,250
Later I tried to contact her

586
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,410
but she changed her phone number.

587
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,960
Isn't this unacceptable?

588
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,000
Say it again.

589
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,600
What did she do to you that night?

590
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,790
It's not important.

591
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,920
Well, actually it is important.

592
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,000
I don't know...

593
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,930
I don't know how to put it.

594
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,760
You're a grown man.

595
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,050
But you're like a loser.

596
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,170
What's wrong with being a loser in front of my wife?

597
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,360
Nothing wrong.

598
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,680
That's great.

599
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,810
So, can I ask you

600
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,440
a question that only a loser will ask?

601
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,650
Go ahead.

602
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,410
Has Xiaoxiao been to the cafe recently?

603
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,600
If she comes,

604
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,520
I'll tell you, okay?

605
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,720
She'll think of you when she comes to the cafe.

606
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,120
Do you think she'll come?

607
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,330
I see.

608
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,040
When are you coming back?

609
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,320
I'm so bored.

610
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,570
If you're bored,

611
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,160
go to Jiacheng or Xu Yan.

612
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Call them.

613
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,040
Bye.

614
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,760
Ye Han.

615
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,490
If they can solve my problem,

616
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,000
why would I call you?

617
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,330
They're all useless.

618
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,960
So annoying.

619
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,210
I'm sorry

620
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,260
that I'm seeing Jialin.

621
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,760
I still want to

622
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,240
treat you to a meal.

623
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,360
You want to negotiate with us too?

624
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,600
No.

625
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,900
I hope

626
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,520
you can allow me to be Jialin's boyfriend.

627
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,800
I'm not here

628
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,190
to negotiate with you

629
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,810
but to apologize to you.

630
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,330
I've promised Jialin

631
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,640
that I'll give her true love

632
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,840
in the most beautiful years of her life.

633
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,980
She told me

634
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,720
she had never

635
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,250
been in love like her peers.

636
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,440
When others

637
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,640
were in sweet love,

638
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,810
She just hoped

639
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,440
she could stop liking me.

640
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,250
But she's never stopped

641
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,850
doing things for me.

642
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Even when I

643
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,360
knew I had

644
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,880
got feelings for her,

645
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,540
I still pretended nothing had happened.

646
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,320
So from now on,

647
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,880
I'll make up for

648
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,140
what I did wrong to her.

649
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,490
I won't

650
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,510
make her feel lonely anymore.

651
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,880
I'll make her feel

652
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,470
that she's loved all the time.

653
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,510
I'll watch her grow up

654
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,570
and be responsible for her future life.

655
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,760
In the future,

656
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,560
no matter

657
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,730
what difficulties we meet,

658
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,720
I'll always be with her.

659
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
I know

660
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,570
in your eyes,

661
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,820
we are unsuited to each other.

662
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,800
But I can do

663
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,720
what I've just promised.

664
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
I will

665
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,120
keep my promise.

666
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,800
You're a lawyer.

667
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,080
No wonder you can say these beautiful words.

668
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,640
Why should we give you

669
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,800
the chance to keep your promise?

670
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,840
Why?

671
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,890
Because I love her.

672
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,280
I can swear to you on my life.

673
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,610
I'm very sure of my love for her.

674
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,920
I don't allow you to date.

675
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,920
Dad.

676
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,360
You are Jiacheng's good friend.

677
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,290
So,

678
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,160
I can't stand

679
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,280
watching you date, fight and break up.

680
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,000
If you want to be together,

681
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,210
just get married.

682
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,179
What are you talking about?

683
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,469
Get married?

684
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,620
Sure.

685
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,929
I agree.

686
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:15,750
Uncle.

687
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,840
Can you do it?

688
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,080
I can do it.

689
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,300
I can do it too.

690
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,360
We can get married tomorrow.

691

What do you mean?

693
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,159
Don't you know your own daughter?

694
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,730
Will she compromise?

695
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,400
Fine, I'm out of it.

696
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,639
I don't care what you will do now.

697
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:40,100
None of my business.

698
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,800
You all don't listen to me.

699
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,290
Whatever.

700
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,070
You can do whatever you want.

701
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,199
Auntie, Auntie.

702
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,960
Jialin.

703
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,640
I agree to your marriage

704
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,760
because I can see

705
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,890
you really like him.

706
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,680
You like him so much that you made a plan

707
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,360
and other efforts to win his love.

708
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,970
I'm proud of you.

709
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,880

00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,780
after you get married,

711
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,810
go work for our company.

712

713
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,640
I'll work hard.

714
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,400

Thank you, Uncle.

722

723
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,140

00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:15,000
♫We could only blame that we didn't have time to prepare for it♫

755
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,000
Now you don't even smile at me.

756
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,040
Did I do anything wrong?

757
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,970
You have to give me an explanation.

758
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:18,850
♫If missing is a misunderstanding♫

759
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,390
You did nothing wrong.

760
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,240
I was wrong.

761
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,790
♫The contradictory emotions are also shaky♫

762
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,280
♫The traffic lights are like tears♫

763
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:26,460
I thought I could handle everything, but I was wrong.

764

♫Twinkling in my heart♫

765
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,160
I'm sorry.

766
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,960

♫Like a silent monologue♫

770
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,800
Your mother talked to my dad.

771

I'm sorry.

775
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,660
I don't know my mom...

776
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,740
Actually, I kind of understand your mom.

777
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,830
♫I don't dare to love even if I long to♫

778
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,880
She's right.

779

♫But how can I forget your tenderness?♫

780
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,970
As long as my dad is there...

781
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,720
This is not about your dad.

782
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,760
This is about you.

783
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,960
I didn't mean anything that my mom said.

784
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,480
Do you really believe we can completely ignore them?

785
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,970
♫Distance makes people retreat♫

786
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,650
Do you think you can stop seeing

787
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,480

♫Can I still face it if I turn around?♫

789

I will choose you.

791
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,080
I have my own life.

792

♫I always doubt myself and take myself as a humble person♫

♫The denial hit my sore point♫

798
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,260
You'll regret it sooner or later.

♫How can I love like the way you do?♫

818

There's no future for our relationship.

819
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,280
Because we can't change our family.

820
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,150

We encountered many problems,

829
