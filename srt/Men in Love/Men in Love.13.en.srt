To be honest,

I just thought your suit was good,

31

32
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,870

This is the new intern of the Content Department.

39

Twenty.

43
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,090
Judging from the way you said it,

44
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,950
you are proud of your age.

45
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,430
Yeah, is that something you should be proud of?

46
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,940
Right.

47
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,400

In fact, getting older than 30 years old

She looks quite

196
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,350
gloomy.

197
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,070

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,860
I heard you ran into Eily at the restaurant last week

203

No.

208
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,990
is just an excuse.

She went straight back to her room yesterday.

212

She left without having breakfast this morning.

213
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,110
I am going to ask her

214
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,240
what happened after I go back tonight.

215

217

please comfort her.

218
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,830
Why would you ask me to do this?

219
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,830
Because I like her.

Xiaoxiao,

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,590
you are a very important friend

227
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,840
to me.

228
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,500
Sometimes when people are too close,

229
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,310

Xiaoxiao,

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,960
I wanted to pretend not to know.

234
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,890
I hope we can get along like we used to.

235
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:38,870
But if I'm going to lie to you

236
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,200
by pretending that I don't know anything,

237
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,110
I think it's too despicable.

238
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,350
It's not your fault.

239
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,750
I messed everything up.

240
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,840
It's not your fault.

241
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,350
I'm responsible.

242
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,710
I should apologize to you.

243
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,570
You don't have to apologize to me.

244
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,360
I won't apologize to you

245
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,590
because I liked you.

246
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,760
I don't regret liking you.

247

Jiacheng,

248
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,120
I don't like you anymore.

249
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,570
I really hope you and Yiwen can be happy together.

250
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,280
I'm not worried about that.

251
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,120
I just hope you won't be sad.

252
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,210
At the same time, I don't want to lose you as a friend.

253
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,110
I cherish my friendship with you guys.

254
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,870
Without this,

255
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,350
everyone would be happy

256
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,430
and I wouldn't have messed up

258

I don't know how to face you,

259
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,590
and how to face Yiwen.

260
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,310
I ruined everything.

261
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,310
I'll keep this a secret for you.

262
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,630
I was about to ask you to keep the secret for me.

263
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,350
Thank you.

I'm sorry.

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,960

277

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,350

280

It's not that I don't want to tell you.

281

282

I know. No need to explain.

286
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,030
But I need your explanation.

What did you say to Xiaoxiao?

288
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,660

I don't want to lie to her.

291
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,230
That's why you came to play basketball that day

292
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,360
and you went to the restaurant with us.

293
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,870

Should I tell you

305
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,110
the girl I like is sad

306
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,310

307

and how sad it makes me because I like her?

308
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,990
Or should I tell you how upset I am

309
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,320
caught between you two?

310
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,350
Sorry, Ye Han.

311
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,430
I didn't know.

312
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,700
Now you know.

313
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,210
You must feel bad.

314
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,420
She feels even worse now.

315
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,990
Because you left all the problems to her.

316

I just don't want to embarrass everyone.

317
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,470

318

How about Xiaoxiao?

322
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,950
She has liked you secretly for so long

323
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,230
just because she was afraid that you would be affected.

324
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,090
And you only care about yourself.

00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,840

I am too selfish.

537

00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,610
The case of Jia Group was convicted.

564
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,620
You won again.

565
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
Not bad.

566
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,990
If I remember correctly,

567
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,430
this is your third case this month, right?

568
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,470
It happened these three cases came to trial this month.

569
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,190
Mr. Xu,

570
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,750
how is the house thing going?

571
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,590
It's settled.

572
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,380
Actually, I made the decision very quickly.

573
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,910
I need to thank you for introducing me to the agent.

574
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,370
They're really reliable.

575
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,670
I heard that

576
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,670
your girlfriend went to see the houses with you

577
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,480
and she checked every house very carefully.

578
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,150
Mr. Xu.

579
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,740
You have a girlfriend?

580
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,430
I don't have a girlfriend.

581
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,070
She's just a girl I know.

582
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,670
That young and pretty girl

583
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,990
was holding your arm while viewing the houses.

584
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:08,550
You call that a girl you know?

585
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,190
I don't think so.

586
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,080
We were just joking that day.

587
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,910
Look.

588
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,710
Mr. Xu is shy.

589
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:19,090
[CLOUDS CAFE]

590
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,430
Bring her to see us next time.

591
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,710
Yes.

592
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,010
She's really not my girlfriend.

593
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,790
Hey,

594
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,270
come to me if you want to buy a house.

595
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,240
My agent is very reliable.

596
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,390
Of course.

597
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,670
Listen to me. The case today...

598
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,850
Bei,

599
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,270
I heard Ayu is recruiting

600
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,580
models for Fashion Week.

601
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,150
I want to go for an interview.

602
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,210
Actually, I've asked around for you.

603
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,030
But the models

604
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,410
who open and close the show

605
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,650
have been decided.

606
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,260
I'm talking about their public interview.

607
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,520
Public interview?

608
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,360
That's for those unknown models.

609
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,290
It's not appropriate for you to go.

610
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:56,830
Yiwen.

611
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,710
I know you want to go on the runway.

612
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,870
I've reached out to some other brands.

613
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:01,750
I'll let you know

614
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,010
if they contact me.

615
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,260
I understand, Bei.

616
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,390
But I haven't been on a show for years.

617
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,530
They won't directly book me.

618
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,230
Instead of asking you to mobilize your connections,

619
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,150
I'd rather go directly.

620
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,170
Have you thought it through?

621
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,880
This means you need to start all over.

622
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,440
Do you know

623
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,230
how many eyes will be on you?

624
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,710
They will say harsh things behind your back.

625
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,870
I don't care what others think anymore.

626
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,870
After all, it has been so many years.

627
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,040
Trust me.

628
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,670
I have confidence in myself.

629
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,340
OK.

630
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,600
It's just an interview.

631
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,690
How many interviews did you go through before?

632
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,800
Yeah.

633
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,860
If you want to start over,

634
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,360
I'll do it with you.

635
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:46,750
Fighting!

636
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,630
Fighting!

637
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,070
That's all for our last training

638
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,190
before the holiday.

639
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,470
It's holiday!

640
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,650
I didn't say you were dismissed.

641
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,570
After the holiday,

642
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,670
you'll have your first single game.

643
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,550
Crueler training is waiting for you.

644
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,860
If you don't want to suffer after the holiday,

645
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,510
you'd better practice during the holiday.

646
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,560
No less than three hours a day.

647
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,520
Three hours?

648
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,180
The whole school has high expectations for you.

649
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,640
Don't make me lose face then.

650
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,610
Miss,

651
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,640
don't worry.

652
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,660
We are so good. We'll make you proud.

653
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,540
I'm most worried about you.

654
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,800
Don't overeat

655
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,960
during the holiday.

656
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,650
Pay attention to your weight.

657
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,990
You're the fattest among them.

658
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,910
Zhong Zixuan.

659
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,270
How dare you laugh at others?

660
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,190
Don't spend all your time playing games.

661
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,080
Don't make trouble.

662
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,650
All right, I won't talk more.

663
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:40,710
Lastly,

664
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,750
I hope you can spend more time with your family

665
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,150
during the holiday.

666
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,150
Take care of yourselves.

667
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,670
Don't get sick.

668
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:47,630
Okay.

669
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,760
Okay.

670
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,510
Alright.

671
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,050
You are dismissed.

672
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:51,990
Let's go.

673
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:52,750
Let's go.

674
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,150
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

675
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,720
Take care. Bye.

676
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,240
Miss.

677
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,830
What do you plan to do during the holiday?

678
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,790
Nothing.

679
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,400
It's tiring to train you.

680
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,810
During the holiday,

681
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:12,880
I just want to have a good rest.

682
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,710
You should go out more during the holidays

683
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,510
to relax.

684
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,480
You'll feel better

685
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,030
when you are on the outside.

686
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,830
Don't worry about me.

687
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,630
Worry about yourself.

688
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,000
When you come back,

689
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:24,429
you must make it into the top three

690
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,909
in the qualifier.

691
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:27,270
Of course.

692
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,920
Have a good holiday, Miss.

693
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,570
-Take care.
-I'm leaving.

694
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,860
Xu Yan.

695
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,290
You're still here?

696
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,980
None of your business.

697
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,460
What's the attitude?

698
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,409
Have you had dinner?

699
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,180
No.

700
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,490
Let's go and eat.

701
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,830
No.

702
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,320
Why are you so weird today?

703
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,150
I'm leaving.

704
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,870
Xu Yan.

705
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,890
I'm here.

706
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,390
Why are you here again?

707
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,200
You didn't reply to my messages.

708
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,470
You didn't answer my calls.

709
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,710
I think

710
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,770
you may not like to use your phone,

711
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,160
so I came in person.

712
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,880
It's more sincere to talk in person.

713
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,850
Have you ever thought

714
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,890
it's not the phone that I don't like,

715
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,100
but you?

716
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,680
It doesn't matter.

717
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,490
You can like whatever you like.

718
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,470
Can you drive me home?

719
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,280
Your brother hasn't gone far.

720
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,400
Go find him.

721
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,850
I don't want to go home with him.

722
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,110
I have someone else with whom I want to go home.

723
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,710
Don't drag me.

724
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,460
Xu Yan.

725
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,630
Don't you think

726
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,310
I'm different today?

727
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,180
No.

728
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,010
This is my first day at work.

729
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,190
I'm a professional woman now.

730
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,510
You found a job.

731
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,830
Where do you work?

732
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,720
Well...

733
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,850
Just a regular white-collar job.

734
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,350
On the first day of work,

735
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,150
you should have dinner with your family

736
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,230
and talk about your work.

737
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,690
My family don't know I found a job.

738
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,840
I don't want them to know it either.

739
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,890
To me, you are my family.

740
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,180
I really want to talk with you

741
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,530
about my first day at work.

742
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,090
It will be better if you can treat me to dinner.

743
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,080
Answer the phone.

744
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:49,310
He might buy you dinner.

745
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,490
I don't want to have dinner with him.

746
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,850
Hey, what?

747
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,840
Where are you?

748
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,070
None of your business.

749
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,150
I'm warning you.

750
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,370
It does you no good

751
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,680
to talk to me like this.

752
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,220
Don't threaten me.

753
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,730
I've turned myself in to Xiaoxiao.

754
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,910
She pardoned me.

755
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,040
What did she say?

756
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,340
She said she wanted to die.

757
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,140
Bye.

758
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,470
So annoying.

759
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,950
I'll just block him.

760
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,330
Why didn't you tell him

761
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,240
you were with me?

762
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,650
Am I with you?

763
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,840
You were avoiding him

764
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,520
at the gate, right?

765
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,020
So, you know

766
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,670
why you did that, right?

767
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,190
Because you know

768
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,920
your unrequited love

769
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,460
won't have a happy ending.

770
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,830
I don't think

771
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,390
it's because of my brother.

772
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,350
That's also one reason.

773
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,880
So, there are two.

774
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,350
Hey, your store is still open.

775
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,170
It's still early. I'll close the store later.

776
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,200
Chinese New Year is coming.

777
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,510
Xiaoxiao will be on holiday.

778
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,840
When will she come back?

779
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,250
She should be back soon.

780
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,350
Can she

781
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,040
bring home your grandson-in-law this time?

782
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,860
This time,

783
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,480
I...

784
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,850
I really don't know.

785
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,110
You're still so funny.

786
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,280
I remember

787
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,150
Xiaoxiao

788
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:35,170
and my grandson Kun are the same age.

789
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,330
Then she'll be 30 next year.

790
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,100
You have to urge her.

791
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,770
What's the rush?

792
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,830
Fate is unpredictable.

793
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,900
As long as Xiaoxiao is happy,

794
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,360
it's better than anything.

795
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,490
It doesn't matter if she gets married.

796
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,660
That's very progressive of you.

797
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:10,750
You can't take all the burdens yourself.

798
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,370
Although I live far away

799
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,520
and I may not be able to help you,

800
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,430
I can try to

801
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,180
come up with some ideas.

802
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,130
Right?

803
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,250
I need to answer the phone.

804
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,370
Hello?

805
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,320
Hello, Grandma.

806
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,740
Speak of the devil.

807
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,370
Xiaoxiao.

808
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,060
My dear granddaughter.

809
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,050
Why did you call me?

810
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,450
I miss you.

811
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,310
Do you miss me?

812
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,920
I have to run the store.

813
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,950
I have to talk with customers.

814
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,670
I'm very busy.

815
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,270
I don't have time to miss you.

816
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,200
I don't miss you.

817
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,230
Liar.

818
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:58,810
Let's be serious.

819
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,030
Chinese New Year is coming.

820
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,880
When will you come back?

821
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,580
When do you want me to go back?

822
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,210
Whatever.

823
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,530
Whose granddaughter was that?

824
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,890
She said she missed her grandmother.

825
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,790
And now you're acting cute.

826
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,590
Fine.

827
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,610
I'll go back tomorrow.

828
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,140
Tomorrow?

829
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,570
She'll be back tomorrow.

830
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,430
Okay.

831
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,100
I'll buy a fish.

832
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,480
What else do you want to eat?

833
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:26,360
I'll buy whatever you want.

834
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,890
No need.

835
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Is there anything

836
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,220
you want me to bring home from Shanghai?

837
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,700
No, nothing.

838
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,040
There's everything here.

839
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,650
You

840
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,390
just come back safely.

841
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,420
Okay.

842
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,090
Then stay home

843
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,360
at home.

844
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,430
See you tomorrow.
