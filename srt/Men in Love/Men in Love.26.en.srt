[Episode 26]

4
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,229
What are you doing here?

5
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,670
I'm healing my broken heart.

6
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,030
Didn't you teach me that?

7
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,560
I don't like Xu Yan anymore.

8
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:59,979
Because he doesn't like you?

9
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,830
Are you trying to make me feel more hurt?

10
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,550
I'm just telling the truth.

11
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,380
Why do you not like him anymore?

12
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,699
Do you really not like him anymore

13
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,740
or do you not want to like him anymore?

14
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,890
I don't like him anymore

15
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,490
and I don't want to like him anymore.

16
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,430
I worked so hard to lose weight and came back.

17
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,230
I deserve better.

18
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,570
So,

19
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,990
you want to forget about your crush on him?

20
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,790
Yes.

21
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,930
From today onward, I'll start a new chapter of my life.

22
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,329
I'll embrace all the good things in my life.

23
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,320
Xiaoxiao,

24
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,050
I'm single again.

25
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,540
How should I live my life as a single woman?

26
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,730
Aren't you always single?

27
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,550
Just live your life as usual.

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,670
You've had a boyfriend for only a few days.

29
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,710
It doesn't give you the right to laugh at single people.

30
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,400
Although I've always been a single woman,

31
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,550
I used to pretend

32
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,290
I was in a relationship with Xu Yan.

33
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,230
If a boy asked me out,

34
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,900
I rejected it.

35
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,120
Don't worry.

36
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,710
Being single is easy.

37
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,750
You're so smart.

38
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,490
You'll get used to it quickly.

39
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,070
Bye.

40
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,600
You just got here.

41
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,910
My boyfriend is here now.

42
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,940
Bye-bye.

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,390
So annoying.

44
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,990
Revise it.

45
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,250
This way, please.

46
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,040
Eric, a lady wants to see you.

47
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,640
Let her in.

48
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,280
Hello, Eric.

49
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,690
It's you.

50
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,560
I should have welcomed you at the door.

51
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,600
No need.

52
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,600
I'm here for a job interview.

53
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,410
Have a seat.

54
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:54,290
You're a supermodel. You don't need to be interviewed.

55
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,280
I don't want to be interviewed for a model.

56
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,460
I'm here today

57
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,870
to be interviewed for your assistant.

58
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,780
This is a skirt I designed.

59
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,330
I majored in fashion design in college.

60
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,370
Let me show you my resume.

61
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,150
I know.

62
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,170
You even won a prize for your design.

63
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,050
Have a seat.

64
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,640
So can I be your assistant?

65
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,200
Of course.

66
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,340
I hope

67
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,490
you can work for me as soon as possible.

68
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,810
But you haven't read my resume yet.

69
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,790
You really don't remember that, do you?

70
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,710
Where should I start?

71
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,909
Back then,

72
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,710
I was an assistant.

73
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,370
Yes.

74
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,900
It was my first time to be in a big fashion show.

75
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,280
You were the model who should wear my clothes.

76
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,550
When you were about to show my clothes on the runway,

77
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,610
something was wrong with my clothes.

78
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,450
I was panicking.

79
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,270
It's you who fixed the problem in time.

80
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,270
But for you, I would have lost my job.

81
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,870
I remember now.

82
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,240
At that time, they all said

83
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,230
you were difficult to deal with.

84
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,200
But

85
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,830
what you did for me

86
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,700
made me believe they were all wrong.

87
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,580
Really.

88
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,030
For you,

89
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,600
it's just a small favor.

90
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,910
But this small favor

91
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,230
helped me know you better.

92
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,790
It even changed me to some extent.

93
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,260
So,

94
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,590
if you want to try something new now,

95
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,320
I will definitely support you.

96
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,080
So your support is not for my design.

97
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,990
Your design is beautiful.

98
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,050
There's no doubt about that.

99
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,600
But for a designer,

100
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,950
only one piece of work,

101
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,390
or a resume

102
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:34,470
is far from enough.

103
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,120
Although

104
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,040
you majored in fashion design in college,

105
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,180
you didn't do any work

106
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,970
related to fashion design in the past.

107
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,370
You weren't in this industry.

108
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,150
So I want to start from being an assistant.

109
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,010
I want to learn from you bit by bit.

110
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,320
It's a very tiring and difficult job to be my assistant.

111
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,140
Being a model is also tiring and difficult.

112
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,950
I've decided to start over.

113
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,570
I'm not afraid of difficulties and tiredness.

114
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,990
I look forward

115
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,850
to working with you in the future.

116
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,470
Okay.

117
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,840
You should know

118
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,490
I am a strict boss.

119
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,130
I wouldn't go easy on you

120
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,730
just because I know you.

121
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,480
By the way,

122
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,350
there will be

123
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,520
a trade expo of clothing and fabric soon.

124
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,510
I hope you can go there with me.

125
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,450
So that you can meet our suppliers.

126
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,730
It will help you

127
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,100
get ready for your job as my assistant.

128
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,720
Hello.

129
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,560
Are you Miss Lin?

130
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,350
Yes.

131
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,550
Why are you so late?

132
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,350
I was stuck in traffic.

133
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,610
That caused the delay.

134
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,350
You spilled the coffee!

135
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,240
I...

136
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,640
I was running too fast.

137
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,110
This is my first day of work.

138
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,150
These coffees are for the participants of the meeting.

139
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,880
I understand that it's your first day of work.

140
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,620
But how should I explain to my boss?

141
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,390
How about this?

142
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,590
I'll get you two new coffees.

143
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,350
It's too late.

144
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,210
I need to go now.

145
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,990
Are you going to turn my room

146
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,390
into a photo studio?

147
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,930
Why didn't you put them in your apartment?

148
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,460
They take up the whole room.

149
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,790
The photos and my apartment do not match.

150
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,290
My apartment is in a different style.

151
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,260
I'm not a narcissistic girl.

152
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,440
I'm in this photo.

153
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,590
Don't you like it?

154
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,110
Look.

155
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,990
You have me in the photo.

156
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,130
You also have me in real life.

157
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,430
How happy you will be!

158
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,330
Fine.

159
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,420
You convinced me.

160
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,570
You're my good girl.

161
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,070
You really think I'm a good girl?

162
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,659
How about this?

163
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,930
It makes you good, too.

164
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,860
But it doesn't make you look smart.

165
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,040
So your likes are peculiar.

166
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,350
But I can do nothing about it.

167
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,870
I chose this strange guy

168
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,460
as my boyfriend.

169
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,200
Now the strange guy thinks

170
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,470
it will make this room

171
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,910
look even better

172
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,030
if you can put one more photo here.

173
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,790
No.

174
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,910
No more photos.

175
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,420
Why not?

176
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,190
You really don't like them?

177
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,790
I didn't mean that.

178
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,330
If I move to different places,

179
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,730
it'll be inconvenient

180
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,490
to take them with me every time.

181
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,710
I don't want these photos to be damaged.

182
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,500
And if we break up someday,

183
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,100
it'll be embarrassing to look at these photos.

184
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,320
You really think

185
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,169
we will break up?

186
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,590
That's not what I meant.

187
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,289
Everyone may break up.

188
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,130
It's like everyone will die eventually.

189
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,510
All right.

190
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,790
No more photos

191
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,960
or photo frames.

192
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,210
There are so many photos of me in my room.

193
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,200
It's weird.

194
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,450
Besides,

195
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,940
there's a photo of you now.

196
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,690
I feel awkward

197
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,320
when you look at me every day.

198
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,350
I'll send Yiwen a message

199
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,360
to ask when she'll be back.

200
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,940
Where are you?

201
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,520
She replied. So soon.

202
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,990
I'm always staying in my room.

203
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,230
Do whatever you want.

204
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,000
She's here.

205
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,560
She's always been here.

206
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,590
Have you

207
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,620
ever considered

208
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,360
moving out?

209
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,340
No.

210
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,530
You really don't want to move out?

211
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,460
Really.

212
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,160
Fine.

213
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,300
If you don't leave,

214
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,800
I'll leave then.

215
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,450
You're leaving now?

216
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,240
Yes.

217
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,790
Because I want you to keep missing me.

218
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,720
You have someone else in the apartment

219
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,560
to keep you company.

220
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,180
Good night.

221
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,250
See you.

222
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,850
Bye.

223
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,640
Bye.

224
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,110
Work harder.

225
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,110
Good.

226
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,430
Watch your speed.

227
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,510
Come on! Come on!

228
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,110
Come on. Faster.

229
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,110
Do not change the formation.

230
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,350
Take turns.

231
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,390
Faster. Faster. Faster.

232
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,180
[Heart rate] [Timer]

233
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,470
One minute left.

234
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,590
Speed up.

235
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,350
What?

236
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,590
Song Jinran is back?

237
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,120
Is she as pretty as before?

238
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,930
I'm not sure yet.

239
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
We only saw her magazine that day.

240
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,190
Besides, that's not important.

241
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,400
Over the past 5 years,

242
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,120
she's never provided works for magazines in China.

243
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,050
She may really come back this time.

244
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,030
Very quietly

245
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,510
she takes her leave.

246
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,450
As quietly as she came here.

247
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,010
-I wave...
-Bro.

248
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,290
Why is she back suddenly?

249
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,710
Back then,

250
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,430
she suddenly disappeared and now she shows up out of nowhere.

251
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,510
Don't you think it's really scary?

252
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,150
Is she back for Ye Han?

253
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,790
When Ye Han mentioned Song Jinran that day,

254
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,120
he got quite emotional.

255
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,870
Yes.

256
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,170
He was stunned in the office that day.

257
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,230
What are you talking about?

258
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,230
Is it a secret?

259
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,170
Ye Han.

260
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,230
Song Jinran is back.

261
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,110
Dude, don't talk about her in front of him.

262
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,350
I'm just asking.

263
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,870
You haven't been in touch for years.

264
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,000
Why does she show up all of a sudden now?

265
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,350
I don't know.

266
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,680
We haven't been in touch for years.

267
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,470
Besides,

268
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,930
this is not your business.

269
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,920
She left so suddenly 5 years ago.

270
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,350
And now she suddenly came back.

271
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,810
Don't you want to know why?

272
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,130
I know.

273
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,690
She wants to get back together with Ye Han.

274
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,040
Shut up!

275
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,590
Are you okay?

276
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
I'm fine.

277
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:53,980
Really.

278
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,110
You don't have to

279
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,510
be so nervous.

280
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,470
It's not a big deal.

281
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,710
It doesn't have any influence on me.

282
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,630
Well,

283
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,190
let's eat together today.

284
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:03,950
Okay.

285
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,470
We can discuss it.

286
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,830
No discussion.

287
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,120
I'm not going.

288
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,330
I need to go on a date later.

289
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,970
You go back and stay with Yun.

290
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,090
Have you ever seen a movie

291
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,310
in which the male protagonist concealed his identity

292
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,670
and had been away from his hometown for 30 years?

293
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,750
Thirty years later, he died with tears in his eyes.

294
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,040
But he kept the secret.

295
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,230
Yes.

296
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,310
There's another movie

297
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,510
in which the protagonist

298
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,590
smuggled drugs in order to get cheaper drugs

299
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,230
for cancer patients.

300
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,100
He ended up in prison for doing it.

301
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,420
That's a good movie too.

302
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:41,810
Yes.

303
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,120
There's another movie that I think is the most wonderful.

304
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,630
That movie is...

305
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,350
Dude.

306
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,870
What are you doing?

307
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,110
Come on. Drink this.

308
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,190
Don't speak.

309
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,050
Come on, drink.

310
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,890
What are you doing?

311
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,310
I'm just...

312
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,580
I'm just

313
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,230
doing a research.

314
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,390
I want to find out

315
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,560
how much sacrifice the protagonist of a movie can make

316
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,110
for doing what he or she thinks is the right thing to do.

317
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,040
I want to write an article about it.

318
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,790
I came to have lunch with you.

319
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,300
But you only got me this fast food

320
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,220
and talked about work with me all the time.

321
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,720
How about we talk about movies that made us laugh?

322
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,250
Let's talk about comedies.

323
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,680
I need to work hard.

324
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,730
I need more money to support my family.

325
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,590
I'm not like you.

326
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,750
I have a girlfriend.

It's completely over.

330
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,790
I said a lot of hurtful things to her.

331
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,530

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,260
I would only say to myself.

I'm a person

335
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,910
who would sacrifice a lot

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,300
I have something to do here.

Whatever it is, it has nothing to do with you.

I'm not waiting for you.

350

Don't misunderstand.

I'm really not waiting for you.

Do you think I'll believe it?

I don't like you anymore.

You told me to stay away from you.

359
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,310
I did.

360
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,310
Why did you start this conversation with me just now?

361
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,350
Keep a distance from me.

379
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:11,810
Right.

380
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,310
I felt the same when I got married.

381
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:18,260
I felt I could never be in a romantic relationship again at that time.

382
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,099
Bye.

Honey.

Honey, let's take a break.

387
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:57,930
I need to stop.

388

Let's have a seat. Take a break.

Do you want some water?

No.

It's okay.

00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,160
Thank you, Auntie.

396
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,180
You're welcome.

397
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,570
You kicked the ball to us again.

I'm sorry, big brother.

Thank you, big brother.

Let's continue to run, honey.

402

No, I don't want to keep running.

What should we eat later?

Should we eat at home or at the restaurant?

I know a restaurant which serves very good steak.

Don't be angry.

00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,770
Did I make you angry again?

413
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,320
No, you didn't.

414
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,310
It's my fault.

Tell me what I did wrong.

416

Why did she call me Auntie?

417
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,530
She's just a kid.

418
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,790
Then why did the kid call you big brother

419
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,950
instead of Uncle?

420
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,770
She's afraid of Uncles.

421
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,770
She's afraid I'll hit her if she calls me Uncle.

422
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,970
So I'm old now.

You're not old at all, honey.

I look older than you.

I'm going to have a facelift.

426
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,710
You don't need it.

427
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,370
That's totally unnecessary.

you could be so hard-working.

00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,110
It's fine.

561
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,520
Actually, I think

562
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,020
there are too many things to remember.

677
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,920

Anyway,

679
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,690

680
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,090
He's a little depressed now.

681
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,480
So I didn't know

682
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,440
if it was right to train him that hard.

00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,240
Xiaoxiao looks like she's in her early twenties.

755
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,670
Where are you from?

756
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,050
I'm from Hangzhou.

757
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,090
I've been to Hangzhou before.

758
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,320
It's a beautiful city.

759
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,230
I like it.

760
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,330
Mom.

761
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,890
Why are you dressed so formally tonight?

762
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,480
Are you going out?

763
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,510
I almost forgot.

764
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,810
I've got an appointment with several old friends tonight.

765
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,480
It's really late.

766
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,270
I-I should go now.

767
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,060
See you later.

768
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,890
I won't come back tonight.

769
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,430
You keep chatting.

770
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,390
Auntie.

771
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,830
I need to go too.

772
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,010
Why?

773
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,470
Actually,

774
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,510
I just came to get a magazine.

775
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,310
I understand.

776
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,150
Mom.

777
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,660
Go now. Don't be late.

778
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,560
Okay.

779
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,590
By the way, Xiaoxiao,

780
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,190
do you like watching dramas?

781
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,810
I have a new drama coming up.

782
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,080
I'll let Ye Han take you to watch it.

783
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,070
Okay.

784
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,120
Thank you, Auntie.

785
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,110
Okay.

786
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,670
Oh my God. Oh my God.

787
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,840
I must have given her a very bad first impression.

788
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,350
You think too much.

789
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,350
My mom doesn't care about that.

790
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,690
She likes you very much.

791
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,410
It's useless.

792
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:57,670
This is different from my imagination.

793
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,940
I have a picture in my mind.

794
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,570
In my imagination,

795
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,280
I was wearing a beautiful dress

796
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,180
and walking to your mother quietly.

797
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,600
What happened is completely different from my imagination.

798
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,510
I was so embarrassed.

799
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,090
I couldn't be more embarrassed.

800
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,370
Relax. My mom really likes you.

801
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:19,010
But it was still so embarrassing.

802
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,560
What should I do?

803
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,260
I don't want to live anymore.

804
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,830
It's okay.

805
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:25,350
It's okay.

806
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:26,719
Don't touch me.

807
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,400
Your Mom is still here.

808
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,650
It'll be bad if she sees us again.

809
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,230
Miss Lin.

810
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,150
Thank you.

811
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,989
I didn't spill a drop this time.

812
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:47,989
I sealed it twice and taped it.

813
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,989
Thank you.

814
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,159
Take this.

815
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,239
This is...

816
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,510
I bought it myself.

817
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,840
I'm sorry for what happened last time.

818
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,409
So...

819
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,139
I bought it for you

820
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,660
to express my apology.

821
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,390
Actually, I'm sorry too.

822
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,850
I was in a hurry that time.

823
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,130
I'm Jialin.

824
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,420
My name is Ke Xiaodong.

825
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,900
I have a meeting.

826
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,130
If I get the chance, I'll go see you at the coffee shop.

827
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:07,630
Okay.

828
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,370
Jialin.

829
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,330
I know the shortcut to your company from the coffee shop.

830
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,990
I'll be faster to deliver the coffees next time.

831
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,210
Do you have any objections

832
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,790
to what we have discussed in the meeting?

833
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,590
No.

834
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,930
Okay, let's end the meeting.

835
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,040
Okay.

836
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,630
Mr. Wang.

837
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,490
When did you start doing that research

838
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,960
on the special services needed by pregnant women?

839
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,310
As a man,

840
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,390
I can hardly come up with such an idea.

841
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,560
Just focus on the needs of our customers.

842
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,960
The most important thing

843
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,090
for a leader

844
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
is to keep...

845
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,640
Isn't this my proposal?

846
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,520
I don't seem

847
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,840
to be very busy usually,

848
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,920
but I am always working hard.

849
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,660
I should learn from you.

850
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,470
Mr. Wang.

851
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,390
Is this my proposal?

852
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,010
Not a single word is changed.

853
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,770
How could you write your name on my proposal

854
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,830
and submit it without my permission?

855
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,990
Lin Jia, what are you talking about?

856
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,270
Listen.

857
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,620
You have no evidence. Don't slander me.

858
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,110
Who said I have no evidence?

859
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,270
I spent years doing this research.

860
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,310
I went to hotels

861
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,900
of different brands.

862
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,110
I asked workers there whether certain services

863
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,530
were available.

864
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,390
I conducted surveys and research

865
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,320
to ensure every detail

866
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,000
of this proposal is perfect.

867
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,120
Stop.

868
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,890
Stop yelling.

869
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,750
Is this how you talk to your superior?

870
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,800
Let me tell you,

871
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,740
you're just an assistant.

872
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,330
Without my guidance,

873
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,690
could you make such a proposal?

874
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,310
I gave you the opportunity

875
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,350
to do more jobs

876
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,780
and helped you make progress.

877
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,460
You shouldn't argue with me

878
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,130
whose name should be on the proposal.

879
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,130
You should thank me.

880
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,440
This is so ridiculous.

881
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,930
How can you be so shameless?

882
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,970
Aren't you afraid you'll lose your job?

883
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,530
Stop it, both of you.

884
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,470
How can you two

885
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,870
have an argument in the office?

886
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,910
Ms. Chen, I wasn't...

887
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,010
Lin Jia.

888
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,580
Bring the original version of the proposal written by you.

889
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:14,530
[Hotel services for special groups]

890
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,950
[Types of special groups]

891
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,580
This proposal

892
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,650
will be labeled as Lin Jia's.

893
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,660
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

894
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,130
Mr. Wang.

895
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,680
Come with me.

896
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,550
I'll wait and see

897
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,010
why you can be so arrogant.

898
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,230
You'd better see it clearly.

899
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,510
Honey.

900
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,970
I've got the plan for your birthday party.

901
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,450
They prepared a lot of themes this time.

902
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,690
They are Retro Theme,

903
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,480
Heart of the Ocean,

904
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,310
and Northern European Castle.

905
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,680
I think Northern European Castle is good.

906
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,080
Do you want to take a look?

907
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,830
I'm becoming one year older.

908
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,900
I don't want to celebrate my birthday this year.

909
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,610
Honey.

910
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,710
You didn't celebrate your birthday last year.

911
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,900
Let's celebrate it this year.

912
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,030
We

913
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,690
can have a good time with our friends.

914
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,390
What good time?

915
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,120
I said I won't celebrate it this year.

916
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,240
Honey,

917
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,180
I think

918
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,070
you didn't smile often recently.

919
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,630
We can take this opportunity

920
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,910
to have fun with all our friends.

921
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,510
Doesn't it sound a good idea?

922
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,600
Have fun? Only you guys will have fun.

923
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,030
Just a bunch of people eating and drinking

924
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,040
and talking nonsense.

925
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,270
You'll all be there to see me turn 38.

926
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,790
What's the point?

927
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,540
Okay.

928
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,850
I give it up.

929
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,640
You give up what?

930
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,580
I mean the birthday party. Let's not have that party.

931
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,420
Okay?

932
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,280
Zhong Zixuan didn't answer our calls.

933
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,640
He must be hiding from us.

934
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,540
He can't hide forever.

935
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,770
Continue.

936
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,850
It's been an hour. Why are they still here?

937
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,570
Alright.

938
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,470
That's all for today's training.

939
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,830
I know

940
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,880
in the last competition,

941
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,430
we got very good results.

942
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,920
I hope the joy brought by our victory

943
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,980
will motivate us to keep working hard

944
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,950
rather than make us become complacent or slack off.

945
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,480
Our next goal

946
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,520
is to become the champion of the national league.

947
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,440
So, don't slack off.

948
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,270
Understand?

949
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,290
Yes.

950
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,110
Okay.

951
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:03,330
Let's call it a day.

952
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:06,970
Ding Zhuang.

953
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,380
Have you seen Zhong Zixuan today?

954
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,550
His phone is turned off.

955
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,250
What happened?

956
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,760
I don't know.

957
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,850
I texted him this morning.

958
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,190
But he hasn't replied yet.

959
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,030
You really don't know?

960
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,100
I really don't know.

961
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,980
Fine.

962
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,310
Ask him to come to me when you see him.

963
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,270
Okay.

964
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Miss Li.

965
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,200
Tonight,

966
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,350
our team will have dinner together.

967
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,930
Would you like to join us?

968
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,050
I can't go with you today.

969
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,720
I have something else to do tonight.

970
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,040
It's rare that you have dinner with us.

971
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,280
Come on. Join us.

972
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,810
I really can't go tonight.

973
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,990
How about next time?

974
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,140
I have to go now.

975
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:39,850
Next time.

976
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,840
It'll be my treat.

977
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,830
Have a good time.

978
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,900
Okay.

979
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,140
Xiaoxiao.

980
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,610
I'm here.

981
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,740
Is the lady in front of me Li Xiaoxiao?

982
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,260
What are you doing?

983
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,380
Are you making fun of me?

984
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,670
No.

985
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,850
So,

986
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,260
why are you wearing this skirt?

987
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,860
Is it because

988
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,570
you want to

989
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,210
leave a good impression on my mom?

990
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,690
Stop teasing me.

991
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,640
I'm so nervous right now.

992
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,350
When I first met your mom,

993
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,550
it was so embarrassing.

994
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,380
I have to redeem myself.

995
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,770
You think too much.

996
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,040
You're not me.

997
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,850
You can't understand how I feel now.

998
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,510
My mom is very open-minded.

999
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,220
She doesn't care about that at all.

1000
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,350
But I still need to do this.

1001
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,430
I can't allow myself to look bad.

1002
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,440
Okay. Okay.

1003
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,660
[Macbeth]

1004
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,790
Hurry.

1005
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,540
Hurry up.

1006
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,880
We're waiting for you.

1007
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,250
What happened to you?

1008
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,140
You made Yun angry again?

1009
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,160
No.

1010
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:42,880
Then why do you

1011
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,240
look so desperate?

1012
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,790
Shengyun

1013
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,080
lost her mind recently.

1014
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,520
What happened?

1015
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,330
A few days ago, a kid

1016
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,600
called her Auntie.

1017
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,210
After that,

1018
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,510
she goes to the beauty salon every day.

1019
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,450
The money she spent is enough to buy a beauty salon.

1020
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,250
That's it?

1021
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,530
She didn't spend your money. Why are you upset?

1022
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,320
It's not about money.

1023
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,960
I'm worried about Shengyun.

1024
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,820
She is so elegant and young.

1025
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,640
Is it necessary for her to have beauty treatment every day?

1026
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,390
Every woman cares about her appearance.

1027
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,640
Besides,

1028
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,700
you like to flatter young and beautiful girls when you see them.

1029
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,790
So she will often

1030
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,950
compare herself with others.

1031
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:18,630
Now,

1032
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,550
I don't say a word when I see a woman.

1033
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,430
The biggest problem is,

1034
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,360
I can't communicate with her efficiently now.

1035
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:29,210
[Macbeth]

1036
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,630
Can you two help me?

1037
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:25,750
Okay.

1038
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,990
Ye Han has arrived. Let's go in.

1039
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:27,750
Hurry up.

1040
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,710
Listen, it's all your fault.

1041
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,180
They're coming.

1042
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,230
Hurry up.

1043
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,630
Let's go. It's about to start.

1044
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,510
Let's go.

1045
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,030
Learn from her.

1046
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,230
Buy some flowers and give her.

1047
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:37,750
What a good idea this is!
