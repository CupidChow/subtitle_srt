Fine.

Why?

201

You have to finish what you started.

202

indoor training was boring.

Go ride it?

211
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,440

00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,550
"I hope Miss Li's wish will come true."

235
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,370

I only have one wish.

239

I hope that Zhong Zixuan

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,840
We were not together back then, were we?

383
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,520
At that time,

384
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,290
you still had a crush on me.

385
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,040
So, when I recall it,

386
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,940
I feel happy.

387
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,280
What are you happy about?

388
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,900
You clearly know

389
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,050
how hard it was for me to pursue you.

390
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,280
So,

391
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,510
now I will let you watch me every day.

392
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,040
My original intention has never changed.

393
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,910
Alright.

394
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,420
Hurry up and cook for me.

395
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,660
I'm hungry.

396
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,380
Your phone is ringing.

397
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,190
Answer it for me.

398
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,080
It's Lu Zheng.

399
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,350
Ye Han.

400
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,500
Hello? What's it?

401
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,740
It's an emergency.

402
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,200
Just say it.

403
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,740
Here's the thing.

404
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,150
Song Jinran

405
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,710
went out to take photos today.

406
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,720
And

407
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,280
her child caught a cold and had a fever.

408
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,260
But she can't come back in a short time.

409
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,260
And coincidentally, her home cleaner's husband

410
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,520
had a car accident and she insisted on leaving.

411
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,270
I was about to leave for

412
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,600
Song Jinran's house.

413
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,300
But a drunkard

414
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,110
came to my cafe

415
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,950
and is making trouble.

416
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,240
I can't leave.

417
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,910
I called Jiacheng and Xu Yan

418
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,590
but they don't have time either.

419
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,070
Can you go?

420
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,280
No.

421
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,240
What does this have to do with me?

422
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,770
She should figure it out herself.

423
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,740
Yes, I understand.

424
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,470
But for the sake of her child,

425
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,140
just go and help her.

426
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,750
Song Jinran doesn't have many friends

427
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,010
since she just came back from abroad.

428
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,690
She even called me.

429
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,240
I called you because I don't have any other way.

430
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,030
Go

431
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,360
and take care of the kid.

432
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,110
I really don't want to go.

433
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Hang it up.

434
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,310
Hang it up.

435
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,350
Lobsters. Do you want them steamed

436
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,670
or roasted?

437
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,320
You should go.

438
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,880
Lu Zheng is in a dilemma.

439
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,970
I don't think he can find anyone else.

440
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,280
I don't want to go.

441
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,160
But the child is sick.

442
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,200
We can't leave him alone.

443
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,630
But I told you

444
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,340
I don't want her to disturb our life anymore.

445
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,130
But she's already in our life.

446
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,510
I know

447
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,510
her staying in Shanghai

448
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,120
has affected you.

449
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,480
That made you feel uneasy.

450
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,180
That's why you drank alone at night.

451
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,210
Xiaoxiao.

452
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,440
But I've told you

453
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,020
I would be with you until your wound heals.

454
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,530
But you shouldn't escape.

455
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,000
If her disappearance

456
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,420
didn't end this,

457
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,770
I want you to end it this time.

458
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,810
Make things between you clear.

459
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,280
If so, even if she is in Shanghai

460
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,560
and even if she appears by our side,

461
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,950
we won't be affected anymore.

462
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,440
Go.

463
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,020
I'll wait for you to come back.

The temperature is still so high.

466
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,650
Sorry, Ye Han.

467
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,650
I came here as soon as I solved the problem in my cafe.

468
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,300
How could you ask Ye Han to come?

469
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,160
I muted my phone.

470
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,850
Otherwise, I would have come.

471
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,810
Alright.

472
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,800
It's okay.

Look at him.

00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,670
He has a defined nose.

481
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,900
His nose is quite similar to Ye Han's.

482
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,210
Be more reasonable, OK?

483
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,550
If he's six years old, he might be.

484
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,480
But if he's five years old, then...

485
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,680
How old do you think he is?

I really don't understand what's on your mind.

I can tell you

491

definitely no.

00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,170
Did you ask why?

572
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,530
I asked them many times,

573
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,870
but they didn't give a reasonable explanation.

574
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,770
I don't think they'll change their mind.

575
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,500
By the way,

576
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,470
there are also other brands we're negotiating with.

577
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,520
We are close to signing a contract.

578
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,620
But now,

579
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,920
they are not so sure.

580
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,030
It seems

581
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,630
they are stalling on purpose.

582
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,600
I'm afraid

583
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,200
it'll be hard for us to reach an agreement.

584
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,700
Okay, I got it.

585
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,850
You may leave now.

586
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,700
Mr. Ye.

587
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,530
What's wrong?

588
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,720
You look upset.

589
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,990
Some clients

590
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,900
suddenly told us that they didn't want to extend the contracts anymore.

591
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,670
We've cooperated for long.

592
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,530
Why?

593
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,060
I need to make a call.

594
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,870
Hello, Mr. Qiu.

595
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:30,960
It's me.

596
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,580
Xu Jiacheng of Declaration.

597
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,130
Look.

598
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,540
Our cooperation has lasted for more than three years.

599
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,140
We know each other very well.

600
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,640
I see.

601
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,560
I'm sorry.

602
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,060
Okay.

603
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,200

604
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,870
We'll talk later.

605
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,410
What's going on?

606
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,800
It's my mom.

607
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,400
My mom asked them to do so.

608
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,450
I didn't see that coming.

609
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,240
Did she do that because of Yiwen?

610
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,990
Of course.

611
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,350
Even if I spent too much time on the magazine,

612
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,510
she never interfered with what I was doing.

613
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,430
And some clients

614
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,150
were introduced by her.

615
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,820
Well,

616
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,210
what are you going to do?

617
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,310
Ye Han.

618
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,370
You know about Yiwen and me.

619
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,880
I won't compromise.

620
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,310
I understand.

621
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,780
No matter what decision you make,

622
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,120
I'm on your side.

623
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,860
We can try to

624
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,040
negotiate with our clients

625
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,350
or maintain them.

626
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,240
At worst, we can develop new ones.

627
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,970
But I think you should try to soften

628
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,300
the relationship between you and your mother.

629
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,890
Where are you going?

630
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:08,600
Jiacheng.

631
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,560
You're back.

632
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,320
Good timing.

633
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,410
Your mom made tea.

634
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,650
Come and have a drink.

635
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,000
Mom,

636
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,200
I know you're really angry this time.

637
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:30,040
But I've said what I should.

638
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,970
I won't break up with Yiwen.

639
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,230
What happened?

640
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,040
It's nothing.

641
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,350
This afternoon,

642
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,870
I met a few colleagues

643
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,800
and had an afternoon tea together.

644
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,550
They talked about Jiacheng.

645
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,990
I said

646
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,370
I was against his choice to run a magazine.

647
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,370
The sales of the magazine are declining.

648
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,050
Do you have to do this?

649
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,950
What does that have to do with me?

650
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,930
The company can't keep afloat

651
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,720
without a few advertisements?

652
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,790
Then quit.

653
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,350
Isn't it good to work at our family's company?

654
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,110
Why did you start a business?

655
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,430
What on earth have you accomplished

656
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,150
after all these years?

657
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,160
Do you have to do this?

658
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,960
Are you happy

659
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,400
to see us drifting apart?

660
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,430
Do we look like a real family

661
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,070
now?

662
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,220
Jiacheng.

663
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,370
I'm telling you.

664
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,880
I can't sleep

665
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,540
because you've driven me mad.

666
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,990
I have a headache every day.

667
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,350
What else do you want?

668
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,060
Jiacheng.

669
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,640
You seldom come back.

670
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,830
You didn't come back to fight with your mother.

671
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,910
You already

672
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,650
ignored family affairs.

673
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,590
Now you have a girlfriend

674
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,270
but you didn't consult us.

675
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,830
Do you think you did right?

676
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,190
Dad, I'm an adult.

677
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,030
Even if you are an adult,

678
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,130
we have the right to discipline you.

679
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,210
Understand?

00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,700
Also,

00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,790
just let the advertiser thing slide.

682
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,390
The paper media industry is going down anyway.

683

It won't last long.

684
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,960
It's the trend.

685
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,110
Why are you going against the trend?

686
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,570
It's time to refocus.

687
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,370

your girlfriend thing.

691
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,680
Your mother must have a reason for being against it.

692
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,030
She is more experienced than you. She knows people better than you.

693
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,580
You need to listen to her.

Who else can he take after?

705
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,420

00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,470
I'll make her think of me all the time.

761
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,000
Have you warmed up?

762
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,350
Yes.

763
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,360
Start the power training.

764
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,300
Remember to have lunch.

765
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,530
Don't be too tired.

766
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,060
You scared me.

767
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,570
Why are you here?

768
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,630
I miss you.

769
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,720
Why the long face?

770
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,270
It seems that someone

771
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,530
needs the moisture of love.

772
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:56,770
Follow me.

773
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,310
This...

774
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,190
To buy this, I queued up for a long time.

775
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,080
Try it.

776
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,550
Did you make it clear to her?

777
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,640
Not yet, right?

778
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,500
Her son suddenly appeared.

779
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,190
So, I

780
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,600
didn't find a chance to tell her.

781
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,940
Are you angry?

782
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,840
No.

783
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,110
I asked you to go.

784
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,530
Why would I be angry?

785
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,620
Well,

786
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,910
don't be unhappy, okay?

787
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,670
I'm not unhappy.

788
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,390
Maybe

789
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,910
because the competition is coming,

790
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,200
I'm a little stressed out.

791
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,800
Then after the competition,

792
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,620
let's go traveling. What do you think?

793
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,000
Let's talk about it after the competition.

794
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,960
It's too early to think about it.

795
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,950
Today,

796
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,190
I am quite tired.

797
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,920
You must take care

798
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,650
and have a good rest.

799
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,610
Okay.

800
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,270
You can go back first.

801
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,450
Remember

802
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,740
to eat the cake.

803
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,830
I'm leaving.

804
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,220
Take care.

805
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,390
Come on.

806
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,620
Are you in such a hurry?

807
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,280
You couldn't even wait for me?

808
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,920
Can't I drink it alone?

809
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,260
Yes, you can.

810
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,680
Did you quarrel with Lu Zheng?

811
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,520
We got divorced.

812
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,990
When did that happen?

813
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:12,770
Yesterday.

814
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,470
Did he do something

815
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,020
you can't stand?

816
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,230
How should I put it?

817
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,420
Neither of us

818
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,150
is 100% responsible

819
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,990
for the divorce.

820
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,950
And there is no right or wrong in marriage.

821
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,950
It's just that we aren't the right ones for each other.

822
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,870
No wonder you asked me to drink with you today.

823
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,910
I'm not going home today.

824
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,130
Let's drink until you feel better.

825
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,320
Get me a glass.

826
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,180
This is our relationship.

827
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,580
You can take me by the hand,

828
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,490
but you can't hug me.

829
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,930
