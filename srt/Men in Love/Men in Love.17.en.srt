193
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,669
♫There's no place for my heart to hide♫

194
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,080
I'm no longer a boy in his early 20s.

195
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:44,700
♫The world stops, like an illusion♫

196
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,809
I'm 33.

197
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,780
♫I thought you were calling me♫

198
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,780
So the version of me that's standing in front of you now

199
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,260
is at the youngest moment of my remaining life.

200
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,840
♫The hand I reached out touches nothing again♫

201
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,970
Yesterday, I was bolder

202
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,330
and younger than today.

203
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,370
The day before yesterday, I was more passionate than yesterday.

204
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,340
♫I want to say something♫

205
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,210
So everything I've done for you during this period

206
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,180
♫But I just stand there and stare for a long time♫

207
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,410
has been my greatest effort.

208
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,270
♫Maybe I don't want to leave♫

209
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,220
But just now, I realized something.

210
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,100
♫It still hurts♫

211
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,360
It turns out that she didn't get my efforts.

212
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,900
♫Looking back♫

213
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,920
♫I feel so much warmth again♫

214
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,790
It turns out that my efforts bothered her.

215
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,520
♫I'll be with you♫

216
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,780
So,

217
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,950
♫You know it's true♫

218
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,160
maybe I should let it go.

219
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,200
♫Memories are endless♫

220
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,000
♫But why♫

221
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,300
Compared to yesterday and the day before it,

222
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,520
I'm maturer today.

223
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,030
♫We've been with each other♫

224
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,500
Although I'm still not mature enough

225
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,130
to be considerate of your feelings,

226
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,240
♫But why can't we have each other?♫

227
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,800
I'll let go of what I have to.

228
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,140
♫I'll be with you♫

229
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,190
♫You know it's true♫

230
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,600
This is the time and space that I can give you.

231
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:04,990
♫If we can notice all the considerations♫

232
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,950
There won't be tears,

233
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,820
♫At the intersection of time♫

234
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:08,810
right?

235
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,760
♫Let's not lose each other again♫

236
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,050
Yes.

237
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,750
If the way that I handled the partings

238
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,350
was not gentlemanly enough,

239
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,960
I apologize.

240
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,760
♫On the snowy streets♫

241
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,220
I mean it.

242
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,570
♫I'm wandering alone again♫

243
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,610
♫If we can meet♫

244
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,550
♫And change our destiny♫

245
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,510
♫I'll go far away with you♫

246
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,430
♫In the future I've been dreaming of♫

247
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:52,250
♫Love is like a lost ark♫

248
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,410
♫Where can I go into the dream?♫

249
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,850
♫I don't know what to do♫

250
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,840
♫I'll be with you♫

251
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,480
♫I'll see this through♫

252
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:16,140
♫Let's greet with a smile♫

253
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,530
Hello, Jiacheng.

254
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,470
Xiaoxiao, are you okay?

255
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,750
♫At every intersection♫

256
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,520
I'm fine.

257
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,960
Where are you?

258
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,000
♫I'll be with you♫

259
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,750
On my way home.

260
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,520
I know you actually care about each other.

261
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,830
Maybe you need more time.

262
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,090
I know.

263
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,330
Xu Yan.

264
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,770
Go to my house.

265
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,910
What about you?

266
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,100
Are you going to Ye Han's place?

267
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,200
I'll go check on him.

268
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,030
I have to go, too.

269
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,150
Why?

270
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,600
I got it.

271
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,240
Is the beauty who sat next to me

272
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,790
the person who Ye Han likes?

273
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,830
But Ye Han left first.

274
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,090
And he left angrily.

275
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,720
There must be something going on between them.

276
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,830
Do you comment this much

277
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,990
at funerals, too?

278
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,310
You don't understand.

279
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,570
As a married woman,

280
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,840
I mean, as a married man,

281
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,540
this relationship

282
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,960
looks like a Disneyland

283
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,380
fantasy.

284
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,760
It's really beautiful and dreamy.

285
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,070
I have to participate in it.

286
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,790
You're such a brave kid.

287
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,170
Your fairy tale has come true.

288
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,950
You cold lawyer, what do you know?

289
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,090
Enough, stop talking nonsense.

290
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,730
Xu Yan.

291
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,760
I've told Jialin.

292
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,890
You can just go over.

293
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,550
She has arranged everything.

294
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,390
Jialin is at home,

295
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,790
and you're letting him go alone?

296
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,660
Why are you talking so much today?

297
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,040
Go back to the cafe.

298
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,550
You're not off work yet.

299
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,350
I'm the boss.

300
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,320
I can go if I want.

301
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,060
I'm warning you, I'll call Yun.

302
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,160
See you.

303
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,060
Why are you here?

304
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,320
It's not safe for Xu Yan to go to your house alone, is it?

305
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,790
Can you save me some trouble?

306
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,340
So, you came to teach me a lesson.

307
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,930
I'm here to apologize.

308
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,800
No need to explain.

309
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,900
I know why you did that.

310
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,890
Even if you know,

311
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,700
I still have to apologize.

312
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,710
I invited Xiaoxiao.

313
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,860
It's reasonable that you're mad at me.

314
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,410
What about Xiaoxiao?

315
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,540
Have you settled it?

316
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,550
She told me she went home.

317
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,980
She told me not to worry.

318
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,190
So don't worry.

319
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,840
Why should I worry?

320
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,470
Look at you two.

321
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,310
You two

322
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,310
obviously care about each other.

323
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,430
It's you two.

324
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,190
Leave me out of it.

325
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,330
Have you really made up your mind?

326
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,610
You can't decide it overnight.

327
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,630
If not today, then tomorrow.

328
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,360
If not tomorrow,

329
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,260
then the day after tomorrow.

330
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,190
Even if Xiaoxiao changes her mind?

331
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,820
The reason she's changed her mind

332
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,540
is not because of me,

333
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,760
but because of the emptiness

334
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,300
in her heart after I left.

335
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,120
Is there a difference?

336
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,170
Yes.

337
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,620
But she doesn't understand that.

338
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,190
Welcome, Mr. Xu.

339
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,040
Congratulations on stepping over the Xu family's threshold.

340
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,520
What are you wearing, Jialin?

341
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,420
Next, let me show you

342
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,690
Xu Yan and Xu Jialin's sweet home.

343
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,760
What home?

344
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,680
Stop it.

345
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,390
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.

346
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,810
What's with that look?

347
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,960
It's my love for a prey in hands, of course.

348
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,680
Stop it.

349
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,950
I'll take that room.

350
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,210
This is a sweet home that's easy to enter

351
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,110
but hard to get out of.

352
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,760
Let me show you.

353
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,710
This is the living room.

354
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,070
The living room is a public area,

355
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,260
so hygiene needs to be maintained.

356
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,760
This is your room.

357
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,750
My room is next to your room.

358
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,160
I've stayed here

359
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,160
longer than you.

360
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,290
That's even better.

361
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,730
You must be familiar with my room too, then.

362
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,730
Have a seat.

363
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,070
What is this?

364
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,580
No.

365
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,860
The tableware...

366
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,110
is too exaggerated.

367
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,760
Once you enter our home,

368
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,570
you have to follow the Xu family's rules.

369
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,240
Be careful not to burn yourself.

370
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:40,990
Okay.

371
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,790
From now on,

372
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
I'll buy

373
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,900
all the groceries.

374
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,520
I'll wash the dishes.

375
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,750
And

376
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,760
I'll clean the living room.

377
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,540
While I'm here,

378
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,080
I'll do all these things.

379
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,370
I will also tell Jiacheng.

380
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,420
Those are my rules.

381
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,599
Come in.

382
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,630
Mr. Ye, we're ready for the meeting.

383
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,470
Okay.

384
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,690
Take these to the meeting.

385
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,130
Are you not happy with any of these advertising samples?

386
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,390
Tell me honestly.

387
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,010
Do you think those look good?

388
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,589
They're quite ugly.

389
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,520
Do you like honey?

390
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,340
Yes.

391
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,670
Take it if you like it.

392
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,790
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

393
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,120
It's not just about the visual effect.

394
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,120
It concerns our friendship with our clients.

395
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,810
We are Party B.

396
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,090
How can you ask Party A to change the template

397
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,150
just because you don't like the font?

398
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,200
Advertisements are parts of our magazine, too.

399
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,420
Whether it's the advertisements or the articles,

400
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,780
they all represent our magazine's aesthetics.

401
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,490
I won't agree to this.

402
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,710
Okay.

403
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,620
How about this?

404
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,840
I'll talk to them.

405
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,920
I'll go.

406
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,680
You can't solve the problem.

407
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,560
Next.

408
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,840
Here's the thing.

409
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,200
There's a problem with tomorrow's shoot.

410
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,670
At first, Yaoyao and Tong Yiwen

411
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,790
were supposed to shoot together.

412
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,950
But now the brand

413
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,710
insists on using only Yaoyao.

414
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,080
We don't know why.

415
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,850
The original theme combining old and new was pretty good.

416
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,050
Have you confirmed it with the brand?

417
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,900
Is there any room for discussion?

418
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,970
We've talked to them repeatedly.

419
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,760
But they didn't explain the specific reason.

420
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,670
They're just insisting on it.

421
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,800
Yaoyao and Yiwen are in the same company, aren't they?

422
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,730
This kind of thing

423
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,440
must be Yaoyao's doing.

424
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,120
Stop gossiping without evidence.

425
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,150
What solution do you have?

426
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,320
If it's just Yaoyao,

427
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,020
the theme,

428
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,020
the outfits, the props, and the venue all have to be changed.

429
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,460
We'll be quite rushed.

430
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
I think we'll have to work overtime.

431
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,400
You haven't gone to school yet?

432
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,640
I don't have class today.

433
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,060
Let's go shopping, then.

434
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,010
I don't want to.

435
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,100
What's wrong with you today?

436
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,190
Are you okay?

437
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,970
I'm fine.

438
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,780
It's just...

439
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,560
I didn't sleep well at night.

440
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,880
I couldn't sleep until morning.

441
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,110
Are you thinking about Ye Han?

442
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,680
You can't solve the problem even if you lie down like this.

443
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,960
You have to talk to him face to face.

444
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,040
I'm the one who decided to give up.

445
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,110
It's okay.

446
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,870
I'll be fine after a nap.

447
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,410
You should go.

448
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,240
Get back to work.

449
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,520
Don't worry about me.

450
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,450
Really?

451
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,010
Okay.

452
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,060
The shooting schedule

453
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,130
can be postponed for two days.

454
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,840
It takes time to adjust the shooting plan.

455
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,510
But the current problem is,

456
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,830
even their agency can't even handle it.

457
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,990
It's even more inconvenient for us to interfere.

458
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,790
After all, this is a collaboration with the brand.

459
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,520
It's already been decided.

460
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,750
How could they change it so easily?

461
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,910
If you are blinded by love

462
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,710
and just want Yiwen to do it,

463
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,040
I'll find a reason.

464
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,270
She's finally made some progress

465
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,440
in this industry,

466
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,250
but now she's being bullied because of this.

467
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,760
And it's happening right under my nose.

468
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,680
I feel like an accomplice now.

469
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,150
How can I ignore it?

470
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,590
I see.

471
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,390
I'll handle it.

472
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,330
Yiwen is a professional model.

473
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,850
The photos will look good.

474
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,200
Thank you.

475
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,140
Yiwen?

476
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,940
She found out so soon?

477
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,550
Impossible.

478
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,100
Then why is she calling me?

479
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,480
Answer it first.

480
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,210
You'll know when you answer it.

481
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,440
Turn on the speaker.

482
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,540
Hello.

483
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,320
Hello, Mr. Ye.

484
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,310
Something bad happened.

485
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,430
I need your help.

486
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,790
What's wrong?

487
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,590
You...

488
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,880
Did something happen?

489
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,300
It's not me.

490
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
It's Xiaoxiao.

491
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,430
She's sick.

492
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,390
I called her,

493
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,190
but she didn't answer.

494
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,670
I'm worried about her.

495
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,310
Can you go to our house

496
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,640
and help me check on her?

497
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,660
I...

498
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,870
I really couldn't think of anyone else to ask.

499
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,040
Thank you.

500
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,240
It sounds serious.

501
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,620
Be careful.

502
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,440
Okay.

503
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,310
Xiaoxiao.

504
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,320
Xiaoxiao.

505
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,790
I'm coming in.

506
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,840
Xiaoxiao.

507
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,430
Are you okay?

508
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,110
Ye Han?

509
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,160
Why are you here?

510
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,970
Am I dreaming?

511
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,230
Why are you talking nonsense?

512
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,790
Do you have a fever?

513
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,760
You are a little hot.

514
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,180
Let me get you some water.

515
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,910
Drink the water first.

516
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,640
Thank you.

517
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,910
Do you have any medicine at home?

518
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,260
Medicine?

519
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,580
What medicine?

520
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,520
Yiwen told me everything.

521
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,100
Drink the water first.

522
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,410
What did she tell you?

523
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,280
Didn't you catch a cold?

524
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,030
I didn't.

525
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,130
Then why was your face so hot just now?

526
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,830
I was sleeping.

527
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,990
Maybe it was a little stuffy.

528
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,450
I didn't catch a cold.

529
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,350
Fine.

530
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,810
If you're fine,

531
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,940
I'll go back.

532
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,810
Wait.

533
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,140
It must be hot.

534
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,710
Are you okay?

535
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,260
I'll get you a towel.

536
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,120
It's okay.

537
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,240
I'm leaving.

538
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,630
Let's take care of it first.

539
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,310
It doesn't matter.

540
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,250
I don't think anyone cares.

541
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Xiaoxiao,

542
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,930
why are you trying to be nice to someone who's so cold?

543
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,340
He changed his attitude so quickly,

544
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,600
as if he's flipping pancakes.

545
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:05,670
♫I'll be heartbroken no matter how careful I am♫

546
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:14,020

I'm sorry.

00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,390
I'll leave soon.

565
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,550
It's me.

566
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,130
Ye Han.

567
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,030
Why are you here?

568
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,080
Are you following me?

569
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,100
This is the entrance of my company.

570
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,560
Don't think I came here on purpose.

571
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,980
I...

572
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,780
I was just passing by.

573
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,720
I just happened to pass by.

574
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,030
Why did you drink so much?

575
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,720
No.

576
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,890
I need to talk to you.

577
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,050
I need to talk to you.

578
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,570
Here you are.

579
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,760
Here's your shirt.

580
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,290
From now on,

581
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,910
we won't have any reasons

582
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,370
to see each other again.

583
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,480
You're drunk.

584
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,380
I'll call a taxi for you.

585
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,220
How can you say it so easily?

586
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,590
How could you say goodbye so easily?

587
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,970
Why is it so easy for you?

588
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,450
Why is it so hard for me?

589
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,050
Xiaoxiao,

590
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,240
can you stop...

591
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,140
[IN WORK]

592
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,000
Stop messing around, Li Xiaoxiao.

593
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,710
Don't make me waver anymore.

594
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,990
Do you still like me?

595
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,660
You...

596
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,350
don't like me anymore, right?

597
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,140
But I'm starting to like you now.

598
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,520
What should I do?

599
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,230
Coming.

600
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,260
Is she still alive?

601
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,770
She's still alive now.

602
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,570
But tomorrow,

603
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,240
she might want to die.

604
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,520
My head hurts.

605
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
You're awake.

606
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,970
Sit up and drink some honey water.

607
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,990
Thank you.

608
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,530
I really wanted to record what you looked like yesterday.

609
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,930
Why do you always get so drunk?

610
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,890
You're a girl.

611
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,680
I learned it from you.

612
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,180
You only learned the bad sides.

613
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,280
Did you

614
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,670
change my clothes for me?

615
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,540
Or what?

616
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,230
Who do you want to change it for you?

617
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,480
It's not like I haven't seen it before.

618
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,060
Why can't I remember

619
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,190
how I came back yesterday?

620
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,190
You've lost your memory?

621
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,390
Do you want me to remind you?

622
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,240
Ye Han,

623
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,550
don't say goodbye.

624
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,010
Don't leave me, okay?

625
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,500
I think

626
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,670
I'm starting to like you.

627
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,470
I can't live anymore!

628
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,390
It seems you remember now.

629
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,750
From now on,

630
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,830
I'll be haunted by my embarrassing past.

631
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,750
Get up and eat.

632
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,100
I have to go.

633
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,750
Is this my last breakfast?

634
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,070
It's so humiliating.

635
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,320
Mr. Ye.

636
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,720
I've received the modifications

637
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,360
for the Lawrence advertisement proposal.

638
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,820
The font has been changed.

639
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,150
It's better this way.

640
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,430
The person in charge didn't lose his temper?

641
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,940
President Xu took care of it himself.

642
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,960
They didn't say much about it.

643
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,880
Okay.

644
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,540
Mr. Ye.

645
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,630
This month's "His Story"

646
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,230
published the article on fur

647
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,710
alongside some photos with animals.

648
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,630
Have you seen it?

649
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,470
Yes.

650
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,550
Something happened, right?

651
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,750
Getting the model to wear fur and pose with animals.

652
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,190
I don't know what Bai Sha was thinking.

653
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,030
Yeah.

654
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,790
Not only did this attract

655
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,990
the attention of the Animal Protection Association,

656
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,040
but the netizens are also criticizing them.

657
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,710
See?

658
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,400
That is what happens when you only focus on visual effects.

659
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,070
Yes.

660
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:25,950
By the way,

661
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,020
the shooting plan I mentioned last time,

662
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,230
I put it upstairs.

663
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:29,670
Okay.

664
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,340
Nice shoes.

665
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,130
Thank you.

666
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,990
You're in a good mood today.

667
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,560
I'm in a good mood.

668
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Li Xiaoxiao,

669
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,610
you've got quite a lot of influence.

670
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,270
The lights over there should be lower.

671
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,640
Adjust the lights over there, too.

672
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,790
Okay, thank you.

673
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,270
Okay.

674
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,230
President Xu.

675
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,910
Hello, Director.

676
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:01,870
Why are you so free today?

677
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,510
You came all the way here to take a look.

678
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,590
I'm just stopping by.

679
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,040
[The Photo-shooting Site of "Declaration“]

680
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,750
Thank you for your hard work today.

681
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,490
Don't mention it.

682
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,750
Let me show you around.

683
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,790
Who is that?

684
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,659
He's the boss of "Declaration."

685
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,630
He looks familiar.

686
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,969
I think I've seen him somewhere.

687
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:18,409
Maybe you've seen him.

688
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,750
He's a big shot in the industry.

689
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,909
The theme of our shoot this time

690
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:28,639
is "Battle Beneath the Skirt."

691
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,550
This is a combination of tenderness and toughness.

692
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,270
So,

693
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,190
I hope you two can bring out

694
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,790
-the tense atmosphere.
-Hello, President Xu.

695
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,510
Hello, President Xu.

696
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,130
I've heard a lot about you.

697
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,070
Hello.

698
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:48,580
Nice to meet you,

699
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,600
Tong Yiwen.

700
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,150
Hello, President Xu.

701
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,429
Director, I have something to discuss with you.

702
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:56,870
Okay.

703
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:57,330
Here.

704
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,900
You came all the way here.

705
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,340
Thank you.

706
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,270
I'm very happy to come to the site.

707
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,740
I hope we have

708
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,620
more opportunities to work together in the future.

709
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,200
Okay, maybe there are.

710
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,290
Good luck today.

711
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:12,730
Okay.

712
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,320
Okay, good.

713
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,410
Yiwen's expression is very good.

714
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,340
Keep it up, Yiwen.

715
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,940
Keep it up.

716
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,600
Okay.

717
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,840
Yaoyao.

718
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,530
Don't widen your eyes so much.

719
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,550
Look sad.

720
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,930
Yiwen looks good.

721
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,650
This won't do.

722
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,100
Yaoyao,

723
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,230
you are a female warrior.

724
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,830
So there should be more toughness in your eyes.

725
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,610
Okay, let's do it again.

726
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,240
Okay.

727
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,530
Raise your hands a little higher.

728
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:54,830
Higher.

729
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,110
Higher.

730
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,350
Change your pose.

731
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,120
Change your pose, Yaoyao.

732
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,980
This won't do.

733
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,490
Yaoyao, can you change to another pose?

734
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,190
We need this to be...

735
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,950
What do you want?

736
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,750
Can't you make it clear in one go?

737
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,090
Be professional.

738
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,780
Let's do it again.

739
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,520
Okay, let's do it again.

740
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,190
Okay.

741
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,330
Let's do it.

742
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,990
Okay.

743
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,210
Yiwen!

744
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,080
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

745
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:28,930
I'm fine.

746
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,480
Yaoyao.

747
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,130
Yaoyao, are you okay?

748
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,870
What happened?

749
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,440
-Does it hurt?
-I'm fine.

750
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,810
It hurts a little.

751
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,640
Are you hurt?

752
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,790
What happened?

753
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,040
How are you?

754
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,510
I'm fine.

755
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,990
Do you want to go to the hospital?

Can't you see who's injured?

759
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,590
Yiwen.

760
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,560
I'm really sorry.

Sorry.

No.

767
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,040
Exactly.

I'm sorry.

773
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,260
I didn't know you two had that kind of relationship.

774
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,670
I knew it, I was wondering

775
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,140
why I had to shoot the cover with Yiwen today.

776
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,270
The company arranged this for me.

777
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,630
It has nothing to do with Xu Jiacheng.

778
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,710
Yiwen, I really envy you.

779
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,780
You have such a good boyfriend.

Everyone says I'm Little Yiwen,

782
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,180
but I'm not as lucky as you.

783
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,070
I have to rely on myself.

784
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,670
I really hope you can rely on yourself.

Don't rely on the title of 'Little Yiwen'

to create hype.

787
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,740
Because I don't want my name

788
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,770
to be associated with a model

789
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,390
who can't even shoot a cover.

790
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,240
I'll go bandage it.

791
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,000
You go ahead.

It's not worth it.

Xu Jiacheng,

795
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,550
did you arrange this shoot?

796
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,150
How many times have I told you?

797
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,300
Please stay out of my business.

798
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,740
It was supposed to be you two.

799
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,830
Besides, you're injured.

800
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,030
I can't stand by, doing nothing.

801
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,150
But because of your presence,

802
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,280
things are even more difficult for me.

803

Please don't help me anymore.

Yiwen!

00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,000
Do you think it's easy for me to do this?

don't say goodbye.
