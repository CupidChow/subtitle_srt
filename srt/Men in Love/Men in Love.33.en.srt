No matter how busy we are,

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,250
we‘ll have to keep in touch.

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,540
In the future,

00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,380
we may not be able to see each other often,

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,680
but

don't forget our friendship.

10

How could I forget

11
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,840
the three years we spent together?

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,880
You are my breath

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,610

14
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,700
I believe our friendship

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,460
will last forever.

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,830

let's meet at this very place.

20
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,730
No one should break the promise.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,510
Deal.

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,990
I won't forget it.

23
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,580
Let's go.

24

-Indeed.
-Nothing, right?

38

Impossible.

46

-Don't…
-You have the right to remain silent.

00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,830
It'll be no fun if you're sore losers.

Why don't you let me win?

51
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,390
Cut it out.

52
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,990
You cheated.

53
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,750
We've played cards with you for over ten years.

54
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,870

55
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,600

57
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,710

Do you know

64
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,270
the day we agreed

65
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,150
to check the Time Box

66
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,329

00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,560
What is the Time Box?

68
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,030
It's passed?

69
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,390
So, it means it has been over fifteen years

70
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,450
since we graduated from high school?

71
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,340
So what is it?

72
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,829
It's what we buried together

00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,310
on the last day of high school.

74
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,470
Why don't I remember?

75
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,160
You brought us to bury it.

76
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,310
That's impossible.

77
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,370
I would never have let you

78
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,770
do such a childish thing.

79
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,440
I didn't expect

80
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,690
that after fifteen years,

81
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,650
we are still together.

82
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,710
Our friendship lasted unexpectedly long.

83
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,970
Why was that?

84
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,960
So,

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,530
are you going or not?

86
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,630
Do we have to go?

87
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,800
Let's drive there tonight.

88
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,200
There's a traffic jam now.

89
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,040
I drank, so I can't drive.

92
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,550
were the letters we wrote each other.

93
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,670
They were about what we wanted to tell

each other until fifteen years later.

95
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,550

the Time Box yet.

97
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,230

00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,090
I'm just an old craftsperson
who loves to embroider.

178
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,830

Hello.

187
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,220

188
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,590
I'm flattered.

189
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,280
I am still a rookie in the industry,

190
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,080
so I want to seek advice from you.

191
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,710
Ask Ms. Lin if you have any questions.

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,510
Okay.

193
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,110
Ms. Lin,

194
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,380
I'm designing a dress now.

195
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,750
Although it's of a modern style,

00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,720
I want to add

197
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,480
some Suzhou embroidery elements.

I would like to seek advice from you.

That's an excellent idea.

201
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,240
But first, I need to know

202
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,610
the fabric you use.

203
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,630
For different fabrics,

00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,630

Why do you stop publication suddenly?

225
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,280
The higher-ups said

226
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,690
the print media is outdated

227
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,920

00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,950
You can do whatever you want

384
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,210
without scruples.

385
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,460
Big sis,

386
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,120
are you so old?

387
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:01,880
What?

388
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,360
Did you give up on that man?

389
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,720
I don't know.

390
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,110
I was wondering

391
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,210
if what I've done in the past ten years

392
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,640
was meaningful.

393
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,040
But loving someone itself

394
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,110
is meaningful,

395
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,370
isn't it?

396
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,950
I used to think so, too.

397
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,700
So I...

398
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,690
kept

399
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,600
moving forward.

400
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,640
But now,

401
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,930
maybe because I've grown up,

402
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,510
I started to have all kinds of concerns.

403
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,910
It seems that no matter how hard I try,

404
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,520
everything will go back to its original place.

405
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,270
So,

406
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,580
even a brave person like me

407
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,280
started to be afraid of getting hurt.

408
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,720
I'm just saying.

409
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,510
Don't be influenced by me.

410
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,190
You have a bright future.

411
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,030
Okay.

412
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,190
I know.

413
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,390
But remember,

414
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,730
don't forget to

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,450
like my Moments.

416
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,830
Don't forget me.

417
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,670
Don't feel that I'm annoying

418
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,250
if I complain to you every day.

419
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,290
No problem.

I bought you some water and food.

424
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,650
Is it enough?

425
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,550
Yes.

426
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,230
Thank you.

only count on you.

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,270
Be good to her.

Don't worry. I will.

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,430
She won't see me.

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,210
I'll call her.

Don't tell her I was here.

Yiwen.

467
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,280
I want to ask you about something.

468
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,590
How long haven't you

469
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,560
contacted your dad?

470
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,760
Why do you ask about him suddenly?

471
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,540
I don't want to hide it from you.

472
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,840
Last night,

473
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,070
I ran into him.

474
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,240
Where?

00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,460
Downstairs.

00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,700
I took you home last night.

477
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,830
I saw someone looking at you sneakily.

478
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,400
So I went to ask him.

479
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,620
I didn't expect him to be your dad.

480
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,480
What did he tell you?

481
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,340
He asked me who I was

482
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,630
and if I was your boyfriend.

483
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,860
He told me he hadn't eaten for a long time.

484
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,640
He asked me to buy him something to eat.

485
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,860
I took him to the convenience store.

486
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,530
I saw him coughing.

487
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,800
I went out to buy medicine for him.

488
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,860
But he disappeared after I came back.

489
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,750
If you see him again,

490
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,320
just take him as invisible.

491
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,050
But after all,

492
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,360
he is your father.

493
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,320
He doesn't deserve it.

494
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,610
I know you hate him.

495
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,450
But now,

496
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,930
he's really pitiful.

497
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,340
You feel sorry for him?

498
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,430
So you think I'm cold-blooded?

499
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,550
No.

500
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,950
Just because I have his blood,

501
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,640
I'll be indebted to him all my life?

502
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,610
That's not what I meant.

503
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,140
What do you mean?

504
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,410
I hope you can stay out of this.

505
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,790
I don't want our relationship to be affected

506
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,790
because of him.

507
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,650
I'm going to work.

508
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,160

00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,940
Tomorrow,

You are also the boss of this company.

513
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,750
Do you want everyone in the company

514
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,680
to pay for your artistic pursuits?

But it doesn't mean

518
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,150
we won't die.

00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,340
Why?

528
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,690
I have an important work dinner to attend.

529
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,220
I'm sorry.

530
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,450
Fine.

531
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,050
Are you going to drink tonight?

532
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,930
Maybe.

533
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,340
When you're done,

534
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,550
I'll go there and drive for you.

535
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,830
I can send you home.

536
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,310
Don't bother.

537
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,150
I can just call a chauffeur.

538
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,640
I'm glad to be a chauffeur for my boyfriend.

539
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,260
Besides,

540
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,930
we can go on a date in passing.

541
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,240
Okay.

542
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,340
See you tonight.

Bye.

545
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,280
I've heard

546
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,710
a lot about Mr. Ye.

547
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,380
The "Declaration" you operated,

548
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,960
in my opinion,

00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,920

It's my honor to be here today.

553
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,820
Mr. Hu,

554
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,990
I heard that you were the first one

555
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,330
to invest in TD Video.

556
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,790
When will you invest in

557
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,120
the magazine industry?

558
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,440
Well,

559
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,010
I've always felt differently

560
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,670
about the magazine industry.

561
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,590
Back then,

562
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,630
when I first started to work,

563
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,040
the first project I invested in

564
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,080
was

565
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,560
the magazine "Close-up."

566
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,880
Mr. Hu,

567
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,270
what do you think

568
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,650
of our industry's prospect?

569
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,760
To be honest,

570
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,780
I'm not optimistic about

571
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,850
the traditional print media industry.

572
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,310
After all, people's lifestyle has changed.

573
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,270
The influence of the Internet

00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,840
is getting bigger and bigger.

575
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,350
People are more and more dependent on it.

576
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,390
Look at people in the street.

577
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,850
Everyone has a cell phone.

578
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,530
They're all busy looking at their phones.

579
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,530
Indeed.

580
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,770
The channels for information

581
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,950
are more and more diversified

582
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,270
and "webified."

583
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,240
But it doesn't necessarily mean

584
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,750
the decline of the print media.

585
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,200
As the saying goes,

586
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,960
most of the time,

587
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,600
what's important for a meal

588
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,360
is our mood while we're eating.

589
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,360
The same goes for reading.

590
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,230
Most of the time, readers need

591
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,940
the mood of reading.

592
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,560
Mr. Ye is right.

593
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,440
No matter how the world changes,

594
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,520
the readers' desire for content

595
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,820
will never change,

596
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,970
so I think

597
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,750
digital magazines

598
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,410
are a new opportunity for us.

599
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,660
Look.

600
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,750
What Mr. Hu said

601
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,860
has given us directions.

602
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,910
Here, I suggest

603
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:41,450
a toast from us all

604
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,290
to Mr. Hu.

605
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,550
-Okay.
-Come on.

606
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,750
Come on.

607
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,630
Sorry, everyone.

608
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,750
I'm late.

609
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,720
Jinran.

610
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,540
Sit down.

611
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,480
We're all waiting for you.

612
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,530
Let me introduce her.

613
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,760
This is Song Jinran,

614
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,600
a famous photographer.

615
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,000
Please work with her

616
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,890
in the future if there's a chance.

617
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,890
Here.

618
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,840
I'm Song Jinran.

619
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,190
Nice to meet you all.

620
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,200
Nice to meet you.

621
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,630
Come on.

622
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,560
Nice to meet you.

623
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,130
Look.

624
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,120
How about this?

625
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,410
-Do I look good?
-You're just going to drive him home.

626
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,830
Do you need to be so pretty?

627
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,040
We haven't dated for days.

628
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,860
We have both been busy.

629
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,090
I have to remind him

630
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,430
how pretty

631
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,590
his girlfriend looks.

632
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,810
Go ahead.

633
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,420
Don't keep your customer waiting.

634
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,620
I'm off then.

635
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,360
Come on.

636
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,830
Let's propose a toast.

637
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,310
Okay.

638
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,380
Eat something before you drink.

639
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,040
Ye,

640
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,150
Jinran has been recommending you

641
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,030
to me.

642
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,970
Now that we've met today,

643
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,600
you're really handsome.

644
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,920
Mr. Hu,

645
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,960
another toast to you.

646
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,290
Okay.

647
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,560
The transformation of the magazine

648
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,450
is the trend.

649
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,210
You're a smart man.

650
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,850
You should understand this.

651
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,520
However,

652
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,260
it's not easy to transform.

653
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,310
It not only needs a lot of funds

654
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,110
but also needs you,
the founder of the magazine,

655
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,920
to invest in it and to persist.

656
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,860
Mr. Hu,

657
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,840
I've known Mr. Ye for a long time.

658
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,270
I watched him

659
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,600
establish "Declaration" from scratch.

660
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,970
He's undoubtedly capable of doing it.

661
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,780
How about this?

662
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,390
Let's make an appointment.

663
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,720
Let's visit

664
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,810
your company

665
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,910
and discuss more about it by then.

666
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,840
Mr. Hu.

667
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,710
Nice meeting you today.

668
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,690
Maybe another day.

669
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,370
I'll ask you to visit our place some other day.

670
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,710
But I suddenly remembered

671
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,310
I have something to do.

672
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,790
I might have to leave now.

673
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,790
Excuse me.

674
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,190
Mr. Hu, I'm sorry.

675
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,310
Let me check on him.

676
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:16,490
Ye Han.

677
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,340
Ye Han.

678
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,130
Ye Han, don't act impulsively.

679
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,210
I think I've made myself clear.

680
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,890
Can you stay out of my business?

681
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,230
Can you stay away from me?

682
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,130
I'm helping you, Ye Han.

683
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,050
I don't need it.

684
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,840
But "Declaration" needs it.

685
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,020
I think

686
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,270
Mr. Hu is a great opportunity for you.

687
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,060
Really?

688
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,080
But I think

689
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,250
this is our magazine's business.

690
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,550
We don't need an outsider to worry about it.

691
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,560
The seed of "Declaration" sprouted

692
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,810
because I put in effort, too.

693
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,350
I don't want to see it fail.

694
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,110
That's why I must do this.

695
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,590
Of course,

696
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,400
I also want to make up

697
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,170
for my harm to you.

698
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,390
Do you think you can make up for it
just because you want to?

699
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,360
Right.

700
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,620
You're always

701
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,590
so self-righteous.

702
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,470
You say whatever you want to say

703
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,470
and do whatever you want.

704
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,570
Ye Han,

705
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,240
am I

706
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,350
such a selfish person in your eyes?

707
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,480
Are you not?

708
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,760
Tell me.

709
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,210
Why did you have to end up like this?

710
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,150
You disappeared suddenly.

711
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,940
Do you know

712
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,120
I've been looking for you like crazy?

713
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,240
When I found out you went abroad,

714
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,820
my first reaction was to be glad.

715
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,030
I was glad you were safe.

716
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,890
Yes.

717
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,960
Ye Han.

718
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,430
I did you wrong back then.

719
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,660
I really needed that chance.

720
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,520
But…

721
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,080
I never stopped you
from pursuing your dream, did I?

722
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,100
But I didn't want to

723
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,530
fulfill my dream at the cost of your dream.

724
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:24,930
What?

725
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,040
So,

726
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,380
she wants you to go with her?

727
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,190
She didn't say that.

728
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,600
It's me who wanted to go with her.

729
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,090
If both of you leave,

730
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,710
what about us starting a business together?

731
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,240
We just moved into this office.

732
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,070
Even if I'm not here,

733
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,030
you can continue to run the magazine.

734
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,430
Bro, we won't have the Editor-in-Chief!

735
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,110
You're the Editor-in-Chief!

736
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,570
If you just wanted to dabble in this,

737
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,030
why did you drag me into it?

738
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,040
I really didn't mean to dabble in it.

739
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,740
Then, what are you doing?

740
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,160
Have you considered others' feelings?

741
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,520
I really don't want to lose Song Jinran.

742
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,900
In fact, I'm really reluctant to leave.

743
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,490
I'm more reluctant than anyone else.

744
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,820
This is the magazine we created from scratch.

745
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,940
This is also my dream.

746
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,890
Every word in the magazine has my effort in it.

747
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,400
Ye Han,

748
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,900
I know you love her.

749
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,720
But to fulfill her dream,

750
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
you'll lose yours.

751
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,390
Is it worth it?

752
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,290
Isn't there any other way?

753
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,670
If this is the price

754
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,710
I must pay to be with her,

755
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,300
I accept it.

756
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,640
I've known you for a long time.

757
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,600
That was the first time

758
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,180
I've seen such a big fight between you two.

759
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,790
I know

760
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,250
you wanted to give up "Declaration"

761
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,490
to go abroad with me.

762
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,470
But how can I

763
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,040
let you give up your dream for me?

764
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,390
I can't.

765
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,130
I couldn't let you do that.

766
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,890
When I received your proposal ring,

767
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,600
I was vexed.

768
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,600
I've thought over and over

769
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,070
whether I should reject you.

770
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,870
Was it right for me to reject you?

771
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,770
But I felt

772
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,150
that in a relationship,

773
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,190
no one should sacrifice themselves.

774
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,680
This kind of relationship is too heavy. I...

775
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,180
I couldn't accept it. Nor could I afford it.

776
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,340
I was scared.

777
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:05,330

to have it both ways.

Ye Han,

779
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,970
I wanted to take you away with me.

780

But

781
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,810

782

00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:59,130
Take care when you're in Beijing.

950
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,520
Keep in touch.

951
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,670
Okay, Lu.

952
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,710
I'll work with you when I'm back.

953
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,490
I may not be able to pay your salary then.

954
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,400
Nonsense.

955
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,860
By then, your business will be bigger.

956
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,640
You'll open a chain store.

957
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,120
Fine.

958
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,210
Thank you for your lucky words.

959
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,800
Okay, Lu, I'm leaving.

960
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,060
Take care.

961
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,050
Are you going on a trip?

962
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,270
No.

963
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,930
I'm going to Beijing to study.

964
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,860
I wish you all the best.

965
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,280
Can I talk to you?

966
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,450
Is there anything?

967
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,470
You may think

968
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,040
I'm a little nosy.

969
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,660
But I should tell you this

970
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,160
as Jialin's friend.

971
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,920
What do you want to say?

972
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,700
Jialin and I are just friends.

973
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,830
We did what we did just to provoke you.

974
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,830
I know.

975
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,550
Jialin told you that?

976
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,320
I'm a few years older than you.

977
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,450
I could tell.

978
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,730
What else?

979
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,210
Also,

980
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,770
everyone can see that

981
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,750
you and Jialin like each other.

982
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,620
It's not just her wishful thinking.

983
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,410
Right?
