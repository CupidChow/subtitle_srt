Is he gone?

5
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,130
I think so.

6
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,250
Can you promise me

7
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,130
you'll sort out your unrequited love affair soon?

8
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,030
You think I'm stupid.

9
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,920
You're not stupid.

10
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,130
You're very beautiful.

11
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,190
But you don't seem to know that.

12
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,670
In the end,

13
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,829
he still asked

14
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,270
the security guard to let us out.

15
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,820
How embarrassing.

16
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,810
I'm the one who should be embarrassed.

17
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,210
I'm also the one who called my friend

18
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,329
for help.

19
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,390
We shouldn't have run away.

20
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,810
You should've just told the security guard

21
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,030
that you know the person who rented the place.

22
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,860
I didn't plan to run at first.

23
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,110
Someone was feeling guilty

24
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,750
and dragged me and ran.

25
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,490
Okay.

26
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,400
It's my fault.

27
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,720
It's good that we're out.

28
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,980
I'm leaving.

29

I'll take you home.

00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,910
have to keep your word.

What's up?

39
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,920
I have one more condition.

40
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,890
You said you'll keep your word.

41
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,250
I haven't even left yet.

42
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,130
I want to publish your photo

on next month's Declaration.

45
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,670
Why?

46
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,670
Well, for our magazine,

47
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,810
there's a monthly section

48
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,670

there?

56
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,100
What photo? A selfie?

57
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,180
A selfie won't do.

58
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,970
It has to be a photo taken in a studio.

59
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,900
Like the kind

60
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,630
that celebrities and models do,

61
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,100
like a poster?

62
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,570
Yes.

63
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,990
Is it

64
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,210
inconvenient for you?

65
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:34,930
No.

66
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,550
I'm willing.

67
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,200

accept this condition.

69
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,120
There are some excuses that I can't even find myself.

78

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,030
It's too soft, I can't hear anything.

Stand up.

85
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,410

about apologizing.

90
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,350
Really?

91
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,340
Judging from his posture,

92
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,370
I don't think he's sincere.

Do you have to ask me once every month?

156
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,710
If I answer you twelve times now,

157
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,650
would you stop asking me for the rest of the year?

158
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,650
Let me tell you.

159
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,920
If you don't want to take over your dad's company,

Don't we have anything else to talk about?

168
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,030

176
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,340
I don't plan to get married now.

177
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,610
Maybe when I'm 40.

178
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,900
I may think about it after I turn 40.

Are you trying to piss me off?

180
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,770
I didn't mean to.

181
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,220
But you always say this every time I come back.

182
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,980

is to let you gain some experience.

188

You have to come back to the company sooner or later.

189
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,430
As for when,

let's not force him.

191
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,720
But you need to be mentally prepared.

00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,300
About your marriage,

193
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,940
you're not young anymore.

194
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,740
It's time to put it on the agenda.

195
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,220
Starting tomorrow,

196
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,650
you'll go on a blind date once a week.

197
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,350
I've already made arrangements.

198
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,650
This Wednesday afternoon,

199
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,830
at our hotel.

200
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,510
I've seen that girl.

201
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,670
She has a great profile.

202
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,750
Mom, don't do this.

203
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,150
Please, I'm begging you.

204
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,290
Madam, it's time to eat.

205
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,630
Dinner is ready.

206
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,490
Come on.

207
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,470
I'm telling you.

208
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,680
Wednesday afternoon.

209
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,800
Don't be late.

210
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,120
Okay.

211
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,870
Come and eat.

212
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,590
Come.

213
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,990
What are you waiting for?

214
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,010
I'm exhausted.

215
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,950
Every time you go to the supermarket,

216
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,470
you act like you haven't eaten anything for weeks.

217
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,550
You take everything.

218
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,530
I'm already 30.

219
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,720
I wanted to get some cherries today

220
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,870
but you stopped me.

221
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,280
I can't even buy whatever groceries I want to buy.

222
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,790
What's the point of living?

223
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,110
By your logic,

224
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,720
I can't even buy all the mineral water that I want to buy.

225
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,210
That's so sad.

226
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,740
We're still in the primary stages

227
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,870
of satisfying our appetites.

228
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,010
My wish for next year is

229
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,550
to find my future husband.

Xiaoxiao.

235
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,230
Mr. Ye.

236
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,230
You didn't forget tomorrow's shoot, did you?

237
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,230
Of course not.

238
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,140
I haven't even had dinner.

239
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,810
I'm just waiting for tomorrow's shoot.

240
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,140
You're very dedicated.

241
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,220
Your voice sounds different on the phone.

242
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,620
How so?

243
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,170
It just sounds like a voice on the phone.

244
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,080
Phone voices and actual voices

245
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,520
always sound different.

246
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,340
You called me

247
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,490
just for this?

248
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,670
Yes.

249
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,630
Rest early.

250
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,800
Good night.

251
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,140
Good night.

252
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,950
[Declaration]

253
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,690
Hello.

254
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,480
Are you Ms. Li Xiaoxiao?

255
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,110
Hello.

256
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:27,930
Hello.

257
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,290
You need to put on makeup first.

258
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:31,880
Are these clothes

259
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,500
all for me?

260
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,420
Yes.

261
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,880
Mr. Ye told us to make sure

262
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,250
that you get to pick out something satisfactory.

263
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,550
These are all new styles from this season.

264
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,480
You can try them on if you like them.

265
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,660
Thank you.

266
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,800
Let me introduce.

267
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,070
This is Kevin,

268
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:52,780
[Declaration]

269
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,440
one of the finest makeup artists in China.

270
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,630
Hello.

271
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,110
Hello, I’m Kevin.

272
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,070
I’m Li Xiaoxiao.

273
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,410
So, you're our superstar for the day?

274
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,250
No, you flatter me.

275
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,880
I’m just an ordinary Physical Education teacher.

276
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,000
That's interesting.

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,880
I've seen you on TV.

278
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,710
You're very good with makeup.

279
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,990
Thank you.

280
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,430
Mr. Ye asked me here today

281
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,960
saying that there's an extraordinary model

282
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,110
that I have to attend to personally.

283
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,590
He was worried that others won't make the cut.

284
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,720
I should be the one he's worried about.

285
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,250
You're really extraordinary.

286
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,930
Typical models don't exude your vibe.

287
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,290
I'm flattered.

288
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,900
Okay, have a seat.

289
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,160
Mr. Ye.

290
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:26,960
Mr. Ye.

291
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,760
I've never seen you in the dressing room.

292
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,530
Yes.

293
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,400
Because she is

294
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,430
an extremely important model to me.

295
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,830
You guys can get started on the makeup first.

296
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,930
I'll go check out the set.

297
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:38,700
Okay.

298
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,080
The light needs to be adjusted.

299
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,350
Okay, no problem.

300
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,410
The model is ready.

301
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,080
[Shooting in progress, quiet please]

302
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,010
Is it strange?

303
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,410
Very strange.

304
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,250
How?

305
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Let's start.

306
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,430
It's good. Go back to work.

307
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,400
Okay.

308
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,640
What do you think?

309
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Is it weird?

310
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,100
If a regular person looks like a model,

311
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,540
it'll be weird.

312
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,400
Because it's like you're imitating others.

313
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,990
You did a great job.

314
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,270
You mean

315
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,080
it's actually better to not look so professional.

316
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,610
Yes.

317
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,950
Let's have dinner

318
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,180
together after this.

319
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,430
We have to eat together after shoots.

320
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,520
That's the rule.

321
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,700
Okay, I'm hungry too.

322
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,050
I'll go get changed.

323
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,800
Take the clothes back with you too.

324
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,960
That's how we do it here.

325
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,070
We give the model the clothes that

326
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,300
she wears for shoots.

327
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,490
This is also a rule.

328
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,410
That's very nice of you.

329
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,390
Okay.

330
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,720
Are you going to post it on Moments?

331
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,490
No.

332
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,050
I write my diary on my phone.

333
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,850
It seems that your name

334
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,320
will be in my diary today.

335
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,640
On the whole,

336
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,060
Jiacheng should have more mentions.

337
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,690
Of course.

338
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,500
I'm teasing you.

339
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,410
But I'm not shy at all.

340
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,700
There's nothing to be shy about.

341
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,340
Although

342
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,500
I'm a little sad.

343
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,960
You don't look sad at all.

344
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,290
You can't always be sad.

345
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,790
There are always many things to be happy about.

346
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,550
You were cool during the shoot today.

347
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,650
That's because you cast a spell on me.

348
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,500
Once the magic disappeared,

349
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,990
I'm still so ordinary.

350
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,900
You've never been ordinary.

351
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,579
In fact, one's beauty

352
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,790
comes from their thoughts

353
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,819
and attitude.

354
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:11,829
So,

355
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,690
whether you're Li Xiaoxiao in a gown

356
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,480
or Miss Li in sportswear,

357
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,200
you're still beautiful.

358
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,570
I'm back.

359
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,150
You scared me.

360
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,180
Hello.

361
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,420
Who are you?

362
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,450
I'm...

363
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,770
This is Wang Ning.

364
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,790
It's cold now.

365
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,260
Do you want to go heat up the car first?

366
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:46,790
Okay.

367
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,500
I'm sorry.

368
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,880
We just met and I have to leave.

369
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,860
Let's get to know each other

370
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,020
next time.

371
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,500
Okay, bye.

372
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,590
See you.

373
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,420
Come here.

374
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,660
Who is it?

375
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,970
Your friend?

376
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,360
Kind of.

377
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,750
But he's pursuing me.

378
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,190
What about Jiacheng?

379
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,360
What happened to Jiacheng?

380
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,510
What do you mean?

381
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,270
I thought you would...

382
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,940
Jiacheng is not someone I will marry.

383
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,390
That man just now

384
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,150
is the one you're going to marry?

385
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,720
Maybe.

386
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,750
Do you like him?

387
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,550
Silly girl.

388
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,350
It's not that simple.

389
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,950
At our age,

390
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,430
we have to eat together,

391
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,670
shop together

392
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,870
and travel together before we can tell.

393
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,930
Then why does it

394
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,430
take just a minute for me?

395
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,820
You have someone you like?

396
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,300
It's all in the past.

397
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,500
You're almost 30.

398
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,710
It's not easy for you to find someone you like

399
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,870
at this age.

400
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,660
So,

401
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,560
you have to meet the person you want to see

402
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,480
and say what you want to say.

403
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,410
That's the only way to live up

404
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,690
to your twenties.

405
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,760
Actually, I...

406
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,490
I'm leaving.

407
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,870
There are leftovers in the fridge.

408
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,130
Remember to cook them.

409
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,310
When can I tell Yiwen?

410
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,720
[I got to know Jiacheng today]

411
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,350
Don't you regret it?

412
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,790
Regret what?

413
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,070
You never told him

414
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,980
what you wrote in your diary.

415
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,780
It's here.

416
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,440
Xiaoxiao.

417
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,600
Jiacheng.

418
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,760
What a coincidence.

419
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,130
You're running here too?

420
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:47,760
Yes.

421
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,560
No.

422
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,390
Did you check my Weibo?

423
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,210
How did you know?

424
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,510
As expected from someone in sports.

425
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,510
You’re so active.

426
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,130
It's good to run here.

427
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,040
Yeah.

428
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,470
The air is nice.

429
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,160
Run!

430
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,650
Let me see how good you are.

431
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,760
Come on, I’m a Physical Education teacher.

432
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,280
Pick one.

433
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,720
You still like white peach drinks.

434
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,640
Yes.

435
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,420
Likes are not easily changed.

436
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,480
Jiacheng,

437
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,330
I actually...

438
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,010
Hello.

439
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,420
I'm Xu Jiacheng.

440
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,000
No, thanks.

441
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,230
They asked me

442
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,470
if little Xu Jiacheng

443
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,730
needs to sign up for a calligraphy class.

444
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,560
It seems like little Xu Jiacheng

445
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,360
needs comprehensive development, whether intellectual or physical.

446
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,450
Have you had breakfast?

447
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,200
Not yet.

448
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,840
Let's have breakfast at my place.

449
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
I'll cook for you.

450
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,260
At your house?

451
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,310
Let's go.

452
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,720
Have a seat.

453
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,280
Your house has great lighting.

454
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
What did you say?

455
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,280
I said

456
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,530
you live in such a big house alone?

457
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm supposed to live with my sister

458
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,830
when she comes back from her studies

459
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,620
so I found a big place.

460
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,350
Right, Jialin will be back soon.

461
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,700
Here.

462
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,650
Thank you.

463
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,560
How about spaghetti?

464
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,670
Sure.

465
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,150
You can fry an egg, right?

466
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,480
Of course.

467
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,110
The eggs I fry are delicious.

468
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,790
Do you want it fully cooked or half cooked?

469
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,270
Fried or sunny side up?

470
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,490
Lower your head.

471
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,100
What are you doing?

472
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,340
I'm done.

473
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,840
Why are you here?

474
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,140
You're up.

475
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,360
I want to ask you that.

476
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,010
Jiacheng, why is he here?

477
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,070
Him?

478
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,410
He stayed up late for a meeting last night.

479
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,530
I bumped into her this morning

480
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,390
while running.

481
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,130
Why are you so nervous?

482
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,660
As if you did something bad

483
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,580
and got caught.

484
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,780
What did I do?

485
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,160
I'm frying eggs.

486
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,090
Sure.

487
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,530
Make one for me too.

488
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
I want a sunny side up.

489
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,110
Make it round.

490
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,130
Jiacheng.

491
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,820
This isn't a gas stove, right?

492
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,310
It's not that good.

493
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,380
Let me tell you how to use it.

494
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,380
Select this.

495
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,050
Okay, it's over there.

496
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,630
What's wrong?

497
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,790
It's so hot.

498
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,210
You're burnt? Let me see.

499
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,390
I got burnt by the side of the pot.

500
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,960
Go.

501
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,000
Go get some water.

502
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,190
Just go.

503
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,600
I'm sorry.

504
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,810
What are you looking at?

505
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,480
I...

506
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,050
I'm going to take the bus.

507
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,330
Where are you going?

508
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,280
It can't be a coincidence.

509
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,780
Your houses are quite far apart.

510
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,720
How can you bump into each other while jogging?

511
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,690
I'm a Physical Education teacher.

512
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,400
This distance is nothing.

513
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,190
Then why did you

514
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,870
put on make up for a jog?

515
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,530
I only applied sunscreen.

516
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,700
Sunscreen?

517
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,490
What sunscreen can give you eyeliner too?

518
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,880
I want to use such good sunscreen too.

519
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,000
Fine.

520
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
I admit.

521
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,090
It wasn't a coincidence.

522
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,940
Actually,

523
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,980
I want to thank you for what you said that day,

524
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,110
it enlightened me.

525
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,100
Me?

526
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,540
You asked me

527
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,830
if it's a pity.

528
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,080
I realized

529
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,750
I do regret it.

530
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,590
So I thought,

531
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,220
even if the outcome won't change,

532
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,520
I have to try.

533
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,620
If someone asks me again,

534
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,680
I will tell him confidently that

535
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,820
I have no regrets.

536
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,060
What do you think?

537
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,220
Aren't I cool?

538
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,270
It's hard to say.

539
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,400
But at the very least you're not stupid

540
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,190
if you knew to orchestrate a chance encounter.

541
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:41,050
Orchestrate a chance encounter?

542
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,590
Got it.

543
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,400
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

544
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,680
Why are you thanking me again?

545
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,510
I'll be late for work.

546
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,470
I have to go.

547
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,170
Boss.

548
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,660
What are you looking for?

549
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,630
Looking for my ring. Did you see it?

550
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,430
Boss, why did you

551
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,990
take off the ring again?

552
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,290
If you didn't see it, you should get back to work.

553
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,700
[CLOUDS CAFE]

554
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,040
Are you busy?

555
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,610
What's wrong?

556
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,890
Honey.

557
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,130
I lost my ring.

558
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,550
Did you lose it?

559
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,890
Yes, I did.

560
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,990
Where?

561
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,850
Well,

562
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,200
it's either at the cafe or

563
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
at home.

564
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,010
Well...

565
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,280
You left it at someone else's home, right?

566
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,230
How is that possible?

567
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,150
It must be at our house.

568
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,070
Every day,

569
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,990
I only go to these two places.

570
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,000
Ask Bai if you don't believe me.

571
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,040
Make me a cup of coffee,

572
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,240
