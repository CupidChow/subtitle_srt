00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,530
I agree with your opinion.

191
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,740
Pick the one in Beijing.

192
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,130
But I have to check the content.

193
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:07,550
And we can't cease publication of our printed magazine.

194
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,470
Okay.

195
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,950
I'll move forward with it.

196
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,460
♫I'll be heartbroken no matter how careful I am♫

197
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,470
♫Maybe you have nothing to say♫

198
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,490
♫Our love takes a roundabout route♫

199
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:59,530
♫We could only blame that we didn't have time to prepare for it♫

200
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,510
♫If missing is a misunderstanding♫

201
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,430
♫The contradictory emotions are also shaky♫

202
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,480
♫The denial hit my sore point♫

203
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,140
♫How embarrassing it's for me when I'm heartbroken♫

204
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,890
♫Time has stolen blossoms♫

205
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,360
♫Like a silent monologue♫

206
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,210
♫But my heartbeats♫

207
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,270
♫Turn the past pages♫

208
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,450
♫We met by chance and missed each other; I look forward to seeing you again♫

209
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,690
♫I don't dare to love even if I long to♫

210
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,080
♫But how can I forget your tenderness?♫

211
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,180
♫We drifted apart in the crowd♫

212
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,240
♫I'm lingering in the same spot♫

213
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,650
♫I can't let go no matter how hard I try♫

214
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,050
♫Dust of constraints♫

215
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:02,220
♫When will the sunshine return?♫

216
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,140
Jialin.

217
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,340
What's wrong?

218
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,150
Xiaoxiao.

219
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,050
Xu Yan and I

220
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,890
♫I've never really understood♫

221
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,070
are done.

222
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,920
♫The future beyond my reach♫

223
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,750
It's fine.

224
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,360
♫I've been looking forward to it♫

225
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,410
♫I just found that you're irreplaceable♫

226
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:36,040
♫How can I love like the way you do?♫

227
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,230
Throw these things away for me.

228
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,160
I was already in front of the trash bin,

229
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,040
but I didn't make it.

230
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,140
Why are they all torn apart?

231
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,410
The first step to saying goodbye

232
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,030
is to let go of the memories about him.

233
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,270
What's the second step?

234
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,640
Leave.

235
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,090
I came back

236
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,720
because of him.

237
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,170
It seems

238
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,410
it's time to go back to America to study.

239
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,050
Have you made up your mind?

240
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,600
Maybe I can only let go of him

241
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,150
by leaving here.

242
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,910
At least,

243
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,080
you can choose to leave.

244
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,180
You and Ye Han...

245
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,730
You are not going well?

246
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,810
We...

247
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,150
broke up.

248
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,300
Where are you going?

249
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,470
Go scold him!

250
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,630
I said it.

251
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,160
Xiaoxiao.

252
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,170
It’s my fault.

253
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,310
How can I only think about myself?

254
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,110
Xiaoxiao.

255
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,240
You must be upset.

256
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,050
Cry.

257
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,350
You'll feel better.

258
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,810
Sir,

259
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,950
do you need to order now?

260
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,640
The steak can't be tasty.

261
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,530
Steak is our specialty.

262
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,080
Cheers.

263
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,660
You are drinking?

264
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,190
If you need wine,

265
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,710
we can do a wine pairing.

266
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,340
Sir.

267
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,400
Sir.

268
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,790
One pasta will do.

269
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,770
Okay.

270
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,830
How does it taste?

271
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,050
It's good.

272
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,820
Here, honey.

273
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,460
Eat mine. I've cut it for you.

274
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,660
Aren't you eating?

275
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,560
I'll watch you eat.

276
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,670
I-It's delicious, right?

277
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,500
Shengyun.

278
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,920
I chose this wine for you.

279
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,310
It tastes sweeter.

280
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,790
I think you'll like it.

281
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,390
Cheers.

282
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,670
Cheers.

283
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,660
Hello.

284
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,170
Do you need more wine?

285
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,990
A bottle of house wine, please.

286
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,630
Okay.

287
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,250
Wait.

288
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,090
Well...

289
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,910
Just a bottle of sparkling water.

290
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,140
No wine, thanks.

291
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,890
Honey, you have many business dinners.

292
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,580
You don't have to drink with me.

293
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,580
Then I don't drink today.

294
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,450
Let's drink sparkling water.

295
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,520
One more bottle.

296
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,210
Are you okay with it?

297
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,190
Yes.

298
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,900
Let me send you home.

299
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,560
Are you okay?

300
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,510
I'm sorry.

301
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,530
Let her go.

302
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,560
Sir, what can I do for you?

303
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,730
You kept asking her to drink.

304
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,600
What do you mean?

305
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,800
I drank it myself.

306
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,190
Did I allow you to speak?

307
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,330
Who are you?

308
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,420
He's my boyfriend.

309
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,870
Do you know each other?

310
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,110
Used to know.

311
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,610
I'm her husband.

312
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,340
Ex-husband.

313
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,130
I see.

314
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,270
Shengyun,

315
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,830
I think you need to talk.

316
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,680
I'll be right here.

317
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,010
Call if you need me.

318
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,570
Sorry.

319
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,370
It's okay.

320
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,070
Sir,

321
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,170
Shengyun and I are just friends.

322
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,700
We just came out for dinner.

323
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,500
Plus,

324
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,340
I hope you can respect her,

325
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,420
no matter what

326
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,850
your relationship is.

327
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,800
I'll leave you two.

328
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,650
I don't respect her?

329
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,530
Guo Shengyun,

330
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,380
we just got divorced.

331
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,380
Do you want to make me angry with someone just like him?

332
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,590
He's a rich bachelor.

333
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,410
He deserves me,

334
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,450
but you don't.

335
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,980
Do you understand?

336
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,900
Fine.

337
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,270
You are drunk today.

338
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,410
I'll forgive you.

339
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,620
-I’m not drunk.
-Come with me.

340
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,610
Come with me!

341
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,170
I'm not drunk!

342
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,770
You have lots of choices

343
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,820
for the blind date.

344
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,630
But you picked a bearded guy.

345
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,680
Look.

346
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,730
Will he carry you if you get drunk?

347
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,020
I'm carrying you.

348
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,560
Can he carry you?

349
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,990
Look how drunk you are.

350
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,720
What if

351
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,740
you would be fooled by the bad guys without me?

352
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,630
It's not right.

353
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,370
Not right.

354
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,350
No. No. No.

355
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,080
Guo Shengyun.

356
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,280
It’s inappropriate.

357
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,680
Lie down.

358
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,610
Guo Shengyun,

359
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,300
I’m not your husband anymore.

360
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,020
Sleep tight.

361
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,330
What am I doing?

362
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,670
[Clouds Cafe]

363
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,620
What's up

364
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,680
with him?

365
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,430
Maybe he broke up

366
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,560
with Xiaoxiao.

367
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,880
Maybe?

368
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,840
You haven't apologized yet?

369
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,880
I don't know what happened.

370
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,940
Hello?

371
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,600
Okay.

372
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,440
I'll be right back.

373
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,700
Well...

374
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,880
Xiaoxiao

375
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,940
came to me.

376
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,550
Why are you looking at me?

377
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,880
She came here for you.

378
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,610
Go.

379
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,520
Okay.

380
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,580
I'll go first.

381
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:12,050
[Clouds Cafe]

382
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
Xiaoxiao.

383
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,010
What's wrong?

384
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,540
Xu Yan.

385
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,980
I thought about it for a long time.

386
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,130
I think I should give this to you.

387
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,030
This is...

388
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,180
Jialin asked me to throw it away.

389
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,760
She said

390
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,650
she would give up on you.

391
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,510
If she doesn't want it,

392
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,860
it will be meaningless to give it to me.

393
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:54,770
Xiaoxiao,

394
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,660
Jialin and I

395
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,760
are done.

396
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:01,390
What if she

397
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,190
will go back to America tonight?

398
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,670
I know

399
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,930
you've always wanted to protect Jialin.

400
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,800
All this time,

401
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,210
you are considering the overall situation,

402
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,810
weighing up the pros and cons

403
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,060
and making the right choices.

404
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,350
But have you ever thought

405
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,460
that Jialin loved you so much,

406
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,060
so she could feel

407
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,730
your pain?

408
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,770
She's protecting you in her way.

409
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,300
You two are the same on this point.

410
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,840
But the difference is

411
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,200
that she is braver than you.

412
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm here today

413
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,690
because I don't want you to miss each other.

414
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,780
Just take me as a busybody.

415
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,090
Think about it.

416
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,210
I'm leaving.

417
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,400
Xiaoxiao,

418
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,660
we need to talk.

419
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,080
I've said

420
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,130
what I should say.

421
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,280
I still don't understand

422
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,550
why we broke up.

423
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,400
I already explained.

424
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,280
But I don't accept that.

425
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,320
You knew it.

426
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,570
From the first time I met you,

427
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,540
my heart lied with you.

428
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,150
Now you wanted to

429
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,390
deny all these things.

430
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,920
Would you accept it if you were in my position?

431
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,550
I saw everything

432
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,270
that my boyfriend had.

433
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,430
If you had been me,

434
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,810
would you accept it?

435
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,630
You said that from the first time you met me,

436
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,640
your heart lied with me.

437
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,380
It would be good if I had the same thought.

438
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,870
♫I'll be heartbroken no matter how careful I am♫

439
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
So you have never

440
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,120
trusted me.

441
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:28,740
♫We could only blame that we didn't have time to prepare for it♫

442
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,380
I have trusted.

443
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,810
I thought I was your girlfriend.

444
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,620
♫If missing is a misunderstanding♫

445
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,490
I thought

446
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,730
♫The contradictory emotions are also shaky♫

447
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,410
I could win this battle.

448
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,070
♫The traffic lights are like tears♫

449
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,860
Because I thought

00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,240
♫Twinkling in my heart♫

451
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,820
our relationship was stronger

♫Time has stolen blossoms♫

453
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,320
than your relationship with your ex.

454
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,450
♫Like a silent monologue♫

455
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,980
But I was wrong.

456
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,880
Since Song Jinran has come back,

457
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,170
♫But my heartbeats♫

458
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,130
♫Turn the past pages♫

459
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,460
it's like you've lived in
a different world sometimes.

460
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,320
♫We met by chance and missed each other; I look forward to seeing you again♫

461
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,400
I didn't know how to trust you.

462
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,530
♫I don't dare to love even if I long to♫

463
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,240
I didn't know how we could
continue with this relationship.

464
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,640
A-As long as we are together,

465
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,360
♫But how can I forget your tenderness?♫

466
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,110
we can continue with this relationship.

467
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,150
But I think being together

468
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,920
is already painful enough!

469
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,710
♫Distance makes people retreat♫

470
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,580
I hate myself for being like this.

471
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:30,320
♫Can I still face it if I turn around?♫

472
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,250
I was full of timidity,

473
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:28,950
inferiority,

474
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,590
suspicion and jealousy.

475
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,520
♫I want to hug you 'cause you're precious♫

476
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,900
But I couldn't control myself.

477
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,490
♫I always doubt myself and take myself as a humble person♫

478
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,080
♫The denial hit my sore point♫

479
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,360
I became who I hated most

480
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,180
♫How embarrassing it's for me when I'm heartbroken♫

481
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,070

♫We met by chance and missed each other; I look forward to seeing you again♫

489

♫But how can I forget your tenderness?♫

492
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,890
I won't have a crush on you anymore.

493
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,910
I won't come to you again.

494
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,940
♫We drifted apart in the crowd♫

495
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,900

♫I can't let go no matter how hard I try♫

497

♫I just found that you're irreplaceable♫

504
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,670
What a mess.

505
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,720
Because of Song Jinran?

506
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,830
She said we shouldn't be together

507
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,550
from the beginning.

508
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,740
And she has never trusted me.

509
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,070
What would you think if it were you?

510
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,510
Compared to others,

511
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,040
you and I

512
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,650
do care more about our past.

513
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,800
It's the truth.

514
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:36,490
But I've explained it countless times.

515
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,190
If she didn't trust me

516
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,580
in the beginning,

517
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:42,340
it's useless no matter how much I do.

518
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,780
Alright.

519
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,600
Don't be angry.

520
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,080
I'm not angry.

521
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,760
I'm just...

522
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,960
a little tired.

523
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,950
And I'm a little sad.

524
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,070
How could she

525
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,530
break up with me so easily?

526
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,390
But if this relationship

527
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,870
makes her suffer,

528
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,020
there will be no need for me
to make up for it.

529
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,680
Actually, there's no right or wrong about this.

530
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,490
It's not on the past,

531
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,940
Xiaoxiao,

532
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,330
or you.

533
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,940
It's good

534
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,460
to take a break.

535
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,000
Jiacheng told me

536
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,180
that Jialin would fly back to America soon.

537
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,810
But have you ever thought

538
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,500
that Jialin loved you so much,

539
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,120
so she could feel

540
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,920
your pain?

541
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,950
She was protecting you in her way.

542
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,500
You just let her go?

543
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,510
What else can I do?

544
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,970
You're right.

545
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,350
Compared to others,

546
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,570
we do care more about our past.

547
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,140
Xu Yan, remember,

548
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,930
the position we are in now

549
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,350
is called the future.

550
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,290
Have you packed everything?

551
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,800
Yes.

552
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,949
You've been in China for so long.

553
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,590
It's time to go back to study.

554
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,360
Mom is right.

555
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,139
The offer has been postponed for so long.

556
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,620
I'm leaving tonight.

557
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,810
Right.

558
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,440
Going to school is good.

559
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,400
Go finish school

560
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,270
and come back to stay with us.

561
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,469
That's great.

562
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,389
I'll drive you

563
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:29,070
to the airport later.

564
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,210
No need.

565
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,389
