2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,790
Actually, we didn't

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,690
become friends naturally.

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,510
Instead, I carefully planned this team.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,200
I planned to invite three classmates

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,330
to join my team.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,320
First,

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,660
this team needs a good student,

9
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,120
because good students have unique temperaments,

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,880
like calmness and good judgment.

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,270
Which is crucial

12
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,010
to unite the team.

13
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:29,790
Excuse me,

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,340
I heard that

15
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,230
you were No. 1 to enter our school.

16
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,170
My name is Ye Han.

17
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,040
Second,

18
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,800
we also need

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,690
a friend from a rich family.

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,170
Actually, money is not important.

21
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,880
But what I value is

22
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,990
the temperaments of a person
who grows up in a rich family:

23
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,870
optimism,

24
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,380
confidence, and gentleness.

25
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,920
With such a member,

26
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,200
the team won't be easily disintegrated.

27
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,010
Hello.

28
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,780
My name is Ye Han.

29
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,370
Lastly, I need a comedian,

30
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,750
because if there is a comedian on the team,

31
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,810
no matter how difficult the problem is,

32
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,140
we will be optimistic.

33
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,650
Trust me. No problem.

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,750
Let me see yours.

35
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,870
About yours, I...

36
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,200
Class begins. Let's go.

37
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,210
Hello.

38
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,990
What's your name?

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,259
My name is Ye Han.

40
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,180
I gathered the top elites

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,410
from each field

42
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,630
and formed a team.

43
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,160
However…

44
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,020
Xu Yan, who seemed to be the most decisive,

45
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,270
was actually

46
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,289
the one who couldn't make any decision,

47
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:58,750
except when he was

48
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,800
answering the test paper in a test.

49
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,000
It's been ten minutes.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,400
You haven't decided yet?

51
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,600
Chicken burger

52
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,220
and cheeseburger

53
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,400
are both what I want.

54
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,490
Which one should I order?

55
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,080
You can just starve.

56
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,030
As a man,

57
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,620
you can't even decide on such a trivial matter.

58
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,790
Jiacheng didn't have any gentleness and calmness

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,870
that are usually typical of people from happy families.

60
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,490
Why hasn't the fast food come out yet?

61
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,110
What fast food restaurant is so slow?

62
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,710
He is

63
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,900
rich

64
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,970
but very impatient.

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,870
Lu Zheng, why aren't you talking?

66
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,070
Aren't you an interesting person?

67
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,400
What shall I talk about when there are no girls?

68
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,550
I thought Lu Zheng could be the team clown.

69
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,270
But without girls,

70
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,670
he would become exceptionally silent.

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,920
How about this?

72
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,920
Why don't we

73
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,390
break up?

74
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,770
Why do you have a say about breaking up?

75
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,780
Are you the boss?

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,720
Are you?

77
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,570
Have you ever seen such a handsome boss?

78
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,870
Can't one be the boss because he's handsome?

79
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,600
I suspect you're targeting me.

80
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,520
There are no girls here.

81
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,320
What's the point of arguing about being handsome?

82
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,230
Maybe

83
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,840
I'll go for the chicken burger.

84
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
You haven't decided yet?

85
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,829
Lu Zheng.

86
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,150
I thought you wouldn't talk at all
without a girl present.

87
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,610
What did you talk to Xu Yan?

88
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,390
Xu Yan is good-looking.

89
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,190
Unlike you, you're too manly.

90
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,410
You're so impatient.

91
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,790
Our meal is finally here.

92
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,030
Why isn't the fried chicken ready yet?

93
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,030
Oh my god. Where is my fried chicken?

94
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,790
It's not mine.

95
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,940
-It seems to be what I ordered.
-You ordered it?

96
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,340
What are you taking mine?

97
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,410
I've decided.

98
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,970
I'll have rice later.

99
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,840
I'll order a Coke first.

100
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,780
Contrary to my expectations,

101
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,560
we didn't get along at all.

102
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,660
So we were always quarreling.

103
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,970
But oddly,

104
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,350
we fought every day

105
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,250
but we were always together.

106
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,520
We looked forward to the day

107
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,360
when we could get along well

108
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,840
like gears joining closely,

109
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,920
if we kept fighting like this.

110
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,340
Stop there.

111
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,030
Gear, gear, gear my foot!

112
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,950
Talking about joining closely…

113
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,470
I never thought that after so many years,

114
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,300
you'd still be the same.

115
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,610
You're talking as if you're not.

116
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,630
When you were 16,

117
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,600
you didn't think about making friends,

118
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,370
but choosing friends.

119
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,730
You were quite premature.

120
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,940
You were scheming.

121
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,650
If it weren't for me,

122
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,710
you wouldn't have made friends.

123
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,580
This one is indecisive.

124
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,870
This one is impatient.

125
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,580
And there's a lunatic.

126
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,180
And a paranoia, too.

127
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,440
Paranoia? Am I paranoid?

128
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,550
How could I be?

129
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,450
A strong denial means you admit it firmly.

130
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,790
Who said that?

131
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,220
A philosopher.

132
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,650
He said that.

133
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,270
That's right.

134
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,360
That…

135
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,770
Italian one, right?

136
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,630
But if we keep doing this,

137
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,250
we should disband here.

138
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,900
Why do you have a say about that?

139
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,980
Are you the boss?

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,840

It's been 17 years.

We still quarrel every day

143
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,260
and still spend time together every day.

144
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,180
We don't like one another,

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,250
but no one can leave the others.

146
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,580
I don't know

147
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,990
if that means we love one another.

148
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,350
But at least,

149
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,110
in the future,

150
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,560
we still want to keep bickering like this.

151
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,430
I hope so.

He's still the same old person he was.

156
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,880
You look

157
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,790
much better than we thought.

158
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,060
The one who's really in good condition
is Xu Yan, right?

159
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,530
He's about to get married.

160
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,120
Look at him. He's different from us.

161
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,550
When he smiles, look,

162
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,640
look at his complexion.

163
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,330
A relationship at a senior age
makes one seem younger.

164
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,240
It's because you came back.

165

Don't mention it.

remember your girlfriend when you go to work today."

00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,650
but she hasn't replied to me.

192
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,470
It's so nice.

193
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,500
What?

194
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,590
That's what the heartbroken ones

195
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,390
should look like,
and we're all on the same boat.

196
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,909
It's great to have you here.

197
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,170
[Perfect]

198
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,770
Get lost!

199
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,510
Let's have dinner together tonight.

200
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,480
And then,

201
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,400
let's go around the martial arts world.
How's that?

202
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,310
I can't.

203
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,490
I'm having a date

204
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,690
with my fiancée.

205
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,300
Me neither.

206
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,200
I'm too tired from the long trip.

207
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,990
Don't look at me.

208
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,030
If they don't go, I won't go, either.

209
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,710
It's great

210
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,490
to have you three as good friends.

211
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,620
Good night.

212
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,810
Ye Han.

213
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,600
When did you come back?

214
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,630
Just today.

215
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,510
You're already here.

216
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,470
Aren't you going upstairs?

217
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,880
I haven't decided what to say to her yet.

218
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,810
I'll go upstairs after I sort it all out.

219
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,000
How has she been recently?

220
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,350
I think she's adjusting herself.

221
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,300
She went jogging in the park this morning.

222
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,090
That's good.

223
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,950
How has Jiacheng been recently?

224
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,440
Not good.

225
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,490
Maybe, like me,

226
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,030
he hasn't decided what to say to you.

227
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,240
That's why he hasn't come yet,

228
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,540
but he will,

229
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,200
because he's never given up on you.

230
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,410
Have you sorted it out?

231
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,710
I don't know

232
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,240
how we can solve our problem.

233
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,710
Every person's relationship

234
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,600
has their own issues.

235
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,380
But as long as two people are still in love,

236
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,420
there must be a solution.

237
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,200
Don't give up

238
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,680
and then regret it

239
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,450
like me.

240
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,840
The noodles are ready.

241
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,720
Have some noodles.

242
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,040
What is this?

243
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,470
It's your birthday today.

244
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,940
Longevity noodles.

245
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,440
I forgot that today is my birthday.

246
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,230
Then I'll remember it for you.

247
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,320
Congratulations.

248
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,530
You've reached 30 first,

249
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,830
while I

250
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,140
am still a young girl in her twenties.

251
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,030
Look at you.

252
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,450
You'll be a 30-year-old big girl

253
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,800
in a couple of days.

254
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,740
I can still show off for a few days.

255
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,380
Eat up

256
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,040
before it gets cold.

257
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,170
I'll eat this first.

258
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,000
We're going through it
because we've made a reservation.

259
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,800
Alright.

260
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,770
Do a good interview tomorrow.

261
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,200
[Yiwen's birthday]

262
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,580
-I made this the day before yesterday.
-The drawing reward?

263
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,630
Okay.

264
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,400
Thank you.

265
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,760
I've added a new task.

266
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,260
[Really. I hope you understand]

267
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,260
[You've already apologized to me] [That's enough] [Stop bothering me]

268
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,660
[Where are you? Are you home?]

269
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,660
[Why aren't you picking up?]

270
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,660
[Your call wasn't answered]

271
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,230
Okay. Okay.

272
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,630
That's it.

273
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,550
[What happened? Why didn't you answer my calls or reply to my messages?]

274
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,750
It's only been a few days.

275
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,500
Why do you all look so haggard?

276
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,050
You made us like this.

277
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,840
You had meetings with us every night.

278
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,370
Look at their dark circles.

279
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,070
Mr. Ye, you're finally back.

280
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,320
If you don't come back,

281
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,080
I'm going to submit my resignation.

282
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,840
Really?

283
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,130
Is that your resignation report in your hand?

284
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,000
No. No.

285
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,310
How is it possible?

286
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,670
This is the topic

287
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,930
for the next sports section.

288
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,110
We're going to interview the champion team

289
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,710
of the National College Cycling Competition.

290
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,550
Cycling Competition?

291
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,630
Let me see.

292
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,470
When is the competition?

293
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:11,960
Tomorrow.

294
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,760
The organizers have invited us.

295
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,090
I'll follow up on this project.

296
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,510
Send me the relevant information

297
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,710
to my email.

298
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,110
Okay.

299
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,750
Anything else to report?

300
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,740
Bring it on.

301
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,110
For a simple wedding,

302
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,770
there will be about 50 guests.

303
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,510
Do you think the venue should be

304
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,790
on the outdoor lawn or indoors?

305
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,590
I'd like what you like.

306
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,990
Okay, I'll think more about it.

307
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,650
What about food?

308
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,470
Which is better: buffet or set meal?

309
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,240
There are more kinds of food in a buffet.

310
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,150
The set meal is more delicate.

311
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,460
They both have their strengths.

312
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,140
It's up to you.

313
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,110
You said something, but it's like you didn't.

314
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,690
Last question.

315
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,920
The wedding planning company made three kinds of logos

316
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,030
for our wedding.

317
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,890
Which one do you think is the best?

318
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,670
I think

319
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,720
they're all good.

320
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,700
You choose the one you like.

321
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,320
Since just now,

322
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,940
have you given even one piece of advice?

323
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,410
Am I the only one to get married?

324
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,970
I didn't mean that.

325
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,940
I just think

326
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:19,790
girls have a better taste

327
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,650
when making this kind of choices.

328
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,630
But this is a wedding for two.

329
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,600
I don't want to make decisions alone.

330
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,220
You read documents every day.

331
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,350
Can't you look at me at a time like this?

332
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,180
It's like

333
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,160
you're okay with anything.

334
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,200
Then, let's have the wedding casually.

335
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,400
You don't think it's important anyway.

336
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,620
How could I not?

337
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,550
Then, from the moment we chose the wedding dress,

338
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,610
have you ever given me any advice?

339
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,030
I really think

340
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,170
I'm fine with anything you like.

341
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,510
I'm willing to satisfy all your needs.

342
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,940
If you think

343
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,000
that means I don't care about you,

344
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,080
I can only say sorry to you.

345
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,840
The first half sentence was nice.

346
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,760
What's that attitude of the second half?

347
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,490
What's wrong with my attitude?

348
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:11,640
Anyway, I think you were just being perfunctory.

349
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,100
I had put up with it
for a long time before I said it.

350
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,060
Why do you look like you're wronged?

351
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,040
What are you doing?

352
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,380
It's our first fight since we started dating.

353
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,580
I'm taking a picture to commemorate it.

354
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,680
Why are you laughing?

355
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,100
Did I allow you to laugh?

356
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,610
Commemorating it and being angry
are two different things.

357
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,980
I'm not going to accept your apology today.

358
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,050
Since we had a fight,

359
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,660
you should eat alone.

360
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,280
I'll let the wedding planning company send you

361
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,720
the logo to confirm.

362
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,180
Bye.

363
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,960
What are you doing here?

364
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,510
Do you want more money?

365
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,800
Wen, I'm here to…

366
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,190
Are you done?

367
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,480
Because of you, Jiacheng and I are impossible.

368
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,590
Don't try to get one more penny

369
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,830
from us.

370
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,670
No.

371
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,430
Listen to me.

372
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,790
No.

373
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,030
Wen.

374
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,420
Wen.

375
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,070
Wen,

376
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,060

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,440
My neck feels empty, too.

564
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,660
If your neck gets cold, wear a scarf.

565
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,410
Don't push your luck.

566
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,700
How far have you gone with Yiwen?

567
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,360
Don't tell others.

568
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,000
How should I put it?

569
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,580
Our relationship has been

570
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,690
quite abstract recently.

571
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,520
We didn't exactly break up,

572
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,400
but we haven't been in touch either lately.

573
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,840
I was a little angry and didn't contact her.

574
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,960
But it was her birthday yesterday.

575
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,450
I sent her a message to say happy birthday,

576
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,650
but she didn't reply.

577
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,760
Today,

578
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,780
I received this.

579
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,380
Isn't this an obvious signal?

580
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,230
Isn't it written here?

581
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,490
Xu Jiacheng,

582
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,260
I'm giving you an out.

583
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,030
-Where did you see it?
-You'd better be sensible.

584
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,050
Are you stupid for real, or are you faking it?

585
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,220
How about I make it easier for you?

586
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,330
I can't come to you now,

587
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,400
but you can come to me.

588
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,900
Understand?

589
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,060
Yes.

590
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,870
Go find her and make up.

591
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,000
Why are you hesitating?

592
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,860
You don't want to make up with her?

593
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,400
Of course I do.

594
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,270
But what can I say if I go there?

595
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,870
There are still many unsolved issues between us.

596
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,870
We'll fight again if we can't solve them.

597
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,080
About our mom?

598
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,180
Speaking of our mom,

599
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,710
it makes me seem more successful.

600
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,000
There is only one trick

601
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,760
to deal with our mom.

602
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,060
Act first and report later.

603
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,870
Make things happen before she realizes it.

604
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,980
Are you kidding me?

605
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,280
What are you old men

606
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,210
thinking about?

607
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,710
I meant you should get married.

608
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,250
Get married, understand?

609
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,550
For example,

610
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,440
When we were kids, we wanted to raise a dog.

611
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,910
Mom wouldn't let us, remember?

612
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,300
After we brought one back,

613
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,660
she treated it like a treasure.

614
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,830
When the dog died,
she cried for three days and nights.

615
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,470
That's what our mom is like.

616
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,530
You should act first and report later. Be prepared to fight a long battle.

617
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,870
Get married and bring your wife home.

618
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,940
A family of two.

619
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,370
A family of three,

620
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
if she's willing.

621
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,010
Then Mom would be…

622
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,130
very happy.

623
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,230
Could she still reject it by then?

624
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,210
Xu Jialin.

625
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,350
I have underestimated you.

626
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,930
You do have a lot of combat experience.

627
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,210
Of course.

628
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,050
I suddenly feel

629
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,110
your neck is a little empty.

630
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,590
You really need a diamond necklace.

631
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,470
Take it as my wedding gift for you.

632
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,860
Thank you.

633
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,220
You have no idea

634
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,610
how nervous I was

635
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,970
when the chain fell off.

636
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,400
I thought

637
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,220
we were doomed.

638
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,490
But I didn't expect

639
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,590
when they were about to reach the finish line,

640
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,190
Zixuan caught up with one sprint.

641
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,210
In the end, he surpassed the others.

642
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,070
My heart went

643
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,640
up and down.

644
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,410
I feel you're more excited than you being the champion.

645
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,580
Of course.

646
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,040
The feeling of standing at the finish line

647
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,230
is totally different.

648
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,400
I met Ye Han today.

649
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,030
He went there too?

650
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,240
What did you talk about?

651
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,800
Nothing.

652
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,340
He said

653
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,080
he was not doing well.

654
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,860
So,

655
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,650
do you want him to live well

656
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,110
or not?

657
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,230
When he said he was not well,

658
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,900
I felt sorry for him.

659
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,470
But

660
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,040
if he started a new life happily

661
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,650
as soon as we separated,

662
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,660
I'd be more upset.

663
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,830
Actually,

664
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,210
I ran into him downstairs a few days ago.

665
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,960
He told me not to tell you,

666
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,670
so I didn't.

667
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,730
He didn't tell me when he left.

668
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,410
Nor did he tell me when he came back.

669
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,650
That's about it

670
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,240
about our relationship.

671
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,580
I think you both have too many scruples.

672
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,770
So,

673
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,380
think about it.

674
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,250
Think about your relationship.

675
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,620
Here's the invitation.

676
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,340
Please come on time.

677
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,370
Of course.

678
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,550
I'll cheer for you.

679
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,980
[Shooting Stars]

680
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,680
Hello, Ms. Zhang.

681
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,170
Hello, Xiaoxiao.

682
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,150
Here's the thing.

683
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,650
The organizers introduced some media to us.

684
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,230
They all wanted to interview our bicycle team.

685
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,260
I agreed

686
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,860
because I think some publicity

687
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,070
will be helpful for our future sponsorship.

688
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,950
Sure.

689
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:03,770
Good.

690
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,520
Tomorrow,

691
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,610
a magazine has reserved
a photoshoot and an interview.

692
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,270
But tomorrow I have to

693
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,190
attend the meeting with the sponsors.

694
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,870
So can you

695
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,250
take them to the magazine for me?

696
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:17,780
Okay.

697
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,650
No problem.

698
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,600
It's Ye Han's magazine.

699
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,740
It's fine if you don't want to go.

700
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,910
I can negotiate with them.

701
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,920
It's okay.

702
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,990
It's good that Declaration is willing to interview us.

703
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,290
I don't want to hinder everyone for my personal reasons.

704
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,240
I'll go.

705
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,120
Okay, thank you.

706
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,820
The address is the studio of the magazine.

707
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,500
Okay.

708
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,760
Are we going to take photos?

709
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,590
It's my first time.

710
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,310
So professional.

711
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,980
Are you Miss Li?

712
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,800
Hello.

713
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,510
Hello.

714
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,679
I'm the photographer's assistant today.

715
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,820
I'll take you and your team members
to the dressing room for makeup.

716
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,820
Let's take some group photos later.

717
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,190
Me too?

718
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,980
Yes.

719
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,070
I see that according to today's work schedule,

720
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,659
the coach and team members will all take photos

721
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,420
and then do the interview separately.

722
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,480
This should have been confirmed
with Ms. Zhang before.

723
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,940
Okay then.

724
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,850
Thank you.

725
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,770
You're welcome. Please follow me.

726
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:49,889
Let's go.

727
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,300
♫I want to say something♫

728
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,070
♫But I just stand there and stare for a long time♫

729
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,120
♫Maybe I don't want to leave♫

730
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,040
♫It still hurts♫

731
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,160
♫Looking back♫

732
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:18,680
♫I feel so much warmth again♫

♫I'll be with you♫

♫You know it's true♫

♫Memories are endless♫

♫But why♫

737
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,060
♫We've been with each other♫

738
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,220
♫But why can't we have each other?♫

739
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,900
Did you expect you'd win

740
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,180
this competition?

741
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,130
I did.

♫I'll be with you♫

743
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,530

♫I'll see this through♫

746
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,590

♫If we can notice all the considerations♫

748
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,320
During the training,

749
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,720

I'm here to tell you,

825
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,680
you are an irresponsible jerk.

826

Who are you calling a jerk?

827
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:50,260
You!

00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,250
I'm pregnant.

841
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,310
Wifey, are you serious?

Let me ask you.

845
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,260
Is it appropriate for him to call me wifey?

846
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,460
If that's the case,

847
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,920
it's a de facto marriage.

848
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,930
It's legal

849
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,710
but unreasonable.

850
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,000
Lu Zheng, you are really something.

851
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,740
Lu Zheng, you are something,

852
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,000
but you're also a jerk.

853
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,540
My wife is pregnant.

854
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,750
Then, am I going to be a father?

855
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,640
I'm going to be a father!

856
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,150
Wifey. Honey.

857
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:43,630
Sit down.

858
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,280
Don't touch her.

859
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,990

I'm an irresponsible jerk, okay?

862
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,390
I am.

863
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,310
You are a piece of junk.

864
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,230
I am.

865
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,820
Did I say I'm gonna remarry you?

866
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,830
Listen.

867
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,890
I don't want this child anymore.

868
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,430
Don't say anything!

869
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,050
Just listen.

870
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,540
-Don't talk.
-Yun, scold him if you want.

871
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,400
We're leaving.

872
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,410
Yun, if you need legal counseling,

873
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,780
I will serve you 24 hours a day.

874
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,230
This is my wedding invitation.

875
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,670
You must come.

876
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,270
Okay.

877
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,440
Watch your hands.

878
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,700
Don't touch my nephew.

879
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,160
Yun, if you get tired from scolding him,

880
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,890
moisten your throat with this.

881
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,420
Honey, is it too hot?

882
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,790
How can you carry something heavy?

883
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,150
Give it to me.

884
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,500
Honey.

885
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:29,410
Don't be angry.

886
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,350
Don't be angry.

887
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,280
Honey,

888
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,920
you can't be so agitated now.

889
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,370
We're having a child now.

890
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,120
It's not good for the child if you're so agitated.

891
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:49,790
I'm already unlucky enough to get divorced.

892
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,760
Now I'm going to be a single mom.

893
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,690
I have to make money

894
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,970
and take care of my child by myself.

895
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,460
Why am I so pitiful?

896
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,000
Honey, you're not a single mom now.

897
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,450
I was wrong.

898
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,360
I'm sorry, okay?

899
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,430
You're not a single mom.

900
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,240
You have me. You have a husband.

901
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:07,920
Who are you?

902
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,380
I'm your husband.

903
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,000
Do I have a husband?

904
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,750
I'm divorced.

905
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,670
My husband abandoned me.

906
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,310
Honey.

907
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,460
I admit I was wrong, okay?

908
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,910
I'm really sorry.

909
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,780
The thing I regret the most in my life

910
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,670
was that time

911
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,400
I signed the divorce agreement on impulse.

912
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,460
I'm really sorry. Can you forgive me?

913
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,520
You...

914
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,660
What is that?

915
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,440
Honey, look.

916
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,770
The ring is still here.

917
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,140
I only have one ring.

918
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,930
And I only have one wife.

919
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,890
After you left,

920
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,460
I've been missing you every day.

921
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,090
Yes.

922
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,220
You didn't have a child before.

923
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,470
That is your preoccupation.

924
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,710
But you know what?

925
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,970
You're my preoccupation all along.

926
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,160
I'm very happy that you're back.

927
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,200
I'm really happy.

928
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,840
Can you be with me again?

929
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,400
I came to the wrong place by accident.

930
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,030
It's too hard for me.

931
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:11,130
I can't persuade her.

932
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,310
Kid, can you come out now

933
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,510
and fight against your mom?

934
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,870
She's so eloquent.

935
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,300
If our kid comes out now,

936
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,880
