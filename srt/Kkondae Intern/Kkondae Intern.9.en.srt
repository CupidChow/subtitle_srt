00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:41,743
What brings you all the way here?

7
00:00:44,997 --> 00:00:47,457
I heard you killed a man, Mr. Ga.

8
00:01:03,182 --> 00:01:05,642
I heard that's why
you had to leave Ongol.

9
00:01:15,152 --> 00:01:17,112
If you promise to give me
the permanent position,

10
00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:18,530
I'll keep my mouth shut.

11
00:01:26,622 --> 00:01:28,248
Are you threatening me right now?

12
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:32,753
Do whatever you want, then.

13
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:13,085
Yeol Chan, it looks like
we need to say goodbye to Mr. Yeo.

14
00:02:20,384 --> 00:02:23,262
His pneumonia suddenly got worse
since last night,

15
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:27,391
but he couldn't hold on
and just passed away.

16
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:37,234

Guess what?

19
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:46,720
My parents also sold rice soup
at a marketplace.

20
00:03:49,556 --> 00:03:51,099
Every day,

21
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:54,853
they'd wake up early and boil meat.

22
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:57,814
They never slept in.

23
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:01,068
They worked hard
until the day they died.

24
00:04:01,527 --> 00:04:02,694
Maybe that's why...

25
00:04:03,237 --> 00:04:07,449
he always reminded me
of my father and enraged me.

26
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:10,035
I wanted to give him a hard time
for no reason.

27
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:13,247
I'm responsible...

28
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,999
for what happened.

29
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:18,460
I killed him.

30
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:21,421
What?

31
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:26,510
He and I didn't have bad blood
from the beginning.

32
00:04:46,196 --> 00:04:47,364
Welcome.

33
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,034
This is so delicious.

34
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:53,704

Goodbye.

37

Come on.

38
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:05,799
I'm doing this
because you remind me of my father.

any better...

42
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:15,684

- Okay.

00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:34,828
It's so good.

47
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,205
Is this the sample? Let's see.

48
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,880
Sir, there's something wrong
with this.

49
00:05:44,922 --> 00:05:46,381
It doesn't taste the same.

50
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:47,966
What are you talking about?

51
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:56,308
It's tasty.

52
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:02,272
This isn't just
any termination of contract.

53
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:04,983
Let's be honest.
Your rice soup tastes awful.

54
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:07,819
How dare you talk such nonsense?

55
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:10,531
Then where are all those customers
who used to wait in line?

56
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:14,618
I did exactly the same as before.

57
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:17,663
Since when did it taste differently?

Give that to me. I'll do it.

60
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:27,840
You know,
my parents also sold rice soup.

61
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:02,499
Sir.

62
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,711
Let's just give up on this.

63
00:07:07,713 --> 00:07:09,506
Don't be ridiculous!

64
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:11,425
I know you've been lying to me
all this time!

65
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,260
What are you talking about?

66
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:16,388
Forget it! I know you thieves
are all in league with one another.

67
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:20,726
So?

68
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:23,562
You're going to sue us?

69
00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:25,397
Today, we will carry out
the verification process...

70
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,983
that the defendant requested
last time.

71
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:33,071
They say long trials...

72
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:35,490

75
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:49,171
See?

76
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:53,383
That dish doesn't deserve
to be tasted by some professionals.

77
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:55,052
It's just horrible!

78
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:59,264
Despite all this,
he has no idea what's wrong!

79
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:01,892
Shouldn't we suspect him
of dementia?

80
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:04,019
We don't need to do a taste test.

81
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:07,523
He needs to take
a psychological test instead.

82
00:08:07,856 --> 00:08:10,025
How could he call that a dish?

83
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:18,659
I sympathized with him.

84
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:22,246
I did, but I had to defend
my company.

85
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:26,458
Because my conviction
was in my company.

86
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:32,047
This world has given me
too much sorrow.

87
00:08:33,465 --> 00:08:35,300
I can't go on any longer.

88
00:08:36,468 --> 00:08:37,678
I've chosen to end my life.

89
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:39,763
Sir.

90
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:53,527
But after that,
I was the one in pure torment.

91
00:09:14,965 --> 00:09:18,635
"Goodness, I guess
he won't kill himself, after all."

92
00:09:19,344 --> 00:09:22,973
"Fine. I hope you find pleasure
in tormenting me."

93
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,768
But when the dust had settled,
that was when he attempted suicide.

94
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:30,939
It was like that story,
"The Boy Who Cried Wolf".

95
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:36,778
Why didn't you tell me this
back then?

96
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:42,492
Because I wanted to blame you.

97
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:46,705
I wanted to believe
that he did so...

98
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:48,832
because of something you did to him.

99
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,462
Thinking that way
helped me pull through.

100
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:02,012
I'm sorry, Yeol Chan.

101
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:08,310
You're right.

102
00:10:11,438 --> 00:10:14,733
He attempted suicide
because of something I did.

103
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:31,458
What's wrong?
Does it not suit your taste?

104
00:10:33,377 --> 00:10:35,546
No, sir. It's delicious.

105
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,473
Darn it.
Nobody will want to eat this.

106
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:30,350
Gosh.

107
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:58,962
I was afraid...

108
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:02,174
that it was because of me.

109
00:12:03,926 --> 00:12:06,512
I was too scared to turn around.

110
00:12:28,534 --> 00:12:30,118
Goodness.

111
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:32,788
Have you been bottling it
all up in here?

112
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:34,498
Were you tormenting yourself
all along?

113
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:37,292
What a stupid fool.

114
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:41,922
What for? What for?

115
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:49,012
It's all my fault.

116
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:50,806
It is.

117
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:55,227
I was the one who pushed him
to the edge of the cliff.

118
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,979
I was also the one
who ignored him...

119
00:12:57,354 --> 00:12:58,772
when he needed help.

120
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:02,234
I shouldn't have done that.

121
00:13:04,528 --> 00:13:05,654
So...

122
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,031
it's not your fault.

123
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:10,909
It's enough...

124
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:15,163
for me to carry all that burden.

125
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:17,207
It's not your fault.

126
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:21,628
It's not your fault.

127
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:46,111
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

128
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:48,155
Why isn't he picking up?

129
00:13:48,822 --> 00:13:50,449
He said he was going to sleep early.

130
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,035
Weren't you calling
the owner of Taeseon?

131
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:55,370
I talked to him
on the phone earlier.

132
00:13:56,038 --> 00:13:58,665
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Okay.

133
00:13:59,082 --> 00:14:01,752
Wait. I'm going to step out
for a moment.

134
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:11,136
I'm sorry.

135
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:13,805
I have misunderstood your intention.

136
00:14:15,891 --> 00:14:19,019
Please don't demand compensation
for damages from him.

137
00:14:24,983 --> 00:14:26,652
Why are you taking this personally?

138
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:31,490
I want a chance
to make up for the mistakes.

139

Hey,

143
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:08,527
can you thank Mr. Lee for me?

144
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:13,156
Thanks to him, a few people
decided to drop the lawsuit.

145
00:15:13,991 --> 00:15:15,826
He said he worked in the industry.

146
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:18,579
I guess he knew a lot of people.

147
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:22,457
Thanks to him, I can avoid
the worst-case scenario.

Dad,

151
00:16:47,584 --> 00:16:49,169
don't you have anything to tell me?

152
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:50,254
Like what?

153
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:53,590
Well, you know,

154
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:56,134
you need to make a pretty important
decision for the company soon.

155

Never mind. Forget it
if you have nothing to tell me.

you decided not to sue the company

Yes. I told them to do that.

164
00:17:32,004 --> 00:17:34,381
So how will you make up
for the loss?

165
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:36,008
Can you even fix it?

I'll do my best.

167
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:44,808
Give him another chance.

168
00:17:46,518 --> 00:17:47,561
Gosh.

169
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:49,897
Hold on.

170
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:52,774
If we have the formula,

171
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:54,484
doesn't it mean we can make
our own products ourselves...

172
00:17:54,526 --> 00:17:56,320
since we already
have the facilities?

173
00:17:57,696 --> 00:17:58,864
It is possible.

174
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:00,866
If we can make them ourselves,

175
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:02,659
why would we hire a subcontractor?

176
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:04,161
We produce it ourselves.

177
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:07,414
Okay. I will set it up,

178
00:18:07,456 --> 00:18:09,249
so we can start manufacturing it
as soon as possible.

179
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,542
Wait!

180
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:16,673
You know,
we got the formula from Taeseon.

181
00:18:16,715 --> 00:18:20,177
And the owner of the company
even tried to kill himself.

182
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:24,515
But even after hiring
a poor company like that,

183
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:27,601
he failed to manage
and supervise the company.

184
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:31,146
We'll let him be off the hook
when he was in charge?

185
00:18:31,188 --> 00:18:32,564
Even without a penalty?

186
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:42,199
If Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon
doesn't do well,

187
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:44,826
should I fire him?

188
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:50,916
Will that make you feel better?

189
00:18:59,174 --> 00:19:00,175
You bet.

190
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:13,522
Try Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon.

191
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:16,900
Our noodles didn't have
any carcinogens.

192
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:20,445
One of the companies that make
ingredients for our soup powder...

193
00:19:20,487 --> 00:19:22,072
To be precise,
it was the sesame oil that had...

194
00:19:22,114 --> 00:19:23,323
It's the same thing.

195
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:27,494
My gosh, ma'am.
That's not the same thing.

196
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:30,289
This has nothing to do
with that company.

197
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,332
We made it from scratch.

198
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:33,709
- Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon.
- Forget it.

199
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,751
Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon!

200
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:43,427
(Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon)

201
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:54,188
Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon
will be the next big thing...

202
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:55,731
after Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

203
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:57,316
Please try a sample.

204
00:19:57,357 --> 00:19:58,358
Try a sample.

205
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,235
- No, I don't want to.
- Try our new product.

206
00:20:00,277 --> 00:20:01,320
Try a sample.

207
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:03,447
People said that it was unhealthy.

208
00:20:03,488 --> 00:20:04,573
Wait, that's not true.

209
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:05,908
This is Spicy
Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon.

210
00:20:05,949 --> 00:20:07,826
- No, don't eat that. It's bad.
- This has carcinogens.

211
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:10,454
You don't have to buy it,
but please try a sample.

212
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:12,831
That's not true.
Try Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon.

213
00:20:12,873 --> 00:20:14,124
You don't have to buy it.
Just try a sample.

214
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,960
- I don't want it.
- You don't have to buy it.

215
00:20:18,295 --> 00:20:21,507
My gosh,
our ramyeon is perfectly safe.

216

(Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon)

217
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,593
Do I have to eat everything up?

218
00:20:24,635 --> 00:20:26,094
(Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon)

219
00:20:28,222 --> 00:20:29,264
This is good.

(Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon)

(Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon)

222
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,483
It's tasty.

223
00:20:45,197 --> 00:20:46,198
You're back.

224
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,116
My legs. Gosh, my legs hurt.

225
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:49,701
(Spicy Chicken Ramyeon)

226
00:20:50,744 --> 00:20:53,121
How's the promotion going
at Joonsu Mall?

227
00:20:53,163 --> 00:20:56,208
People only bought some
when it was 10 cents.

228
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,126
And no one is placing
additional orders.

229
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:00,337
Mr. Ga.

230
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:03,006
HR will be evaluating us
pretty soon.

231
00:21:03,048 --> 00:21:04,883
Let's just give up on this.

232
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:05,968
Wouldn't it be better...

233
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:08,178
if we focus on projects that would
give us better performance rates?

234
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,221
Mr. Oh.

235
00:21:10,013 --> 00:21:11,473
Are you saying
that you don't trust me?

236
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:15,269
What? No. It's not a matter
of my confidence in you.

237
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,022
Other teams are working their heads
off to increase their performance.

238
00:21:19,064 --> 00:21:21,233
But we are...

239
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:22,568
What?

240
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:28,156
Gosh.

241
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:32,911
(We put webfoot octopus
in ramyeon this time.)

(Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon)

243
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:38,292
What will happen to you?

244
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,501
(What will happen to you?)

245
00:21:49,052 --> 00:21:50,053
Ms. Lee.

246
00:21:53,098 --> 00:21:54,641
You ruined my life.

247
00:21:54,683 --> 00:21:57,144
But look at you. Are you happy
with your brand-new life?

248
00:21:57,769 --> 00:21:58,770
Are you?

249
00:21:59,271 --> 00:22:00,898
How did you find me here?

250
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:04,401
Don't talk to me.

251
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:07,029
Hey!

252
00:22:33,597 --> 00:22:34,598
Are you okay?

253
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:36,892
Mr. Ga.

254
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:40,270
- Are you all right?
- Get up.

255
00:22:40,312 --> 00:22:41,313
Hey.

256
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:44,608
Who are you?

257
00:22:44,816 --> 00:22:46,318
Let go. Let go of me.

258
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:48,612
- Come with us.
- Let go of me!

259
00:22:51,406 --> 00:22:53,033
Do you think this is over?

260
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:55,911
You. Just wait for me.

261
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:07,172
Mr. Ga. Are you all right?

262
00:23:07,422 --> 00:23:08,465
Who's that man?

263
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:12,344
Why is everyone around you
so messed up? Why?

264
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:15,430
What have you been doing
with your life?

265
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,601
It sounds like you're saying...

266
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:21,979
these things happen because
something is wrong with my life.

267
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:24,439
That's not what I meant.

268
00:23:25,983 --> 00:23:28,193
It's because I was angry.

269
00:23:30,237 --> 00:23:32,447
Why does this make you angry?

270
00:23:34,074 --> 00:23:36,660
I have no idea
why I'm like this either.

271
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,087
Thank you for your help today.

272
00:23:51,383 --> 00:23:53,385
Wait, Ms. Lee...

273
00:23:57,723 --> 00:23:59,516
What? Why are the police here?

274
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:06,690
What's going on between them?

275
00:24:09,193 --> 00:24:11,320
This is making me suddenly want her.

276
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:14,615
(Trustworthy police, safe country.)

277
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:15,699
Keep up the good work.

278
00:24:17,034 --> 00:24:18,368
Yes, good work.

279
00:24:19,203 --> 00:24:20,412
Who's that guy?

280
00:24:21,371 --> 00:24:22,998
The president
of my previous workplace.

281
00:24:23,624 --> 00:24:24,791
Gosh.

282
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:28,545
You're one brave girl.

283
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:30,631
Did you report that president?

284
00:24:32,424 --> 00:24:35,010
So you should be careful too.

285
00:24:35,052 --> 00:24:37,387
I won't let you off either.

286
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:38,680
My gosh.

287
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:44,144
Anyway, why is your ex-boss
getting all clingy?

288
00:24:46,313 --> 00:24:47,314
Please.

289
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:52,319
Could you please
leave me alone today?

290
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:56,240
You called me a player
and King Euija or whatever,

291
00:24:56,323 --> 00:24:59,660
but you're the one
who has a lot of dregs in your life.

292
00:25:00,077 --> 00:25:01,078
D...

293
00:25:02,246 --> 00:25:03,247
"Dregs"?

294
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,581
No, I...

295
00:25:05,874 --> 00:25:06,959
Right.

296
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:09,086
That's the correct answer.

297
00:25:10,254 --> 00:25:12,589
No, it's not...

298
00:25:13,423 --> 00:25:14,466
a correct answer, per se.

299
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:18,178
Man, I should've been there.

300
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:22,891
I mean,

301
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,811
I should save you at least once.

302
00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:38,115
I'm already grateful enough
that you came to the police station.

303
00:25:41,743 --> 00:25:44,788
Hey, this is kind of touching.

304
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:51,295
Hey, what's going on with
Ga Yeol Chan? Does he like you?

305
00:25:51,336 --> 00:25:54,339
Come on. Stop saying nonsense.

306
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:56,133
Right? That's nonsense.

307
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:57,509
Of course, it is.

308
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:58,802
"Of course"!

309
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:01,430
- My goodness.
- I thought so.

310
00:26:01,471 --> 00:26:02,806
"Of course"!

311
00:26:05,851 --> 00:26:07,144
This burns.

312
00:26:09,897 --> 00:26:10,939
Gosh, this burns.

313
00:26:24,494 --> 00:26:26,496
It's because I was angry.

314
00:26:26,538 --> 00:26:28,498
Why does this make you angry?

315
00:26:29,499 --> 00:26:32,127
I have no idea
why I'm like this either.

316
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:40,427
Why would he get angry?

317
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:43,889
Unbelievable.

318
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,274
Goodness.

319
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:58,654
Why are you looking
so wretched all alone?

320
00:26:59,988 --> 00:27:00,989
You got here quickly.

321
00:27:03,784 --> 00:27:05,369
I can't believe
I lived to see a day like this.

322
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:09,706
I can't believe
I asked you to have a drink with me.

323
00:27:19,883 --> 00:27:21,760
I lose my confidence day after day.

324
00:27:24,346 --> 00:27:26,390
I never had any to begin with,

325
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,934
so I always ran around
trying to do everything.

326
00:27:31,645 --> 00:27:34,147
But after I persistently worked
for some time,

327
00:27:35,232 --> 00:27:39,027
I slowly got this gut feeling
that something might work out.

328
00:27:41,196 --> 00:27:42,656
But recently,

329
00:27:44,241 --> 00:27:47,369
I'm starting to get suspicious
and distrust my gut feelings.

330
00:27:47,411 --> 00:27:49,913
How will you make up for this?

331
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,748
Can you bring it back to normal?

332
00:27:55,544 --> 00:27:56,753
I'll do my best.

333
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:02,634
I can no longer say,

334
00:28:04,136 --> 00:28:05,512
"Just trust me",

335
00:28:07,472 --> 00:28:08,682
like I used to.

336
00:28:09,057 --> 00:28:11,852
Do you know what happens
if you take a step further?

337
00:28:13,061 --> 00:28:15,480
You can just
speak out of both sides.

338
00:28:15,522 --> 00:28:17,649
Just say something first,
and if it doesn't work out,

339
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:20,485
turn it all around
as if nothing had happened.

340
00:28:20,652 --> 00:28:22,404
Pretend like you don't know
even if you do.

341
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:24,615
After that, just be brazen and say,

342
00:28:24,656 --> 00:28:26,617
"That was then, but this is now."

343
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:28,243
Be like that.

344
00:28:29,995 --> 00:28:32,289
I really don't want to
end up like that.

345
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:36,418
But if you try doing that,
it's kind of easy.

346
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,297
Troubled conscience?
That doesn't happen.

347
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:43,425
If something is about to kill you,
you need to save yourself first.

348
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:48,055
I mean, it's too much work...

349
00:28:48,096 --> 00:28:51,266
to explain it to those kids
who don't know a thing.

350
00:28:52,184 --> 00:28:56,146
When things get tough,
go whip your subordinates.

351
00:28:56,188 --> 00:28:57,814
Go whip them.

352
00:28:57,856 --> 00:28:59,650
- What?
- You were good at that.

353
00:28:59,691 --> 00:29:02,027
Keep whipping them.
Whip them. Kill them.

354
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:04,238
I thought we spoke the same language
for a little bit.

355
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:08,492
Then...

356
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,827
why don't you ask Mr. Cha for help?

357
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:15,290
He might sound a bit arrogant,

358
00:29:15,332 --> 00:29:16,750
but he looked competent.

359
00:29:17,209 --> 00:29:20,337
It'll take a while
for the domestic market,

360
00:29:20,462 --> 00:29:24,716
so it's a good idea
to start with international markets.

361
00:29:26,343 --> 00:29:27,386
Mr. Cha...

362
00:29:56,123 --> 00:29:58,083
Why are you calling at this hour?

363
00:29:59,585 --> 00:30:00,878
I have a favor to ask.

364
00:30:01,086 --> 00:30:04,298
It's not that difficult
to give that a try over here.

365
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:07,843
But if this goes well,
it's our performance.

366
00:30:08,302 --> 00:30:10,053
- Okay?
- Sure.

367
00:30:10,512 --> 00:30:12,222
I just need our new product
to survive.

368
00:30:12,556 --> 00:30:13,849
That's enough.

369
00:30:13,891 --> 00:30:15,809
Stop trying to be so cool.

370
00:30:16,602 --> 00:30:17,895
It's very annoying.

371
00:30:18,103 --> 00:30:19,104
I'm hanging up.

372

00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:11,031
- Hello.
- Hello.

378
00:31:11,323 --> 00:31:14,034
Hey, Ms. Lee.
You're the talk of the town.

379
00:31:14,076 --> 00:31:15,911
I saw it too.

Ramyeon-Gobbling Woman".

What is that?

00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:20,290
Shall we watch it again?

383
00:31:20,332 --> 00:31:22,084
- You seemed quite furious.
- I know.

384
00:31:22,835 --> 00:31:24,169
What is this?

385
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:26,547
Look.

by the customers,)

(this furious Joonsu Food employee
gobbles up the ramyeon.)

388
00:31:31,343 --> 00:31:33,053
Look at the view count.

389
00:31:33,971 --> 00:31:34,930
It's unbelievable.

390
00:31:34,972 --> 00:31:36,473
Why was this uploaded?

391
00:31:36,765 --> 00:31:38,684
You ate so much.

392
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:40,018
There are so many comments too.

393
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,104
Gosh, look at you munching
on all that ramyeon.

394
00:31:42,855 --> 00:31:45,107
- Goodness.
- When was this uploaded?

395
00:31:45,148 --> 00:31:47,568
It was yesterday afternoon.

396
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:50,863
This video was
on the trending topics.

397
00:31:51,822 --> 00:31:52,781
Goodness.

398
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:55,075
Mr. Kim, can you print out
yesterday's retail sales count...

399
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:56,326
for Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon?

400
00:31:56,368 --> 00:31:57,369
Yes, sir.

401
00:31:57,661 --> 00:31:59,580
Here you go.

402
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:05,002
(Retail Sales
for Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon)

403
00:32:13,135 --> 00:32:14,136
Did they increase?

404
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:25,731
What? China ordered
our Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon.

405
00:32:25,814 --> 00:32:27,232
My goodness.

406
00:32:27,357 --> 00:32:29,818
They didn't order any samples
and ordered 30 containers.

407
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,069
Isn't this amazing?

408
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:33,572
My goodness.

409
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,243
I can't believe this.

410
00:32:38,535 --> 00:32:40,037
We did it.

411
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:42,581
I'll be getting a promotion.

412
00:32:42,623 --> 00:32:44,166
Ms. Lee, you did it.

413
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,376
Okay! You have my respect.

414
00:32:46,418 --> 00:32:49,004
This is unbelievable.
I can't believe how lucky I am.

415
00:32:49,046 --> 00:32:50,839
- Goodness.
- Great job.

416
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:52,341
This is so fascinating.

417
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:18,909
Mr. Joo.

418
00:33:21,078 --> 00:33:23,080
I liked your proposal.

419
00:33:24,373 --> 00:33:25,457
But...

420
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:28,418
I think it'll be even better
if you summarized the parts...

421
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,546
that I've checked.

422
00:33:35,592 --> 00:33:36,969
(The title should convey
the overall idea.)

423
00:33:39,221 --> 00:33:40,556
(Not many people have the patience
to read the entire proposal.)

424
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,600
(Summarize
and include background information.)

425
00:33:58,991 --> 00:34:01,660
- About last time...
- What is it?

426
00:34:02,536 --> 00:34:03,704
Did something happen?

427
00:34:06,331 --> 00:34:08,834
Also, the mid-term evaluation
is just that.

428
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:10,335
It's not final.

429
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:13,755
That proposal wasn't even included.

430
00:34:18,385 --> 00:34:19,428
Sir.

431
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:24,099
Ms. Koo knows about this.

432
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:27,519
I happened to overhear
her and Mr. Kim Do Yeong...

433
00:34:28,187 --> 00:34:29,730
talking.

434
00:34:33,317 --> 00:34:35,068
I'm here to meet
with Ms. Koo Ja Sook.

435
00:34:35,736 --> 00:34:39,072
I'm sorry, but I can't let you in
unless you have an appointment.

436
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,658
No, he's here to see me.

437
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:47,497
- Ma'am.
- Hello.

438
00:35:23,158 --> 00:35:25,911
Hello, Chairman Cheon.

439
00:35:26,828 --> 00:35:28,080
It's been a while.

440
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,376
(Chairman Namgoong Pyo,
owns 33 percent of shares)

441
00:35:33,544 --> 00:35:35,587
(Chairman Cheon Seok Ho,
owns 19.8 percent of shares)

442
00:35:35,796 --> 00:35:37,589
All right, then. Sit down.

443
00:35:40,926 --> 00:35:41,927
Goodness.

444
00:35:43,595 --> 00:35:46,598
This quarter, your stock prices...

445
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,227
roller-coasted quite a bit
and made me dizzy.

446
00:35:51,603 --> 00:35:55,941
Isn't that more fun
for people like you...

447
00:35:55,983 --> 00:35:59,152
who have hefty amounts of money?

448
00:36:00,988 --> 00:36:02,698
I guess you're right.

449
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,330
"Ga Yeol Chan"?

450
00:36:12,332 --> 00:36:16,712
You're choosing him
over your own son?

451
00:36:16,753 --> 00:36:17,921
Yes.

452
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:21,216
If I said I'd appoint my own son,

453
00:36:21,425 --> 00:36:23,427
I doubt valuable individuals
like you...

454
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:26,638
would take our side.

455
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:32,978
I guess you're right.

456
00:36:44,615 --> 00:36:47,868
He's going to nominate Yeol Chan
as the junior managing director?

457
00:36:48,994 --> 00:36:50,913
I had no idea he'd actually do that.

458
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:53,498
That means he's going
to appoint him...

459
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,000
as the managing director
in the future.

460
00:36:55,459 --> 00:36:56,627
So what did you say?

461
00:36:56,668 --> 00:36:58,879
What could I say?

462
00:36:59,296 --> 00:37:02,007
I just played along.

463
00:37:05,344 --> 00:37:06,553
You did well.

464
00:37:09,014 --> 00:37:10,224
Darn it!

465
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,852
Is he a cockroach or what?

466
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:16,522
How does he keep coming back?

467
00:37:17,773 --> 00:37:21,401
Is there a simple way to end him
once and for all?

468
00:37:21,485 --> 00:37:22,819
"Once and for all"?

469
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:24,821
You see it all the time
in the dramas.

470
00:37:24,863 --> 00:37:28,617
They'd hide money
in the person's bag and drawers...

471
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:30,994
- and accused them of bribery.
- Gosh.

472
00:37:31,328 --> 00:37:33,247
We'd be in a lot of trouble
if we did that.

473
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,999
Also, there are surveillance cameras
in all the offices.

474
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:37,918
Then what do you want me to do?

475
00:37:41,713 --> 00:37:44,633
By the way, are you my superior?

476
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,052
Why aren't you proposing
any measures?

477
00:37:47,094 --> 00:37:49,513
You need to come up with some plans.

478
00:37:52,724 --> 00:37:54,059
Darn it.

479
00:38:00,023 --> 00:38:02,067
It's a cheap trick.

480
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:07,281
Compared to the bribery scam
you've mentioned,

481
00:38:07,573 --> 00:38:09,783
this is one step higher.

482
00:38:10,742 --> 00:38:11,743
Which is?

483
00:38:13,704 --> 00:38:18,542
Back in the day,
we used to do this often.

484
00:38:20,127 --> 00:38:21,211
Soon,

485
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:23,338
the commemorative event...

486
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,965
for Joon Ramyeon's 55th anniversary
will take place.

487
00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:33,182
I've turned a corner, but...

488
00:38:34,266 --> 00:38:37,561
Mr. Kim Do Yeong,
a former colleague of yours...

489
00:38:37,603 --> 00:38:41,273
from Ongol, visited Ms. Koo.

490
00:38:41,773 --> 00:38:45,360
I happened to overhear
her and Mr. Kim Do Yeong talking.

491
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,491
Isn't my hair so slick?

492
00:38:51,742 --> 00:38:53,202
Hey, Yeol Chan.

493
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,121
What?

494
00:38:58,582 --> 00:38:59,625
What?

495
00:39:01,251 --> 00:39:03,420
Sit down. Sit beside her.

496
00:39:08,467 --> 00:39:10,594
How's your wound?

497
00:39:12,763 --> 00:39:14,932
I was too harsh on you back then.

498
00:39:16,183 --> 00:39:20,771
No, you weren't. You helped me,
and yet I got upset at you.

499
00:39:24,107 --> 00:39:25,150
You're right.

500
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:35,285
By the way,

501
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:37,746
there was something
I've been curious about.

502
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:42,042
Is it true that you were inspired
to make Spicy Chicken Ramyeon...

503
00:39:42,084 --> 00:39:44,419
after seeing a woman eat
fiery chicken here?

504
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:46,755
That's true. And it's you.

505
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:50,676
Was that a secret?

506
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,805
It was me.

507
00:39:56,223 --> 00:39:57,349
It was true.

508
00:40:04,022 --> 00:40:08,402
But it didn't make
a huge impact or anything, right?

509
00:40:09,695 --> 00:40:11,488
- Of course not.
- Right?

510
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:20,497
Then did you also see me...

511
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:23,125
bawling my eyes out?

512
00:40:26,128 --> 00:40:27,129
I did.

513
00:40:33,635 --> 00:40:35,429
Darn it.

514
00:40:35,596 --> 00:40:39,266
He escapes
every time I put him behind bars.

515
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:41,143
He does that every single time.

516
00:40:41,185 --> 00:40:44,188
Is he a zombie or what?

517
00:40:44,229 --> 00:40:49,276
Why are all the guys around me
so despicable?

518
00:40:49,318 --> 00:40:53,197
Why is this world
so cruel to me? Why?

519
00:40:53,238 --> 00:40:57,159
Bring it on, world!
Come at me, and I'll beat you up!

520
00:40:57,201 --> 00:41:01,163
This world is so bitter toward me,
but why?

521
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:02,998
Darn it.

522
00:41:07,419 --> 00:41:08,420
Right.

523
00:41:09,588 --> 00:41:12,633
- Dear Mr. Ga.
- Yes?

524
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:17,054
Why did you write such comments
on our reports?

525
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,141
Well, I didn't think much of it.

526
00:41:21,183 --> 00:41:23,393
I just jotted down
since it was just for me.

527
00:41:23,435 --> 00:41:25,187
But you read it too.

528
00:41:25,687 --> 00:41:28,815
You pretend to be cool
on the outside.

529
00:41:28,857 --> 00:41:32,152
But in your head,
you think you did all the work...

530
00:41:32,194 --> 00:41:34,154
and practically did everyone's work.

531
00:41:34,196 --> 00:41:35,739
Is that what you think?

532
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:38,450
Well, doesn't everyone think
the same way?

533
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:41,328
They all think they do everything.

534
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:44,122
- Is that so?
- Yes.

535
00:41:45,123 --> 00:41:46,124
Right?

536
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:47,918
That's true.

537
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:53,173
But then, why did you give me
two thumbs-ups?

538
00:41:53,382 --> 00:41:55,634
Explain why you did that.

539
00:41:55,884 --> 00:41:57,469
I got excited for a second.

540
00:41:57,803 --> 00:41:59,930
I had to give you two thumbs-ups...

541
00:41:59,972 --> 00:42:02,683
because I couldn't criticize
to your face.

542
00:42:03,308 --> 00:42:04,309
Thumbs-up.

543
00:42:04,852 --> 00:42:06,478
No, you're good at that.

544
00:42:07,688 --> 00:42:11,358
Right. If you want, I'll keep
criticizing you to your face.

545
00:42:11,984 --> 00:42:12,985
Gosh.

546
00:42:14,486 --> 00:42:16,029
Then, what about this?

547
00:42:16,613 --> 00:42:19,575
You put on this serious face
in front of me.

548
00:42:21,535 --> 00:42:24,872
"The company is important,
but my team members..."

549
00:42:24,913 --> 00:42:26,164
- "are important too."
- "Important too."

550
00:42:26,707 --> 00:42:27,958
That's what you said.

551
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,170
Did you say that
because you wanted to look cool?

552
00:42:31,795 --> 00:42:33,463
I don't know.
Think whatever you want.

553
00:42:33,505 --> 00:42:35,507
Why does she keep
asking me questions?

554
00:42:35,549 --> 00:42:38,260
Oh, right. What about that?

555
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:40,554
Do you remember the incident
with Park Beom Jun?

556
00:42:40,596 --> 00:42:43,015
You helped me get away from him
and ripped the contract.

557
00:42:43,056 --> 00:42:44,349
Then, you grabbed my wrist...

558
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:46,810
and took me to the car
like a really cool guy.

559
00:42:46,852 --> 00:42:49,188
And a while ago, you protected me...

560
00:42:49,229 --> 00:42:52,733
and got your back smashed for me.

561
00:42:53,859 --> 00:42:56,445
Were you trying to look cool again?

562
00:42:56,862 --> 00:42:58,488
Are you complaining
when I saved you?

563
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,908
I'm asking if you were just
putting on a show again.

564
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:02,826
No, I wasn't!

565
00:43:02,868 --> 00:43:05,579
Who would put on a show
for something like that?

566
00:43:34,691 --> 00:43:35,776
I'm sorry.

567
00:43:36,693 --> 00:43:38,028
I didn't know what I was doing.

568
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:40,280
Okay.

569
00:43:40,572 --> 00:43:41,657
Sorry.

570
00:44:22,865 --> 00:44:24,950
Seriously! She kissed me first!

571
00:45:50,702 --> 00:45:51,745
I'm sorry...

572
00:45:53,038 --> 00:45:54,831
that I can't afford to date.

573
00:46:08,595 --> 00:46:11,265
Ms. Tak, what about
the market research?

574
00:46:11,306 --> 00:46:12,683
Was that your task, Yoon Soo?

575
00:46:12,724 --> 00:46:14,309
Anyway, can I have that report now?

576
00:46:16,061 --> 00:46:17,187
Yoon Soo,

577
00:46:17,229 --> 00:46:19,398
Mr. Oh asked you to do
the market research on dry noodles.

578
00:46:19,439 --> 00:46:22,484
- How's that going?
- I'll email it to you now.

579
00:47:10,449 --> 00:47:13,035
Ms. Lee. What are you doing
this weekend?

580
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:43,607
Mr. Ga.

581
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:47,319
You're here.

582
00:47:50,197 --> 00:47:52,658
My gosh, you ordered a lot.

583
00:47:53,158 --> 00:47:55,035
These are all my favorites.

584
00:47:58,163 --> 00:48:01,124
I wanted to talk to you...

585
00:48:02,793 --> 00:48:03,877
regarding my romantic interests...

586
00:48:04,461 --> 00:48:05,546
objectively.

587
00:48:06,964 --> 00:48:09,007
I see. Okay.

588
00:48:12,052 --> 00:48:14,346
I was lying when I said
the ramyeon muse...

589
00:48:15,264 --> 00:48:16,390
wasn't important to me.

590
00:48:19,268 --> 00:48:21,687
Spicy Chicken Ramyeon
did change my life.

591
00:48:26,692 --> 00:48:28,443
The same thing happened
with Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon.

592
00:48:30,279 --> 00:48:31,280
Pardon?

593
00:48:31,697 --> 00:48:33,365
I got the idea for the ramyeon...

594
00:48:34,283 --> 00:48:35,284
from you.

595
00:48:47,087 --> 00:48:49,590
And it was you who saved
Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon...

596
00:48:50,132 --> 00:48:51,216
when it was going nowhere.

597
00:49:16,074 --> 00:49:17,910
And I kept thinking about you.

598
00:49:19,453 --> 00:49:21,747
I tried not to think about you,

599
00:49:21,788 --> 00:49:22,956
but I couldn't stop.

600
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:27,503
I thought of you to the point
that I got annoyed,

601
00:49:28,253 --> 00:49:29,421
Ms. Lee.

602
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:36,136
But that night,

603
00:49:37,262 --> 00:49:39,556
when you kissed me out of the blue,

604
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,061
I realized it then.

605
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,735
"Oh, I see. I like her."

606
00:49:53,153 --> 00:49:54,655
I see.

607
00:49:56,365 --> 00:49:57,658
Okay.

608
00:49:59,826 --> 00:50:01,578
To be honest,

609
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:07,167
there was a time
when I liked you too.

610
00:50:07,543 --> 00:50:11,296
Back then,
you were so cool and perfect.

611
00:50:14,675 --> 00:50:17,177
But you started to get weird.

612
00:50:17,302 --> 00:50:19,555
As I expected more from you
and liked you a lot,

613
00:50:19,596 --> 00:50:20,973
my disappointment was pretty big.

614
00:50:21,348 --> 00:50:23,767
I do think about you
from time to time,

615
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:25,978
but I don't know what this is.

616
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,605
You're such a kkondae.

617
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:34,528
You're such a kkondae.

618
00:50:50,586 --> 00:50:52,212
I got it.

619
00:50:59,344 --> 00:51:00,429
Wait...

620
00:51:59,238 --> 00:52:00,906
- Hello.
- Good morning.

621
00:52:00,948 --> 00:52:02,324
- Hello.
- Hello.

622
00:52:25,389 --> 00:52:28,392
Mr. Joo, please check.

623
00:52:29,518 --> 00:52:30,519
(Fine, let's do it.)

624
00:52:39,278 --> 00:52:40,237
Fine, let's do it.

625
00:52:40,279 --> 00:52:42,406
People fall in love
even in the middle of a war.

626
00:52:42,447 --> 00:52:44,157
So there's no reason why
we shouldn't date.

627
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:55,377
Then I'll meet you there,
Yoon Soo, babe.

628
00:52:59,506 --> 00:53:01,049
(Marketing and Sales, 7 people)

629
00:53:01,091 --> 00:53:02,259
(Then I'll meet you there,
Yoon Soo, babe.)

630
00:53:02,467 --> 00:53:04,803
"Yoon Soo, babe"?

631
00:53:09,308 --> 00:53:10,350
Ms. Tak.

632
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,478
What does "babe" mean?

633
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:15,189
I know what "baby" means,
but not that.

634
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,231
What?

635
00:53:17,524 --> 00:53:21,445
You sent a message in our group chat
saying, "Yoon Soo, babe."

636
00:53:21,528 --> 00:53:24,364
If it's a trendy word,
I wanted to use it too.

637
00:53:24,406 --> 00:53:27,075
- Isn't that cool, babe?
- Wait, what? What is this?

638
00:53:27,117 --> 00:53:28,952
This is huge. This is so huge.

639
00:53:28,994 --> 00:53:32,372
What is it? What's going on between
you two that you called him "babe"?

640
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:35,250
- It's... It's a typo.
- It's so not a typo.

641
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:36,460
You wanted to meet him there.

642
00:53:36,502 --> 00:53:38,587
Where is that place?
Your babe, Yoon Soo's heart?

643
00:53:38,629 --> 00:53:41,006
The meeting room. I wanted to
see him in the meeting room.

644
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:45,260
Yes, she promised to read over
my report in the meeting room.

645
00:53:45,302 --> 00:53:46,720
What report?

646
00:53:46,762 --> 00:53:49,139
Is it about how pretty your babe,
Jung Eun is?

647
00:53:49,348 --> 00:53:51,016
No, it's not like that. Stop it.

648
00:53:51,058 --> 00:53:52,309
Let me do this just a bit longer.
Give me five minutes.

649
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:53,477
I'm serious. No.

650
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:55,812
- No.
- How can you two date at this time?

651
00:54:03,529 --> 00:54:07,324
I'm sure you two already know

I'm sure they'll manage.

00:54:11,703 --> 00:54:14,831
My gosh, how long has it been
since you dated, Tak?

654
00:54:14,873 --> 00:54:16,917
- It has been...
- It's not just for my sake.

655
00:54:17,793 --> 00:54:20,295
It's awful to see a couple
get lovey-dovey at work,

656
00:54:20,337 --> 00:54:22,756

They'll bring in their relationship
into the office...

and look after one another,

661
00:54:31,181 --> 00:54:32,558
then it'll ruin
the office atmosphere.
