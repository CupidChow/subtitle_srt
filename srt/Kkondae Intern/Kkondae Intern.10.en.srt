(Kkondae Intern)

6
00:00:45,163 --> 00:00:46,290
300 dollars.

7
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:48,458
All I got was 300 dollars.

8
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:51,628
My monthly salary
I couldn't tell anyone about.

9
00:00:52,504 --> 00:00:55,757
On top of that, he said he'll pay me
when he gets the investment.

10
00:00:57,176 --> 00:00:58,468
"Good for you."

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,554
"Other people
pay to learn these things,"

12
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:02,681
"but you get paid to learn to work."

13
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:04,975
What a load of nonsense.

14
00:01:06,977 --> 00:01:10,147
I couldn't...
I just couldn't take it anymore.

15
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,191
What?

16
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:14,651
"Is your brain filled with
udon instead of brains?"

17
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:17,029
That doesn't count
as office harassment?

18
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,782
No. "Udon" isn't exactly
an abusive word.

19
00:01:20,824 --> 00:01:24,578
I mean, we can't say
only abusive words are...

20
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,413
wrong to say to others.

21
00:01:26,747 --> 00:01:31,084
He said a lot of bad things to me.

22
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:34,463
You haven't signed
an employment contract.

23
00:01:35,214 --> 00:01:37,216
By any chance,
do you have anything...

24
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:38,967
that can prove
the hours you worked...

25
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:42,012
like a work log or a list of times
that you clocked in and out?

26
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:44,723
I don't have anything like that.

27
00:01:46,308 --> 00:01:48,810
Then by any chance,

28
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:52,064
could I use my diary as proof?

29
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:53,899
Hey, where is she?

30
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:56,401
Where's this idiot?

31
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,196
How can you eat anything right now?

32
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:01,198
All you ever do is waste food.

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,909
It has only been a couple of months.
Why did you quit already?

34
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:07,204
It's not like I wanted to quit.

35
00:02:07,246 --> 00:02:10,332
I can't believe your attitude.

36
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:12,960
What will become of you
with this kind of attitude?

37
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:14,586
Do you think
I make money for doing nothing?

38
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:16,839
I put up with hearing things
I don't want to hear...

39
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,299
and my boss who nags at me
all the time to make a living.

40
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:21,760
What are you packing?

41
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:23,220
Stop nagging her while she eats.

42
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:25,013
You're too soft-hearted with her.

43
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:26,932
That's why she still can't
earn her keep at this age.

44
00:02:26,974 --> 00:02:29,309
That's why she's
still acting like a dimwit.

45
00:02:31,228 --> 00:02:32,437
- Put this away.
- Goodness.

46
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,523
My goodness. What's with you?

47
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,652
Don't you dare dream of taking
a speck of dust from my house.

48
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:43,740
I won't.

49
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:45,367
I won't take anything!

50
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:46,410
Get out right now.

51
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:47,744
Get out of my house.

52
00:02:47,786 --> 00:02:48,996
I'm leaving!

53
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:50,873
I'll leave, okay?

54
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:53,542
I told you to stop already!

55
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:55,210
- Tae Lee. Tae Lee?
- I'm leaving!

56
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:58,422
I can't believe
I had a kid like her.

57
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:15,272
You. Did you think
you'd survive in this industry...

58
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:17,524
after doing this to me?

59
00:03:20,736 --> 00:03:24,865
(Interviewer)

60
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:27,117
It's her, right?

61
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:28,785
The girl who sued Mr. Jang.

62
00:03:28,827 --> 00:03:29,786
It's her.

64
00:03:33,415 --> 00:03:37,127
He threatened me saying
I'll never survive in that industry,

65
00:03:37,461 --> 00:03:40,130
and I couldn't survive.

66
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:43,300
- A food company?
- Yes.

67
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:44,927
Wait, you studied fashion.

68
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:47,095
But you suddenly want to
get a job at a food company?

69
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:48,931
I love eating.

70
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:52,434
Hey, loads of people desperately
want to work there, but they can't.

71
00:03:52,976 --> 00:03:54,102
I'll give it a try.

72
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:01,777
Excuse me, hello.

73
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:04,154
This is my first day here,

74
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:06,448
- and my name is Lee Tae Lee.
- One second.

75
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,491
All right.

76
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:10,035
Thank you. Thank you.

77
00:04:14,873 --> 00:04:17,292
Lee Tae Lee.
Tae Lee, Tae Lee, Lee Tae Lee.

78
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:19,711
It's a new start. Let's go.

79
00:04:20,045 --> 00:04:22,881
I decided to begin my life
in a different industry.

80
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:25,884
Hello, I'm Lee Tae Lee.

81
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:29,638
You're right. My name sounds
like "Italy", Lee Tae Lee.

82
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:32,891
Hello!

83
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:36,061
I'm the senior intern
who'll begin as of today,

84
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:37,646
Lee Man Sic.

85
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:48,156
"The senior intern"?

86
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:49,366
What are you doing here?

87
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,419
Wait, a senior intern?

88
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,920
I thought you were
recruited as a director.

89
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:03,172
Did you lie to Mom?

90
00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:04,590
What happened to you?

91
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:06,967
Your mom didn't say
you began an internship.

92
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:09,094
I didn't want her to
get hopeful again.

93
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:10,804
I was going to tell her
if I get a permanent job here.

94
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:12,806
Listen up.

95
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:14,391
If your mom ever asks,

96
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,810
I came here as a director.
Do you understand?

97
00:05:18,437 --> 00:05:21,440
- How long will you hide this?
- That's none of your business!

98
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:24,526
What about the people at work?

99
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:26,236
I don't think anyone knows.

100
00:05:26,278 --> 00:05:27,613
We don't have to tell them.

101
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:28,780
Nothing good will happen.

102
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:31,074
So what? You want to pretend
like we're strangers?

103
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:34,036
We may be a family on paper,

104
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:35,579
but we're as good as strangers.

105
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:36,705
What's the problem?

106
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:38,874
Nothing. I never said
there was a problem.

107
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,918
You better step up your game.

108
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,253
Don't get in my way
of getting a permanent job.

109
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:48,592
That... That little brat.

110
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:50,636
How should I address you?

111
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:52,763
How should we address you?

112
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:54,932
Intern Lee? Sir?

113
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:56,099
Mr. Lee Man Sic.

114
00:05:57,476 --> 00:06:00,479
That's his name.
How else should we call him?

115
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:02,648
You're right.

116
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:04,608
It's his name, all right.

117
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,610
But why do I feel so uncomfortable?

118
00:06:06,777 --> 00:06:11,073
Goodness. I'll only feel
uncomfortable if you think that way.

119
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:14,034
Please treat me the same way
you'd treat them.

120
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:17,412
This is my motto.
"Be an adult, not a kkondae."

121
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:20,666
You're not old-fashioned at all.

(A rise in one-person households)

123
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,429
All right. Whatever.
What am I trying to learn?

124
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:36,598
My subordinates will do this
once I become the vice president.

125
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,483
Focus, focus!

126
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,074
You should rest now.

127
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:55,659
I'll write about rockfish ramyeon.

128
00:06:56,326 --> 00:06:57,369
Okay?

129
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,293
You're so smart
and have good character.

130
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:06,795
So why haven't you found a job yet?

131
00:07:07,713 --> 00:07:08,839
Goodness.

132
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:11,800
You must've gone through so much.

133
00:07:16,346 --> 00:07:17,556
Ga Yeol Chan!

134
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,641

Ga Yeol Chan!

137
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,358
Goodness.

138
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,068
Hey, why are you imitating me?

139
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:32,112
I'm your daughter, Man Sic, babe.

140
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:33,697
Man Sic.

141
00:07:37,618 --> 00:07:38,785
What brings you here?

142
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,871
Hey, Mom!

143
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:47,586
Why are you here?

144
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:52,090
Is this where you've been
working as an intern?

145
00:07:52,549 --> 00:07:55,886
In the same department
with your dad? Both as interns?

146
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:01,016
Mom?

147
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:04,186
Dad?

148
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:13,737
Open this.

149
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:17,908
I was going to tell you.

150
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:21,537
I was going to tell you the truth
once I got in.

151
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:23,205
That's why I...

152
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:28,710
What do you take me for?
A fool? An idiot?

153
00:08:29,086 --> 00:08:31,922
How could you deceive me
like this? How?

154
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:33,966
I...

155
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:36,802
That's not it.

156
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:39,429
Everything's fine.

157
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:42,766
Come on, honey.

158
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,530
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

159
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,657
I didn't want this
to become a disadvantage for me...

160
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:00,075
upon getting hired.

161
00:09:00,284 --> 00:09:02,077
That wouldn't have happened.

162
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:04,413
It was a blind recruitment,

163
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:05,789
and you guys are merely interns.

164
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:08,750
It's kind of weird
for a father and his daughter...

165
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,377
to work at the same place
as interns.

166
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:13,088
Then were you going
to deceive me forever?

167
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:16,383
Isn't that the purpose
of blind recruitments?

168
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,887
You could've really twisted
the family tree.

169
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:21,221
What family tree?

170
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:24,349
What if we ended up dating?

171
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:27,102
Then he could've become
my father-in-law.

172
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:28,812
What nonsense is this?

173
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:36,862
What kind of ridiculous comment
was that?

174
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:38,739
- Father, that's not...
- "Father"?

175
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:41,491
- Mr. Lee...
- You little scumbag.

176
00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:43,952
- How dare you lust after her?
- Dad!

177
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:45,746
You're dead meat today.

178
00:09:45,996 --> 00:09:47,164
Dad!

179
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:49,374
- Don't do this!
- Sir!

180
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,836
I thought dating in the workplace
was forbidden?

181
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:54,296
Dad, stop it!

182
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:56,507
- Didn't you say that?
- That's not it!

183
00:09:56,548 --> 00:09:59,343
That's not it! Nothing happened!

184
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:01,553
Go ahead, tell him.

185
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:03,222
- Nothing happened.
- That's right.

186
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:04,515
Look at you two.

187
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:07,976
It's obvious
that something happened.

188
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,020
- What did you say?
- Stop.

189
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:11,563
You said it was forbidden.

190
00:10:11,605 --> 00:10:13,398
- That's enough!
- How dare you?

191
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,983
- How dare you?
- It's nothing.

192
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:16,109
- You punk.
- Hold on.

193
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:19,780
I already feel bad for smooching
and then rejecting him.

194
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:23,617
"Smooching"?

195
00:10:24,952 --> 00:10:26,245
"Smooching"?

196
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:28,830
- You little scumbag.
- No!

197
00:10:28,872 --> 00:10:30,249
How dare you smooch her?

198
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,335
How could I have told you?

199
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:34,545
How dare you?

200
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:37,881
Don't hurt him. He's innocent.
Hit me instead.

201
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:40,509
Hit me.

202
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:43,387
I thought it was all over.

203
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,472
So why are you defending him?

204
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:47,057
Wait.

205
00:10:48,976 --> 00:10:50,310
I don't know.

206
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:54,064
Why am I doing this?

207
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:59,361
So Mr. Ga confessed to her
but got rejected?

208
00:10:59,403 --> 00:11:00,445
I think that's about right.

209
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:02,030
I thought he abhorred
dating in the workplace?

210
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:03,073
I know, right?

211
00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:05,117
Stop it!

212
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:11,707
Goodness.

213
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:15,419
How could he be...

214
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:20,340
Hold on. In hindsight,

215
00:11:20,382 --> 00:11:23,093
they do look strangely similar.

216
00:11:27,806 --> 00:11:29,933
Gosh, thank goodness
we didn't go out.

217
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:45,282
Does it hurt a lot?

218
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:48,452
I'm sorry you got beaten up
because of me.

219
00:11:49,786 --> 00:11:51,496
That's fine.

220
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:54,666
But thanks to you,
my reputation has been tainted.

221
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,376
And I don't think
it'll be recovered anytime soon.

222
00:11:56,418 --> 00:11:59,421
Let's be frank. You're the one
who made the mistake...

223
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:02,049
of mentioning him
as a father-in-law.

224
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:04,092
Is that why you told him
about our smooching?

225
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:07,304
Are you proud that you smooched
and then rejected me?

226
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:09,723
Why don't you
just tell the world about it?

227
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:12,601
What?

228
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:15,270
What did he say?

229
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:18,315
Darn it.

230
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:20,526
Move aside.

231
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:30,953
Will this also affect Ms. Lee
regarding her evaluation?

232
00:12:30,994 --> 00:12:32,788
You said dating in the workplace...

233
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:34,998
could affect our evaluations
in giving us permanent jobs.

234
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:37,459
There's nothing going on between us.

235
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:38,460
If she rejected you,

236
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:40,712
doesn't that mean
you still have feelings for her?

237
00:12:40,796 --> 00:12:43,257
That's not true. It's not.

238
00:12:44,508 --> 00:12:46,426
And about what I said last time,

239
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:48,887
I was meaning to apologize sooner.

240
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:50,889
But you guys didn't pick up.

241
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:52,432
Are you sure it's not because
you got caught?

242
00:12:52,683 --> 00:12:55,185
No. I said, no.

243
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,272
I wanted to apologize to you...

244
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:00,023
regarding dating
and your evaluations.

245
00:13:00,357 --> 00:13:02,276
It had nothing to do with her.

246
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:05,863
I wanted to apologize sooner.

247
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:09,241
I'm sorry. I crossed the line.

248
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:11,577
That's okay, sir.

249
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:35,934
How could I have told you?

250
00:13:36,185 --> 00:13:37,144
How dare you?

251
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:40,647
Don't hurt him. He's innocent.
Hit me instead.

252
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:43,025
Hit me.

253
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,861
I thought it was all over.

254
00:13:46,737 --> 00:13:48,030
So why are you defending him?

255
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:49,907
Wait.

256
00:13:50,449 --> 00:13:51,491
I don't know.

257
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:53,785
Why am I doing this?

258
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:54,828
If she rejected you,

259
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,496
doesn't that mean
you still have feelings for her?

260
00:13:56,622 --> 00:13:58,999
That's not true. It's not.

261
00:14:06,632 --> 00:14:08,634
Do I like that guy?

262
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:12,971
No.

263
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,307
I must've been crazy back then.

264
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,601
What's there to like about him?
Snap out of it.

265
00:14:17,643 --> 00:14:19,686
You don't have time for this.
Wake up, Tae Lee.

266
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:39,748
Who is that? Who is it?

267
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:44,795
Who is it?

268
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:48,048
What?

269
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:52,928
Dad.

270
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:55,931
Why are you here at this hour?

271
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,899
Look at that.
No wonder you're a professional.

272
00:15:06,316 --> 00:15:09,319
There's no doubt that
you were the former ace of Ongol.

273
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:13,407
Have you called your mom yet?

274
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:18,579
She's ignoring me as well.

275
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,751
Should we add some rice?

276
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:25,919
Sure.

277
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:28,463
How's my house?

278
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:29,631
I like it.

279
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:31,717
- It's nice, right?
- Is that a toilet?

280
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:34,970
This rhino is my pet.

281
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:39,558
This lunchbox looks delicious.

282
00:15:40,684 --> 00:15:41,643
Let me try it.

283
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:43,103
Don't you know who I am?

284
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,689
Of course, it's going to be tasty.

285
00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:49,359
Isn't it tastier
than your mom's food?

286
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:51,528
Yes, it's good.

287
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:04,374
Dad.

288
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,502
No.

289
00:16:08,712 --> 00:16:11,298
You didn't even hear me out.

290
00:16:11,757 --> 00:16:14,468
He and I have a long story.

291
00:16:15,677 --> 00:16:17,095
What are you talking about?

292
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:18,889
I wasn't talking about him.

293
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:29,858
Dad.

294
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:57,636
My goodness, Mr. Ga. Did you
buy all of the drinks yourself?

295
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:59,471
- Okay. Let me.
- Yes.

296
00:16:59,513 --> 00:17:01,390
All right. Let's see.

297
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:03,433
Which one of these drinks
is the most expensive?

298
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:05,727
- My gosh.
- Thank you for the drink.

299
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:07,062
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

300
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:09,731
What's inside this drink?
It's sweet and salty. It's so good.

301
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:11,650
Goodness, this definitely got
my blood sugar going.

302
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,572
We had a distasteful
incident yesterday.

303
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:18,740
I ask that you stop talking...

304
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:21,577
about my scandal with an employee
whose surname starts with L.

305
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:24,037
Seriously?

306
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,164
It's only a scandal.

307
00:17:26,206 --> 00:17:28,250
Let's not get the wrong idea.
We all should chant it.

308
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:29,960
- It's only a scandal.
- It's only a scandal.

309
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:31,336
- Let's not get the wrong idea.
- Let's not get the wrong idea.

310
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:32,880
- It's... Yes?
- Mr. Oh.

311
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:36,925
How's the 55th anniversary project
for Joon Ramyeon coming along?

312
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:37,968
It's going well.

313
00:17:38,302 --> 00:17:40,012
Unlike someone,
I don't have time to date.

314
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:41,597
So I've been working diligently.

315
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:43,891
Come on, Mr. Oh.

316
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:48,520
By the way, your evaluation is
around the corner.

317
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:50,230
Are you guys preparing
for it, interns?

318
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:51,982
- What?
- Yes.

319
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:53,984
Did you get a partner
for your presentation?

320
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:56,445
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

321
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:58,739
I heard they'll get extra points
for pairing up with senior interns.

322
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,449
Other senior interns are
in high demand.

323
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,491
Gosh!

324
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:04,870
I heard from other senior interns
that everyone is...

325
00:18:04,912 --> 00:18:06,663
wanting to pair up with them.

326
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:17,591
Hello, I'm Intern Hong.

327
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:19,885
Hello, I'm Intern Lee Su Jeong.
I hope we can work well together.

328
00:18:19,927 --> 00:18:21,887
- Enjoy it.
- Enjoy the food.

329
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:24,515
Okay. Why are they giving me food?

330
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:27,518
My gosh, look at all this food.

331
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:30,062
That small dog's poop is
as big as a person's.

332
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:34,107
My gosh, how do you put up
with such a hard job like this?

333
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:36,610
I heard the CEO is a complete jerk.

334
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:38,529
Hey.

335
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:41,156
- What's this?
- What?

336
00:18:41,782 --> 00:18:43,033
Why is my name last?

337
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:45,285
Whether it's our age
or the order of the Korean letters,

338
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:46,745
my name should be placed
before yours.

339
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:49,039
Hey. Listen.

340
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:51,625
You didn't even help that much.

341
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,168
And you want your name
to come first?

342
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,378
Of course.

343
00:18:57,506 --> 00:19:00,092
That's why we call you kkondae.

344
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:02,803
Hey, switch our names.

345
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:08,058
But why is no one
reaching out to me?

346
00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:16,400
My goodness. What will happen
if I don't get a partner?

347
00:19:18,193 --> 00:19:19,486
What do you say?

348
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:22,865
You know the presentation
assignment with a partner?

349
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:25,659
I heard it's a deathmatch
where only one person passes.

350
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:29,580
Right. If we pair up,
will you let me win, Dad?

351
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:33,709
Your mother wants a divorce.

352
00:19:35,878 --> 00:19:37,171
So what?

353
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:39,840
You want to beat your daughter
at this presentation?

354
00:19:39,882 --> 00:19:43,051
Do you think you can beat me?

355
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:45,596
Gosh.

356
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:49,391
This is why no one wants
to pair up with you.

357
00:19:54,897 --> 00:19:57,858
What? Managing director?

358
00:20:00,152 --> 00:20:02,237
Sir, I don't want
that kind of position.

359
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:03,780
And I'm not qualified...

360
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:05,574
Once I'm gone,

361
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:08,952
someone else will take
over the company.

362
00:20:09,328 --> 00:20:12,915
Do you think my son, Joon Su,
can protect the company?

363
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,834
But still.
I can't take that position.

364
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:19,296
I'm not telling you
that you must take the position.

365
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:21,173
Then?

366
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:24,301
I'm trying to...

367
00:20:25,177 --> 00:20:26,929
feel someone out.

368
00:20:28,222 --> 00:20:30,766
Do you want me to be your bait?

369
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:40,400
Here.

370
00:20:41,568 --> 00:20:44,279
Sir, you recommended Mr. Ga...

371
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:46,156
as the junior managing director.

372
00:20:46,198 --> 00:20:47,199
What?

373
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:51,036
Mr. Park was let go because of
the sexual harassment scandal.

374
00:20:51,203 --> 00:20:53,038
So there's an opening.

375
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:54,873
So I recommended him. So what?

376
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:57,209
Is that the highest position
you'll give him?

377
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:58,460
- Or...
- Or what?

378
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:01,129
are you thinking about making him
the managing director too?

379
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:02,756
My gosh.

380
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:05,801
Well, that's not my concern.

381
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,761
I'm sure the committee
will do their due diligence...

382
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:09,346
to check if he's qualified.

383
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,684
Darn it. You scared me for a while.

384
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:17,938
The committee and qualifications
are mere formalities.

385
00:21:18,188 --> 00:21:21,692
In the end, they'll vote if they
want to appoint me again.

386
00:21:26,822 --> 00:21:28,532
What's up with this vibe?

387
00:21:29,324 --> 00:21:32,870
Dad! Are you seriously thinking
about backing him up?

388
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:34,371
And you'll just toss your son aside?

389
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:37,332
Gosh, I'm not backing him up
or anything.

390
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,294
If you want to get appointed again,

391
00:21:40,335 --> 00:21:42,296
you should do your best to survive.

392
00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:43,463
No way!

393
00:21:43,714 --> 00:21:46,675
Right. I happen to be
the chairperson of the committee...

394
00:21:46,717 --> 00:21:49,011
to check qualifications
of the candidates.

395
00:21:49,344 --> 00:21:50,345
Is that so?

396
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,183
Well, then I know
it will be in good hands.

397
00:22:08,947 --> 00:22:09,948
What?

398
00:22:22,294 --> 00:22:24,588
I can't hold it in. Mr. Ga.

399
00:22:25,547 --> 00:22:27,049
Are you getting promoted
to the junior managing director?

400
00:22:27,883 --> 00:22:29,551
Well,

401
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:34,431
nothing has been decided yet.

402
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:35,516
I see.

403
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:38,685
Mr. Oh. Come here, Mr. Oh.

404
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:42,397
- What?
- That's not the position.

405
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:44,274
- Then which position is it?
- It's the managing director.

406
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:47,194
There's a rumor going viral online
and on tabloids...

407
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:49,571
that Mr. Ga might be
the next managing director.

408
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:51,114
Managing director?

409
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:59,665
Let me call you Managing Director Ga
very carefully.

410
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:01,333
My gosh.

411
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,418
I remember the first time
we met, Mr. Ga.

412
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,921
You said you wanted to work hard
together to the end.

413
00:23:05,963 --> 00:23:08,507
- My gosh, I thought...
- I have big news!

414
00:23:09,091 --> 00:23:10,884
I heard this from my friend in HR.

415
00:23:10,926 --> 00:23:13,095
There's only one permanent position
available for our team.

416
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:15,138
What? So 1 of the 3 interns
will get the permanent position?

417
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,682
Didn't you see that coming though?

418
00:23:16,723 --> 00:23:19,393
No, not just that.
Including Ms. Tak.

419
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,355
Only one of the interns or Ms. Tak
will get the permanent position.

420
00:23:23,397 --> 00:23:25,774
What? What is this about?

421
00:23:25,816 --> 00:23:27,651
These two just started dating.

422
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:29,486
And they are a father
and a daughter.

423
00:23:29,528 --> 00:23:31,488
Are they supposed
to fight for the position now?

What is this about?

429
00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:48,380
I have a question for you.

430
00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:50,382
Is it true that our team only has...

431
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:52,593
one opening
for the permanent position?

432
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:55,470
Oh, that? Yes, that's true.

433
00:23:56,138 --> 00:23:57,639
How can that be?

434
00:23:58,056 --> 00:24:00,434
You can't let contract workers
and interns compete with each other.

435
00:24:02,728 --> 00:24:05,522
Ms. Tak should get
a fair evaluation.

436
00:24:05,772 --> 00:24:07,107
You know,

437
00:24:09,276 --> 00:24:12,487
the truth is that Ms. Koo
was very firm about this.

438
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:16,575
Why would she have influence
over the job openings for my team?

going on with these losers.

00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,299
I'm sure one of you
brought it up first.

489
00:27:19,341 --> 00:27:22,636
It happened almost at the same time.
It was uncanny.

490
00:27:25,848 --> 00:27:28,225
Show them a smile.
We can talk later.

493
00:28:02,926 --> 00:28:03,969
Where are you?

494
00:28:06,555 --> 00:28:09,683
What's with this company?

495
00:28:11,393 --> 00:28:13,562
- What do you mean?
- If we have to compete,

496
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:15,689
senior interns should
compete with other senior interns.

497
00:28:15,731 --> 00:28:18,650
How can you put us up
against young people?

498
00:28:21,236 --> 00:28:23,322
Why? Did someone tell you off?

499
00:28:24,156 --> 00:28:26,742
No one does that.

500
00:28:27,117 --> 00:28:29,161
It feels like I'm taking away...

501
00:28:29,745 --> 00:28:31,955

502

Oh, I'm Lee Man Sic. Hello.

Do you have a partner?

00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:36,812
Well, yes, kind of.

517
00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:38,021
What about you?

518
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:39,439
Me too.

519
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:41,316
Gosh, this isn't easy.

Mr. Eom, don't go the wrong way
and make this work.

- Ms. Ok.
- Hey.

522
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,117
- What brings you here?
- Goodness.

523
00:29:50,158 --> 00:29:52,244
We need to set up a time.

524
00:29:52,286 --> 00:29:54,329
- Gosh.
- What time should we do it?

525
00:29:54,913 --> 00:29:57,040
Well, either two or three o'clock.

526
00:29:57,666 --> 00:30:00,377
Then let's do it at 4:00pm,
and eat dinner together.

527
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:01,461
We can do it!

528
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,214
No, I'm thankful.

529
00:30:07,176 --> 00:30:08,135
You're the best.

530
00:30:08,177 --> 00:30:10,721
No, I'm grateful that
you're willing to do this with me.

531
00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:21,231
- Dad.
- Stop that.

532
00:30:21,773 --> 00:30:22,941
Gosh.

533
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,569
You still haven't found
a partner for the presentation?

534
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:27,529
No.

535
00:30:28,363 --> 00:30:29,323
Why?

536
00:30:29,364 --> 00:30:33,744
That's why you need to stop saying
things like, "Back in my days".

537
00:30:33,785 --> 00:30:36,747
You should humble yourself
when you approach younger people.

538
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:38,999
And hear out their ideas...

539
00:30:39,124 --> 00:30:40,542
instead of asserting only yours.

You can't do this with me.

542
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:46,673
One of the partners will
end up getting dropped.

543
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:49,384
There's only room for
one more person in our department.

544
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:51,220
We should've teamed up...

545
00:30:51,261 --> 00:30:53,388
and made sure one person wins.

546
00:31:00,646 --> 00:31:02,064
I'm so sorry.

547
00:31:02,272 --> 00:31:05,734
It's okay. I have loads of people
who want to do it with me.

Okay. Let's do this.

Mr. Namgoong Joon Su was
behind all this.

580

He gave you
the worst interns on purpose...

Is that why you said...

our team can only recruit one person
including the contract worker?

584

To be precise,

585
00:33:43,392 --> 00:33:46,603
we will only evaluate
that contract worker for this job.

of the situation,

into our company anyway.

to keep them from getting hurt.

Let's be discreet about this
and make them leave.

611

Let's just sugarcoat it
and make it look like...

612
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:23,200
they didn't pass the evaluation.

613
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:42,761
Gosh, you've become quite bold.

614
00:35:42,803 --> 00:35:44,304
Since you've been nominated
as the junior managing director,

615
00:35:44,346 --> 00:35:46,181
you've become brazen enough
to call me over like this.

of this corruption,

they won't face any charges.

637
00:37:43,674 --> 00:37:45,509
Since they didn't solicit anyone
in order to get in,

they don't have to leave

were punished.

- Okay.
- The White Chicken Ramyeon order?

650
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:20,335
You can just email it to me.

651

Yes, it's mansigi at...

Excuse me.

659
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:48,655
Like we thought,
we can pick our topics.

660
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:50,532
But what is this "sales mission"?

661
00:38:51,158 --> 00:38:54,661
They'll give you an item
and tell you to sell it.

662
00:38:54,745 --> 00:38:56,496
They'll observe
how quick-witted you are.

663
00:38:56,538 --> 00:38:58,415
This mission
was really difficult for me.

I think Mr. Lee would be good at it.

665

You know it. I'm the best
when it comes to selling.

Yes.

If you want to sell an item,

670
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,875
make them feel like they need it.

671
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,088
They may not need it at the moment,

672
00:39:46,964 --> 00:39:49,091
but make them feel like they do.

673

That's the basics of sales.

674

Why are you telling me this?

675
00:40:02,437 --> 00:40:04,189
Because everyone can see...

how desperate you are.

677
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:13,198
You should watch it.

678
00:40:13,407 --> 00:40:17,953
Seeming too desperate
won't look good to your superiors.

That's strange.

689

- Yes.

No way.

- It's the truth.
- He's so gentle.

Not at all.

look back...

Hypothetically speaking,

725
00:44:26,952 --> 00:44:29,413

if you either got the job...

not based on...

your qualifications...

728
00:44:34,751 --> 00:44:36,003
but based on external factors?

729
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,381
Darn it.

730
00:44:40,048 --> 00:44:41,842
I should kill everyone involved.

731
00:44:41,884 --> 00:44:43,385
I can't let them be.

732
00:44:43,594 --> 00:44:45,179
Wait, it doesn't mean...

733
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,847
you won't get the job.

734
00:44:47,055 --> 00:44:48,932
Will you feel the same way
if you get the job?

735

robbed of their chance at the job.

Okay. Just eat it.

00:45:02,404 --> 00:45:04,698

and get the job...

I'm always rooting for you.
You know that, right?

755
00:46:05,676 --> 00:46:07,761
Are you already drunk?

756
00:46:07,803 --> 00:46:10,931

does that make you a sidekick?

- What?
- You could have chosen anyone.

like that lame jerk's sidekick.

all this time.

as a friend.

I have to keep my head above water.

772
00:46:52,973 --> 00:46:54,308
You punk.

773
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:56,351
- Sure. I want my head underwater.
- Underwater, my foot.

774
00:46:56,393 --> 00:46:58,145

- Man Sic.

782
00:47:18,498 --> 00:47:20,292
But since you're doing
a presentation,

783
00:47:20,334 --> 00:47:22,503
why don't you do hand gestures
to look cool?

784

Let me tell you about the smartphone
markets in the ASEAN countries.

788
00:47:38,393 --> 00:47:40,687
The average Internet penetration
rate in ASEAN countries...

789
00:47:40,729 --> 00:47:41,855
is 53 percent.

790
00:47:41,897 --> 00:47:44,191
And 89 percent of the users
have smartphones.

791
00:47:44,233 --> 00:47:46,151
And it's expected that 56 percent
of the smartphone owners...

792
00:47:46,193 --> 00:47:47,611
will be involved
in an online transaction.

793
00:47:47,653 --> 00:47:50,614
The governments
of ASEAN countries...

794
00:47:53,784 --> 00:47:54,910
I just gave it a try.

a fashion philosophy...

796

Newtro...

797
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,093
Dad, why did you ask me to present?

798
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,263
Mom said you were really good
at giving presentations.

799
00:48:14,304 --> 00:48:16,890
They always signed the contracts
when you did the presentations.

800
00:48:25,399 --> 00:48:27,776
I'll do a great job
for the both of us...

801
00:48:27,943 --> 00:48:29,319
and get you a job there.

802
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,365

- No.
- No.

00:49:48,607 --> 00:49:49,942
Don't let us intimidate you.

812
00:49:49,983 --> 00:49:52,736
You have been working
at the company for six months.

813
00:49:52,778 --> 00:49:55,822
Show us
what you have learned so far.

814
00:49:55,864 --> 00:49:57,407
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

815
00:49:57,783 --> 00:49:58,784
Good luck.

816
00:49:59,826 --> 00:50:01,995
There are 1st and 2nd rounds.

817
00:50:02,037 --> 00:50:03,997
But today, we'll proceed with
the individual assignment first.

818
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:06,750
And you'll deliver
your presentations later.

(Sell a cell phone to a man
in his 60s.)

820
00:50:33,735 --> 00:50:35,654
Me? That's too bad.

821
00:50:36,238 --> 00:50:38,824
I just bought
a new cell phone last month.

822
00:50:40,158 --> 00:50:42,703
This isn't the cell phone
I want to sell to you.

823
00:50:42,744 --> 00:50:44,663
I want to sell you my phone.

824
00:50:45,372 --> 00:50:46,540
You want me to buy your phone?

825
00:50:46,582 --> 00:50:47,916
Why would I do that?

826
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:49,668
Can he do that?

827
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:52,588
It said, "sell a cell phone".

828
00:50:52,754 --> 00:50:55,132
It didn't specify I had to
sell a particular cell phone.

829
00:50:55,174 --> 00:50:56,425
That wasn't in the rules.

830
00:50:56,466 --> 00:50:58,343
- He's right.
- He has a point.

831
00:50:59,178 --> 00:51:02,723
It's a bit embarrassing
to tell you this myself.

832
00:51:03,056 --> 00:51:06,310
I had worked at a ramyeon company
for over 30 years.

833
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,147
This phone comes
with all the contacts of buyers...

834
00:51:10,189 --> 00:51:13,066
I met while working
at the company for 30 years.

835
00:51:13,108 --> 00:51:15,527
You'll recognize their names
when you hear them right away.

836
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:16,945
They are big names in Korea.

837
00:51:17,487 --> 00:51:20,073
I bet you wanted to get
their contacts, but you couldn't.

838
00:51:20,115 --> 00:51:22,618
But I have contacts of people
who work in logistics abroad.

(Interviewer)

840
00:51:24,536 --> 00:51:27,039
And don't forget the owners
of small import companies.

841
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:31,293
I believed in them when
they started off as street vendors.

842
00:51:31,335 --> 00:51:33,462
I believed in their potentials.

843
00:51:39,176 --> 00:51:42,721
Mr. Kozosky, the supervisor
of BC Mart from Russia.

844
00:51:42,971 --> 00:51:46,016
Mr. Cholongkutok,
an import buyer from Mongolia.

845
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:48,352
Mr. Baduduk Grumi from Nepal.

846
00:51:48,393 --> 00:51:50,729
Mr. Adelaman from the Arab Emirates.

847
00:51:50,771 --> 00:51:53,607
Mr. Eungekong
of Kong Mart from Vietnam.

00:51:53,649 --> 00:51:55,943
Mr. Andes Mendoza from Brazil.

849
00:51:55,984 --> 00:51:57,611
Mr. Panchobia Baldes from Mexico.

850
00:51:57,653 --> 00:51:59,112
That's pretty useful.

851

China?

852
00:52:03,784 --> 00:52:06,537
Mr. Binghao. "Thank you, Man Sic".

853
00:52:07,788 --> 00:52:09,748
Is that the guy who signed
the contract with Binghao?

854
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,667
Yes, that's right.

855
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:14,503
Everyone, the moment
you buy this phone,

856
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:16,797
it will be the same as having
thousands of troops and horses.

857
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,466
You will be buying my experience...

858
00:52:19,508 --> 00:52:23,387
of 30 years and my identity
with this cell phone.

859
00:52:24,096 --> 00:52:25,556
I'll buy it. 200 dollars.

860
00:52:25,597 --> 00:52:27,307
I'll buy it. 300 dollars.

861
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:29,226
300 dollars. Any other takers?

862
00:52:29,685 --> 00:52:31,270
I'll buy it for 3,000 dollars.

863
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:33,230
- Sold!
- My gosh.

864
00:52:33,272 --> 00:52:35,816
- No!
- He said he'd sell it to me.

865
00:52:37,234 --> 00:52:38,235
That's it.

866
00:53:06,722 --> 00:53:07,764
Well,

867
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:09,892
the forecast said it'd rain today.

868
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:11,101
I'm not buying.

869
00:53:20,235 --> 00:53:22,738
If you want to sell an item,
make them feel like they need it.

870
00:53:22,863 --> 00:53:24,948
They may not need it at the moment,

871
00:53:25,073 --> 00:53:26,950
but make them feel like they do.

872
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:29,745
That's the basics of sales.

873
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:30,871
Wait.

874
00:53:32,873 --> 00:53:34,249

- What is this?

- My gosh, what is that?
- What are you doing?

878
00:53:41,381 --> 00:53:42,341
Why did you bring that?

879
00:53:42,382 --> 00:53:43,759
- What will you do with it?
- What?

880
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:48,639
What are you up to?

881
00:53:50,682 --> 00:53:51,683
I'm sorry.

882
00:53:52,184 --> 00:53:54,603
I'm not doing this
because I want to.

Are you really going
to splash water on her?

884
00:54:07,407 --> 00:54:08,867
I'm sorry.

- What did she pick?

891
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:51,785
What is that?

892
00:54:53,328 --> 00:54:54,454
That's rice. Rice.

No, I don't want it.

Okay, let's do this.

and played tag before, haven't you?

What will you do?

900
00:56:09,112 --> 00:56:10,239
I'll buy it. I'll buy the rice.

901

I hope he doesn't get too nervous

much easier if he makes it.

They probably began
their team presentation by now.

00:56:52,614 --> 00:56:55,075
First off,
we analyzed our consumers...

911
00:56:55,117 --> 00:56:59,580
and made a graph
with their opinions on health.

912
00:56:59,663 --> 00:57:03,375
People's confidence regarding
their health drops with age,

913
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:06,211
but their interest in a healthy life
continually increases.

914

all over Thailand through

937

They've been showing
continuous growth in Thailand,

938
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:15,864
so we kept a close eye on them.

939
00:58:15,906 --> 00:58:19,868
Recently, it seemed like they were
hoping to expand their business.

940
00:58:21,078 --> 00:58:22,162
I've never heard of this company.

941

No, sir. I didn't do this.

It's all thanks to Mr. Joo Yoon Soo.

Come here.

947
00:58:39,763 --> 00:58:42,349
What do you mean,
you contacted them yourself?

948
00:58:42,391 --> 00:58:46,228
Yes, sir. I tried contacting them
through their email address.

949
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:49,189
They showed interest, especially
for our Spicy Chicken Ramyeon,

950
00:58:49,231 --> 00:58:51,483
so I sent them one of our catalogs.

951
00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:53,318
When did that happen?

952
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,903
Yes, sir. I sent it two days ago.

953
00:58:54,945 --> 00:58:56,989
They contacted us back
right before the interview,

954
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:59,032
so I transferred
the email to Mr. Ga.

Not only has newtro
captured fashion and culture,

963
00:59:33,066 --> 00:59:34,443
but it has become a mega-trend...

even in the food
and distribution industry.

00:59:45,746 --> 00:59:47,915
leading people to spend their money
on emotional values.

970
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:52,669
You all know Chamjincheoreom soju
became a huge hit...

971
00:59:52,711 --> 00:59:54,963
after they returned with
their old toad packaging, right?

972
00:59:55,088 --> 00:59:58,217
Also, this is a water bottle
that was literally in...

973
00:59:58,258 --> 00:59:59,676
every single household
in the 80s and 90s.

974
00:59:59,718 --> 01:00:02,554
It's this juice bottle
from the Starmont company.

975
01:00:03,931 --> 01:00:05,807
After its launch in 1963,

976
01:00:06,016 --> 01:00:09,061
Joon Ramyeon became
a big trend in the 80s and 90s.

977
01:00:09,311 --> 01:00:11,104
There are stories of...

978
01:00:11,146 --> 01:00:14,274
our grandfathers, grandmothers,
mothers, and fathers in the ramyeon.

979
01:00:15,192 --> 01:00:17,611
There's the story of a mother...

980
01:00:17,653 --> 01:00:19,988
who couldn't waste the package
and packed seasoned seaweed...

981
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:22,866
for her children's lunch box.

982
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:26,036
There's the story of a father who
threw in thin noodles in ramyeon...

983
01:00:26,078 --> 01:00:28,163
because ramyeon was
still too valuable back then.

984
01:00:28,914 --> 01:00:30,165
We can use these stories...

985
01:00:30,207 --> 01:00:32,292
- Don't try too hard.
- to make a retro edition...

986
01:00:32,334 --> 01:00:34,545

- and launch it for a limited time.

(Interviewer)

988
01:00:41,552 --> 01:00:43,387
Great job. Good job!

989

Great job!

990
01:01:02,155 --> 01:01:03,198
Who's that?

991
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:06,201
I'm Lieutenant Lee Geun Seok
of Intellectual Crime Team...

992
01:01:06,243 --> 01:01:08,078
- of the Seoul Metropolitan Police.
- So?

993
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,164
Mr. Lee Man Sic, Ms. Lee Tae Lee,
and Mr. Joo Yoon Soo.

994
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:13,208
I have questions to ask you
regarding recruitment corruption.

995
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:15,210
I need to ask you to come with me.

996
01:01:16,211 --> 01:01:17,379
Recruitment corruption?

997
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,381
What?

998
01:02:04,468 --> 01:02:06,178
(Kkondae Intern)

999
01:02:06,261 --> 01:02:09,973
Are you allowed to do this
if you're rich and powerful?

1000
01:02:10,015 --> 01:02:11,642
Do you think we're a joke?

1001
01:02:11,683 --> 01:02:12,935
You need to be wise.

1002
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:14,728
Depending on what you say,

1003
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:17,773
either Ga Yeol Chan
or you will get fired.

1004
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:18,899
Does Mr. Ga know...

1005
01:02:18,941 --> 01:02:21,735
that you're
President Namgoong's spy?

1006
01:02:21,777 --> 01:02:23,111
I'm not a spy!

1007
01:02:23,153 --> 01:02:25,739
You seem to love our company.

1008
01:02:25,781 --> 01:02:27,074
Yeol Chan...

1009
01:02:27,115 --> 01:02:28,909
You have to leave as soon as
you're done with the noodles.

1010
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:31,620
May I stay here for a while?

1011
01:02:31,662 --> 01:02:32,663
What?

1012
