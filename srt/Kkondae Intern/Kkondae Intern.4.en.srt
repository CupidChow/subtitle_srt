00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:37,906
- Oh no.
- My gosh.

8
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:40,075
Mr. Ga!

00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:42,619
Yeol Chan! Hey, kid!

10
00:00:43,912 --> 00:00:44,997
Hang in there!

11
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:03,265
My gosh! Are you insane?

12
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:06,435
Hey. Goodness.

13
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:07,728
Can't you see that I'm breathing?

14
00:01:09,897 --> 00:01:10,898

16
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:31,293
I hate doing product placements,

17
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:34,087
but I will consider doing it.

18
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:37,090
- Thank you.
- I'll just consider it.

19
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:38,133
I'll just think about it.

20
00:01:38,258 --> 00:01:41,512
And let's make one thing clear.

21
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:43,972
Even if I end up doing it,

22
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:47,601
it's only because of
Mr. Ga Yeol Chan.

23

Thank you.

Thank you!

26
00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:00,447
I'll just think about it.
I'm just going to think about it.

27

Mr. Joo!

28
00:02:50,497 --> 00:02:51,707
Have you had breakfast?

29
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,041
Yes.

30
00:02:54,918 --> 00:02:56,962
Great job. You should eat breakfast.

31
00:03:09,183 --> 00:03:10,350
- Hello.
- Hello.

32
00:03:10,392 --> 00:03:12,436
- Hello.
- What is this?

33
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:14,980
Mr. Oh, come over here.
You have to see this.

34
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:16,190
Why? What is it?

- This is no joke.

What is it?

37
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,198
- It's out?
- Yes, keep going. Keep it going.

38

Goodness.

39
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:31,121
Did you eat a rat alive?

40
00:03:31,455 --> 00:03:34,208
No, I had chicken.

41
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:36,293
What is this?

42
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:38,378
My mouth is on fire.

43
00:03:38,712 --> 00:03:40,672
What kind of chicken did you eat...

44
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:43,425

45

- My gosh.

48
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:57,523
Do you hear the sound
of our sales spiking up?

49
00:03:57,564 --> 00:03:59,107
Their ratings are
at 30 percent and above,

50
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:00,692
and it's already sold overseas
to be aired.

51
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:02,152
We're going to sell this abroad too?

52
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:05,447
Ms. Ban, can you stop us already?

53
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:07,783
- We can't seem to stop.
- Have you seen a doctor?

It looks wonderful. My gosh.

56
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:12,496
Will you please stop doing
things like these?

57
00:04:12,538 --> 00:04:14,498
What are you talking about?
I look like this goblin?

58
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,542
- Stop it.
- I thought it was you, Mr. Oh.

59
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,543
Is it my profile?

60
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:19,127
I'm trying to be nice.
What's with him?

61
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:20,712

- No.
- Yes.

67

I heard she singled out Mr. Lee...

68

- Yes.

72

73
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:49,408
Okay, of course.

74
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:51,451
I'm sure you managed this
all right, Mr. Ga.

dating someone?

00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:55,455
Pardon?

77
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:58,917
You don't seem
very focused recently.

78
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,004
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

79
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:04,214
She's just saying that to help you
stay on top of everything.

80
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:06,758

88
00:05:27,446 --> 00:05:28,947

Mr. Ga was just told off
by my kkondae just now.

94

Do you need anything in the office?

95
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:49,343
Just say it.

Goodness.

97

Isn't the air fresher?

to see you up here.

107
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,596
Please bring four cups of coffee
to the meeting room.

108
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,310
Mr. Lee, what's wrong?

109
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:43,105
Is there a problem
with making coffee?

110
00:06:49,403 --> 00:06:51,780
- No.
- Thank you.

111
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:03,625
Mr. Lee, is the coffee...

112
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:06,128
What?

113
00:07:06,628 --> 00:07:08,463
What is it? What?

114
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:10,382
What are you doing with the wrapper?

115
00:07:10,424 --> 00:07:11,967
Make new ones.

116
00:07:12,926 --> 00:07:16,597
No one else drinks coffee mix
except for you and Mr. Ahn.

117
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:19,600
Please prepare Americano
from now on. Do you understand?

118
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:22,269
You kids can make your own coffee.

119
00:07:22,811 --> 00:07:24,354
"You kids"?

120
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:27,733
You should be thanking me
for making coffee for you kids,

121
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:29,234
yet you're complaining
about my being dirty.

122
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:30,652
And how clean are you, exactly?

123
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:33,197
Mr. Lee, let's make this clear.

124
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:36,116
You're an intern, not a director.

125
00:07:36,158 --> 00:07:38,202
Do you think
I'm like the other interns?

126
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:43,790
What's wrong?

127
00:07:44,082 --> 00:07:46,293
- He wants me to make coffee.
- She wants me to make coffee.

128
00:07:49,087 --> 00:07:52,841
I'll make the coffee.
You should attend the meeting.

129
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:57,846
He's so unbelievable.

130
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:01,850
My goodness.

131
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:05,103
Sir, you shouldn't have done that.
She's your superior.

132
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:08,148
Superior, my foot.
She's a mere contract worker.

133
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,817
I ought to snap her neck.

134
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:11,944
Sir.

135
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:14,655
Hey, come here
and make some coffee.

136
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:16,448
- No, I can do it.
- No.

137
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,536
Make four cups of Americano
and bring them to the meeting room.

138
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:21,620
What?

139
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:31,713
- Where's the coffee?
- The others are making it.

140
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,509
What are you writing?

141
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:39,012
"MF"?

142
00:08:45,227 --> 00:08:47,187
"Male, female"?

143
00:08:50,107 --> 00:08:52,192
Spicy Chicken brand
or Joon Ramyeon's...

144
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:53,527
extension products are good.

145
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:55,320
It could be meat or curry.

146
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:57,698
They could be HMR collaborations.

147

(HMR: A type of instant foods)

148
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:01,410
The topic is
"something new but familiar".

149
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:03,996
I'd like you guys to write up
a proposal each.

150
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:04,997
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

151
00:09:05,038 --> 00:09:06,790
And I'd like the interns
to help out.

152
00:09:07,124 --> 00:09:08,166
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:13,213
Wait.

154
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,716
How about our interns
also write up their own?

155
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:20,220
Mr. Lee was the one
who made Ong Ramyeon.

156
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,640
Is that so?

157
00:09:29,062 --> 00:09:32,608
Is this finally my chance
to do some real work?

158
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:38,906
(Marketing and Sales Department)

159
00:09:38,947 --> 00:09:40,741
Goodness.

160
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:44,912
This is good.
I think it's all right.

161
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:48,332
Gosh, it's so neat.

162
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:52,586
Mr. Oh, my proposal
is going to be breathtaking.

163
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:54,505
You're already breathtaking as is.

164
00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:03,305
Gosh, that's spicy.

165

What do we have here?

166
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:18,070
(New, changes,
challenges, evolution)

167
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:19,446
Does this help?

168
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:20,489
Yes.

169
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:24,785
Mind maps provide
the optimal environment...

170
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:26,787
for our brains to work.

171
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:29,039
Our brains will reach
the highest effectiveness.

172
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:37,506
Is there anything you have in mind?

173
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:41,468
We're told to use
the products that already exist.

174
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:44,763
We have dried pollack.

175
00:10:45,472 --> 00:10:49,059
I thought about adding
a bunch of it.

176
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:50,686
Dried pollack ramyeon...

177
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:52,688
Is that it?

178
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:53,730
Yes.

179
00:10:57,276 --> 00:10:58,569
That was too simple, wasn't it?

180
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,029
No, it sounds good.

181
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:04,825
No wonder you came up
with Ong Ramyeon. You're brilliant.

182
00:11:07,202 --> 00:11:08,495
Goodness.

183
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:12,499
Sir.

184
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,128
Have you ever had it before?

185
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:19,173
No, I haven't.

186
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:22,509
But I did add ramyeon
to some dried pollack soup.

187
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:26,263
And it was amazing.

188
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:29,016
Since then,
I tell my wife to add ramyeon...

189
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:30,934
whenever she cooks
some dried pollack soup.

190
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:32,769
My son loves it as well.

191
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:34,354
It's that good?

192
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:35,731
Even kids like it.

193
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:36,815
Gosh.

194
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:38,567
That's great.

195
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:41,278
I guess so.

196
00:11:43,322 --> 00:11:46,116
Is this finally my time to shine?

197
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,786
I feel so alive.

198
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:52,331
I've always been doing menial work.

199
00:11:52,456 --> 00:11:54,833
And now,
I'm finally doing some real work.

200
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,587
Yes, I'm still just as competent.

201
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,881
I truly am.

202
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,551
Sir.

203
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:07,638
Should I write up a proposal
with your idea?

204
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,682
Goodness, you don't have to.

205
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:12,893
No, no. I really like it.

206
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:15,062
I'd be more than grateful.

207
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:16,355
All right, then.

208
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:22,945
How could I get the ingredients?

209
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:32,246
There was the limited edition
Spicy Chicken Noodle.

210
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:35,374
I believe the downside was that
it wasn't spicy enough.

211
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:38,126
We need to be unique.

212
00:12:38,418 --> 00:12:41,129
Koreans are known
to enjoy very spicy foods.

213
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:43,757
Isn't our brand known
for producing such products?

214
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:51,098
(Something New but Familiar,
Spicy Chicken Ramyeon with Eggs)

215
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:53,892
Mr. Joo.
"Spicy Chicken Ramyeon with Eggs"?

216
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:54,977
Yes.

217
00:12:55,018 --> 00:12:57,145
I thought about selling the original
Spicy Chicken Ramyeon...

218
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:01,608
alongside a half-boiled egg.

219
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:06,613
To be honest,
Spicy Chicken Ramyeon...

220
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:09,533
is too spicy for people like me.

221
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:14,121
That's why I thought adding
an egg to it would neutralize...

222
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:15,747
the spiciness.

223
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:17,499
The expiration date...

224
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:22,462
I'll think about it.

225
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:23,714
Okay.

226
00:13:24,006 --> 00:13:25,632
Oh, thank you.

227
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:30,596
Ms. Lee.

228
00:13:31,138 --> 00:13:32,598
The name of the ramyeon is...

229
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,809
"We've Added Saury to the Ramyeon"?

230
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,856
Yes, it's abbreviated to WASR.

231
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:45,319
Like so, it'd be interesting
to make an entire series.

232
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:49,198
For example, WASR.

233
00:13:49,323 --> 00:13:51,658
"We've Added Saury to the Ramyeon".

234
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,535
"We've Added Pig Fat
to the Ramyeon".

235
00:13:53,577 --> 00:13:55,204
"We've Added Kkakdugi
to the Ramyeon".

236
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:56,872
"We've Added Chicken Heads
to the Ramyeon".

237
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:58,207
"We've Added Chicken Feet
to the Ramyeon".

238
00:13:58,248 --> 00:14:00,459
"We've Added Loaches
to the Ramyeon".

239
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:02,336
"We've Added Salad to the Ramyeon".

240
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:05,672
"We've Added Pupae to the Ramyeon".

241
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:07,174
Something like this.

242
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:11,303
Gosh, you're so weird.

243
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:13,388
No, I think it'll be fun.

244
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,475
You're so original.

245
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:26,151
All right.

246
00:14:26,193 --> 00:14:29,279
(Something New but Familiar,
Dried Pollack Ramyeon)

247
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:32,741
"Dried Pollack Ramyeon".

248
00:15:03,313 --> 00:15:04,481
This is good.

249
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,233
What is this?

250
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:10,904
I added our dried pollack cube
to our ramyeon.

251
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:14,575
Yes, that's right.
It's dried pollack ramyeon.

252
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:17,995
Is the dried pollack cube
the only thing you added?

253
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,413
Yes, just that one.

254
00:15:19,454 --> 00:15:21,665
Come on, that's too easy.

255
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:23,750
Let's go with this.

256
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:28,046
It'd be fun to use
the same dried pollack packaging.

257
00:15:28,714 --> 00:15:29,756
Mr. Oh.

258
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:31,758
Great job.

259
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,260
I love you.

260
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:40,184
Mr. Lee, where's your proposal?

261
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:41,268
Sorry?

262
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:44,438
This dried pollack ramyeon
was my idea.

263
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:50,068
What are you talking about?

264
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:52,487
Oh, my. What are you going on about?

265
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:53,572
Have you been dreaming?

266
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:56,491
I'm serious.
You know that it was my idea.

267
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:58,702
What are you talking about?

268
00:15:58,744 --> 00:16:00,078
Are you seriously doing this to me?

269
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,872
What have I done to you?

270
00:16:01,914 --> 00:16:03,999
Come on, you're driving me crazy.

271
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,126
You're the one
who's driving me crazy.

272
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:07,961
Why are you doing this to me?

273
00:16:08,337 --> 00:16:11,798
Right. Witnesses.
We have witnesses here.

274
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:14,134
Yoon Soo. Tae Lee.
Didn't you see me...

275
00:16:14,384 --> 00:16:17,971
explaining my idea to Mr. Oh?
You saw that, right?

276
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,890
- I did?
- Yes.

277
00:16:20,432 --> 00:16:22,976
Well, you don't really count
even if you were there.

278
00:16:23,018 --> 00:16:25,187
Yoon Soo. Why don't you tell him?

279
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:31,902
Yes. Can you tell us what you saw?

280
00:16:44,164 --> 00:16:45,165
He never...

281
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,334
did that.

282
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:49,878
Are you kidding me?

283
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,421
Come on.

284
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:54,216
Mr. Ga, it's so hard to work here.

285
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:12,025
So Mr. Lee won't be joining us
because he's upset?

286
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:13,193
No, he won't.

287
00:17:13,235 --> 00:17:15,571
He said he might upset his stomach
because what happened wasn't fair.

288
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:19,700
It doesn't make any sense that he's
the one who came up with the idea.

289
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,202
Gosh, that was
such an absurd accusation.

290
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:24,246
I can't say anything to him
because he's older than me.

291
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:34,548
Did you eat?

292
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,019
Whatever. As if I care.

293
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:56,069
I was the one who came up
with that idea for the ramyeon!

294
00:17:59,573 --> 00:18:01,783
Mr. Lee, you're
in the office, right?

295
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:02,826
Yes.

296
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,494
I'm going to send you an email.

297
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:05,871
Make 10 copies of the email...

298
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:07,915
and bring them to the conference
room. Make it quick.

299
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,918
- Okay.
- What's your email address?

300
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:14,087
It's mansigi at ongol.co.kr.

301
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:18,550
- "Ongol"?
- M-A-N-S...

Gosh.

303
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:23,805
Just...

304
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:26,767
go to my desk.
The email is already open.

305
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:28,101
Check it and print it out.

306
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:29,686
The password is...

307
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,104

- That's it. Oh, no.
- My gosh.

328
00:19:44,595 --> 00:19:48,307
- All of them?
- Did the company get the virus?

329
00:19:48,348 --> 00:19:49,641
- Darn it.
- Come on.

330
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:52,936
This generation checks the presence
of a product on social media.

331
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:54,938
You can see that
this has developed into...

332
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,108
Come on. We're in a meeting.
Put the phone on vibrate.

333
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:01,278
Wait, that's me.

334
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:03,906
I'm sorry.

335
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:07,951
Hey, what is it?

336
00:20:09,828 --> 00:20:10,829
What?

337
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:12,748
Ransomware?

338
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,042
What's that?

339
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:18,712
Whose computer?

340
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,923
Ga Yeol Chan?

341
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:23,300
Wait, what's going on?

342
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:28,889
The virus spread
from Mr. Ga Yeol Chan's computer.

343
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:31,266
So all of the computers
in the office got infected.

344
00:20:31,683 --> 00:20:33,560
- You!
- What are you talking about?

345
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:35,854
What happened?

346
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:40,400
That jerk, Lee Man Sic.

347
00:20:40,442 --> 00:20:42,402
We checked the virus
with the malicious code tool.

348
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:46,198
I did open another email.

349
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,701
I had no idea that
it contained a virus.

350
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,703
You should've only opened up
the email I told you to.

351
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:54,331
Why did you look through my emails?

352
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,294
- What's the damage?
- 19 computers were infected.

353
00:20:59,336 --> 00:21:01,547
During lunch, the network
for each floor was different.

354
00:21:01,588 --> 00:21:04,258
So the damage wasn't as severe.
Otherwise, it would've been awful.

355
00:21:04,591 --> 00:21:05,759
How can you fix this?

356
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:07,761
We did everything we can do
on our end,

357
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:08,929
but it's not working out.

358
00:21:10,222 --> 00:21:11,431
What's the demand?

359
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:12,724
3,000 dollars per computer.

360
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:16,061
19 computers were infected,
so that's 57,000 dollars.

361
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:17,896
In Korean won, it's 70 million won.

362
00:21:17,938 --> 00:21:20,691
They'll double it
for each day you're late.

363
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:22,150
What?

364
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,861
Well,

365
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:28,407
do I have to pay for the ransom?

366
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,158
Is that what's important now?

367
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:36,665
I really don't think
we should keep him here.

368
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:40,210
Shouldn't we take a stronger stand
on this matter?

369
00:21:40,252 --> 00:21:42,296
He's causing trouble every day.

370
00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:44,798
Exactly.
The company isn't some charity.

371
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,550
They want us to be patient
until he gets better.

372
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:48,635
But until when must we wait?

373
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:50,596
I get that he can make mistakes.

374
00:21:50,637 --> 00:21:52,347
But he said he came up
with the idea for the ramyeon.

375
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:53,974
That's not a mistake.

376
00:21:54,016 --> 00:21:56,226
He's like a thief. Don't you agree?

377
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:59,146
He told me that
"You people make your own coffee."

378
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:00,689
That's my point.

379
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:02,608
He's getting in the way of everyone.

380
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:06,153
I really don't think someone
like him should work here.

381
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:08,280
- Exactly.
- Right.

382
00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:10,449
It's not an understatement
to call him a rotten apple.

383
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:12,618
There are so many smart people
these days.

384
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:13,869
Exactly.

385
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:16,121
Why did he come to our team?

386
00:22:16,163 --> 00:22:17,497
Seriously.

387
00:22:57,454 --> 00:22:58,747
Who is that?

388
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,040
Hey.

389
00:23:07,714 --> 00:23:09,216
Aren't you finished your shift?

390
00:23:10,551 --> 00:23:13,804
My gosh.
No one is waiting for me at home.

391
00:23:14,221 --> 00:23:15,597
I was planning to go home
after the meal.

392
00:23:17,391 --> 00:23:19,560
Isn't it awful to eat your meal
in the restroom?

393
00:23:20,394 --> 00:23:22,229
Now that I've been doing that
for a while,

394
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:23,647
I got used to it.

395
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:34,867
- The person you have reached is...
- He's not answering?

396
00:23:34,908 --> 00:23:35,909
No.

397
00:23:36,076 --> 00:23:38,662
- Why don't you call him?
- Okay. I'll call him.

398
00:23:57,097 --> 00:23:58,557
If you're that worried,
just answer it.

399
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,641
My gosh, hey.

400
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:01,518
- Hello?
- Where are you?

401
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:06,023
What are you doing?

402
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,816
Do you think working here is a joke?

403
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,736
If you weren't coming back,
request a half-day off.

404
00:24:10,777 --> 00:24:12,529
Or you should never come back.

405
00:24:12,571 --> 00:24:14,406
I'll quit.

406
00:24:14,448 --> 00:24:16,658
I'll take responsibility for it
and resign.

407
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:19,870
How can a mere intern
take responsibility for it?

408
00:24:19,912 --> 00:24:21,914
I can just submit my resignation.

409
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:24,291
Don't you know only employees
can submit a resignation?

410
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:29,421
Besides,
let's get the fact straight.

411
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:31,131
You're not taking
responsibility for it.

412
00:24:31,757 --> 00:24:33,467
You're running away from it.

413
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:36,970
You ran away too that time.

414
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:44,770
Suit yourself.

415
00:24:45,812 --> 00:24:48,649
I was quite surprised
when I saw you here as an intern.

416
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:51,735
I questioned myself,
"He's going to work under me?"

417
00:24:52,653 --> 00:24:53,654
"At his age?"

418
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,991
So I thought perhaps,
you might have changed.

419
00:25:00,202 --> 00:25:01,495
But people don't change.

420
00:25:01,537 --> 00:25:02,579
Yes.

421
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:04,957
It's not that easy
for people to change.

422
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:10,546
So you must think you have some kind
of important position here.

423
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:14,675
But in my eyes, you're just like
that loser from a long time ago.

424
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,051
Loser?

425
00:25:16,343 --> 00:25:17,678
Are you calling me a loser
because you're quitting?

426
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:20,556
I didn't even get started, you punk.

427
00:25:20,722 --> 00:25:24,101
Who are you to order me around?
You're such a loser.

428
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,020
You must think you're some big shot
now that you have a title.

429
00:25:27,855 --> 00:25:30,732
You people aren't
even close to Ongol.

430
00:25:30,774 --> 00:25:32,150
How dare you brag in front of me?

431
00:25:32,192 --> 00:25:34,486
If you like Ongol that much,
go join them.

432
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:36,363
I'm on my way, you punk.

433
00:25:36,405 --> 00:25:39,032
You're all talk. Just leave already.

434
00:25:39,366 --> 00:25:40,534
Right now!

435
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:45,622
What a wimp.

436
00:25:45,664 --> 00:25:46,748
You called me a wimp again!

437
00:26:07,436 --> 00:26:09,563

Why won't he pick up?

444
00:26:50,229 --> 00:26:51,772
I told him to print it out ages ago.

445
00:26:54,483 --> 00:26:55,817

Why haven't I thought of this
until now?

453

You should've only opened up
the email I told you to.

Why did you look through my emails?

Did I unconsciously
want to conclude...

to crawl back and work for him?

487
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,589
- Come on.
- Come back here, man.

488
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,840
- Let me go!
- Sit down.

489
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:06,800
Have a drink first.

490
00:30:07,217 --> 00:30:09,970
We're almost there.
Our goal is right in front of us.

491
00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:11,763
Exactly.

492
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:15,225
Just a little more. You just
have to hold out a bit longer.

493
00:30:15,475 --> 00:30:16,852
Goodness. Here.

494
00:30:16,894 --> 00:30:18,896
- I didn't think Man Sic would...
- Forget it.

495
00:30:18,937 --> 00:30:21,190
do such a great job for me.

496
00:30:21,815 --> 00:30:22,941
Exactly, sir.

497
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:25,986
What happened with that ransomware?

498
00:30:26,862 --> 00:30:30,824
Exactly, Mr. Ahn.
Don't you think he's a genius?

499
00:30:31,617 --> 00:30:32,868
- Come on.
- I'm not doing it.

500
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:34,703
Take a seat, will you?

501
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:39,041
Man Sic, please let me
pour you a drink for this.

502
00:30:41,543 --> 00:30:43,629
For the next vice president.

503
00:30:46,673 --> 00:30:47,716
The vice...

504
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,510
president?

505
00:30:52,513 --> 00:30:53,680
Here.

506
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:05,526
(Joonsu Food)

507
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:08,820
- Did they tell you anything?
- So what happened is...

508
00:31:08,862 --> 00:31:10,489
Mr. Ga is here.
Get back to your seats.

509
00:31:10,531 --> 00:31:12,241
- Hello.
- Hello.

510
00:31:12,282 --> 00:31:13,742
Good morning.

511
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:15,452
Good morning.

512
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:20,707
- Let's get back to work.
- Yes, sir.

513
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,001
- Okay.
- Thank you.

514
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:28,882
One second, everyone.

515
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:33,887
I'd like to tell you...

516
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,432
that as of today, Mr. Lee Man Sic...

517
00:31:37,474 --> 00:31:38,475
Yes?

518
00:31:45,107 --> 00:31:47,860
Mr. Ga, good morning.

519
00:31:48,151 --> 00:31:50,445
I'm sorry for
stepping over the line yesterday.

520
00:31:51,071 --> 00:31:54,199
Is he really trying to say
he'll crawl back to work...

521
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:57,244
after he told me off yesterday?

522
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:14,178
Mr. Ga, I'm so sorry.

523
00:32:14,761 --> 00:32:17,848
I must have gone insane yesterday.

524
00:32:18,265 --> 00:32:21,018
I'll put my head down
to express my regret to you.

525
00:32:22,144 --> 00:32:24,229
- Goodness, sir.
- Old man, stop.

526
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,274
No, don't stop me. A guy like me...

527
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:30,360
- Whoa, stop this.
- The corner! The corner!

528
00:32:31,945 --> 00:32:34,239
- Old man, stop this.
- Don't do this.

529
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:35,407
Please calm down.

530
00:32:35,449 --> 00:32:37,618
- Calm down.
- Goodness.

531
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:43,790
It's okay.

532
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:46,960
I'll buy coffee for everyone.

533
00:32:47,461 --> 00:32:50,589
- Yoon Soo?
- I'll go with IA.

534
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:52,549
- IA for me too.
- I'll go with HA.

535
00:32:52,591 --> 00:32:54,718
- IA with an extra shot.
- Latte, please.

536
00:32:55,344 --> 00:32:56,929
Mr. Ga, you take...

537
00:32:57,471 --> 00:33:00,140
espresso doppio in lungo,

538
00:33:00,182 --> 00:33:02,017
very dry cappuccino
with whipped cream,

539
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:04,311
topped with chocolate drizzle
and cinnamon powder.

540
00:33:04,353 --> 00:33:05,437
You want that, don't you?

541
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:08,148
- Wow.
- My goodness.

542
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:13,028
No, I want something else
other than coffee today.

543
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:17,157
Could you head over to
that new milk tea place out front...

544
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:19,576
and get me a cup of
black sugar milk tea?

545
00:33:20,202 --> 00:33:22,079
Oh, okay.

546
00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:25,707
The tapioca pearls are in frogspawn
or salamander egg sizes.

547
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:27,835
I want a 6 to 4 ratio of
frogspawn and salamander eggs.

548
00:33:27,876 --> 00:33:30,796
No, never mind. A 5 to 5 ratio.

549
00:33:30,838 --> 00:33:32,422
And add premium cream.

550
00:33:32,464 --> 00:33:36,844
Bring it when the leopard gradation
gets darker as it goes down.

551
00:33:37,594 --> 00:33:38,679
I'll take it like that.

552
00:33:39,012 --> 00:33:40,138
- Goodness.
- Oh, and...

553
00:33:40,347 --> 00:33:43,976
shake it for about 15 seconds.

554
00:33:44,852 --> 00:33:47,271
Shake it for 15 seconds.
Remember that.

555
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,691
I can't believe this jerk.

556
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:53,443
In 5 to 5 ratio.

557
00:33:53,485 --> 00:33:54,862
And add premium cream.

558
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:58,866
Bring it when the leopard gradation
gets darker as it goes down.

559
00:33:58,907 --> 00:34:00,951
I'll take it like that.

560
00:34:00,993 --> 00:34:04,913
Oh, and shake it
for about 15 seconds.

561
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,834
I'll take four of these...

562
00:34:08,876 --> 00:34:10,502
and three IA.

563
00:34:11,378 --> 00:34:13,380
Sure, we'll get that ready for you.

564
00:34:19,511 --> 00:34:20,596
Did you shake it?

565
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:35,402
Here.

566
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,822
Yes, this is it.

567
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:41,408
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

568
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:45,495
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

569
00:34:45,537 --> 00:34:47,247
- I shook it for you.
- Thank you.

570
00:34:58,467 --> 00:34:59,510
That's Mr. Oh?

571
00:34:59,551 --> 00:35:01,595
- This was what happened?
- No way.

572
00:35:01,637 --> 00:35:04,223
- My gosh.
- I can't believe it.

573
00:35:04,264 --> 00:35:07,142
How could he call himself
a superior?

574
00:35:08,435 --> 00:35:10,145
How could he do that?

575
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,064
What's wrong?

576
00:35:12,564 --> 00:35:13,565
Well...

577
00:35:13,857 --> 00:35:15,984
I think you should see this.

578
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,361
What is it?

579
00:35:17,402 --> 00:35:19,905
A recording was uploaded
on the intranet.

580
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:21,865
Let me hear it.

581
00:35:23,617 --> 00:35:25,244
Anytime, now.

582
00:35:25,285 --> 00:35:26,286
Okay.

583
00:35:26,328 --> 00:35:28,539
(Anonymous Bulletin Board)

584
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,958
Is there anything you have in mind?

585
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:33,710
We're told to use
the products that already exist.

586
00:35:33,752 --> 00:35:36,463
We have dried pollack.

587
00:35:36,588 --> 00:35:40,467
I thought about adding
a bunch of it.

588
00:35:40,968 --> 00:35:44,054
Dried pollack ramyeon... Is that it?

589
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:45,597
- Yes.
- My gosh.

590
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:46,807
Come on.

591
00:35:47,432 --> 00:35:49,434
The audio is of poor quality.

592
00:35:49,476 --> 00:35:51,144
Someone must've fabricated this.

593
00:35:51,186 --> 00:35:52,646
As if.

594
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,481
Don't be ridiculous.

595
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:58,193
This is neither the NFS nor the NIS.

596
00:35:58,402 --> 00:36:00,404
Who'd fabricate that?

597
00:36:01,864 --> 00:36:05,450
If you have a conscience,
you should admit to your mistakes.

598
00:36:06,785 --> 00:36:10,414
You guys aren't any better either!
You all lied too.

599
00:36:10,831 --> 00:36:13,542
Do you finally understand
how competent I am?

600
00:36:14,251 --> 00:36:15,294
I think...

601
00:36:16,086 --> 00:36:17,921
it is Mr. Oh's proposal.

602
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:21,842
Sir.

603
00:36:23,552 --> 00:36:25,470
It doesn't matter
who came up with the idea.

604
00:36:26,346 --> 00:36:28,515
Spitballing an idea
doesn't make it complete.

605
00:36:28,557 --> 00:36:31,351
It's only worthy
if you can write up...

606
00:36:31,894 --> 00:36:33,353
a convincing proposal.

607
00:36:34,354 --> 00:36:36,899
Whoever wrote the proposal
is the owner.

608
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:39,151
Do you understand?

609
00:36:44,698 --> 00:36:45,699
If you feel upset about it,

610
00:36:47,284 --> 00:36:49,119
you should submit your own.

611
00:36:50,537 --> 00:36:52,706
Being competent also means
you can protect your own ideas.

612
00:36:56,627 --> 00:36:57,794
We'll keep that in mind.

613
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,887
I'm pretty sure it's her.

614
00:37:07,804 --> 00:37:08,972
It must be this weirdo.

615
00:37:10,974 --> 00:37:14,269
Don't you think Joo Yoon Soo
seems a bit fishy at times?

616
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:15,938
Yes, you're right.

617
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:19,316
His face screams "betrayer".

618
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,776
He looks like a weasel.

619
00:37:21,568 --> 00:37:24,446
Okay, you search his desk.

620
00:37:24,488 --> 00:37:25,531
Okay.

621
00:37:25,614 --> 00:37:26,823
Quiet down!

622
00:37:47,594 --> 00:37:50,055
It's this! It's this!

623
00:37:51,431 --> 00:37:53,058

- "We've Added Chicken Heads..."

- "We've Added Chicken Feet..."
- "We've Added..."

629
00:38:04,862 --> 00:38:06,738
Maybe she was just recording herself
as practice.

630
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,324
Be quiet! She removed it.

631
00:38:09,366 --> 00:38:10,492
You have no idea.

632
00:38:10,534 --> 00:38:12,578
- I knew it.
- "We've Added Pupae".

00:38:31,263 --> 00:38:33,056
- Ms. Lee.
- Yes?

638
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:36,018
Can you organize these for me
by the end of the day?

639
00:38:39,271 --> 00:38:40,480
- Are you asking me?
- Yes.

640
00:38:40,522 --> 00:38:42,691
Mr. Joo is a bit busy today.
I'm sorry.

641
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:45,319
Could you also bring me my lunch?

642
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,196
Yes, sir.

643

from the Palace of Sea Kings.

What are you doing to my mentee?

646
00:38:55,454 --> 00:38:56,413

00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:00,959
Please photocopy these.

649
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:02,252
Yes, ma'am.

650
00:39:02,294 --> 00:39:03,295
Make three copies.

651
00:39:04,296 --> 00:39:05,297
Yes, ma'am.

652
00:39:11,011 --> 00:39:12,137
Thank you.

653
00:39:13,847 --> 00:39:16,350
This card isn't working.
Do you have another one?

654
00:39:17,392 --> 00:39:18,852
Please wait a minute.

655
00:39:19,728 --> 00:39:21,021
Yes, what is it?

656
00:39:21,188 --> 00:39:22,272
The card isn't working?

657
00:39:23,398 --> 00:39:26,235
Oh, dear. I gave you the wrong one.

658
00:39:26,485 --> 00:39:29,071
I'm sorry, but I think
you'll have to come back.

659
00:39:29,112 --> 00:39:32,115
No, I'm not ready for a promotion.

660
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,743
Yes.

661
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:37,371
I'm riding airplanes all the time.

662
00:39:43,377 --> 00:39:45,087
- Hello?
- Where are you right now?

663
00:39:45,128 --> 00:39:46,255
Did you buy the lunchbox?

664
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,716
Gosh, I'm so sorry,

665
00:39:49,758 --> 00:39:51,927
but I'm craving sundae soup.

666
00:39:52,094 --> 00:39:53,637
Can you get a refund?

667
00:39:54,972 --> 00:39:55,973
Okay.

668
00:39:59,351 --> 00:40:00,853
Here you go.

669
00:40:02,396 --> 00:40:03,772
- Hello?
- Ms. Lee.

670
00:40:03,814 --> 00:40:05,899
Can you get kimchi fried rice
instead?

671
00:40:07,234 --> 00:40:10,487
I'm truly sorry. I'm sorry.

672
00:40:14,616 --> 00:40:16,368
Ms. Lee.

673
00:40:17,202 --> 00:40:20,205
Actually, I think I want
the Dragon King Lunchbox after all.

674
00:40:20,247 --> 00:40:22,249
Let's go back there. Okay.

675
00:40:25,752 --> 00:40:26,795
Hey.

676
00:40:32,634 --> 00:40:33,760
What's with him?

677
00:40:34,178 --> 00:40:37,139
Ms. Lee was the one
who uploaded the recording.

678
00:40:38,473 --> 00:40:39,600
Who said that?

679
00:40:39,892 --> 00:40:41,018
Mr. Oh.

680
00:40:43,604 --> 00:40:44,605
Are you sure?

681
00:40:44,646 --> 00:40:47,566
He found a voice recorder
on her desk.

682
00:40:48,275 --> 00:40:51,361
You should treat her better.

683
00:40:51,612 --> 00:40:54,907
After all,
she was trying to help you.

684
00:40:58,535 --> 00:40:59,536
What?

685
00:41:00,704 --> 00:41:02,039
She was the one...

686
00:41:03,081 --> 00:41:04,333
who uploaded that?

687
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:17,638
Ms. Lee, I'm sorry.
Can you just buy kimchi fried rice?

688
00:41:17,846 --> 00:41:18,847
Okay.

689
00:41:20,724 --> 00:41:22,518
Just eat anything.

690
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:29,608
Here you go.

691
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,901
- Goodness.
- I brought it.

692
00:41:30,943 --> 00:41:33,153
It must've been tiring. Good work.

693
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:38,450
Darn it!

694
00:41:40,118 --> 00:41:44,331
The egg is hard-boiled.

695
00:41:44,998 --> 00:41:48,043
When having kimchi fried rice,

696
00:41:48,085 --> 00:41:51,797
you should be able to mix
the yolk with the rice.

697
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:52,840
Don't you know that?

698
00:41:52,965 --> 00:41:55,717
How am I to mix everything
when it's so dry?

699
00:41:55,759 --> 00:41:59,513
You know what? You can have this.

700
00:42:13,569 --> 00:42:17,573
I... I was giving it to you.

701
00:42:37,426 --> 00:42:40,971
How about we interns
have a get-together?

702
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:42,973
I should've proposed this earlier...

703
00:42:43,265 --> 00:42:45,475
as the eldest in the group.

704
00:42:46,393 --> 00:42:48,604
How about some beef? It's my treat.

705
00:42:48,896 --> 00:42:49,897
Deal.

706
00:42:55,527 --> 00:42:57,487
I thought we were having beef.

707
00:42:58,155 --> 00:42:59,156
Come on.

708
00:42:59,865 --> 00:43:01,950
You know how much we get.

709
00:43:02,743 --> 00:43:03,952
Let's have beef next time.

710
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:07,164
Here. Have a drink.

711
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:08,624
Here.

712
00:43:11,251 --> 00:43:14,755
All right. Let's clink our glasses.

713
00:43:20,761 --> 00:43:22,554
Since we got to know each other,

714
00:43:22,596 --> 00:43:25,432
let's have a get-together
from time to time.

715
00:43:27,267 --> 00:43:30,145
What is it? Is it no fun
to hang out with an old man?

716
00:43:30,187 --> 00:43:31,396
No, sir.

717
00:43:31,438 --> 00:43:32,648
Of course, it isn't.

718
00:43:34,691 --> 00:43:35,859
I'll be honest.

719
00:43:35,901 --> 00:43:39,238
You seem like
a company director, not a colleague.

720
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:40,656
You little...

721
00:43:42,074 --> 00:43:46,620
I know that
you guys call me Kkon-tern.

722
00:43:47,496 --> 00:43:51,375
But still, can't you treat me better
face-to-face?

723
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,921
Kids these days are so impertinent.

724
00:43:59,842 --> 00:44:02,177
I'm sorry.

725
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:04,847
It's a force of habit.

726
00:44:07,015 --> 00:44:08,016
I'm sorry...

727
00:44:10,102 --> 00:44:11,687
for scolding you.

728
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:19,444
It's probably because
I was a superior for so long.

729
00:44:20,028 --> 00:44:24,283
It's not easy to fix this habit.

730
00:44:25,784 --> 00:44:26,785
Did you know?

731
00:44:27,911 --> 00:44:29,997
There are two things
senior employees...

732
00:44:30,038 --> 00:44:32,249
have to keep in mind the most.

733
00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:34,918
The first one is, don't be nosy.

734
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,628
Our experience isn't valuable.

735
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:39,548
The second one is,
don't talk about your past.

736
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:42,801
No one is interested in your past.

737
00:44:42,843 --> 00:44:45,387
I know that. I know all of it,

738
00:44:45,429 --> 00:44:46,513
but...

739
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:50,851
My gosh. I'm getting the urge
to talk about that.

740
00:44:55,898 --> 00:44:56,857
Hey.

741
00:44:57,691 --> 00:44:59,860
Thank you.

742
00:45:00,777 --> 00:45:01,904
Thank you.

743
00:45:01,945 --> 00:45:05,574
Ma'am, three servings
of fried rice, please.

744
00:45:06,366 --> 00:45:07,701
Hey, Tae Lee.

745
00:45:09,953 --> 00:45:12,539
Thank you. Okay?

746
00:45:13,707 --> 00:45:15,000
You were the one...

747
00:45:16,502 --> 00:45:19,254
who salvaged the last bit...

748
00:45:19,796 --> 00:45:22,633
of my remaining pride.

749
00:45:23,091 --> 00:45:24,343
Thank you.

750
00:45:25,844 --> 00:45:26,845
Thank you.

751
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:29,890
Hey.

752
00:45:30,766 --> 00:45:33,852
But what's up with your hair?

753
00:45:33,894 --> 00:45:36,730
Ma'am, a bottle of Coke, please.

754
00:45:37,773 --> 00:45:40,943
If you cut out this horse-tail
resembling the hair of yours,

755
00:45:40,984 --> 00:45:42,194
you'll look neat.

756
00:45:42,236 --> 00:45:44,571
Come on. That's enough!

757
00:45:47,908 --> 00:45:50,285
What do you know about fashion?

758
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:53,914
What do you, old people,
know anything about two-tone hair?

759
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:57,584
I'm sorry.

760
00:46:20,399 --> 00:46:23,151
Look. It's nice and neat.

761
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,530
You!

762
00:46:27,155 --> 00:46:29,783
You scumbag!

763
00:46:34,454 --> 00:46:36,498
Are you going back
to the office now?

764
00:46:37,666 --> 00:46:41,461
Yes. I want to fix the proposal
I submitted the other day.

765
00:46:46,175 --> 00:46:47,342
What about your hair?

766
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:49,761
Gosh.

767
00:46:50,596 --> 00:46:52,806
I'll go to a hair salon
and see what I can do.

768
00:46:55,142 --> 00:46:58,896
Gosh. He's a much bigger kkondae
than I expected.

769
00:47:01,857 --> 00:47:03,025
But why didn't you say...

770
00:47:03,066 --> 00:47:05,694
that you were the one
who made the proposal?

771
00:47:06,862 --> 00:47:07,863
You knew?

772
00:47:09,156 --> 00:47:11,033
I can't be on my mentor's bad side.

773
00:47:11,074 --> 00:47:13,243
It will be reflected
in my evaluation.

774
00:47:13,493 --> 00:47:14,536
My gosh.

775
00:47:15,621 --> 00:47:17,915
Isn't he so evil?

776
00:47:18,248 --> 00:47:21,710
In the end, he didn't lift
a finger to do any of this.

777
00:47:22,503 --> 00:47:23,837
Is that why you exposed him?

778
00:47:24,171 --> 00:47:25,214
Expose whom?

779
00:47:25,756 --> 00:47:28,342
I thought you were the one
who uploaded the recording file.

780
00:47:29,009 --> 00:47:30,010
Me?

781
00:47:30,344 --> 00:47:34,056
Yes. That's why Mr. Lee bought us
meat to thank you.

782
00:47:34,598 --> 00:47:35,682
What?

783
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,312
Our brains will reach
the highest effectiveness.

784
00:47:40,354 --> 00:47:42,981
(1 day before the stealing incident
of the proposal)

785
00:47:45,275 --> 00:47:47,194
Yes, this is Joonsu Food.

786
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:52,533
Ms. Lee? What's her first name?

787
00:47:53,867 --> 00:47:56,036
We're told to use
the products that already exist.

788
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,330
We have dried pollack.

789
00:47:58,372 --> 00:47:59,373
(Record)

790
00:48:00,123 --> 00:48:01,333
How did you find me here?

791
00:48:24,773 --> 00:48:29,653
(The day of
the proposal-stealing incident)

792
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:38,120
There's a recording.

793
00:48:39,121 --> 00:48:40,122
(Record)

794
00:48:42,457 --> 00:48:44,918
I can recognize your voice, Ms. Lee.

795
00:48:45,043 --> 00:48:46,378
- Did you already forget my voice?
- We're told to use...

796
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,838
the products that already exist.

797
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:50,757
- We have dried pollack.
- How did you find me here?

798
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:52,050
I thought I saw you...

799
00:48:52,092 --> 00:48:54,428
- at Joonsu Food.
- I thought about adding...

800
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:57,097
- So I looked into that.
- a bunch of it.

801
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:59,600
- But you were really there.
- Is that it?

802
00:48:59,641 --> 00:49:01,351
Do you know you're stalking me?

803
00:49:01,393 --> 00:49:02,853
That was too simple, wasn't it?

804
00:49:03,228 --> 00:49:05,689
- I'm recording this.
- No, it sounds good.

805
00:49:05,731 --> 00:49:07,774
- Come on, I'm not your stalker.
- No wonder you came up...

806
00:49:07,816 --> 00:49:10,611
- Can't I call my former employee?
- You're brilliant.

807
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:13,197
- We're pretty special, you know.
- Sir.

808
00:49:13,238 --> 00:49:15,532
Have you ever had it before?

809
00:49:15,574 --> 00:49:19,119
No, I haven't.

810
00:49:19,286 --> 00:49:21,997
(Something New but Familiar,
Dried Pollack Ramyeon)

811
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:27,461
Dried Pollack Ramyeon?

812
00:49:28,837 --> 00:49:31,089
We have dried pollack.

813
00:49:31,131 --> 00:49:35,260
I thought about adding
a bunch of it.

814
00:49:35,636 --> 00:49:38,263
That was too simple, wasn't it?

815
00:49:38,972 --> 00:49:41,099
Mr. Lee, where's your proposal?

816
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:42,142
Sorry?

817
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:46,355
This dried pollack ramyeon
was my idea.

818
00:49:47,314 --> 00:49:49,942
I submitted that, sir.

819
00:49:49,983 --> 00:49:52,778
What are you guys talking about?

820
00:49:52,945 --> 00:49:54,488
That was my idea.

821
00:49:54,613 --> 00:49:56,406
You know that it was my idea.

822
00:49:56,448 --> 00:49:58,617
What are you talking about?

823
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:00,327
Are you seriously doing this to me?

824
00:50:00,577 --> 00:50:02,246
What have I done to you?

825
00:50:02,454 --> 00:50:04,790
Come on, you're driving me crazy.

826
00:50:04,831 --> 00:50:05,999
You're the one...

827
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:07,334
- All right.
- who's driving me crazy.

828
00:50:07,668 --> 00:50:09,294
- Even if I kick him out of here,
- Right.

829
00:50:09,336 --> 00:50:11,630
- but I'll have a clean conscience.
- We have witnesses here.

830
00:50:11,922 --> 00:50:14,424
I can recognize your voice, Ms. Lee.

831
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:15,843
- Did you already forget my voice?
- We're told to use...

832
00:50:15,884 --> 00:50:17,261
the products that already exist.

833
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,180
- We have dried pollack.
- How did you find me here?

834
00:50:20,222 --> 00:50:22,474
I thought I saw you...

835
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:24,685
- at Joonsu Food.
- I thought about adding...

836
00:50:24,893 --> 00:50:27,980
- Can you mute the call...
- Okay.

837
00:50:28,021 --> 00:50:31,066
and make the voice louder
in the background?

838
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:33,277
Well, hold on.

I think...

845
00:50:56,175 --> 00:50:58,218
it is Mr. Oh's proposal.

846
00:50:59,094 --> 00:51:00,053
Sir.

847
00:51:00,095 --> 00:51:02,347
It doesn't matter
who came up with the idea.

848

Spitballing an idea
doesn't make it complete.

849
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,728
It's only worthy
if you can write up...

850
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:09,438
a convincing proposal.

851

is the owner.

I uploaded the recording

But I sided with Mr. Oh,

857
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:31,710
so Mr. Oh's dignity would be intact.

862
00:52:02,282 --> 00:52:03,534
I'm sorry.

863
00:52:05,077 --> 00:52:08,038
Mr. Ga. You're still here.

864
00:52:08,288 --> 00:52:11,124
Yes. I forgot something here.

865
00:52:12,751 --> 00:52:15,462
But what happened to your hair?

866
00:52:16,129 --> 00:52:17,881
- Is it a trend or something?
- My gosh.

867
00:52:18,465 --> 00:52:19,591
No way.

868
00:52:20,592 --> 00:52:21,593
Right?

869

Aren't you going home?

870
00:52:26,431 --> 00:52:29,518
I'm staying behind

I see.

872
00:52:34,439 --> 00:52:36,525
Nothing happened, right?

873
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,528
Pardon?

874
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,406

00:52:46,034 --> 00:52:47,703
It's nothing.

00:52:50,163 --> 00:52:51,540
don't hesitate to talk to me.

00:52:53,876 --> 00:52:54,877
Okay.

884
00:53:07,431 --> 00:53:08,432
Okay.

He ate the candy I gave him.

890

Why is your company asking you
to come in on a weekend?

891

Come on. I'm trying
to do great things here.

Listen. You came home
completely wasted last night.

You usually stay in bed until noon.

894

I'm only asking because
you're out of bed already.

895
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:15,749
Don't you know anything about...

Click the right button right here,
and click it again.

909

Do it again. It's autofill.

910
00:54:57,666 --> 00:54:59,084
The shape icon will show up.

911
00:54:59,126 --> 00:55:00,169
I can't do this.

Do I press this twice?

00:55:11,138 --> 00:55:12,139
Hey.

915
00:55:15,184 --> 00:55:16,226
Look at this.

916
00:55:16,476 --> 00:55:19,146
There's "insert"...
Do you see "insert" up there?

917
00:55:19,479 --> 00:55:21,648
And do you see
the illustrations here?

918
00:55:26,945 --> 00:55:28,071

I thought
I could learn this quickly.

921
00:55:35,162 --> 00:55:37,831
No, I was actually scared
that I may not be able to follow...

922
00:55:38,665 --> 00:55:39,958

923

this old man is useless.

It was a scary and miserable night.

932
00:56:29,925 --> 00:56:32,719
All right. Whatever.
What am I trying to learn?

933

No, I was just looking through.

have to make something like this?

Can't you just ask
your subordinates to do it?

939
00:56:52,364 --> 00:56:54,616
I can't just make
my subordinates do this.

940

who can't do their job these days.

Mr. Lee!

976
01:02:02,758 --> 01:02:05,802
You aren't like this because of me,
are you? Say that it wasn't so.

977
01:02:06,762 --> 01:02:08,722
I was going to tell you
about the ransomware.

978
01:02:08,764 --> 01:02:10,724
I was going to say it.

979
01:02:13,352 --> 01:02:14,436
Don't die.

980
01:02:15,187 --> 01:02:16,230
Don't die!

981
01:02:18,232 --> 01:02:20,526
Don't die like this, please.

982
01:02:25,405 --> 01:02:28,700
Are you acting like a lunatic...

983
01:02:33,247 --> 01:02:35,082
because of what happened back then?

984
01:02:51,807 --> 01:02:53,433
The owner of that rice soup place...

985
01:02:54,268 --> 01:02:56,436
hasn't died yet, you idiot.

01:03:43,567 --> 01:03:45,194
A customer is claiming
that he found a cockroach...

988
01:03:45,235 --> 01:03:47,404
- in Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.
- Hello.

989
01:03:47,446 --> 01:03:48,405
- All right.
- Can you take this?

990
01:03:48,447 --> 01:03:50,199
- Beom Jun.
- Tae Lee.

991
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,241
Are you two acquainted?

992
01:03:51,283 --> 01:03:54,119
I only signed the confirmation
because of you.

993
01:03:54,161 --> 01:03:56,914
Let's start over.
I'll make you happy.

994
01:03:56,955 --> 01:03:59,791
Why didn't he just say
it came out of his place?

995
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:02,669
- Why is he blowing this up?
- Mr. Ga!

996
01:04:03,003 --> 01:04:06,465
Mr. Ga, the chairman told you
to stay away from your duties.

997
01:04:06,507 --> 01:04:09,885
Do you think we'll find any leads?

998
01:04:10,385 --> 01:04:13,597
A dead body
always leaves clues behind.
