00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,672
(Park Hae Jin as Yeol Chan)

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,468
(Kim Eung Soo as Man Sic)

00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,888
(Han Ji Eun as Tae Lee)

00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:14,973
(Park Ki Woong as Yeol Chan,
Park Ah In as Jung Eun)

5
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,816
(Kkondae Intern)

6
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:30,900
Don't die.

7
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:32,777
Don't die!

8
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:37,114
Don't die like this, please.

9
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:44,080
Are you acting like a lunatic...

10
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:50,461
because of what happened back then?

11
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:03,849
The owner of that rice soup place...

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,936
hasn't died yet, you idiot.

13
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:18,698
I thought...

14
00:01:19,448 --> 00:01:21,283
it'd be better for you to live on...

15
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:23,327
and consider him dead.

16
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:45,016
Has he been lying unconscious
ever since that day?

17
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,601
Yes.

18
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:56,777
Why haven't you eaten?

19
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:57,987
Here.

20
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:00,448
I should be buying you good food.

21
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:03,117
Stop talking nonsense and eat up.

22
00:02:07,663 --> 00:02:08,789
Sir.

23
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:13,210
Please do not think of
doing anything irrational.

24
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,513
Once again, it felt like...

25
00:02:25,097 --> 00:02:28,517
I was going back and forth between
the pit of destruction and paradise.

26
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:43,741
How do you call this living?

27
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,536
Lee Man Sic, you jerk!

28
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:03,344
I'm telling you. I'll pay.

29
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:05,054
I'll pay.
It's not like I'll go off the grid.

30
00:03:05,096 --> 00:03:08,182
I know that. We are well aware
that you wouldn't do that.

31
00:03:08,224 --> 00:03:11,519
Exactly. So give me a few days...

32
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,396
We'd like to cut you some slack,

33
00:03:13,437 --> 00:03:15,398
but there's a limit
to the time we can give you.

34
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,399
I can't say anything else.

35
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,568
Then are you telling the patient
to go out and die?

36
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,445
- Sir.
- Please do me a favor.

37
00:03:21,487 --> 00:03:23,406
Please. What can I do?

38
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:25,449
It's not like
I can take him elsewhere.

39
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:27,451
- Please pay in full.
- Until this day...

40
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:41,257
How much of
his hospital bills are unpaid?

41
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:47,847
If you were going to do this,
why didn't you go there yourself?

42
00:03:48,556 --> 00:03:50,766
Why did you leave someone
who was about to die?

43
00:03:56,313 --> 00:03:57,314
Hey, wait.

44
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:00,901
If you're going back to the office,
give me a ride...

45
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:02,903
What office?

46
00:04:02,945 --> 00:04:04,572
You need to get examined.

47
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:07,408
Are you worried about me
in this situation?

48
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,701
Darn it.

49
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:11,537
Go get examined or whatever.

50
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:26,677
They're there together?

51
00:04:28,763 --> 00:04:29,847
Look into it.

52
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:40,358
So they're going around together.

53
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:48,491
Is there no possibility
that he'll wake up?

54
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:51,160
It has been over five years since
he was diagnosed as brain dead.

55
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:53,954
Even his family had given up,

56
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:57,500
but Mr. Lee wouldn't give up,
so we couldn't let him go.

57
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,796
What do you mean?

58
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:05,675
Mr. Lee Man Sic had been
looking after Mr. Yeo.

59
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:07,843
He even persuaded his family.

60
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:11,889
He was a human, after all.

61
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:13,432
What is this? Look.

62
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:17,061
I got a nosebleed,
lost a pot full of blood,

63
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:19,397
then collapsed immediately
like this.

64
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:21,857
This hasn't happened to me before.

65
00:05:22,274 --> 00:05:25,569
What's wrong with me? What is it?

66
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:28,114
I think you need
a thorough examination.

67
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:29,657
Goodness.

68
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:36,205
- Hello, sir.
- Where are you?

69
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:45,131
Man Sic.

70
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,800
What happened?

71
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:49,802
Goodness.

72
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,721
Hey.

73
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,392
Did Yeol Chan make you work
like a donkey until you collapsed?

74
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,644
I ought to teach him a lesson.

75
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:03,441
You should've told me sooner
if something like this happened.

76
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:04,942
What did the doctor say?

77
00:06:04,984 --> 00:06:07,945
He said I just overworked.

78
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:10,031
It's not that big of a deal.

79
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:12,908
Gosh. Of course, it is.

80
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,368
It's a huge deal.

81
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,663
It's absurd to make someone work
this much in this day and age.

82
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:20,666
And on top of that, you're a geezer
who's counting his days.

83
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:22,877
I should've caught on...

84
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:25,588
when he scolded you
for having jjamppong.

85
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:29,258
He did that? Why didn't you tell me?

86
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,220
My goodness.
Couldn't this cause a huge problem?

87
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:37,266
It's nothing.
I was just being foolish.

88
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:38,559
Why did you have to talk about that?

89
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:42,188
Forget it. I'll talk to the doctor.

90
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:44,899
Get a doctor's note and file this
as an industrial accident.

91
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:48,110
- That's not necessary, sir.
- Come on.

92
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:50,488
Aren't you going to take
Yeol Chan down?

93
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,825
I... I will.

94
00:06:54,867 --> 00:06:55,868
Yes.

95
00:06:56,452 --> 00:06:58,579
By the way,
what did you have to tell me?

96
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,249
- Sorry?
- You called me.

97
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:06,420
I'm on my way.

98
00:07:13,135 --> 00:07:15,930
You see, Yeol Chan is...

99
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:17,348
Yes?

100
00:07:17,473 --> 00:07:19,600
That jerk is...

101
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:22,186
He's...

102
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:24,689
Go on.

103
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,691
Don't you want to become
the vice-president?

104
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:28,693
He is...

105
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:34,490
Don't die. Don't die!

106
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:41,330
He has...

107
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:45,876
a serious case of dog allergies.

108
00:07:56,178 --> 00:07:57,388
Is that so?

109
00:07:59,265 --> 00:08:00,725
What's wrong with him?

110
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:16,115
Mr. Lee Man Sic had been
looking after Mr. Yeo.

111
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,161
That doesn't mean I'll forgive him
for everything he's done.

112
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,716
(Amount of Money to be Transferred)

113
00:08:33,758 --> 00:08:37,553
(Will you send 15,632 dollars
to Daehan Hospital?)

114
00:08:42,516 --> 00:08:43,851
(Yes)

115
00:08:43,893 --> 00:08:44,894
(Money Transferred)

116
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:12,755
- Hello.
- Hello.

117
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:19,762
This mahameru flower blooms once
every 400 years in the Himalayas.

118
00:09:19,804 --> 00:09:24,308
I'd like to send this rare energy
to you as good luck.

119
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,477
Please tell me what kind of coffee
you want.

120
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,523
Right, please share this photo
with the others.

121
00:09:30,564 --> 00:09:31,899
- Mr. Oh.
- Yes, sir?

122
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:33,984
What's that claim from yesterday
about finding something...

123
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:35,027
in our Spicy Chicken Ramyeon?

124
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:38,114
A customer is claiming
that he found a cockroach...

125
00:09:38,155 --> 00:09:40,866
in Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

126
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:43,619
But he's not easy at all.

127
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:45,996
The team manager of Response
couldn't do anything...

128
00:09:46,038 --> 00:09:48,165
and just gave up.

129
00:09:48,874 --> 00:09:51,460
He should be here soon.

130
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:54,213
I followed the manual.

131
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:58,968
I visited him right away
and apologized sincerely.

132
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,720
I asked him if I could retrieve
the product...

133
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:02,430
so that we could analyze
what had happened.

134
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:05,349
But he said he didn't trust us
and refused to give...

135
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:07,309
the only evidence he had.

136
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:11,897
He's suspecting that we'd fabricate
the analysis result...

137
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:13,858
and is refusing to hand it over.

138
00:10:15,526 --> 00:10:17,528
Is there anything he wants?

139
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:21,198
He wants us to apologize sincerely
and show that we care.

140
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:25,703
This is unbelievable.

141
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,956
Let me visit him.

142
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,000
I'd be grateful.

143
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:32,793
Bring Man Sic along.

144
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:36,130
Mr. Lee.

145
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,593
I heard you dealt
with many complaints...

146
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:42,303
regarding something similar
at your previous workplace.

147
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:44,180
Yes.

148
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,682
Look at his face.
Is this a joke to him?

149
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:56,734
What?

150
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:04,033
You better stay quiet.

151
00:11:04,825 --> 00:11:05,868
Okay.

152
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:14,001
Sir, we're from Joonsu Food.

153
00:11:14,377 --> 00:11:15,836
Open up, open up.

154
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:22,718
Are you Mr. Park Beom Jun?

155
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,761
Yes.

156
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,472
Seeing how you brought a higher-up,

157
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:28,599
you must've finally realized
the gravity of this situation.

158
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:30,393
Come in.

159
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:35,898
Goodness, judging by how messy
your house is,

160
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,733
I bet the cockroach liked it.

161
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:40,069
That's enough!

162
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:42,780
We need to intimidate him
from the start.

163
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:46,158
I guess you cleaned up
because we were coming.

164
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,035
Thank you and nice to meet you.

165
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:51,706
Do you eat ramyeon often?

166
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:58,838
Where is your food waste?

167
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,678
How clean is your kitchen?

168
00:12:15,146 --> 00:12:17,314
I see.

169
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:20,443
(Spicy Chicken Ramyeon)

170
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,781
- Is this it?
- Yes.

171
00:12:25,823 --> 00:12:29,702
If it's okay with you,
could you explain what happened?

172
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:32,913
How many times
do I need to repeat myself?

173
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:38,794
This is annoying.

174
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:43,966
I poured some water into this pan...

175
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:46,594
and placed it here.

176
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,769
I took the sauce out.

177
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,396
Then I poured the ramyeon inside.

178
00:12:57,438 --> 00:12:58,731
And that was when...

179
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:03,861
a cockroach fell in the middle
of the ramyeon.

180
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:05,738
Is this funny?

181
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:07,865
Why are you laughing?

182
00:13:07,907 --> 00:13:08,949
- Look, here.
- What?

183
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,952
- It just doesn't make sense.
- What doesn't?

184
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:13,662
- Hey.
- Come on.

185
00:13:13,704 --> 00:13:16,290
If the cockroach was inside
the package,

186
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:19,377
how did it perfectly land
in the middle?

187
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:21,128
Mr. Lee, that's enough.

188
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,797
Did it have a motor or something?

189
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:25,633
That's enough. Please.

190
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:27,468
- Did it?
- Come on, now.

191
00:13:28,177 --> 00:13:29,679
My goodness.

192
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:31,681
You must've been very startled.

193
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:33,349
How could I not have been?

194
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:35,267
I found a cockroach in my food.

195
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:37,144
You must've been extremely shocked.

196
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:39,063
Just seeing a cockroach
passing by...

197
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:40,856
- That's so scary.
- gives us a heart attack.

198
00:13:41,357 --> 00:13:44,193
And to make it worse,
it came out from your food.

199
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:45,653
We're truly sorry.

200
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,863
Gosh.

201
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:50,241
By the way,

202
00:13:50,658 --> 00:13:52,827
- I'm just wondering.
- Yes?

203
00:13:53,577 --> 00:13:56,539
Did you perhaps add
some additional ingredients?

204
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,666
For example, spring onions or eggs?

205
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,001
Of course not.

206
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:03,337
I hate adding additional ingredients
to my ramyeon.

207
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:07,633
Oh, my. Oh, my! Oh, my!

208
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,011
That's the tastiest way
to eat ramyeon,

209
00:14:10,052 --> 00:14:11,971
but many people don't know that.

210
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:14,098
- What's the best part of ramyeon?
- The flavor enhancer?

211
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:18,978
Who'd add eggs to the broth
and ruin it?

212
00:14:19,145 --> 00:14:20,563
Not us.

213
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:21,897
He's right.

214
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:24,400
You and I seem to be
on the same page.

215
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:27,361
- By the way,
- Yes?

216
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:29,572
I'm just wondering.

217
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:34,744
Did you notice anything unusual
when you opened the package?

218
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:36,662
What? What do you mean?

219
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:37,955
For example,

220
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,708
did you see the cockroach
inside the package?

221
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,711
What? If I did, I wouldn't have
poured it in the pan.

222
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:44,920
- Right?
- Yes.

223
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:49,717
Then you're not sure
whether the cockroach was...

224
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:51,260
inside the package to begin with.

225
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:52,303
What?

226
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:53,888
You said you didn't see it inside.

227
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:55,931
Then how could it have gone inside?

228
00:14:56,057 --> 00:14:57,475
Are you saying it was outside the package,

229
00:14:57,516 --> 00:14:59,352
and then it suddenly climbed inside?

230
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:02,271
Unless the cockroach was insane,

231
00:15:02,313 --> 00:15:03,898
it wouldn't have voluntarily gone
into the boiling water.

232
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:06,859
It's possible if it was dead.

233
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:10,321
If it was dead, how would it
have stuck to the package?

234
00:15:14,658 --> 00:15:15,659
It got stuck.

235
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:20,915
You see,

236
00:15:21,832 --> 00:15:24,960
ethologically speaking,
cockroaches enjoy these areas.

237
00:15:25,169 --> 00:15:27,880
They like this part,
so they tend to go in there.

238
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:31,050
Are you implying that
the cockroach came from my house?

239
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:35,221
My house doesn't even have
a single particle of micro-dust.

240
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:37,390
What? Come on!

241
00:15:37,598 --> 00:15:39,934
You only clean those places when
you're cleaning the whole house!

242
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:41,352
I understand, sir.

243
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:46,565
Gosh, I can't believe you jerks.

244
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:49,318
Are you looking down on me
because I'm living in a place...

245
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,945
like this at my age?

246
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:52,071
Gosh, no.

247
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:53,656
- No way.
- No.

248
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:55,700
- That's not true at all.
- That's not it.

249
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:58,494
- We didn't look down on you.
- Why is this important right now?

250
00:15:58,536 --> 00:16:01,163
You'll end up living
in a mansion later on!

251
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:02,289
That's true.

252
00:16:03,332 --> 00:16:04,750
- You think so?
- Of course.

253
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:07,920
- Of course.
- We're talking about possibilities.

254
00:16:08,295 --> 00:16:11,882
A very small possibility that
the cockroach could have come...

255
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:15,469
from outside, not from the bag.

256
00:16:18,014 --> 00:16:21,350
Please don't be so upset.
Why don't you try our new products?

257
00:16:21,392 --> 00:16:24,228
Did you only bring
two boxes of ramyeon?

258
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,689
I see. You want me to stop
harassing you with that?

259
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:28,024
No, that's not it.

260
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:30,317
- Hello, sir.
- Gosh.

261
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:31,736
- What's this?
- Well,

262
00:16:31,777 --> 00:16:35,031
we ran out of ramyeon boxes
at the headquarters.

263
00:16:35,072 --> 00:16:37,950
I had to pick them up
from a nearby store, so I'm late.

264
00:16:37,992 --> 00:16:39,368
- Just put them down.
- Where should I put these?

265
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,537
- Hey, get a grip.
- Where should I put them?

266
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,497
- All right. Over there.
- Where...

267
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:44,540
The boxes...

268
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:47,585
What's wrong with you?

Do you know him?

272
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:01,891
- She's my ex-girlfriend.
- We went to the same college.

273

277
00:17:24,955 --> 00:17:27,666
I would like
to apologize once again.

279
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,341

282
00:17:42,473 --> 00:17:43,724
You can go first.

283
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:45,768
I need to talk to Tae Lee.

284
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:51,524
Okay. Go without me.

285
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:55,653
Okay.

about selling the original...

290

Spicy Chicken Ramyeon
alongside a half-boiled egg.

291

That crossed my mind.

292
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,292
I'll think about it.

293
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:52,460

Tae Lee, you were so mean before.

00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:27,805
You looked down at me
because you got a job.

316

When did I do that?

317
00:20:30,057 --> 00:20:32,351
You know that's true. You dumped me
because I can't find a job.

Isn't that true? No?

It wasn't about that at all.

320

It was because of what you do.

321

Sometimes,
you act like such a loser.

322

You dumped me
because I couldn't find a job.

323

to be criticized for that.

Fine.

- Yes.

00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,251
It's so nice that
you're finally admitting that.

327
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:01,130
Anyway, now that you got
a job at a nice company,

328
00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:03,215
you've gotten prettier.

329
00:21:08,095 --> 00:21:10,639
You know that I signed the agreement
that I won't disclose this...

330
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:12,641
to the public for you, right?

331
00:21:15,603 --> 00:21:18,105
So what? What do you want?

332
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,983
Well, you know,

333
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:22,902
can we...

334
00:21:24,612 --> 00:21:26,113
get back together?

335
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:28,491
I'll make you happy.

336
00:21:31,911 --> 00:21:33,662
Tae Lee, where are you going?

337
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:35,039
I love you.

338
00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:36,290
Tae Lee.

339
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,125
Hey, Tae Lee.

340
00:21:39,126 --> 00:21:40,503
If you leave like this,

341
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:42,963
you can forget about the agreement.
I'll reveal everything.

342
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:48,928
The people from your company
mocked me.

343
00:21:49,053 --> 00:21:50,388
They looked down on me...

344
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:52,390
because I still live
in a small studio...

345
00:21:52,431 --> 00:21:53,808
and am unemployed at my age.

346
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:55,059
I'll pay you back for that.

347
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:57,186
When did we look down on you?

348
00:21:57,228 --> 00:22:00,022
Have you ever felt
the mocking eyes of the people?

349
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:05,069
Tae Lee, you know that I follow
through if I put my mind to it.

350
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:07,697
Can we start over? Please?

351
00:22:07,738 --> 00:22:09,532
- What are you saying?
- After we broke up,

352
00:22:09,573 --> 00:22:11,784
I have never stopped thinking
about you.

353
00:22:11,826 --> 00:22:13,285
Please, Tae Lee. I love you!

354
00:22:13,536 --> 00:22:15,162
- Tae Lee.
- Let go of me.

355
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:16,956
- Tae Lee, you're mine!
- Let go.

356
00:22:16,997 --> 00:22:19,291
Don't you dare. Don't!

357
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,918
Stop it.

358
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:26,215
Are you okay?

359
00:22:26,424 --> 00:22:27,675
Mr. Ga.

360
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:31,345
Are you a fool?

361
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:34,265
If you knew he could be dangerous,
why would you follow him?

362
00:22:34,473 --> 00:22:38,561
Well, he kept saying that
he would talk to the press.

363
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:42,314
This jerk follows through
once he decides to do something.

364
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:48,154
- Hey, Mr. Park.
- What?

365
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:50,865
Is it true that you signed
the agreement because of...

366
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:51,907
your feelings for her?

367
00:22:52,158 --> 00:22:53,242
What if I did?

368
00:22:58,289 --> 00:22:59,373
Mr. Ga.

369
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,461
Here.

370
00:23:03,878 --> 00:23:06,964
Disclose this to the public or not.
Do whatever you want with it.

371
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:11,552
But you will have to pay
for damaging the reputation...

372
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:13,679
of Joonsu Food...

373
00:23:14,722 --> 00:23:18,351
and for what you have done
to her as well.

374
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:21,062
I'll make sure you pay for that.

375
00:23:29,737 --> 00:23:31,614
What's wrong with that jerk?
Let go of her!

376
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:34,116
Hey, let go of her hand.

377
00:23:34,784 --> 00:23:35,785
Hey!

378
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:38,704
Darn it.

379
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:39,914
What are you going to do?

380
00:23:39,955 --> 00:23:42,333
If he decides to do something,
he really does it.

381
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,793
I don't know. Just get in.

382
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:45,044
Darn it.

383
00:23:51,092 --> 00:23:52,593
This is my house.

384
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:53,886
- I see.
- Okay.

385
00:23:55,805 --> 00:23:57,139
Bye.

386
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:04,897
Mr. Ga.

387
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:07,149
I...

388
00:24:10,277 --> 00:24:12,988
You don't know it really came
from Spicy Chicken Ramyeon, right?

389
00:24:14,782 --> 00:24:15,783
Well,

390
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:18,494
we'll have to run a test.

391
00:24:18,661 --> 00:24:20,371
All the factories are automated.

392
00:24:20,413 --> 00:24:22,415
So the possibility
of a foreign object going in...

393
00:24:22,998 --> 00:24:24,709
is slim to none.

394
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,835
Don't worry.

395
00:24:26,836 --> 00:24:29,463
So don't meet up
with that jerk in private...

396
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:31,382
for the sake of the company.

397
00:24:31,841 --> 00:24:33,426
The company is important,

398
00:24:34,135 --> 00:24:35,636
but my team members
are important too.

399
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:41,392
Then, I'll get going.

400
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:43,352
Wait.

401
00:24:48,524 --> 00:24:52,319
Can you repeat that again?

402
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:55,990
Repeat what?

403
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,828
I see.

404
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,752
So don't meet up
with that jerk in private...

405
00:25:08,002 --> 00:25:10,129
for the sake of the company.

406
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,216
The company is important,

407
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:18,054
but my team members
are important too.

408
00:25:30,691 --> 00:25:31,692
Yes.

409
00:26:01,806 --> 00:26:02,890
This is huge.

410
00:26:07,895 --> 00:26:09,105
Man, this is...

411
00:26:09,522 --> 00:26:11,982
"Have you gone insane?
Are you playing house?"

412
00:26:12,024 --> 00:26:13,734
"Do you think ramyeon is a joke?"

413
00:26:13,776 --> 00:26:14,985
"Fall into the pit of destruction."

414
00:26:15,611 --> 00:26:16,862
"Go to the underworld."

415
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:32,795
Why did I let him catch me
in that situation?

416
00:26:36,632 --> 00:26:38,009
The company is important,

417
00:26:39,218 --> 00:26:41,846
but my team members
are important too.

418
00:27:00,614 --> 00:27:01,741
Kim Seung Jin, not you.

419
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:12,960
Lee Tae Lee, not you.

420
00:27:13,002 --> 00:27:15,379
Yes, she doesn't have
that kind of handwriting.

421
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:19,342
(Intern Lee Man Sic)

422
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:25,014
Lee Man Sic, not you.

423
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:33,356
Just as I expected,
it's either Mr. Oh or Ms. Tak.

424
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:04,553
Just you wait.

425
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,181
I'll make sure I catch you.

426
00:28:16,315 --> 00:28:17,441
Yes, Mr. Baek.

427
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:19,902
Are we going to analyze
what we retrieved immediately?

428
00:28:19,944 --> 00:28:21,362
We were going to do that,

429
00:28:21,404 --> 00:28:23,572
but I received a call
from Mr. Park Beom Jun this morning.

430
00:28:24,365 --> 00:28:26,325
He told me
not to touch the cockroach.

431
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:28,869
What?

432
00:28:31,163 --> 00:28:33,541
There's that folded part
behind the ramyeon package, right?

433
00:28:33,582 --> 00:28:35,459
They said
it could have come out from there.

434
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:37,753
I couldn't
deal with the humiliation.

435
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,589
Then they handed me a contract.

436
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,759
It said I was supposed to shut up
for four boxes of ramyeon.

437
00:28:44,468 --> 00:28:46,429
Who gave you that contract?

438
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,890
I believe it's the person who made
that ramyeon I was about to eat.

439
00:28:49,932 --> 00:28:52,727
- He can't say it like that.
- I see.

440
00:28:52,768 --> 00:28:55,062
- My gosh.
- And I heard you have a reason...

441
00:28:55,104 --> 00:28:57,982
for asking us
not to blur out your face today.

442
00:28:58,024 --> 00:29:00,776
It's because I am not ashamed.
I'm totally confident.

443
00:29:00,818 --> 00:29:03,654
And I wanted to leave this word.

444
00:29:03,696 --> 00:29:05,364
Is it okay for you
to treat me like this...

445
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:08,492
just because I'm an unemployed man
living in a rented studio at my age?

446
00:29:09,076 --> 00:29:12,663
It's unfair enough that I had
no money and make do with ramyeon.

447
00:29:12,705 --> 00:29:15,833
Do I have to be treated like this
by a ramyeon company?

448
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,585
I see. Thank you for your words.

449
00:29:17,752 --> 00:29:19,420
- That's horrible.
- According to our investigation,

450
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:21,088
- Joonsu Food plans on...
- I can't believe that guy.

451
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,008
analyzing the evidence
with the help of...

452
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:27,094
the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety
and releasing the result.

453
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:30,306
How will you analyze the evidence
thoroughly? With the catalase test?

454
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,392
How did you know?

455
00:29:35,853 --> 00:29:38,189
That guy majored in chemistry.

456
00:29:41,108 --> 00:29:42,610
That's about all you can do.

457
00:29:42,651 --> 00:29:44,111
Spraying hydrogen peroxide...

458
00:29:44,153 --> 00:29:46,655
to see if the cockroach
shows any reaction.

459
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:48,657
You're right.

460
00:29:50,493 --> 00:29:53,412
If the cockroach had gone through
the frying process...

461
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:54,997
and had been fried with ramyeon...

462
00:29:55,164 --> 00:29:57,500
(Hydrogen peroxide)

463
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,710
its protein components
would've been destroyed,

464
00:29:59,752 --> 00:30:01,671
so it won't show any reaction
to hydrogen peroxide.

465
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:05,966
If it had fallen in
from the outside...

466
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,388
(Hydrogen peroxide)

467
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:12,348
its protein components
would be intact,

468
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,392
so it will show a reaction
to hydrogen peroxide.

469
00:30:18,813 --> 00:30:19,855
If the cockroach...

470
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:24,026
hadn't been fried with the ramyeon,

471
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,737
but made its way in there...

472
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:28,864
during the packaging process?

473
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:31,450
(Spicy Chicken Ramyeon,
hydrogen peroxide)

474
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:34,578
Then both the cockroach
that was found outside or inside...

475
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,706
would have their
protein components intact...

476
00:30:36,956 --> 00:30:39,041
and will show a reaction
to hydrogen peroxide.

477
00:30:43,379 --> 00:30:44,797
I knew that from the start.

478
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:47,466
I can't use
the hydrogen peroxide reaction...

479
00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:51,303
to completely attest
if it had been found...

480
00:30:52,054 --> 00:30:54,056
inside or outside of the package.

481
00:30:55,224 --> 00:30:58,894
If you do not thoroughly prove
this part,

482
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:04,400
I'll officially file a suit against
Joonsu Food and you, Mr. Ga.

483
00:31:05,735 --> 00:31:07,278
- My gosh, no.
- What?

484
00:31:10,072 --> 00:31:11,741
You crazy idiot.

485
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:15,077
You lunatic.

486
00:31:19,707 --> 00:31:20,875
Darn it.

487
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:24,420
Is there any way to resolve this?

488
00:31:25,004 --> 00:31:26,380
Unless...

489
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:29,342
we find a piece of...

490
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:31,761
the cockroach's body
between the crease,

491
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:33,179
I don't think so.

492
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,098
Why didn't he simply say it came out
during the distribution process?

493
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,226
Why did he blow up this problem?

494
00:31:39,602 --> 00:31:42,021
We could've just given him
a few pennies and had him shut up.

495
00:31:42,063 --> 00:31:45,316
Chairman, what if it backfires?

496
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:49,278
Other unemployed young people
began to connect with him,

497
00:31:49,737 --> 00:31:52,615
and it seems like
they might begin boycotting us.

498
00:31:52,656 --> 00:31:56,535
My goodness.
I can't believe this nonsense.

499
00:31:56,577 --> 00:31:59,747
Consumers these days are...

500
00:32:00,122 --> 00:32:01,999
very sensitive
about corporate identity.

501
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,835
If a company seems good,
they promote it themselves.

502
00:32:04,877 --> 00:32:06,921
If a company seems bad,

503
00:32:07,088 --> 00:32:09,757
they take an action
called boycotting...

504
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,509
to punish the company
with their hands.

505
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,470
Who do they think they are
to punish another company?

506
00:32:14,512 --> 00:32:16,097
Those cheeky jerks.

507
00:32:19,642 --> 00:32:23,771
Right. Did you look into
that thing I told you to find out?

508
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:24,814
Yes, sir.

509
00:32:25,523 --> 00:32:27,108
I don't think...

510
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:30,986
anything happened recently
to cause a change in his mind.

511
00:32:31,195 --> 00:32:32,196
Are you sure?

512
00:32:33,114 --> 00:32:34,281
They're there together?

513
00:32:34,615 --> 00:32:35,700
Look into it.

514
00:32:36,283 --> 00:32:37,576
Yes, I'm sure.

515
00:32:42,957 --> 00:32:46,794
So Chairman, what's your plan?

516
00:32:48,462 --> 00:32:49,755
What should I do?

517
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:51,841
You should...

518
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:56,637
consider taking
some action to show them.

519
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,306
For example?

520
00:33:00,975 --> 00:33:05,813
(Chairman's Office)

521
00:33:05,855 --> 00:33:07,690
- Hey.
- Did you do this?

522
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,191
What?

523
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:12,153
Oh, that. Does it matter?

524
00:33:12,528 --> 00:33:15,531
If our common enemy gets destroyed,

525
00:33:15,573 --> 00:33:16,532
isn't that a good thing?

526
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:18,325
Where there's a will, there's a way.

527
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,328
I didn't have to cause
any incidents or accidents.

528
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:24,373
Things are blowing up on their own.
Blowing up.

529
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:29,003
Actually, I planted...

530
00:33:29,879 --> 00:33:31,464
a couple of bombs.

531
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,215
Mr. Namgoong.

532
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:37,053
I don't think you have a grasp
of what's happening right now.

533
00:33:37,887 --> 00:33:39,722
If we were a small business,

534
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:42,099
we would've had to shut down.

535
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:43,559
Kid.

536
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:00,493
Mr. Ga.

537
00:34:01,243 --> 00:34:02,953
There was
an emergency personnel announcement,

538
00:34:03,371 --> 00:34:05,956
and you have been put on standby.

539
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:07,541
What do you mean?

540
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:10,878
This can't happen!

541
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:12,046
Wait, what?

542
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:14,048
(Ga Yeol Chan:
On standby for an appointment)

543
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,091
All of a sudden?

544
00:34:16,592 --> 00:34:18,844
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

545
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:20,763
- Man.
- I can't believe this.

546
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:24,809
So why didn't you
keep this under control?

547
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,979
Don't you know that you shouldn't
mess with kids these days?

548
00:34:29,897 --> 00:34:33,943
Mr. Ga, the chairman ordered you
to stay away from your duties.

549
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:36,445
- Sorry?
- Also,

550
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:39,532
did you overwork your senior intern
until he collapsed?

551
00:34:39,573 --> 00:34:42,118
Lee Man Sic, your intern,
got a doctor's note.

552
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:45,079
What do you mean?

553
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:48,165
How could you treat him that way
in this day and age?

554
00:34:48,207 --> 00:34:51,127
That's not true. No.

555
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:52,837
After all that
Mr. Ga has done for him?

556
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:55,339
It can't be!

557
00:34:56,799 --> 00:34:58,843
(Waiting Room 2)

558
00:35:01,262 --> 00:35:02,471
Please put all your belongings
in here.

559
00:35:13,774 --> 00:35:16,819
Hold on. I should be able
to keep my phone.

560
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:18,863
It'll be confiscated
until you get off work.

561
00:35:18,904 --> 00:35:21,073
What? Wait a minute.

562
00:35:21,115 --> 00:35:22,283
(Waiting Room 2)

563
00:35:22,324 --> 00:35:23,325
Wait...

564
00:35:30,332 --> 00:35:31,709
(Abide by the Rules,
Think, Realize, and Change)

565
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:33,127
(We're Watching You,
Be a Law-Abiding Joonsu Employee)

566
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,815
- Hey.
- Hello, ma'am.

567
00:35:59,153 --> 00:36:01,530
How far is he taking this?

568
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:14,377
What's going on?
Who got my doctor's note?

569
00:36:14,418 --> 00:36:16,587
What's going on with you?

570
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:19,715
Didn't I tell you to submit
the doctor's note...

571
00:36:19,757 --> 00:36:21,634
and file this
as an industrial accident?

572
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:25,721
Hey.

573
00:36:26,514 --> 00:36:27,890
Am I a joke to you?

574
00:36:41,153 --> 00:36:43,197
Are you sure you don't have
a chronic illness?

575
00:36:44,031 --> 00:36:47,410
Judging by your complexion,
I bet you have a variety of them.

576
00:36:48,285 --> 00:36:49,537
It's not like that.

577
00:36:50,663 --> 00:36:52,331
I'm just overworked.

578
00:36:52,373 --> 00:36:55,084
Still, how could you submit
a doctor's note right away?

579
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:58,295
If he collapsed while working,

580
00:36:58,337 --> 00:37:00,214
it should be considered
an industrial accident.

581
00:37:00,715 --> 00:37:02,591
Are you the union head or what?

582
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:07,555
Who will take responsibility
if he gets sacked?

583
00:37:09,682 --> 00:37:11,934
Goodness.

584
00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:14,061
Who is it? Is it Mr. Oh...

585
00:37:14,562 --> 00:37:16,230
or Ms. Tak?

586
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:53,893
(Waiting Room 2)

587
00:38:21,754 --> 00:38:22,880
It's six o'clock.

588
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:26,967
You may go home now.

589
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:34,225
Darn it.

590
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,191
Hey, Mom.

591
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,193
It's nothing.

592
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:47,279
He's just trying to appeal
to the public.

593
00:38:48,114 --> 00:38:50,324
Yes. Don't worry.

594
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:54,954
Mr. Lee.

595
00:38:55,955 --> 00:38:57,331
Mom, I'll call you later.

596
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:02,378
Going up. The doors are closing.

597
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,506
Darn it. What is he trying to do?

598
00:39:06,674 --> 00:39:07,675
Darn it.

599
00:39:12,638 --> 00:39:15,391
Mr. Lee, where are you going?

600
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:18,102
I'm sorry.

601
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:21,772
I really am,
but I can't talk right now.

602
00:39:23,441 --> 00:39:24,483
What?

603
00:39:25,401 --> 00:39:26,444
Mr. Lee!

604
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,181
Man Sik!

605
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:03,105
Going up. The doors are closing.

606
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:07,943
You...

607
00:40:46,023 --> 00:40:49,110
The chairman wanted to kick you out
of the house he's provided for you.

608
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:50,653
I was barely able to dissuade him.

609
00:40:57,284 --> 00:41:00,371
If it's this bad,
it's understandable.

610
00:41:35,322 --> 00:41:37,324
Mr. Ga Yeol Chan
paid for everything.

611
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:38,492
What?

612
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,995
The medical bills?

613
00:41:43,998 --> 00:41:45,332
Why would he?

614
00:41:58,929 --> 00:42:01,974
Tae Lee, let me know
if you change your mind.

615
00:42:02,016 --> 00:42:03,601
I'll pretend like
none of it happened.

616
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:13,152
What?

617
00:42:15,571 --> 00:42:16,614
Hey.

618
00:42:24,246 --> 00:42:26,248
Hey, let's go out.

619
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:30,586
You're really the only person
who saved me...

620
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:32,046
after my mom died.

621
00:42:32,254 --> 00:42:33,547
I said no.

622
00:42:37,259 --> 00:42:39,804
I'm in a good mood today.

623
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:42,932
I'd feel exhilarated
if you said yes.

624
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:45,768
Come on! I said no.

625
00:42:46,686 --> 00:42:47,812
How many times
do I need to repeat myself?

626
00:42:47,853 --> 00:42:49,397
"How many times
do I need to repeat myself?"

627
00:42:49,605 --> 00:42:51,941
Why don't you want to? Why?

628
00:42:53,442 --> 00:42:55,277
Why? Why not?

629
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:56,404
Darn it!

630
00:42:58,948 --> 00:43:00,908
Are you crazy?

631
00:43:01,075 --> 00:43:04,328
Hey. Why do you not like me? Why?

632
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,497
You said you're in a relationship
right now...

633
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:09,375
and that you have no plans
to break up.

634
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:11,669
So why would you want
to go out with me?

635
00:43:18,217 --> 00:43:20,886
Hey, you're also the first girl
to reject me...

636
00:43:20,928 --> 00:43:21,971
for having a girlfriend.

637
00:43:24,306 --> 00:43:26,225
What is he rambling on about?

638
00:43:42,867 --> 00:43:44,076
Darn it!

639
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,245
Come on!

640
00:43:47,038 --> 00:43:51,459
Why are there so many jerks
around me?

641
00:43:55,296 --> 00:43:59,258
I'm so upset!

642
00:44:04,805 --> 00:44:06,307
Darn it.

643
00:44:26,827 --> 00:44:29,830
Also, did you overwork
your senior intern...

644
00:44:29,872 --> 00:44:30,998
until he collapsed?

645
00:44:31,415 --> 00:44:33,918
Lee Man Sic, your intern,
got a doctor's note.

646
00:44:35,086 --> 00:44:38,756
Gosh, when I heard that he's
been taking care of the owner,

647
00:44:39,173 --> 00:44:40,758
I got soft.

648
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,721
Get a grip, Ga Yeol Chan.

649
00:44:52,061 --> 00:44:53,187
Did you know?

650
00:44:53,354 --> 00:44:56,524
When things are tough, you should
hire a lawyer for your heart.

651
00:44:58,025 --> 00:45:00,444
Mr. Ga, don't beat
yourself up for it.

652

Why would I do that?

653
00:45:02,196 --> 00:45:04,573
This is all because of you!

654
00:45:05,324 --> 00:45:08,452
She should have told me
if he was that crazy.

655
00:45:09,453 --> 00:45:11,288
Gosh, she's part of the problem too.

656
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:17,712
I acted all cool in front of her
for no good reason.

657
00:45:17,753 --> 00:45:19,588
Gosh.Oh, no.

658
00:45:29,056 --> 00:45:30,057
Where are you?

659
00:45:33,227 --> 00:45:35,396
No. I'll go to your house.

00:45:58,002 --> 00:45:59,754
His personality gets a C.

664
00:46:00,463 --> 00:46:02,256
He's somewhat cute.

Right.

709

- Mr. Ga.

- Here.

to ask about the result.

They didn't find anything
on the wrapper...

Mr. Park gave us.

- Not even a single antenna.
- No?

749
00:50:26,979 --> 00:50:28,856
- They found nothing.
- Nothing?

750
00:50:30,066 --> 00:50:32,526
- Oh, no.
- This is awful.

751

- Be quiet.

in the noodles first...

any leads?

all the time.

How could you submit
the doctor's note like that?

789

Did I tell you to stay up all night?

790
00:53:36,544 --> 00:53:38,796
I uploaded
the recording file for you.

791

Were you the one
who uploaded the recording file?

Yes.

How did you know?

797
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:01,861
Why are you talking to me casually?

798
00:54:02,737 --> 00:54:05,781
I'm sorry, sir.
I forgot I was only an intern.

Hey.

802
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:17,293
Are you leaving me here?

803
00:54:17,668 --> 00:54:19,003
Speak to me politely.

804
00:54:19,462 --> 00:54:22,590
Gosh, he's so immature.

805
00:54:38,606 --> 00:54:40,107
The examination results are out.

806
00:54:50,868 --> 00:54:52,119
Let's see.

807
00:54:55,873 --> 00:54:56,916
Goodness.

808
00:54:58,042 --> 00:54:59,210
What is this?

809
00:55:03,506 --> 00:55:06,801
How did we find a duck's DNA
on a cockroach?

810
00:55:06,842 --> 00:55:08,719
- What?
- A duck?

811
00:55:11,055 --> 00:55:14,558
I'm sure a cockroach
hadn't been dating a duck.

That's why we found
a lot of duck DNA...

816
00:55:48,009 --> 00:55:50,553
from the first set of roaches
you had given us.

817
00:55:50,594 --> 00:55:51,929
The first set?

818
00:55:52,346 --> 00:55:54,682
Well, it's...

819
00:56:11,198 --> 00:56:12,241
Where are you?

820
00:56:15,411 --> 00:56:17,246
No. I'll go to your house.

821
00:56:20,583 --> 00:56:21,751
Yes, I'll talk to you there.

Let's see.

Wow, I found it.
Man, this place is just... Get it!

- My gosh.

- Oh no! Over here!
- I'll get you!

833

- My gosh!
- No!

Wait!

and the roach that was found
in Spicy Chicken Ramyeon...

match by 99.999999999 percent.

How can you run
a paternity test on cockroaches?

You little...

848
00:57:59,348 --> 00:58:02,518
I mean, the cockroach
could have had duck meat...

849
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,979
before it went into
the ramyeon package, right?

850
00:58:06,272 --> 00:58:09,108
Is there a possibility
you'll find duck DNA...

851
00:58:10,234 --> 00:58:12,653
in a cockroach that had duck meat
three months ago?

(Produced on February 28, 2020)

853
00:58:18,325 --> 00:58:21,162
No. After three months,

854
00:58:21,662 --> 00:58:25,332
any food that remains in its stomach
would have degenerated,

855
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,668
so you wouldn't find any DNA.

856
00:58:28,544 --> 00:58:32,423
That means this cockroach
had duck meat very recently.

- What do you mean?
- Well...

877
00:59:39,865 --> 00:59:41,075
What's the reason?

878
00:59:41,117 --> 00:59:42,493
The ransomware.

879
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,583
Of course, an intern gets fired
over such a huge mistake.

880
00:59:50,793 --> 00:59:51,794
