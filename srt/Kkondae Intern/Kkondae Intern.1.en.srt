1
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,672
(Park Hae Jin as Yeol Chan)

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,468
(Kim Eung Soo as Man Sic)

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,888
(Han Ji Eun as Tae Lee)

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:14,973
(Park Ki Woong as Yeol Chan,
Park Ah In as Jung Eun)

5
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,816
(Kkondae Intern)

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,312
- Give me the phone number.
- Hey.

7
00:00:27,354 --> 00:00:30,691
- I told you not to sell anything.
- Come on, cut me some slack.

8
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:33,026
- Just record it here.
- You can't sell this here.

9
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:34,403
- You're making me frustrated.
- Goodness.

10
00:00:34,444 --> 00:00:36,655
- My gosh.
- Stop making me angry.

11
00:00:36,697 --> 00:00:37,656
- Hey, lady.
- What's with them?

12
00:00:37,698 --> 00:00:39,616
This stop is
Jeonchan Borough Office Station.

13
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:41,743
This stop is
Jeonchan Borough Office Station.

14
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,373
This stop is
Jeonchan Borough Office Station.

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,959
The doors are on your right.

16
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:56,258
- My gosh.
- What is he doing?

17
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,010
- What was that?
- Man, that's disgusting.

18
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,887
- Why doesn't he just stay at home?
- My gosh.

19
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:01,763
What's with that old man?

20
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:06,310
The definition of "kkondae" is...

21
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:09,521
slang for
an old person or a teacher.

22
00:01:10,772 --> 00:01:12,024
Peek-a-boo.

23
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:14,276
You should sit here.

24
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:15,527
It must be tough
to bring up a child.

25
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:16,987
No, it's all right.

26
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,116
But not all old people are kkondaes.

27
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:22,659
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:25,120
Exactly. Why did you ignore me?

29
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:27,164
- Pardon?
- "Pardon"? You didn't see my text?

30
00:01:27,206 --> 00:01:30,167
How can you fall asleep
while you talk to your senior?

31
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:31,376
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:31,418 --> 00:01:33,879
I can't believe kids these days.
Why don't you sleep forever?

33
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:34,963
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:35,797 --> 00:01:38,383
Young kkondaes also exist.

35
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,302
What's up with your jacket?

36
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:47,476
A kkondae is a person who forces
others to accept...

37
00:01:47,518 --> 00:01:52,105
their old-fashioned beliefs
regardless of how old they are.

38
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:54,608
And he's one of them.

39
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:06,036
Move aside.

40
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:07,788
Can't you see
that this is the elderly's seat?

41
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:10,165
I have the right to sit here too.

42
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:13,085
Someone as young as you
should just obey the elders.

43
00:02:13,585 --> 00:02:14,670
How dare you talk back?

44
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:18,841
What's your deal?

45
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:21,134
What? What did you say?

46
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,053
What?

47
00:02:23,804 --> 00:02:25,722
You little punk. Hey!

48
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:30,352
Hey. Hey.

49
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:33,605
Don't make me look back.

50
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:37,359
I've been studying too much
that I got anemia.

51
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:39,444
You should've told me.

52
00:02:39,486 --> 00:02:40,654
I did.

53
00:02:41,154 --> 00:02:43,198
I said I had the right
to sit there too.

54
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:45,826
Hey.

55
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,452
Hey.

56
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,205
What a weird, old man.

57
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:52,583
- Why did you bother him?
- He's anemic.

58
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,084
What's wrong with him?

59
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,504
Have your meals on time.

60
00:02:59,631 --> 00:03:02,843
How could a young man like you
be anemic?

61
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:04,803
Kids these days...

62
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:07,389
are so weak.

63
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:09,516
It's a problem.

64
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:15,439
He was a one-of-a-kind kkondae.

65
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:28,452
- Hello.
- Hello.

66
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:30,662
- Hello.
- Hello.

67
00:03:30,704 --> 00:03:32,372
- Hello.
- Hey.

68
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:34,374
- Good morning.
- You too.

69
00:03:50,224 --> 00:03:52,601
How dare that punk come to work
later than the general manager?

70
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:00,484
I'm sorry for being late.

71
00:04:00,526 --> 00:04:01,568
And...

72
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:04,905
I was his underling.

73
00:04:19,086 --> 00:04:20,087
- Yeol Chan.
- Yes?

74
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:22,339
Have you finalized the proposal
for the private brands?

75
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:24,633
- No, sir.
- What?

76
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,177
Actually, I'm almost done.

77
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:29,930
What's taking you so long?

78
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:32,724
I told you to pick a few
from the ones that were rejected.

79
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:34,351
I'm organizing it right now.

80
00:04:34,393 --> 00:04:36,854
Just give it to me.

81
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:38,021
Yes, sir.

82
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:40,232
Here you go.

83
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:45,362
What? What's wrong with this?

84
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:49,116
What is this?
Why is the quality so poor?

85
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:51,660
Did you do something?

86
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:58,709
What? Are you still
in the World Cup season?

87
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:02,379
Why are you still using
the 2002 version of the program?

88
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:03,380
There was a problem
with compatibility.

89
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:07,384
You should update your program
and yourself as well.

90
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:09,595
Yes, sir.

91
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:12,598
I'll update it right now
and re-print this.

92
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,350
Don't! Just sit still.

93
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:21,190
Mr. Kim, pick out a few
from the list.

94
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:23,192
Cup noodles or packaged ones?

95
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:25,611
- The former.
- Yes, sir.

96
00:05:27,863 --> 00:05:29,656
Sir... Sir.

97
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:31,783
Should I buy some coffee?

98
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,911
Just stay still! Don't do anything!

99
00:05:35,162 --> 00:05:36,788
I know you're just an intern,

100
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,790
but how could you do so poorly?

101
00:05:38,832 --> 00:05:41,543
Come on.
He could get us some coffee.

102
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:43,462
He seems like
the best intern so far.

103
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:45,214
Who? Him?

104
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:48,342
Hey, Mi Jin. Do you like him?

105
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:49,635
Don't be ridiculous.

106
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:51,470
Then why are you siding
with him? Why?

107
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:54,306
Are you trying to seduce him?

108
00:06:09,363 --> 00:06:12,032
What do young people think?

109
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:16,912
Yeol Chan, be honest.
Which ramyeon is the tastiest?

110
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:19,831
May I be honest?

111
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:22,209
Of course. That's why you're here.

112
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,880
I think Joonsoo Food's Sam Ramyeon
made an outstanding change.

113
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:30,259
Our Ong Ramyeon changed
in taste as well.

114
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:32,386
But it doesn't seem
as tasty as before.

115
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:36,265
What did you say?

116
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:39,476
How dare an intern
blabber about such things?

117
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:41,645
If you love Joonsoo Food so much,
you should've joined them.

118
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:42,813
Why did you even choose to join us?

119
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:44,565
Do you even know
how great our ramyeon is?

120
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:53,991
Let's call it Fiery Squid Ramyeon.

121
00:06:57,411 --> 00:06:59,663
That was our intern's idea.

122
00:06:59,955 --> 00:07:01,874
- What?
- That was...

123
00:07:02,165 --> 00:07:04,168
Yeol Chan's idea.

124
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:06,962
He mentioned it last time.

125
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:09,590
I submitted that, sir.

126
00:07:09,631 --> 00:07:12,551
What are you guys talking about?

127
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:14,178
That was my idea.

128
00:07:14,386 --> 00:07:17,222
Hey, are you sure
you two aren't dating?

129
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:18,432
We're not.

130
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:20,893
Then why do you keep siding
with him?

131
00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:27,191
I must've gotten confused.

132
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:30,110
Fiery Squid Ramyeon was your idea.

133
00:07:30,652 --> 00:07:32,738
She's right.
It was your idea.

134
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,448
- Yes, you're right.
- You're right.

135
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:35,949
- It was his idea.
- Hey!

136
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,744
It's a bit too late, isn't it?

137
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:41,830
You ruined my mood already.
Forget it.

138
00:07:42,664 --> 00:07:44,458
This never happened.

139
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,043
Sir...

140
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:48,879
Also, who is it
that keeps giving him work?

141
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:51,131
Stop giving him work!

142
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:03,810
Hey, Mom. What is it?

143
00:08:03,852 --> 00:08:05,479
Are there still
some side dishes left?

144
00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:09,149
I heard at small studio apartments,
your neighbors steal your food.

145
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,401
That never happened.

146
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:13,862
Does that mean you don't need
any extra side dishes?

147
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,199
I made some geotjeori at work.
It was tasty,

148
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:18,992
so I packed some for you.

149
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:21,995
Did you get a part-time job again?

150
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:26,166
You recently got surgery
for the slipped disc.

151
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:29,920
Don't do anything
and just stay at home!

152
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:33,090
Do you even know how it feels
to do nothing?

153
00:08:47,187 --> 00:08:48,438
How's work?

154
00:08:55,487 --> 00:08:58,824
I get scolded no matter what I do.

155
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:01,159
That's the life of an intern.

156
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:02,411
Just endure it.

157
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:05,664
I was so jealous of you
when I heard you got in.

158
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:08,041
Were you?

159
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:20,262
Hey.

160
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,182
What's wrong?

161
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:26,101
You can't even drink.
Don't scare me like this.

162
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:28,187
Gosh.

163
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:40,449

his ox head rice soup recipe for
our product, ox head noodle soup.

against the owner of the restaurant.

always joked around
and asked them for their recipe.

their rice soup, have you?

and can't taste things anymore.

317

Of course, customers stopped coming,

318
00:23:03,544 --> 00:23:06,296
and that's when we released
our ox head noodle soup,

319
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:08,799
so they figured they could
make a case around this.

- No, sir.

00:38:13,787 --> 00:38:16,665
General Manager Ga Yeol Chan is
the maker of Spicy Chicken Ramyeon,

486
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:18,584
who made a direct contribution...

487
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:21,628
in increasing their export
to 200 million dollars.

(2020 61st Trade Day)

491
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:31,763
Congratulations.

492
00:38:33,015 --> 00:38:35,267
Please share your speech.

493
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,688
Our chairman hates spicy food.

494
00:38:40,772 --> 00:38:43,525
And I brought Spicy Chicken Ramyeon
to a guy like him.

495
00:38:43,942 --> 00:38:45,986
He turned me down
well over a hundred times.

496
00:38:46,028 --> 00:38:47,988
But regardless of his taste,

497
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,532
he accepted the opinions
of the younger generation.

498
00:38:50,782 --> 00:38:51,992
I'd like to give the honor...

499
00:38:52,034 --> 00:38:54,536
to Chairman Namgoong Pyo,
the father of ramyeon.

500
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:05,214
And we won't stop here
with an increase in our export.

501
00:39:05,631 --> 00:39:07,549
We'll continue to use...

502
00:39:07,633 --> 00:39:10,010
Spicy Chicken brand
to lead the K-food craze.

503
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:11,261
Thank you.

All right!

506
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:29,363
Let's celebrate
the 200 million dollars in export,

507
00:39:29,404 --> 00:39:31,823
achieved by
General Manager Ga Yeol Chan!

508
00:39:31,865 --> 00:39:34,284
- Goodness.
- Congratulations! All right!

509

- All right!

511
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:44,336
Seung Jin, you need to
chug that down at once.

512
00:39:44,795 --> 00:39:47,923
Mr. Ga, I really look up to...

513
00:39:47,965 --> 00:39:51,343
the sharp eye you have
for seeing into the future.

514
00:39:51,385 --> 00:39:54,096
So what about our incentives?
I'll be frank.

515
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:56,056
- How much will it be? I'm curious.
- The incentive?

516
00:39:56,098 --> 00:39:57,140
That's my main focus.

517
00:39:57,766 --> 00:39:59,393
I'll bring it up.

518
00:40:02,729 --> 00:40:03,730
All right, then.

519
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:07,442
Mr. Ga, could you show us?

520
00:40:15,784 --> 00:40:18,829
- Shall I?
- All right!

521
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:23,667
All right, now. Everyone,
let's give him our attention.

522
00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:25,085
Attention, please.

523
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:50,819
Everyone, check this out.

524
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:53,155
- Move aside.
- He looks cool.

525
00:40:55,032 --> 00:41:00,787
- Ga Yeol Chan!
- Ga Yeol Chan!

526
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,975

- Nice!

527
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:25,687
That was awesome!

528
00:41:26,647 --> 00:41:30,526
Can a company get-together
be this simple?

529
00:41:30,651 --> 00:41:32,569
My score is usually around
two hundred points.

530
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,073
- My goodness!
- Goodness.

531
00:41:36,114 --> 00:41:37,991
Look at this sunshine.

532
00:41:38,033 --> 00:41:40,994
Even after partying so hard,
the sun is still up.

533
00:41:41,537 --> 00:41:43,622
Having afternoon get-togethers
is the trend nowadays.

534
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:45,624
When I heard that
get-togethers are also...

535
00:41:45,707 --> 00:41:47,334
a part of work, I thought to myself,

536
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:49,711
If I ever become a superior,

537
00:41:49,753 --> 00:41:52,089
"I will schedule my get-togethers
during working hours."

538
00:41:54,383 --> 00:41:56,510
What? It's already 6pm.

539
00:41:57,845 --> 00:41:59,429
What are you doing? Go home, now.

540
00:41:59,471 --> 00:42:00,472
Right.

541
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,226
I value my personal time,
so I should get going.

542
00:42:06,103 --> 00:42:07,771
- Goodbye.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

543
00:42:10,816 --> 00:42:12,651

544

Honey, you're getting promoted
today, right?

549
00:44:07,224 --> 00:44:11,228
Come on. You should focus on
tending to the house.

What's the monthly pay
for a director?

551

20,000 dollars? 30,000 dollars?

552

Tell him to come in.

Yes, sir.

00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:46,555
Sorry?

560
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:49,016
You want me to take care
of the warehouses?

561
00:44:49,057 --> 00:44:50,559
What did I do so wrong?

562
00:44:50,601 --> 00:44:52,227
You didn't.

563
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:53,437
Then what?

564
00:44:54,354 --> 00:44:57,232
Don't tell me it's because I'm old.

565
00:44:58,066 --> 00:44:59,401
You know that...

566
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,696
people our age
are subjected to such things.

567
00:45:02,738 --> 00:45:06,158
I do, but why does it have to be me?

No matter how much
I think about it,

575
00:46:30,325 --> 00:46:33,453
you shouldn't kick me out like this.

576

I refuse to be ousted like this.

577

I was never there for my wife...

578
00:46:39,793 --> 00:46:41,628
when she was giving birth to
both of my kids.

You know that.

I wasn't there for her.

583
00:46:53,515 --> 00:46:56,226
Why? Because I had work.

584
00:46:56,268 --> 00:46:59,354
You guys needed me!

585
00:46:59,396 --> 00:47:01,231
You said it had to be me!

586
00:47:04,151 --> 00:47:06,945
I dedicated everything
to this company.

587
00:47:06,987 --> 00:47:09,531
What do you expect me to do
once I leave this place?

588
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:11,742
Should I suddenly become
a loving father to my kids?

589
00:47:12,034 --> 00:47:13,535
Should I become a good son
to my late mother?

590
00:47:15,537 --> 00:47:17,998
You turned me into a workaholic,

591
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,666
- so what do you expect?
- Hey.

592
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:21,460
Isn't the warehouse
also a part of Ongol?

593
00:47:22,211 --> 00:47:25,422
You can work hard there as well.

594
00:47:25,631 --> 00:47:27,549
Is that why you're sending me
down south?

595
00:47:28,592 --> 00:47:30,969
You're obviously telling me to quit.

I have nowhere else to go?

- It's not too late.

00:52:21,844 --> 00:52:23,345
He took the wrong path again.

648
00:52:24,805 --> 00:52:26,348
You were supposed to come here.

649
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:27,349
(Um Han Gil)

650
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:31,645
(Lee Man Sic)

651
00:52:31,687 --> 00:52:32,688
Thank you.

652
00:52:32,855 --> 00:52:34,189
I'm sorry.

653
00:52:34,231 --> 00:52:36,775
I know you guys are working hard,
but I won't be able to join you.

654
00:52:36,817 --> 00:52:39,152
But are you sure there will be
a job waiting for me?

655
00:52:39,194 --> 00:52:41,321
I'm going to return
after I deliver this baby.

656
00:52:41,363 --> 00:52:43,532
- My goodness.
- Of course.

657
00:52:43,866 --> 00:52:45,450
Mr. Oh is back now.

658
00:52:45,492 --> 00:52:46,869
We'll visit you to see the baby.

659
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,745
You'd better.

660
00:52:49,413 --> 00:52:50,706
Have a healthy baby.

661
00:52:51,707 --> 00:52:52,958
- That's so considerate of you.
- All right.

662
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,502
- I got you a bigger present.
- My goodness.

663
00:52:56,712 --> 00:52:57,754
I know how you must feel now.

664
00:52:57,796 --> 00:52:59,298
- Everyone, say it with me.
- My gosh.

665
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:01,008
- Healthy baby!
- Healthy...

666
00:53:01,049 --> 00:53:02,217
- Healthy baby!
- Healthy baby!

667
00:53:02,676 --> 00:53:04,887
- Healthy baby!
- It's like I'm giving birth now.

668
00:53:04,928 --> 00:53:06,263
Stop it!

669
00:53:08,473 --> 00:53:11,894
She's just going to give birth to
a baby. What's all the fuss about?

670
00:53:12,227 --> 00:53:14,062
What happened with Mumbai Food?

671
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:15,731
You acted as if
you already got the deal.

672
00:53:15,898 --> 00:53:17,232
Did they pull out?

673
00:53:17,858 --> 00:53:18,859
My gosh.

674
00:53:19,693 --> 00:53:20,694
Hello.

675
00:53:22,571 --> 00:53:23,739
Wait a minute, sir.

676
00:53:24,448 --> 00:53:27,242
Mr. Ga, Mr. Rancho is on the phone.

677
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:29,953
- Okay.
- Mr. Rancho?

678
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:32,706
This is Ga Yeol Chan speaking.
Hello, Mr. Rancho.

679
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,794
Is that so? Thank you.

680
00:53:39,463 --> 00:53:41,340
- We entered the Indian market now.
- Yes!

681
00:53:43,634 --> 00:53:45,928
Okay. I'll proceed as you said.

682
00:53:45,969 --> 00:53:47,971
- We did it.
- I'm so happy.

683
00:53:48,555 --> 00:53:49,973
I can't believe this.

684
00:53:51,266 --> 00:53:52,267
Me?

685
00:53:53,018 --> 00:53:55,979
Have you ever had
Hot Chicken Noodle?

686
00:53:56,021 --> 00:53:57,814
Are you teasing me now?

687
00:53:58,023 --> 00:54:01,401
You know that I'm dying to try it,
but I can't ever eat that.

688
00:54:10,536 --> 00:54:12,371
I made this just for you.

689
00:54:13,914 --> 00:54:14,915
(Hot Chicken Noodle)

690
00:54:14,957 --> 00:54:17,125
It's Hot Chicken Noodle
without the chicken in it.

691
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:19,670
There's no chicken
in Hot Chicken Noodle?

692
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:21,380
My goodness.
I must tell the world about this.

693
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:24,758
Everyone, there's no chicken
in Hot Chicken Noodle!

694
00:54:35,769 --> 00:54:36,812
(Hot Chicken Noodle)

695
00:54:36,854 --> 00:54:38,564
(Hot Chicken Noodle)

696
00:54:41,066 --> 00:54:42,234
(Hot Chicken Noodle)

697
00:54:44,778 --> 00:54:47,072
(Hot Chicken Noodle)

698
00:54:51,285 --> 00:54:56,081
Now, you can try
the Vegan Hot Chicken Noodle.

699
00:54:56,999 --> 00:54:58,000
Korea.

700
00:55:11,096 --> 00:55:14,224
My goodness. I can't believe
someone like him is working for me.

701
00:55:14,266 --> 00:55:16,643
- He's the best person for the job.
- Yes.

702
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,980
What's the big deal
selling our products in India?

703
00:55:20,022 --> 00:55:22,774
I doubt that they would eat
a lot of ramyeon over there.

704
00:55:22,816 --> 00:55:27,237
The scale of the market
for ramyeon in India is...

705
00:55:27,279 --> 00:55:28,864
one billion dollars.

706
00:55:29,031 --> 00:55:30,532
- He got our product in...
- But...

707
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:32,117
if they can eat tandoori chicken,

708
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:34,036
can't they eat
Spicy Chicken Ramyeon?

709
00:55:34,077 --> 00:55:36,413
Do they have to get rid of beef?

710
00:55:36,455 --> 00:55:37,789
Or is it pork?

711
00:55:38,373 --> 00:55:40,626
Anyway, why would
they get rid of chicken?

712
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:44,755
It's not just about their religion.

713
00:55:44,796 --> 00:55:49,134
40 percent of the Indian population
is vegetarian.

714
00:55:49,176 --> 00:55:51,637
It's the biggest
vegetarian-friendly country.

715
00:55:51,678 --> 00:55:54,389
The total population of India
is 1.38 billion.

716
00:55:54,431 --> 00:55:55,641
What's 40 percent of that?

717
00:55:55,682 --> 00:55:57,893
- Stop. Are you womansplaining me?
- 1.38 billion...

718
00:55:58,477 --> 00:56:00,604
But isn't this more suspicious
when you think about it?

719
00:56:00,646 --> 00:56:03,232
He's not even a celebrity.
Why would he film the commercial?

720
00:56:03,732 --> 00:56:06,985
The moment the chairman
of Mumbai Food saw Mr. Ga,

721
00:56:07,027 --> 00:56:08,737
he was smitten with Mr. Ga.

722
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:12,991
Exactly. Could it be possible
that he has ties to the chairman?

723
00:56:14,618 --> 00:56:15,577
What is it?

724
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:18,539
There's a rumor
that he's your boy toy too.

725
00:56:19,748 --> 00:56:20,958
What did you say, punk?

726
00:56:20,999 --> 00:56:23,043
Why are you getting mad?

727
00:56:24,378 --> 00:56:25,379
Hold on.

728
00:56:26,046 --> 00:56:27,923
Dad. Dad.

729
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:29,800
Is it true that...

730
00:56:29,842 --> 00:56:31,969
you guys had a fling
when she was young?

731
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,262
Hey, you...

732
00:56:35,013 --> 00:56:36,390
Oh, my gosh.

733
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,893
So you, that woman,
and Ga Yeol Chan...

734
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:42,145
- are in a love triangle.
- Hey! You punk. Get out.

735
00:56:42,187 --> 00:56:44,439
- Get out!
- A love triangle.

736
00:56:46,525 --> 00:56:47,526
Fine. I'll leave.

737
00:56:49,778 --> 00:56:51,446
My gosh, if Yeol Chan was my son,

738
00:56:51,488 --> 00:56:53,282
things would've been so good. Right?

739
00:56:56,952 --> 00:56:57,953
Hey.

740
00:56:58,036 --> 00:56:59,037
You startled me.

741
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:05,252
Don't play innocent.

742
00:57:05,294 --> 00:57:06,795
Show us where your loyalty lies.

743
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,799
You'll be kicked out if things
go south for Ga Yeol Chan.

744
00:57:15,596 --> 00:57:18,682
My gosh, this perfume is expensive.

745
00:57:19,308 --> 00:57:21,435
You're wearing expensive perfume,

746
00:57:21,476 --> 00:57:23,270
but why does it smell cheap?

747
00:57:24,771 --> 00:57:25,772
Gosh.

748
00:57:33,447 --> 00:57:36,116
How come I can't find
any dirt on this guy?

749
00:57:37,034 --> 00:57:38,452
Exactly.

750
00:57:39,536 --> 00:57:42,706
My old man keeps saying that
instead of driving down...

751
00:57:42,748 --> 00:57:45,459
the company to the gutter,
he'd rather give it to someone else.

752
00:57:45,501 --> 00:57:46,460
What if he gives it...

753
00:57:46,502 --> 00:57:48,879
- to Ga Yeol Chan?
- My gosh.

754
00:57:49,171 --> 00:57:51,048
- No way.
- Dig deeper.

755
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,008
Dig more thoroughly, okay?

756
00:57:53,509 --> 00:57:55,677
You ought to give me something!

757
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:57,888
Okay. I will.

758
00:57:58,013 --> 00:57:59,723
(Intern Recruitment
for the First Half)

759
00:58:00,807 --> 00:58:02,893
My gosh. I don't think
they'll get the job done.

760
00:58:03,644 --> 00:58:05,896
When will the interns start working?

761
00:58:09,024 --> 00:58:10,442
Did you see this?

762
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:12,611
It's an Indian commercial
for ramyeon.

763
00:58:12,653 --> 00:58:14,530
- It's so funny.
- Let me see.

764
00:58:14,571 --> 00:58:15,656
Hold on. Let me see.

765
00:58:16,073 --> 00:58:18,825
My gosh. Seriously? He used to
be an intern at my company.

766
00:58:18,992 --> 00:58:22,037
His last name was really unique. Ga...

767
00:58:22,496 --> 00:58:23,956
Ga...

768
00:58:25,249 --> 00:58:27,042
- Ga Yeol Chan.
- Ga Yeol Chan?

769
00:58:27,084 --> 00:58:29,336
Why is he in this commercial?

770
00:58:29,378 --> 00:58:30,587
Isn't it so funny?

771
00:58:30,629 --> 00:58:32,297
- Yes. Totally.
- It's so weird.

772
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:35,175
That jerk, Ga Yeol Chan,
used to work for Ongol.

773
00:58:35,384 --> 00:58:36,468
Ongol?

774
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,388
Then, why didn't he say that?
It wasn't on his resume.

775
00:58:39,429 --> 00:58:41,932
That means
he wants to hide something.

776
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:45,602
Okay. I got an idea.

777
00:58:45,644 --> 00:58:47,688
This is it. Great.

778
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:03,287
My goodness.

779
00:59:03,328 --> 00:59:04,329
Gosh.

780
00:59:05,247 --> 00:59:06,790
I can't do this.

781
00:59:06,832 --> 00:59:09,710
It's obvious that
this wasn't the baby's poop.

782
00:59:09,751 --> 00:59:11,461
It's definitely from an adult.

783
00:59:11,503 --> 00:59:14,756
The previous security guard
was good at this.

784
00:59:15,549 --> 00:59:16,758
They kicked out all the good ones.

785
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,552
Why did they hire someone like him?

786
00:59:20,012 --> 00:59:21,680
You should call
other security guards.

787
00:59:22,764 --> 00:59:24,600
Throw that out on your way out.

788
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:40,824
(Ong Ramyeon)

789
00:59:54,713 --> 00:59:55,714
Ongol.

790
00:59:55,964 --> 00:59:58,842
(Ong Ramyeon)

791
01:00:13,524 --> 01:00:14,816
Yes? Hello?

792
01:00:16,401 --> 01:00:17,402
Who?

793
01:00:18,111 --> 01:00:19,238
Ahn Sang Jong?

794
01:00:21,323 --> 01:00:22,741
My archenemy...

795
01:00:23,825 --> 01:00:25,744
and my one and only rival...

796
01:00:25,786 --> 01:00:28,080
who works for Joonsoo Food,

797
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,964
All right. Here they come!

798
01:00:37,005 --> 01:00:38,048
Are they here?

799
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,716
- Well...
- Is it a man or a woman?

800
01:00:39,758 --> 01:00:42,553
One man and one woman.
Bring me their resumes.

801
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:44,763
All right, stay focused.
I'll have it.

802
01:00:44,805 --> 01:00:45,806
Why do you look so nervous?

803
01:00:45,848 --> 01:00:47,015
I'm not nervous.

804
01:00:47,057 --> 01:00:48,642
- You can see them for yourself.
- Tell me.

805
01:00:48,684 --> 01:00:50,060
- A woman?
- Let me see.

806
01:00:52,521 --> 01:00:53,605
Attention, please.

807
01:00:57,067 --> 01:00:58,151
Say hello to them.

808
01:00:58,861 --> 01:01:02,155
For the next six months, they'll be
a part of Marketing and Sales,

809
01:01:02,364 --> 01:01:04,366
Ms. Lee Tae Lee and Joo Yoon Soo.

810
01:01:04,575 --> 01:01:07,452
Hello, I'm Lee Tae Lee.

811
01:01:07,536 --> 01:01:11,039
You're right. My name sounds
like "Italy", Lee Tae Lee.

812
01:01:11,248 --> 01:01:13,625
But I haven't been there yet.

813
01:01:13,959 --> 01:01:16,879
Nice to meet you.
Tae Lee, Tae Lee, Lee Tae Lee.

814
01:01:18,213 --> 01:01:20,257
What's with this awful introduction?

815
01:01:24,219 --> 01:01:25,679
She seems very witty.

816
01:01:25,721 --> 01:01:27,055
Yes, your turn.

817
01:01:30,267 --> 01:01:32,477
He... Hello.

818
01:01:34,062 --> 01:01:36,940
I'm Joo Yoon Soo. Nice to meet you.

819
01:01:37,065 --> 01:01:38,108
Gosh.

820
01:01:39,401 --> 01:01:41,403
Why does he sound like a goat?

821
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,743
Why did the ones I gave
the worst scores make the cut?

822
01:01:49,953 --> 01:01:50,954
Well.

823
01:01:52,289 --> 01:01:53,624
Why do we only have two interns?

824
01:01:54,458 --> 01:01:56,210
Didn't you say
we'll get three in total?

825
01:01:57,753 --> 01:02:00,214
It's because
they got here way too early.

826
01:02:00,297 --> 01:02:01,548
It's not time yet.

827
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:03,509
- We still have hope.
- Yes.

828
01:02:03,759 --> 01:02:06,261
Will it be a woman?
I hope she's pretty.

829
01:02:59,189 --> 01:03:00,357
Hello!

830
01:03:01,275 --> 01:03:03,819
I'm the senior intern
who'll begin as of today,

831
01:03:04,486 --> 01:03:05,696
Lee Man Sic.

832
01:03:33,098 --> 01:03:35,184
Why are you here, Mr. Lee?

833
01:03:36,476 --> 01:03:37,519
Who are you?

834
01:03:39,605 --> 01:03:40,981
Do you know me?

835
01:03:47,821 --> 01:03:48,864
You're...

836
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:53,160
You're...

837
01:04:31,448 --> 01:04:33,033
(Kkondae Intern)

838
01:04:33,116 --> 01:04:35,494
There are no relationships
that are 100 percent bad...

839
01:04:35,536 --> 01:04:37,538
- in our lives.
- You're here.

840
01:04:37,579 --> 01:04:40,624
Something good that happens now
might begin something bad,

841
01:04:40,666 --> 01:04:42,709
and something
that's seemingly bad now...

842
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,170
may become the beginning
of something good.

843
01:04:45,212 --> 01:04:47,589
Do you want a cup of morning coffee?

844
01:04:47,631 --> 01:04:49,466
Do you want
a cold cup of iced coffee?

845
01:04:49,508 --> 01:04:51,927
So you're planning on doing this?

846
