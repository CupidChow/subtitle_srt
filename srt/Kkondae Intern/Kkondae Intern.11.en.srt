I met while working
at the company for 30 years.

I believed in them when
they started off as street vendors.

Yes, sir. I tried contacting them
through their email address.

They showed interest, especially
for our Spicy Chicken Ramyeon,

There's the story of a father who
threw in thin noodles in ramyeon...

49
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,569
because ramyeon was
still too valuable back then.

couldn't have gotten
into a company like this.

- Mr. Namgoong,

127
00:07:11,383 --> 00:07:14,428
you, and Mr. Baek...

128
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:17,264
all gave full marks
to these individuals.

129
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:22,144
All that I did...

130
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:24,897
was give fair evaluations.

131
00:07:24,938 --> 00:07:26,815
Why are you changing your testimony?

132
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:29,359
Did your superiors threaten
to call you out...

133
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:30,527
for being a whistleblower?

134

Is that it?

135
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,448
The guy who reported this
changed his testimony,

136
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:36,033
so we can't carry out
a search and seizure.

137
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:37,618
I'm sure we'd be able
to find something...

their bank statements in advance.

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,104
on the seventh floor on Monday?

165
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:30,522
Oh, dear.

166
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:32,482
I don't have them.

167
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:33,525
Sorry?

168
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:35,903
I erased them by accident.

169
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:39,323
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:43,660
(6 months ago)

171
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:47,122
I know you've all mustered up
the courage to come here.

172
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:50,250
If the kids look down on you,

173
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:52,169
you just let me know.

174
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,131
I heard you're from Ongol.

175
00:09:56,173 --> 00:09:57,966
Hello, I'm Lee Man Sic,
a senior intern.

176
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:00,427
You're the new
Security Team employee.

177
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:02,095
- Hello, I'm Eom Han Gil.
- Hello.

178
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:04,348
Please take good care of my son...

179
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:10,687
Anastasia?

180
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:15,484
Sorry?

181
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:17,486
I mean, hello.

182
00:10:27,788 --> 00:10:30,207
Isn't Anastasia...

183
00:10:30,374 --> 00:10:32,459
that notorious lobbyist?

184
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:34,503
Do you mean the woman
who had a thing...

185
00:10:34,545 --> 00:10:35,671
with Moon Min Jung?

186
00:10:35,712 --> 00:10:37,005
Right.

187
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:40,133
She bewitched all the higher-ups...

188
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:42,010
and took
all the confidential documents.

189
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:46,265
I guess she does look like her.

190
00:10:46,306 --> 00:10:47,432
- Right?
- Yes.

191
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,232
I do hear that often.

192
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,610
- I'll be off then.
- Goodbye.

193
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:04,449
Isn't she incarcerated
at the moment?

194
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:08,620
That was ages ago.
She's probably out by now.

195
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:13,625
Could she have joined Joonsu Food?

196
00:11:15,335 --> 00:11:17,963
She tried to hide it
by using a borrowed name.

197
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:21,258
But the real stockholder
is Ms. Koo Ja Sook.

198
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:23,594
(Chairman Namgoong Pyo)

199
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:27,890
The second-biggest shareholder
of SCI is her?

200
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:29,558
Darn it.

201
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:32,811
This was
during the secret gathering...

202
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:35,314
of the general stockholders'
meeting.

203
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:40,360
What a cunning woman.

204
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:43,989
Did you side with Chairman Cheon...

205
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:47,701
in order to take over my company?

206
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:55,501
Shoot! Goal!

207
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:01,798
Is something wrong?

208
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:06,595
No.

209
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:10,349
Is it because of that incident
on the news?

210
00:12:10,974 --> 00:12:13,143
Do you know them?

211
00:12:19,483 --> 00:12:22,319
You just can't stop bothering me,
can you?

212
00:12:25,697 --> 00:12:26,990
Those useless punks.

213
00:12:29,326 --> 00:12:31,787
You shouldn't judge a person
that easily.

214
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:36,500
You shouldn't do that...

215
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:38,836
of all people.

216
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,846
Shoot! Goal!

217
00:12:55,018 --> 00:12:56,144
I need to head out for a bit.

218
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:04,820
(Seoul Metropolitan Police
Intelligent Criminalistics)

219
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:06,780
Why aren't they out yet?

220
00:13:15,873 --> 00:13:17,207
Are you okay?

221
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:21,879
You must've been startled.

222
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:23,755
I'm fine.

223
00:13:45,944 --> 00:13:47,029
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:49,698
I am.

225
00:13:55,621 --> 00:13:57,497
This is so annoying.

226
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:59,583
Why did they tell me to come
when I've done nothing wrong?

227
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:02,669
What is this?

228
00:14:08,926 --> 00:14:11,261
Hey, Joon Su.

229
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:12,304
What is it?

230
00:14:12,513 --> 00:14:14,014
You jerk.

231
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:16,433
So you have money and connections.

232
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:18,936
Does it mean
you can toy with my life?

233
00:14:18,977 --> 00:14:20,437
- Why are you hitting me?
- Seriously?

234
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:23,315
- What? Why are you hitting me?
- You jerk.

235
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:24,608
- You jerk.
- Calm down.

236
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,901
- Why? She...
- All right.

237
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:29,488
The three of you were hired
for your talents.

238
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,409
That's right. You guys were hired
based on your merits.

239
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:36,328
- What?
- Ms. Lee.

240
00:14:36,453 --> 00:14:39,248
- Yes.
- What's up with your hair?

241
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:41,083
Don't you know about two-tone hair?

242
00:14:41,124 --> 00:14:43,085
It's really trending these days.

243
00:14:43,126 --> 00:14:45,796
I believe people who make food...

244
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:47,798
should be sensitive to trends.

245
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,844
And furthermore,
they should lead the trends.

246
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:52,886
You're out.

247
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,305
That went out of style
a long time ago.

(Total score)

249
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:06,608
(Total score)

250
00:15:07,651 --> 00:15:09,736
Even if Mr. Namgoong
asked us to rig it,

251
00:15:09,987 --> 00:15:11,989
their lives were at stake.

252
00:15:12,072 --> 00:15:14,491
We weren't sure
if we should fabricate the result.

253
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:17,286
And you guys showed us
unexpected merits.

254
00:15:17,411 --> 00:15:20,205
It says on your cover letter
that you won...

255
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:22,416
awards at many contests.

256
00:15:22,457 --> 00:15:24,459
Can you tell us
about these contests?

257
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:26,336
The first contest I won was...

258
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:29,715
Name the Dog which was sponsored
by a Korean Folk Village.

259
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:33,427
And the second contest was
Paintings by the Worst Drawers.

260
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:37,639
And the third contest was
Name the Character at Bone Health.

261
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:39,349
And... Right.

262
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:42,728
There was a video contest
to reduce food waste.

263
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:44,688
And I won the Grand Award.

264
00:15:44,855 --> 00:15:46,356
You know, there's a saying...

265
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:49,318
that you will end up eating all of
the leftover food from this world...

266
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,028
in the underworld.

267
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:53,447
And I filmed a video
based on that concept.

268
00:15:53,488 --> 00:15:56,033
I was filming a scene
where I was eating food waste.

269
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:58,619
I really thought that I was heading
to the underworld.

270
00:15:59,703 --> 00:16:01,205
There's a video contest like that?

271
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:03,040
I think it's original.

272
00:16:03,248 --> 00:16:06,376
Instead of focusing on the types
of contests I participated in,

273
00:16:06,418 --> 00:16:10,047
please focus on the fact
that I have...

274
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:12,633
dazzling ideas like this.
That's why...

275
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:15,385
I'm the most confident
when it comes to fun marketing...

276
00:16:15,427 --> 00:16:17,554
which is the trend these days.

277
00:16:20,098 --> 00:16:23,894
This is for the couples
in their 20s and 30s.

278
00:16:25,062 --> 00:16:28,398
It's the X-rated
Spicy Chicken edition.

279
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,568
I used the character
of Spicy Chicken Ramyeon, Hotdaki...

280
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,321
and incorporated it to come up
with this underwear.

281
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:36,782
This is the men's underwear,
Spicy Chicken Underpants.

282
00:16:36,823 --> 00:16:38,992
We can just go with underwear too.

283
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,577
Can you see how big this is?

284
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:43,497
And I came up
with various characters...

285
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:46,208
which we can use
for the couples' underwear.

286
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:47,626
Next.

287
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:51,255
It's my best one yet.

288
00:16:52,798 --> 00:16:55,759
It's Spicy Chicken Con.

289
00:16:57,094 --> 00:16:59,221
I like that. I want one.

290
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:01,223
This is Spicy Chicken Running Shoes.

291
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:04,226
Can you see Hotdaki breathing fire?

292
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:05,686
- Hip people will love them.
- Right.

293
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:07,563
This is the Spicy Chicken
Relief Patches.

294
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:11,483
- Do you see Hotdaki breathing fire?
- I see.

295
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:13,694
It's ramyeon. We should win
them over with ramyeon.

296
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:14,736
Hotdaki is...

297
00:17:14,862 --> 00:17:17,239
What do you think about
our Spicy Chicken Ramyeon?

298
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:19,700
Can I tell you an honest opinion?

299
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:21,869
Yes.

300
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:26,081
Why do you like making
painfully spicy ramyeon?

301
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:33,088
You're out.

302
00:17:34,882 --> 00:17:36,008

303
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,051
(Interview for Intern Recruitment)

304
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,309
- He wants us to give a high score?
- How?

305
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:47,436
Just do it.

306
00:17:47,477 --> 00:17:49,980
You can memorize all the ingredients
that go into the products?

307
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:52,691
They are written
on the back of the wrapper.

308
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,234
Somehow, I ended up memorizing them.

309
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:55,485
Is that possible?

310
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:57,654
- What about Joonsu Ramyeon?
- Joonsu Ramyeon has...

311
00:17:57,696 --> 00:18:00,115
refined salt, beef-flavored powder,
refined sugar,

312
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:02,451
broth-flavored powder,
stir-fried sauce,

313
00:18:02,492 --> 00:18:04,870
seasoned beef powder,
amino acid, soy sauce powder,

314
00:18:04,912 --> 00:18:07,039
and chili-flavored powder.
That's it.

315
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,123
What about Real Shrimp Ramyeon?

316
00:18:08,165 --> 00:18:11,168
Real Shrimp Ramyeon has
shrimp powder which was made...

317
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,587
with the shrimp extract
from Canadian frozen shrimps,

318
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:16,089
squid extract from Peru,
Korean shrimp extract,

319
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:17,674
dried Chinese bok choy,

320
00:18:17,716 --> 00:18:20,552
and fish stew powder
which was made with...

321
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:22,179
Korean and Chinese shrimps
and dried Chinese shrimps.

322
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:24,681
When you list the ingredients,
you didn't stutter.

323
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:25,807
How fascinating.

324
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:28,560
- Joonsu Bibim Ramyeon.
- Joonsu Bibim Ramyeon has...

325
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:31,021
sugar, purified water,
gochujang from Sunchang,

326
00:18:31,063 --> 00:18:33,524
marinated crab sauce, refined sugar,
apple extract,

327
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:36,902
seasoning sauce, dextrin,
and beef-flavored yeast extract.

328
00:18:36,944 --> 00:18:37,945
By the way,

329
00:18:38,654 --> 00:18:40,197
are those all correct?

330
00:18:40,614 --> 00:18:41,615
Yes.

331
00:18:42,783 --> 00:18:44,952
Who is this guy?
King of memorization?

332
00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:46,912
(Interviewer)

333
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:48,330
(Total score)

334
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:50,249
Do Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

335
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:51,708
Spicy Chicken Ramyeon has...

336
00:18:52,793 --> 00:18:54,711
I'm sorry. I haven't had it.

337
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:59,216
I see. Is that so?

338
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:01,593
It's all right.

339
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:08,267
One of you prepared a lot
for the interview.

340
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:10,435
She had interesting ideas.

341
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:13,689
And the other one seemed
a bit unsure of himself,

342
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,108
but he had great knowledge
regarding our products.

343
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,735
He had his own principle.

344
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:21,697
Did you figure it out, Mr. Ga?

345
00:19:21,989 --> 00:19:25,909
How awful you are at judging people?

346
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:29,955
Wait, hold on.

347
00:19:30,122 --> 00:19:32,875
You guys planned
this behind my back...

348
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,585
and deceived me all this time?

349
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:35,627
What?

350
00:19:37,296 --> 00:19:38,630
It's not that.

351
00:19:39,173 --> 00:19:41,925
A part of me
was trying to protect you.

352
00:19:42,676 --> 00:19:43,677
Look.

353
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:47,222
If we made the wrong decision
back then,

354
00:19:47,264 --> 00:19:50,142
all of us would have been locked up.

355
00:19:50,184 --> 00:19:51,643
- Right?
- Yes.

356
00:19:55,522 --> 00:19:56,648
Wait.

357
00:19:57,608 --> 00:19:59,234
I can understand
that I had evaluated...

358
00:19:59,276 --> 00:20:01,403
Ms. Lee and Mr. Joo
based on different standards.

359
00:20:01,445 --> 00:20:03,197
Then, what about Mr. Lee?

360
00:20:03,238 --> 00:20:06,992
Mr. Lee had the most experience
among the applicants.

361
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:08,660
And he knew a lot about ramyeon...

362
00:20:08,702 --> 00:20:11,121
and was confident
when it came to ramyeon.

363
00:20:11,163 --> 00:20:13,415
It was a no-brainer to hire him.

364
00:20:13,457 --> 00:20:17,294
Then, what about the applicant
who did an internship in Indonesia?

365
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:19,379
Shouldn't that applicant
have been hired?

366
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:22,925
Oh, the internship guy? He's
the one who had the highest score.

367
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:25,344
When I called him to say that
he was selected as our intern,

368
00:20:25,385 --> 00:20:27,513
he also had an offer from Ongol,

369
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:29,681
so he chose Ongol.

370
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:31,266
What?

371
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:33,685
Then,

372
00:20:35,062 --> 00:20:36,688
they were really hired...

373
00:20:37,314 --> 00:20:40,234
based on their merits,
not as pawns against me?

374
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:41,276
Yes.

375
00:20:49,826 --> 00:20:52,371
You shouldn't judge a person
that easily.

376
00:20:54,164 --> 00:20:56,041
You shouldn't do that...

377
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,210
of all people.

378
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,130
Please focus on the fact
that I have...

379
00:21:02,172 --> 00:21:03,799
dazzling ideas like this.

380
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:05,801
That's when I realized...

381
00:21:05,843 --> 00:21:08,220
that I had been
too quick to judge...

382
00:21:08,262 --> 00:21:09,930
based on my standards...

383
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:13,433
without remembering how clumsy
I had been in the beginning.

384
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:14,977
Don't do it. Don't.

385
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:16,186
- I looked down...
- Don't do it.

386
00:21:16,228 --> 00:21:19,231
- Don't give him any work.
- on them just like the people...

387
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,234
who had looked down on me.

388
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:25,904
They were never...

389
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:30,367
useless from the get-go.

390
00:21:48,051 --> 00:21:50,971
(Chairman Namgoong Pyo)

391
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:53,473
You knew everything.

392
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:56,185
Why did you also keep in the dark?

393
00:21:59,229 --> 00:22:00,397
If you had known,

394
00:22:01,273 --> 00:22:03,734
you would have given it away
with your bad acting.

395
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,360
Pardon?

396
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,824
But why are you going this far?

397
00:22:12,618 --> 00:22:14,244
This will hurt the company.

398
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:16,288
Why would it hurt the company?

399
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:28,717
("An Incident Caused by
Blind Hiring by Joonsu Food")

400
00:22:29,551 --> 00:22:30,928
(When the interns were hired...)

401
00:22:34,014 --> 00:22:36,517
(This actually proved Joonsu Food
didn't consider external factors.)

402
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:41,355
(- Joonsu Food is the best.
- Shouldn't they win an award?)

403
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:47,861
The real fight begins now.

404
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:52,699
You have to catch the fox,

405
00:22:53,742 --> 00:22:56,119
but if she goes up against your son,
he might get hurt.

406
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,122
That's why you put me
in the front line?

407
00:23:00,457 --> 00:23:02,626
Well, I'm sorry about that.

408
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,757
I don't care if I get hurt.

409
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,134
I'm afraid my people might get hurt.

410
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:14,096
I will do everything
to prevent that from happening.

411
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:15,514
Don't worry.

412
00:23:19,768 --> 00:23:20,853
I'll do it.

413
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:23,605
I'll give it a go.

414
00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:26,608
Be it the Junior Managing Director
or the President,

415
00:23:27,776 --> 00:23:29,820
I won't be the bait.
I will try my best.

416
00:23:34,408 --> 00:23:36,451
Someone who doesn't deserve
the position...

417
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:38,370
should not take it.

418
00:23:52,384 --> 00:23:55,637
Anyway, to silence those
who like to talk,

419
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,472
you have to show them
what you can do.

420
00:23:57,556 --> 00:23:59,141
Then, they can't do anything.
You know that, right?

421
00:23:59,183 --> 00:24:01,351
Thank you as always.
You know I rely on you a lot, right?

422
00:24:01,393 --> 00:24:04,396
I got this position thanks to you.
Thank you.

423
00:24:04,438 --> 00:24:08,192
Is it so hard to write a report
for the chairman?

424
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:10,986
If you try to be perfect
all the time, it will hurt you.

425
00:24:12,988 --> 00:24:14,740
You're making me really sad now.

426
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:17,117
Since when did you want to see
the chairman before me?

427
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,119
If you step down as a junior
managing director candidate,

428
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:20,829
I'll stop this article
from getting published.

429
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:22,539
Are you trying to make a deal
with those interns?

430
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:24,374
Let's be discreet about this
and make them leave.

Mr. Lee Man Sic, Ms. Lee Tae Lee,
and Mr. Joo Yoon Soo.

I have questions to ask you
regarding recruitment corruption.

433
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:30,756

Is this how you do your job?
You idiots!

441
00:25:14,132 --> 00:25:15,968
They weren't fairly recruited!

442

(Ja Sook: A time of self-reflection)

443
00:25:20,013 --> 00:25:23,642
Ms. Koo, why haven't you reported
that he resigned...

444
00:25:23,684 --> 00:25:26,186
from the candidacy of
the junior managing director?

445
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,022
Oh, it's...

446
00:25:29,064 --> 00:25:32,234
He was just trying to sound humble.

447
00:25:32,276 --> 00:25:34,194
Did you approve that
at the face value?

448
00:25:34,236 --> 00:25:35,821
Goodness.

449
00:25:36,947 --> 00:25:37,948
I'm sorry.

450
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,701
Stop being absurd
and cancel his resignation.

451
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:42,369
Have him evaluated, okay?

452
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:53,630
It's a bit embarrassing...

453
00:25:53,672 --> 00:25:56,175
for me to bring this up
since it happened in our department,

454
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:00,804
but Ga Yeol Chan's team caused
quite a lot of trouble this year.

455
00:26:01,305 --> 00:26:04,474
There was the cockroach incident,
the carcinogen incident, and more.

456
00:26:04,516 --> 00:26:07,269
I don't think there is
any reason for us to discuss this.

457
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:11,106
We disregard his worst and best
performance for the evaluation.

458
00:26:11,148 --> 00:26:14,443
I don't think his qualification has
anything to do...

459
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:16,278
with the low performance
he showed this quarter.

460
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,780
There were a few troubles,
but if you look at the results,

461
00:26:18,822 --> 00:26:20,282
his numbers don't look bad.

462
00:26:20,324 --> 00:26:24,077
We'll have to deduct points from him
regardless of his performance...

463

for forcing his subordinates
to buy our products.

464
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:31,543
Hey, he got framed for
something Director Ahn did.

465
00:26:31,585 --> 00:26:33,670
- Everyone here knows that.
- What?

466
00:26:33,712 --> 00:26:35,005
- What did you say?
- Goodness.

that spread all over our company?

It wasn't the senior intern.
It was Mr. Ga.

470
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:46,141
He got framed once,
and he framed someone once.

471
00:26:46,183 --> 00:26:47,726
- He's back to ground zero.
- Right.

472
00:26:47,768 --> 00:26:50,437
- Unbelievable.
- You must think this is a joke.

473

The chairman may be
behind this candidate,

474
00:26:52,356 --> 00:26:54,316
but don't you think
it's a bit absurd to have...

475
00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:57,194
someone with zero management
experience as our board member?

You all know that he won't just be
the junior managing director, right?

You know what's next
once he passes this.

479

Then let's wrap this up here.

Which one of his colleagues shall we
interview for the next process?

484
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:32,563
- Intern Lee Man Sic.
- Intern Lee Man Sic.

485
00:27:50,747 --> 00:27:52,833
Okay. Goodness. Mr. Joo, take this.

486
00:27:57,045 --> 00:27:58,130
He's not here.

487
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:01,842
Man, this is why
it's scary to grow habits.

488
00:28:01,884 --> 00:28:03,927
We don't realize someone's value
until they're gone.

489
00:28:03,969 --> 00:28:06,763
Things seem so empty now that
all three have disappeared at once.

490
00:28:08,891 --> 00:28:10,100
When will the evaluation come out?

491
00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:12,144
- It'll take about two weeks.
- Okay.

492
00:28:12,186 --> 00:28:14,730
They're probably
really tormented right now.

493
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:19,526
Who do you think will make the cut?

494
00:28:20,277 --> 00:28:23,614
I'm not sure. Mr. Lee got
good responses during the interview.

495
00:28:23,655 --> 00:28:26,783
And Mr. Joo Yoon Soo also seemed
like he was on top of everything...

496
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,705
We'll see when it comes out.
Don't ask me these things.

497
00:28:31,747 --> 00:28:32,789
Okay.

498
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:36,668
If I had known this would happen,
I should've bought him a drink.

499
00:28:38,587 --> 00:28:40,797
It does feel empty
to be here without them.

500
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:46,220
Let's see.

501
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:48,889
All sent.

502
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:51,475
Okay, now. See that? All done.

503
00:28:51,517 --> 00:28:53,060
- The tapioca pearls are in...
- Can you hear that all right?

504
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:54,394
frogspawn or salamander egg sizes.

505
00:28:54,436 --> 00:28:55,938
I want a 6 to 4 ratio of
frogspawn and salamander eggs.

506
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:58,106
No, never mind. A 5 to 5 ratio.

507
00:28:58,148 --> 00:28:59,942
- Tell me if I should play it again.
- And add premium cream.

508
00:28:59,983 --> 00:29:03,403
Bring it when the leopard gradation
gets darker as it goes down.

509
00:29:03,445 --> 00:29:04,571
I'll take it like that.

510
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:07,699
- Did you get that? Okay.
- And shake it for about 15 seconds.

511
00:29:08,617 --> 00:29:10,327
That's amazing. My gosh.

512
00:29:10,452 --> 00:29:11,495
Goodness.

513
00:29:11,537 --> 00:29:12,663
Don't be like that.

514
00:29:12,704 --> 00:29:14,289
- It's here.
- Wow.

515
00:29:14,331 --> 00:29:15,707
- All right.
- Good, good.

516
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:18,126
Remember?

517
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:20,629
- Shake it, shake it.
- Shake it, shake it.

518
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:22,589
Of course, I remember.
Shake it, shake it.

519
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:32,015
Anyway, Mr. Oh really sent you...

520
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:33,809
vouchers for milk tea?

521
00:29:33,851 --> 00:29:37,062
Hey, it's a wonder.
That cheapskate did this...

522
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:38,480
saying he knows I like this.

523
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:40,524
My gosh.

524
00:29:41,108 --> 00:29:44,570
Dad, you now have
a similar taste with Mr. Ga.

525
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:48,615
My taste is similar to who?

526
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,992
Me? And him?

527
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,161
I tried it like this,
and it wasn't too sweet,

528
00:29:53,203 --> 00:29:54,538
so I just liked it.

529
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,582
Similar taste, my foot.

530
00:29:59,209 --> 00:30:01,879
Anyway, if we weren't
illegally recruited,

531
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:03,797
will they increase
the number of new recruits?

532
00:30:04,673 --> 00:30:08,260
I mean, Ms. Tak and we'll be
in a different category...

533
00:30:08,302 --> 00:30:09,928
when it comes to the evaluation,
right?

534
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:13,390
It's probably like that.

535
00:30:13,432 --> 00:30:14,433
Yes.

536
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:23,734
What?

537
00:30:25,611 --> 00:30:26,653
Me?

538
00:30:30,616 --> 00:30:32,868
Tae Lee,
you're always very positive,

539
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,119
so I'm sure it'll go well.

540
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,330
I just do my best.

541
00:30:36,914 --> 00:30:38,081
You're right.

542
00:30:38,123 --> 00:30:40,459
Hey, this is the same as mine.

543
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:41,835
Don't they look the same?

544
00:30:42,753 --> 00:30:44,129
Let's see.

545
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:45,756
Hey.

546
00:30:54,848 --> 00:30:56,934
This bag is pretty.

547
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:00,187
Yes.

548
00:31:00,938 --> 00:31:04,274
It's a present for myself
after working hard for six months.

549
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,986
Great work, Tae Lee.

550
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,739
- It looks great on you.
- Really?

551
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:12,616
Yes, what does your boyfriend think?

552
00:31:12,658 --> 00:31:15,369
I'm not her boyfriend.
We're just friends.

553
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,537
Oh, I see.

554
00:31:18,247 --> 00:31:19,873
- "Friends"?
- What?

555
00:31:19,915 --> 00:31:21,917
Does this mean we're friends now?

556
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:27,631
What should I get?

557
00:31:43,772 --> 00:31:45,274
Come to think about it,

558
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:48,986
I never did anything nice for you.

559
00:31:50,404 --> 00:31:54,825
A good bag
will bring you success.

560
00:32:06,545 --> 00:32:09,381
You could've been sacked sooner.

561
00:32:10,257 --> 00:32:11,842
Do you know why I didn't?

562
00:32:14,094 --> 00:32:15,762
You need to be wise.

563
00:32:17,014 --> 00:32:19,349
Depending on what you say,

564
00:32:19,683 --> 00:32:21,393
either Ga Yeol Chan...

565
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:25,480
or you will get fired.

566
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,199
Eat up.

567
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:38,702
I'll be going now.

568
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,871
Bye.

569
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,386
Mr. Lee.

570
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,231
I'm sure you've answered him well...

571
00:33:07,272 --> 00:33:09,483
instead of being righteous
and thinking that everything...

572
00:33:09,525 --> 00:33:11,401
would be over if you quit.

573
00:33:12,361 --> 00:33:14,196
That's just a thought I had.

574
00:33:16,198 --> 00:33:17,324
So what?

575
00:33:18,033 --> 00:33:19,535
Does Mr. Ga know...

576
00:33:20,202 --> 00:33:23,580
that you were a spy
who worked for Mr. Namgoong?

577
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,377
"Spy"? Don't be ridiculous.

578
00:33:28,418 --> 00:33:29,962
These photos don't prove anything.

579
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:34,007
Aren't you going to take
Yeol Chan down?

580
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:36,134
I... I will.

581
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,097
Make sure he doesn't sign
any new contracts.

582
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:43,517
Come on!

583
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,519
Everything has turned into ashes.

584
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:46,562
Keep going.

585
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:49,648
Better yet, turn Ga Yeol Chan
into ashes.

586
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,067
Forget it. How long do you think
you can maintain your fame?

587
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:53,569
It's only difficult
to make things successful.

588
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,821
Ruining things is a piece of cake.

589
00:33:55,863 --> 00:33:59,283
We're on a trip
to develop a new product.

590
00:34:24,391 --> 00:34:25,851
Let me share a spoiler with you.

591
00:34:27,436 --> 00:34:29,271
Your daughter won't receive
a permanent position.

592
00:34:29,897 --> 00:34:31,815
She seems to love the company a lot.

593
00:34:31,857 --> 00:34:34,484
Let's help her keep working, okay?

594
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:52,586
Yeol Chan.

595
00:34:57,257 --> 00:34:59,676
Yeol Chan, you punk.

596
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,413
Does Mr. Ga know...

597
00:35:28,455 --> 00:35:31,792
that you were a spy
who worked for Mr. Namgoong?

598
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:41,134
She seems to love the company a lot.

599
00:35:41,176 --> 00:35:43,846
Let's help her keep working, okay?

600
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:45,389
I wrote an awesome proposal.

601
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,808
We've Added Saury to the Ramyeon.

602
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,518
We've Added Chicken Heads
to the Ramyeon.

603
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,894
We've Added Chicken Feet
to the Ramyeon.

604
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:53,605
We've Added Pupae to the Ramyeon.

605
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,441
What?

606
00:35:56,608 --> 00:35:58,819
I'm fine. I'm really fine.

607
00:35:58,861 --> 00:35:59,903
We should...

608
00:35:59,945 --> 00:36:01,238
You can't put that in ramyeon.

609
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,449
How spicy was the spicy seafood
and chicken ramyeon?

610
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:07,995
Isn't it good?

611
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:09,288
Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon
will be the next big thing...

612
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:10,581
after Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

613
00:36:10,622 --> 00:36:12,124
Ms. Lee, you did it.

614
00:36:12,165 --> 00:36:14,209
Okay! You have my respect.

615
00:36:14,251 --> 00:36:16,837
This is unbelievable.
I can't believe how lucky I am.

616
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:19,089
Press alt and tab.

617
00:36:19,298 --> 00:36:20,340
It changed.

618
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:27,264
I'll work even harder
for your sake...

619
00:36:27,514 --> 00:36:28,765
and make sure you get in.

620
00:36:28,974 --> 00:36:30,767
- Man Sic.
- Tae Lee.

621
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:32,102
Okay!

622
00:36:32,603 --> 00:36:35,105
Not only has newtro
captured fashion and culture...

623
00:36:35,147 --> 00:36:36,857
You all know...

624
00:36:36,899 --> 00:36:39,151
We can use these stories...

625
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:16,438
- You're working so hard.
- Thanks.

626
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,273
Hello, sir.

627
00:37:18,315 --> 00:37:20,651
Hello.

628
00:37:21,193 --> 00:37:22,194
Hello.

629
00:37:24,655 --> 00:37:25,864
Why are you guys here?

630
00:37:25,906 --> 00:37:27,199
I know, right?

631
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:29,785
We told them to wait at home,
but they insisted on coming.

632
00:37:29,826 --> 00:37:32,329
They caused such a scene.
My goodness.

633
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:35,040
Why are you at the office?

634
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,501
Because I love...

635
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:39,670
my company.

636
00:37:39,753 --> 00:37:42,381
Me too. Instead of staying home
and worrying,

637
00:37:42,422 --> 00:37:43,966
I wanted to come here and help out.

638
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,641
My dear mentee, Yoon Soo.

639
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,103
If that's what you want,
please call the agency right now...

640
00:37:56,144 --> 00:37:57,813
and get the list of people...

641
00:37:57,855 --> 00:37:59,898
who won the 55th anniversary event.

642
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,233
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

643
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:02,276
Okay.

644
00:38:08,073 --> 00:38:09,658
Big news! Big...

645
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,702
Enough with your "big news".

646
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:14,121
It's about
the colleague interview...

647
00:38:14,162 --> 00:38:15,539
regarding Mr. Ga's appointment
as the junior managing director.

648
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:16,707
What about that?

649
00:38:16,748 --> 00:38:18,917
They're interviewing Mr. Lee.

650
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:21,378
Why would they interview him?

651
00:38:22,504 --> 00:38:25,007
Hold on. You weren't notified?

652
00:38:29,303 --> 00:38:30,304
No.

653
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:34,224
Mr. Lee.

654
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:36,935
Did Mr. Ga...

655
00:38:38,103 --> 00:38:42,691
abuse his authority by forcing you
to take responsibility...

656
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:44,484
for his own mistake?

657
00:38:44,526 --> 00:38:45,569
Yes, he did.

658
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:48,238
But...

659
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:51,700
at first, he didn't know
that he had made the mistake.

660
00:38:51,742 --> 00:38:54,328
He only found out later...

661
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:56,872
and then apologized to me.

662
00:38:57,873 --> 00:38:59,833
Previously, Mr. Namgoong wanted
to fire me for that.

663
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:01,585
But he sorted that out.

664
00:39:02,628 --> 00:39:04,004
- My goodness?
- What?

665
00:39:04,755 --> 00:39:05,923
Mr. Lee.

666
00:39:06,423 --> 00:39:08,759
This isn't the first time
you worked with Mr. Ga, is it?

667
00:39:14,264 --> 00:39:15,390
- What is that?
- What is that?

668
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:16,975
- What is that?
- What?

669
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:23,607
("Rice Soup Owner
Attempts Suicide...")

670
00:39:23,649 --> 00:39:25,484
("Due to an Ill-Fated
Relationship with Ongol...")

671
00:39:25,526 --> 00:39:27,402
(and Is Unconscious")

672
00:39:27,444 --> 00:39:29,446
(Intern B was the last person
to meet with the owner...)

673
00:39:29,488 --> 00:39:31,448
(and has resigned.)

674
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:36,078
Who is "Intern B"?

675
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,126
It's Mr. Ga Yeol Chan.

676
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,837
- What?
- So...

677
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:48,090
what happened
to that rice soup owner?

678
00:39:48,882 --> 00:39:49,925
He passed away...

679
00:39:51,718 --> 00:39:53,220
not too long ago.

680
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,348
- Yeol Chan killed him?
- Did he kill him?

681
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,433
I'm the one to blame.
It's my fault!

682
00:40:01,144 --> 00:40:03,939
I didn't want to cover it up
and then hear people blame...

683
00:40:03,981 --> 00:40:06,650
the company for using its money
to shush the incident.

684
00:40:06,692 --> 00:40:09,444
That's why I forced Yeol Chan
to resign.

685
00:40:10,112 --> 00:40:11,113
I am...

686
00:40:11,989 --> 00:40:13,448
the one to blame.

687
00:40:13,657 --> 00:40:14,783
- You...
- Hey.

688
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,162
I'd like to ask the elderly here.

689
00:40:19,454 --> 00:40:23,208
Were your hands always clean
while working for this company?

690
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:25,210
We all had to do such things.

691
00:40:26,003 --> 00:40:27,004
Wait.

692
00:40:27,713 --> 00:40:31,717
I know that you have all done
some corrupt deeds as well!

693
00:40:32,426 --> 00:40:33,427
Am I wrong?

694
00:40:33,468 --> 00:40:34,469
What?

695
00:40:34,511 --> 00:40:38,098
But that's not the case
for Yeol Chan.

696
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,517
You know that well!

697
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:45,772
I know why you're tormenting him
so much.

698
00:40:46,315 --> 00:40:47,357
But...

699
00:40:49,943 --> 00:40:51,862
if you dare to harm him,

700
00:40:52,404 --> 00:40:55,240
I won't sit still!

701
00:40:55,949 --> 00:40:57,868
Hey. Are you...

702
00:40:58,285 --> 00:40:59,453
I can't believe him.

703
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:02,539
Hey. My gosh.

704
00:41:27,564 --> 00:41:28,941
You're quite interesting.

705
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,915
My gosh.

706
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:48,126
Darn it.

707
00:41:52,965 --> 00:41:54,633
What's your angle here?

708
00:41:54,675 --> 00:41:57,052
Are you Ga Yeol Chan's lawyer?

709
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:59,596
Or are you a double agent
or something?

710
00:41:59,638 --> 00:42:02,891
My gosh. You must have been
on his side from the get-go.

711
00:42:02,933 --> 00:42:04,560
You only pretended to be on mine.

712
00:42:04,601 --> 00:42:07,062
Is that what's important right now?

713
00:42:07,104 --> 00:42:10,274
That's very important to me now!

714
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:13,318
Freeze.

715
00:42:18,782 --> 00:42:20,284
What are you doing right now?

716
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:23,287
Hey, don't butt in our business.

717
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:24,538
Just go on your way.

718
00:42:26,665 --> 00:42:27,666
Dad.

719
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:29,585
Dad, what have you done wrong?

720
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:31,837
- Don't just take that from him.
- Stop.

721
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:35,716
"Dad"?

722
00:42:38,343 --> 00:42:39,428
Your daughter?

723
00:42:46,852 --> 00:42:48,604
My gosh, your glass is empty.

724
00:42:49,229 --> 00:42:52,608
My gosh, my son-in-law.

725
00:42:52,649 --> 00:42:54,359
Father.

726
00:42:58,906 --> 00:42:59,907
Father.

727
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,327
You and I should join hands.

728
00:43:03,368 --> 00:43:06,872
And let's kick out
Ga Yeol Chan together.

729
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,081
Hey.

730
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:14,087
Why are you dying to destroy him?

731
00:43:14,129 --> 00:43:17,674
If you care to pay attention,
he comes with a sad story too.

732
00:43:18,258 --> 00:43:19,801
What sad story?

733
00:43:19,843 --> 00:43:21,136
In my opinion,

734
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,349
I don't think you should be
trying to kick him out now.

735
00:43:26,892 --> 00:43:29,144
What are you talking about, Man Sic?

736
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:30,938
I mean, Father.

737
00:43:32,481 --> 00:43:34,024
Senior Managing Director Koo...

738
00:43:34,525 --> 00:43:38,737
is doing everything she can
to get rid of Yeol Chan.

739
00:43:38,779 --> 00:43:41,365
Do you think
she's doing that for you?

740
00:43:42,115 --> 00:43:44,243
- No.
- Then, why?

741
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:46,370
Why?

742
00:43:46,537 --> 00:43:50,541
The second biggest shareholder of
SCI is Senior Managing Director Koo.

743
00:43:53,043 --> 00:43:55,379
- Hey.
- Ma'am.

744
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,047
You're here, Ok Kyung.

745
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:02,302
As of now, Chairman Namgoong Pyo...

746
00:44:02,344 --> 00:44:06,014
has 33 percent
of Joonsu Food's stocks.

747
00:44:06,056 --> 00:44:09,184
And the second biggest
shareholder of Joonsu Food,

748
00:44:09,226 --> 00:44:13,522
their equity partner, SCI,
has 19.8 percent.

749
00:44:13,564 --> 00:44:19,069
The chairman thought
Ms. Koo and SCI were on his side,

750
00:44:19,111 --> 00:44:21,363
but when he found out
they had an ulterior plan,

751
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:24,908
the chairman is feeling
very threatened of his position.

752
00:44:27,911 --> 00:44:28,871
(Gift tax)

753
00:44:28,912 --> 00:44:32,916
And the chairman is hesitant
to transfer you the stocks...

754
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:34,668
because once he does that,

755
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,420
after deducting 65 percent of it
for the gift tax,

756
00:44:36,461 --> 00:44:38,213
forget about keeping
the control of the management.

757
00:44:38,255 --> 00:44:42,009
It'll be hard to be the largest
shareholder of the company.

758
00:44:44,011 --> 00:44:45,012
That's why...

759
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:47,723
he hasn't given me any shares.

760
00:44:47,764 --> 00:44:50,100
Ms. Koo will run
for the presidential position...

761
00:44:50,142 --> 00:44:53,103
of the company as a candidate.

762
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:54,771
What?

763
00:44:56,023 --> 00:44:57,065
That...

764
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,943
Chairman Cheon
will just be supporting her.

765
00:44:59,985 --> 00:45:01,862
Ms. Koo will try
to be the president...

766
00:45:01,904 --> 00:45:04,823
and have control of the company.

767
00:45:05,282 --> 00:45:06,366
That woman.

768
00:45:06,491 --> 00:45:07,701
Did you get it now?

769
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:10,954
That your target
shouldn't be Yeol Chan?

770
00:45:12,873 --> 00:45:15,501
What should I do to get rid of her?

771
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:16,668
As for that...

772
00:45:18,128 --> 00:45:20,005
You have to get rid of her.

773
00:45:21,131 --> 00:45:22,132
Right.

774
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:24,885
By the way,

775
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:31,016
who really are you?

776
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:35,145
She's Ok Kyung.

777
00:45:47,032 --> 00:45:48,659
You're quite interesting.

778
00:45:52,788 --> 00:45:56,166
I'm sure she's going
to do something about this.

779
00:46:19,731 --> 00:46:23,360
If a stranger visits you
all of a sudden...

780
00:46:23,402 --> 00:46:25,988
or if you're in any danger,

781
00:46:26,029 --> 00:46:28,156
you have to tell me.

782
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:29,575
"In any danger"?

783
00:46:33,245 --> 00:46:34,746
- What is this?
- Did you get it too?

784
00:46:34,788 --> 00:46:35,789
- Yes.
- Yes.

785
00:46:36,123 --> 00:46:37,165
What is this?

786
00:46:37,374 --> 00:46:38,375
I don't know.

787
00:46:40,335 --> 00:46:43,213
You will find out soon enough.

788
00:46:56,476 --> 00:46:58,187
You'll have more friends.

789
00:46:58,896 --> 00:47:00,480
You just do what I say.

790
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:26,423
I can't do it.

791
00:47:27,758 --> 00:47:28,926
I'm sorry.

Mr. Lee is Tae Lee's father?

00:48:53,385 --> 00:48:57,014

each other for over 40 years.

812
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,474
- I was totally surprised too.
- My gosh.

Then, did you know Ms. Koo is
the second largest shareholder?

Goodness. I can't believe
someone like you is working for me.

isn't important right now.

Is it true that it counts
as a withdrawal if he doesn't...

Of course.

If he doesn't show up
without prior notice,

825

for the position.

This is all you had
in that big house?

My gosh, you're so nosy.

831

Why did you have to come?
I told you not to come.

to his interview?

Maybe.
