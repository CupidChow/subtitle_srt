(Kkondae Intern)

6
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:34,278
Who's that guy?

7
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:39,449
Hey, stop.

8
00:00:43,078 --> 00:00:44,997
Hey, who are you?

9
00:00:45,163 --> 00:00:46,707
Hey, who is this guy?

10
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,209
My gosh.

11
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:00,179
Where's the other guy?

12
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:02,347
There's traffic on Olympic Bridge.

13
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:04,516
Then is Mapo Bridge down?

14
00:01:05,726 --> 00:01:06,768
No, sir.

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,782
Why would Mapo Bridge be down?

16
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:23,410
I crossed that bridge
to work today.

17
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:30,125
Goodness.

18
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:35,672
If you keep behaving like this,

19
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:37,883
you'll turn me into a real thug.

20
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:39,635
You are a real thug.

21
00:01:41,553 --> 00:01:43,305
So how do you think I got here?

22
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,183
I did better than the good ones.

23
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:48,185
I abandoned the fools.

24
00:01:48,727 --> 00:01:50,938
Then I killed all betrayers
like that guy in glasses.

25
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:52,064
I see, sir.

26
00:01:53,857 --> 00:01:55,776
- Boys.
- Yes, Boss.

27
00:01:58,278 --> 00:01:59,279
Wait...

28
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:07,287
(Abiding by
the broadcasting regulations)

29
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:09,331
- Cut one off.
- What?

30
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:10,415
Cut one of these off.

31
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:12,125
- Goodness.
- Man Sic, let's stick to the rules.

32
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:13,669
Don't cut it off. Don't.

33
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,711
Hold him down.

34
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,630
Don't cut it off. Don't cut...

35
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:18,590
Stay still.

36
00:02:18,674 --> 00:02:19,675
You'll get hurt.

37
00:02:22,928 --> 00:02:23,929
(Abiding by
the broadcasting regulations)

38
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:28,976
Mr. Lee!

39
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:32,938
Mr. Ga!

40
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:43,031
You're all dead.

41
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:56,044
- Moo Seok.
- Yes, Boss?

42
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:57,546
Can you win against that guy?

43
00:02:58,338 --> 00:02:59,590
I won't lose twice.

44
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:01,967
If you lose again,
you'll be found dead.

45
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:06,305
Mr. Ga, if you lose,
you'll be found dead too.

46
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:08,348
What are you talking about, man?

47
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,101
Get them.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,627
- Move.
- Darn it.

49
00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:37,669
Mr. Lee.

50
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:41,924
Mr. Ga.

51
00:03:47,429 --> 00:03:48,555
Who do we have now?

52
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:24,925
- Darn it.
- You jerks.

53
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:26,927
- Hey, get back here.
- I'll get you.

54
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:28,387
- Hey.
- Don't be cute.

55
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:30,722
- I'll kill you.
- Darn it.

56
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:36,645
My gosh.

57
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:39,356
You.

58
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,983
You idiots. Take them down!

59
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:42,025
Take them down!

60
00:04:57,457 --> 00:04:58,458
Be careful.

61
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:07,009
You jerk.

62
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:11,763
You jerk. Take this. Take this.

63
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:13,265
Darn it!

64
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:16,268
I'll kill you.

65
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:20,981
Darn you, idiot. You idiot.

66
00:05:22,357 --> 00:05:24,818
Hey, come at me.
Bring it, you jerk.

67
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:26,320
- I'll get you.
- Goodness.

68
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:31,116
Go away. Go away.

69
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:37,289
Darn it, that stings.

70
00:05:37,998 --> 00:05:39,666
Go away.

71
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:54,097
Man Sic!

72
00:06:00,646 --> 00:06:03,315
- Darn it, man.
- Don't play around with these.

73
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:08,904
My gosh.

74
00:06:11,073 --> 00:06:12,074
Take this!

75
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:20,415
Dad!

76
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,417
Stop!

77
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,211
Hey!

78
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:25,796
- Did you see that?
- Duck!

79
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:37,975
Moo Seok, they're way too tough.

80
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:39,142
Tell me about it.

81
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:40,477
I totally agree.

82
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:53,031
Goodness.

83
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,161
The air is so fresh.

84
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:01,206
Are you all right?

85
00:07:01,331 --> 00:07:02,749
Yes, I'm fine.

86
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,460
Why did you follow me
all the way here?

87
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:06,962
I was worried.

88
00:07:08,422 --> 00:07:10,674
About my dad.
I was worried about my dad.

89
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:11,717
Right.

90
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:14,386
Great work, everyone.

91
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:17,514
- Yes, Ms. Ok.
- Great work, Kyung.

92
00:07:20,142 --> 00:07:21,143
Look at him.

93
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:23,770
Why are you getting in there?

94
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:25,564
Unbelievable.

95
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:28,525
Hey, you can come with me.

96
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:32,821
Come on.

97
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:34,406
Come.

98
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:43,248
Great work.

99
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:49,129
Hey, old lady.

100
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,633
You were pretty cool back there.

101
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,261
Here.

102
00:08:05,103 --> 00:08:06,188
So?

103
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:09,566
You ran out
during your evaluation interview?

104
00:08:09,608 --> 00:08:11,944
How can I turn a blind eye
to someone whose life is in danger?

105
00:08:12,486 --> 00:08:16,573
My gosh. This is awful.
Why do you think I went this far?

106
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:20,410
Why did you take things this far?

107
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,998
Because if we don't win,
we'll die in this fight.

108
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:28,460
It'll only end
when someone is covered in blood.

109
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:33,131
I wanted to help you win.

110
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:41,181
Do you remember?

111
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:43,892
The day you save me the third time,

112
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:45,811
I said we'll really start dating.

113
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,774
I'm done talking to Man Sic... No.

114
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:53,819
I'm all done talking to
my father-in-law.

115
00:08:54,486 --> 00:08:55,487
What?

116
00:08:55,654 --> 00:08:57,823
Hey, if you start dating me,

117
00:08:57,865 --> 00:09:00,826
You don't need to worry
about becoming a full-time employee.

118
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,413
- There you go again.
- I'm just joking.

119
00:09:04,705 --> 00:09:05,706
Gosh.

120
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:13,338
I had no idea since I was born
into a wealthy family.

121
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:17,843
But seeing how you all jumped
through all sorts of hoops,

122
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:21,388
I could kind of understand
how hard you tried in life.

123
00:09:25,642 --> 00:09:28,562
If people get to know you,
you're not all that bad.

124
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,023
It would've been nice
if there was a good adult...

125
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:32,357
who could guide you.

126
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:37,863
The problem is,
there aren't that many of them.

127
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:42,784
That's because they don't survive
in this world.

128
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:44,745
What?

129
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:46,747
Hey, this is what my dad told me.

130
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:50,751
All those higher-ups
at our company...

131
00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:53,754
didn't get their positions
through hard work.

132
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:55,839
They just refused
to take responsibility.

133
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:58,759
They forced
the goodhearted fools...

134
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:01,220
to take responsibility for them.

135
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:09,186
If Mr. Ga became president,

136
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:12,189
wouldn't he be able to pave a way
for the goodhearted ones?

137
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:14,608
Hey. I can do that as well!

138
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:20,280
Let's go.

139
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:22,699
What? She's unbelievable.

140
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,868
You seem to always bring him up.

141
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,328
Is there something going on
between you guys?

142
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:27,621
Hurry up and let's go.

143
00:10:27,663 --> 00:10:31,250
Hey, then how about me, you,
and Yeol Chan...

144
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,417
go together?

145
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:34,378
That's enough.

146
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:35,671
"That's enough."

147
00:10:38,882 --> 00:10:40,759
You should've turned that way!

148
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:43,011
Shouldn't you go home?

149
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,515
You agreed to let me stay
at your place for some time.

150
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:49,017
Darn it.

151
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:52,145
How could you not know
the way to your house?

152
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:53,939
My goodness.

153
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:58,235
We're taking a much longer path.
Darn it.

154
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:09,538
(Junior Managing Director,
Ga Yeol Chan)

155

(Ga Yeol Chan)

156
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:44,364
Sir, should we have dinner?

157
00:11:44,615 --> 00:11:47,326
I'd love to.
I'm craving something with broth.

158
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:50,412
- Then how about seafood kalguksu?
- Seafood kalguksu?

159
00:11:50,454 --> 00:11:52,331
What about pollack stew?
I know a good place.

160
00:11:52,372 --> 00:11:53,415
- I'd like pollack stew.
- Me too.

161
00:11:53,457 --> 00:11:54,917
- Me too.
- Who else wants it?

162
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,502
- Many of you want short rib soup.
- Yes.

163
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,961
What about you?

164
00:11:58,003 --> 00:12:00,005
- I'm fine with anything.
- Okay.

165
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:01,924
- I'll make a reservation right now.
- I'd like that.

166
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:03,717
- Okay.
- That sounds nice.

167
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,345
- I've organized it from page eight.

I think Mr. Ga is really going
to become the president.

171
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:15,062
He's one of the candidates
for the managing director.

these candidates down to two?

Yes.

178
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:36,500
I guess it'll be a battle
between Yeol Chan and me.

00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:50,973
Would I be on the list again?

I'm not sure.

that he'll kick her out?

Hey, don't you think
he'll end up becoming the president?

He's 1 of the final 2 candidates.

If Mr. Ga cherished you so much,
why were you a contract worker...

Mr. Ga.

203
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,685
Since...

204
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:02,938
we don't have peer evaluation,

205
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:06,441
the vice president's evaluation
takes up 30 percent.

206

But if I think about it,

207
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:12,823
I think our document and
interview evaluations are similar.

208

on the vice president's evaluation.

Shouldn't you at least explain
why you're doing this?

The subcontractor that was in charge
of the 55th anniversary event...

238

had wired money
to your personal bank account.

239
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:12,359
And the amount was exactly half
of the price of the car...

240
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:13,694
which was the first prize.

the second he looked at them.

256
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:55,569
He must know one of them.

257

Are you seriously
going to be like this?

277
00:19:01,301 --> 00:19:03,178
You only do tasks that make you
look hard-working.

278
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:06,056
And you make the others do tasks
that no one would pay attention to.

279
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:07,266
You flatter your superiors.

280
00:19:07,307 --> 00:19:08,934
And you turn the other way when
your subordinates are struggling.

281
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:10,310
Fine.

282

Being somewhat selfish
at the workplace...

283
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:16,692
is understandable because...

284
00:19:17,484 --> 00:19:20,320
we are like mere parts
that can be replaced anytime.

285
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:23,323
Since you can be replaced,
you'll focus on helping your family?

286
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:26,493
Fine. But...

287

I told you. I lent the money to him.

Yes.

00:21:46,758 --> 00:21:47,759
Tae Lee.

332
00:21:50,304 --> 00:21:52,890
- Quiet.
- Why are you scowling at me?

333
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:56,560
Try not to go there a lot, okay?

334
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,493
The corn dog is delicious.

335
00:22:17,915 --> 00:22:18,916
Paeng Min Woo?

336
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,001
- What?
- Paeng is a rare last name.

337
00:22:21,335 --> 00:22:22,503
What about you, Mr. Lee?

338
00:22:23,295 --> 00:22:24,546
Well, we don't work
together anymore.

339
00:22:24,588 --> 00:22:26,173
Gosh, call me whatever you want.

340
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:29,009
You can call me Man Sic or Mister.

341
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:30,928
Then, how about Oldie Lee?

342
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:33,931
My gosh, come on.
Stop calling me old.

343
00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:35,015
I don't want to hear it.

344
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:37,351
It's because you're like
a wise old man.

345
00:22:40,145 --> 00:22:41,271
Who do we need to find?

346
00:22:41,313 --> 00:22:44,483
I think we need
to find Paeng Min Woo.

347
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:46,944
Who's Paeng Min Woo?

348
00:22:46,985 --> 00:22:48,820
He's Kim Eun Young's boyfriend.

349
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:50,531
Here's her photo.

350
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:53,283
Right here.

351
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:54,826
(Paeng Min Woo and Kim Eun Young)

352
00:22:57,871 --> 00:23:00,374
My gosh, you're so meticulous
that it gives me the chills.

353
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,543
I totally agree.

354
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:04,962
(See that? This is an aurora.)

355
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:08,340
Okay. Let's see.

356
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,511
And there are more photos.

357
00:23:13,387 --> 00:23:17,099
Mr. Oh, the winner
of the last year's event...

358
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,393
won a free trip to see
the aurora, right?

359
00:23:19,434 --> 00:23:20,519
- Yes.
- The aurora.

360
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:21,645
And...

361
00:23:22,312 --> 00:23:25,941
what other prizes did
the previous winners get?

362
00:23:25,983 --> 00:23:27,276
A small car was one of the prizes.

363
00:23:27,317 --> 00:23:28,610
And we also gave out
a golden pig too.

364
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:29,653
A small car.

365
00:23:29,695 --> 00:23:31,697
A golden pig.

366
00:23:33,198 --> 00:23:37,202
Why does this guy, Paeng Min Woo,
have all the prizes?

367
00:23:39,246 --> 00:23:42,124
This means the event was rigged.

368
00:23:43,584 --> 00:23:44,710
Paeng.

369
00:23:45,502 --> 00:23:47,212
Who are you?

370
00:23:57,222 --> 00:23:58,557
Man Sae, I think your mom is here.

371
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:00,851
- Man Sae. Hey.
- Mom is here.

372
00:24:00,893 --> 00:24:02,019
Darn it.

373
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,021
Man Sae, is it your mom?

374
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,108
Mr. Oh.

375
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:11,195
Come on.

376
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:12,571
Mr. Oh.

377
00:24:12,613 --> 00:24:15,532
Among our subcontractors,
there's a company called Hojoondang.

378
00:24:15,574 --> 00:24:18,702
They supply the rice cake
for rice cake soup and tteokbokki.

379
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:21,622
The owner's name is Paeng Ho Joon.

380
00:24:21,663 --> 00:24:22,623
Paeng Ho Joon?

381
00:24:22,664 --> 00:24:25,083
Why are you telling us that?

382
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:28,003
Well, you told me to come here.

383
00:24:28,879 --> 00:24:30,255
Come sit here.

384
00:24:31,632 --> 00:24:32,758
Take a seat.

385
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,886
- What a surprise.
- The owner's name is Paeng Ho Joon?

386
00:24:36,303 --> 00:24:39,139
Yes. Whenever we hold events,

387
00:24:39,264 --> 00:24:40,891
he's always involved.

388
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:43,560
At first, he borrowed his family
and relatives' online account.

389
00:24:43,894 --> 00:24:47,189
Now, he's using
his son's girlfriend's account.

390
00:24:47,856 --> 00:24:49,816
How did you know
Paeng was involved...

391
00:24:49,858 --> 00:24:51,735
just by looking
at Kim Eun Young's username?

392
00:24:51,777 --> 00:24:55,322
Well, her username had
"paeng" and 58 in it.

393
00:24:55,364 --> 00:24:57,241
- I see.
- He sold her girlfriend's ID...

394
00:24:57,282 --> 00:24:58,617
to his father.

395
00:24:59,618 --> 00:25:03,956
But a mere subcontractor...

396
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:06,875
called the event agency...

397
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:09,795
and rigged the result?

398
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:13,006
This doesn't add up.

399
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:15,467
Then,

400
00:25:17,469 --> 00:25:21,807
it means someone in our company
is involved in this scheme.

401
00:25:24,768 --> 00:25:25,769
How odd.

402
00:25:26,478 --> 00:25:30,190
Friends Event has close ties
with Ms. Koo.

403
00:25:30,482 --> 00:25:31,817
Ms. Koo?

404
00:25:32,985 --> 00:25:34,319
Elaborate.

405
00:25:34,736 --> 00:25:36,947
Friends Event isn't that competent.

406
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:39,741
Their presentation was awful
during the bidding process.

407
00:25:39,783 --> 00:25:41,994
But they won the bid.

408
00:25:43,495 --> 00:25:46,915
Rumor has it that
Ms. Koo has ties with them.

409
00:25:54,506 --> 00:25:56,049
Koo Ja Sook.

410
00:25:56,675 --> 00:25:59,845
My gosh. Am I really gifted?

411
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,307
Whenever I try to cause trouble,
someone else is responsible.

412
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,184
When I tried to use
the Taeseon Incident,

413
00:26:05,225 --> 00:26:06,977
there were real carcinogens.

414
00:26:07,102 --> 00:26:09,521
When I tried to plot a scheme
to kick Ga Yeol Chan out,

415
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,231
it turns out Ms. Koo
has been plotting all along.

416
00:26:12,232 --> 00:26:13,358
Right.

417
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:17,362
I'm starting to get a bit scared.

418
00:26:19,114 --> 00:26:20,115
But...

419
00:26:20,908 --> 00:26:24,077
didn't Ms. Granny call...

420
00:26:24,494 --> 00:26:26,872
Taeseon and Friends Event?

421
00:26:42,262 --> 00:26:45,265
By the way,
are you my dad's subordinate?

422
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:54,024
- That's Tae Lee's brother.
- That's Man Sic Junior.

423
00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:55,651
Hey, stop playing games.

424
00:26:56,818 --> 00:27:00,030
What do you mean
Ms. Koo picked out the winner?

425
00:27:00,072 --> 00:27:02,824
It's only circumstantial.
There's no proof.

426
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:05,202
I think Ms. Koo pressured
the event agency to include...

427
00:27:05,244 --> 00:27:09,081
Mr. Paeng's family
and acquaintances' names...

428
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:11,708
on the list of winners every year.

429
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:15,379
Let's say that there was
an illegal trade.

430
00:27:15,796 --> 00:27:18,090
But why did they send me the money?

431
00:27:18,924 --> 00:27:20,425
Exactly.

432
00:27:21,301 --> 00:27:23,846
I don't understand that either.

433
00:27:24,346 --> 00:27:26,765
If we keep digging,
we'll find her at the end.

434
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:27,808
This looks like...

435
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:31,144
a perfect chance to dig up
some dirt on Ms. Koo.

436
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,691
First of all,

437
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:39,278
let's get evidence by pressuring
the owner of Friends Event.

438
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:42,114
And finding out the relationship
between Mr. Paeng and Ms. Koo...

439
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:43,448
is the key factor.

440
00:27:44,116 --> 00:27:45,075
- Okay.
- I got it.

441
00:27:45,117 --> 00:27:47,077
- Let's try that.
- Yes.

442
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,161
- Yoon Soo.
- Yes?

443
00:27:48,203 --> 00:27:50,247
- You should stay out of this.
- Pardon?

444
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:52,165
You worked so hard to become
a regular employee.

445
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:53,917
Do you want to get kicked out?

446
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:57,838
This means we're going to go
head to head with Ms. Koo.

447
00:27:58,422 --> 00:28:00,674
We have to risk our jobs here.

448
00:28:01,008 --> 00:28:02,801
Right. You should stay out of this.

449
00:28:05,762 --> 00:28:07,306
Everyone, this is enough for me.

450
00:28:07,431 --> 00:28:09,016
I'll take care of the rest.

451
00:28:09,433 --> 00:28:10,434
No.

452
00:28:10,893 --> 00:28:11,894
I'll join too.

453
00:28:11,935 --> 00:28:15,189
I know Friends Event
and Hojoondang the best.

454
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,231
Right.

455
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:18,609
I know, but if this goes south...

456
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,902
I know.

457
00:28:21,403 --> 00:28:25,115
When I asked for paternity leave
to help my wife go back to work...

458
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:26,992
because I didn't want her
to lose her career,

459
00:28:27,326 --> 00:28:28,869
all of my superiors threatened me.

460
00:28:28,911 --> 00:28:30,829
They said I might not have
a job to come back to...

461
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:33,373
and I might end up
not getting promoted.

462
00:28:33,415 --> 00:28:37,002
But you were the only person
who told me to take the leave...

463
00:28:37,377 --> 00:28:38,712
without any worries.

464
00:28:39,338 --> 00:28:42,549
And it was you who took me back
without any complaints.

465
00:28:45,427 --> 00:28:46,845
To be honest,

466
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:49,556
I didn't like it when a guy
younger than me...

467
00:28:49,598 --> 00:28:52,142
got the general managerial
position over me.

468
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,647
But he was the best
general manager ever.

469
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:01,527
I mean, of course,
he did have an era...

470
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,071
when he seemed like
a crazy and uptight father.

471
00:29:07,199 --> 00:29:08,367
But after you became
the junior managing director,

472
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:10,410
you're back to your old self.

473
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:17,793
And I'm not saying this
to get on Mr. Ga's good side.

474
00:29:17,835 --> 00:29:19,628
I'm serious. I promise.

475
00:29:19,878 --> 00:29:21,547
I'm in too.

476
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:23,757
- You stay out of this.
- No.

477
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,425
No, you stay out of this.

478
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:26,552
- I'm doing it.
- No.

479
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:28,637
- I want to do it.
- Do whatever you want.

480
00:29:29,221 --> 00:29:32,474
(Germanium Salt Room)

481
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:41,233
Mr. Ga, there he is.

482
00:29:42,651 --> 00:29:45,529
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

483
00:29:45,571 --> 00:29:47,531
We bought two trays of eggs.

484
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:50,409
How are we going to finish this?
I told you we should've gotten one.

485
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,871
- I wanted to have a tray each.
- Should we give some out?

486
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:56,039
My gosh, these eggs look great.

487
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:57,583
Mr. Park of Friends Event...

488
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:59,251
is crazy for free stuff.

489
00:29:59,877 --> 00:30:01,503
It's broken.

490
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:04,131
- Sir.
- That looks good.

491
00:30:04,173 --> 00:30:06,550
We got two trays of eggs.
Do you want some?

492
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,720
My gosh. I'm so lucky.
Why did you get so many?

493
00:30:09,761 --> 00:30:11,638
- Goodness. Mr. Park.
- Hey.

494
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,432
- Hey.
- What are the chances?

495
00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:15,934
Mr. Park, is this
the sauna you come to?

496
00:30:15,976 --> 00:30:17,436
I've been coming here for ages.

497
00:30:17,477 --> 00:30:19,229
- Why did you two get so many?
- Have some.

498
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:20,355
You two could use some help.

499
00:30:20,397 --> 00:30:22,983
- Look.
- We knew we'd run into you.

500
00:30:24,484 --> 00:30:26,570
- My gosh.
- Try some with salt.

501
00:30:26,945 --> 00:30:29,239
- This place has great eggs.
- Yes.

502
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:31,867
Gosh, why are you eating
so many eggs?

503
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:34,077
- They make great eggs.
- Exactly.

504
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:36,580
I'm not sure if I could eat so many.
Can I have some more?

505
00:30:36,622 --> 00:30:37,998
- Go ahead.
- Eat up.

506
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:42,336
It's a bit salty,
but let me have another one.

507
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:44,254
- I'll peel another one for you.
- It's so good.

508
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:46,006
I love it.

509
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:49,885
- Here.
- Goodness, another one?

510
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:53,347
This place has great sikhye too.

511
00:30:54,932 --> 00:30:56,934
- Hey, wait.
- It's good.

512
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,937
Let me have a sip.

513
00:31:00,312 --> 00:31:02,022
Just a sip. Just one sip.

514
00:31:03,315 --> 00:31:04,316
What?

515
00:31:06,318 --> 00:31:07,945
Let me have just one sip...

516
00:31:08,695 --> 00:31:10,072
I put my mouth on this.

517
00:31:10,113 --> 00:31:11,740
I'll use the other one.

518
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:16,328
Just give me a sip.

519
00:31:16,453 --> 00:31:17,913
You had all the eggs.

520
00:31:18,664 --> 00:31:21,250
You had all the eggs.
You can have some more.

521
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,501
Here.

522
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:24,670
Just a sip. I'll have one sip.

523
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,631
Well.

524
00:31:28,465 --> 00:31:31,009
Tell me what your deal
with Ms. Koo was.

525
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:32,177
Then I'll give you a sip.

526
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:35,180
I can't believe this.
Just give me a sip.

527
00:31:35,222 --> 00:31:37,182
There was no deal between us.

528
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:39,184
Give me a sip first.

529
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,356
Man, you two are awful.

530
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,693
I'll get one for myself.

531
00:31:47,734 --> 00:31:49,319
- Go ahead.
- Go.

532
00:31:49,695 --> 00:31:51,196
- Go order one.
- Go get your sikhye.

533
00:31:51,238 --> 00:31:52,781
- It's not like I have no money.
- Go order one.

534
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:53,782
I have to go all the way there?

535
00:31:53,824 --> 00:31:54,908
It's not even that expensive.

536
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,034
I'm just asking for a sip!

537
00:31:56,076 --> 00:31:57,327
- Get your own.
- Go order one.

538
00:31:57,369 --> 00:31:58,579
- Get your own.
- Fine, I'll go.

539
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,122
- Fine.
- Go order your own.

540
00:32:00,163 --> 00:32:02,749
My gosh, I'm so thirsty.

541
00:32:09,882 --> 00:32:10,841
What's with this?

542
00:32:10,883 --> 00:32:12,759
- Gosh, I'm so scared.
- My gosh.

543
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:14,052
I'm really scared.

544
00:32:14,136 --> 00:32:16,889
No, we can do this. Don't give up.

545
00:32:19,057 --> 00:32:21,435
He's coming! What if he breaks this?

546
00:32:21,476 --> 00:32:23,103
Right? I think he might.

547
00:32:23,145 --> 00:32:24,146
Goodness.

548
00:32:24,188 --> 00:32:25,230
Move aside.

549
00:32:25,522 --> 00:32:27,065
- Yes.
- We're cleaning this room.

550
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:29,693
They drank sikhye lying down,
and they spilled everything.

551
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,987
He's coming. He's coming out.

552
00:32:32,196 --> 00:32:33,238
You can do this.

553
00:32:38,911 --> 00:32:40,120
Just one sip.

554
00:32:40,913 --> 00:32:42,122
Please give me just one sip.

555
00:32:43,123 --> 00:32:45,083
Just one... Just one sip.

556
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:49,713
So just tell us what your deal
with Ms. Koo was about.

557
00:32:49,755 --> 00:32:52,883
Then I'll give you
the entire bottle. The entire thing.

558
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:55,219
- Goodness.
- Just one sip...

559
00:32:57,763 --> 00:33:00,766
So what about Ms. Koo?
You can have the whole thing.

560
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:03,018
Just one sip, please.

561
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:06,939
- I'm too thirsty.
- Goodness.

562
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:08,815
One sip...

563
00:33:09,358 --> 00:33:10,484
I'm too...

564
00:33:12,486 --> 00:33:13,612
Just one...

565
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:17,658
Okay.

566
00:33:18,242 --> 00:33:19,535
So what happened is...

567
00:33:19,576 --> 00:33:20,661
Yes, keep going.

568
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,163
What happened?

569
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:27,084
My gosh.

570
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:28,502
What happened? How did it go?

571
00:33:29,294 --> 00:33:31,255
- Yes!
- We got him!

572
00:33:31,547 --> 00:33:32,548
Yes!

573
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:37,427
Mr. Park ate a lot of eggs.
He had five in a row.

574
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:40,097
Yes, he didn't seem like a human.
What a man.

575
00:33:40,472 --> 00:33:44,101
Then we just have to find out
Mr. Paeng and Ms. Koo's ties?

576
00:33:44,142 --> 00:33:45,519
- You're right.
- Yes.

577
00:34:00,534 --> 00:34:02,369
Look at that.

578
00:34:04,538 --> 00:34:05,664
Look.

579
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,501
You got some on your lips.

580
00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:11,503
It's okay.

581
00:34:17,885 --> 00:34:18,927
Can you see them?

582
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:25,475
- I can't see anything.
- Quiet.

583
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:27,352
I'll... I'll look.

584
00:34:31,815 --> 00:34:33,942
I can see them. I can see her.

585
00:34:38,322 --> 00:34:39,781
Anyway, Mr. Eom.

586
00:34:40,657 --> 00:34:42,868
Where did you get that camera?

587
00:34:43,076 --> 00:34:45,245
Oh, this? I borrowed it from Kyung.

588
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:50,876
This is him, right? Mr. Paeng.

589
00:34:51,627 --> 00:34:52,628
You're right.

590
00:34:54,463 --> 00:34:56,381
It's him. This is him.

591
00:34:58,383 --> 00:35:01,094
Look at how happy she is.

592
00:35:01,512 --> 00:35:03,430
But this camera got you.

593
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,433
Goodness.

594
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:08,519
- Who are you?
- Me?

595
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,728
I'm Eom Han Gil.

596
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,231
Mr. Eom. Sir. Sir?

597
00:35:14,441 --> 00:35:15,442
Goodness.

598
00:35:17,277 --> 00:35:20,072
Be careful.
And it's not just a warning.

599
00:35:30,415 --> 00:35:31,542
Try some.

600
00:35:32,835 --> 00:35:33,961
I found it!

601
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:42,678
What did you find?

602
00:35:49,017 --> 00:35:51,186
So you were looking for this
all night long?

603
00:35:51,228 --> 00:35:52,229
Yes.

604
00:35:53,981 --> 00:35:55,482
Koo Ja Sook.

605
00:35:55,524 --> 00:35:57,192
Paeng Ho Joon.

606
00:35:57,442 --> 00:35:59,820
- Let our love always be the same.
- Let our love always be the same.

607
00:36:16,587 --> 00:36:19,965
An affair? Unbelievable.

608
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:24,845
But you found this lock among
hundreds and thousands of these?

609
00:36:24,887 --> 00:36:26,555
And you unlocked this too?

610
00:36:26,597 --> 00:36:28,473
- Yes, it didn't take that long.
- Man, you're something.

611
00:36:28,515 --> 00:36:29,850
Gosh, Mr. Joo.

612
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:32,352
Goodness. You didn't have to
take things that far.

613
00:36:32,394 --> 00:36:35,606
Don't say that.
I wanted to help out too.

614
00:36:36,899 --> 00:36:40,068
Anyway,
why is she being so petty?

615
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,278
It's Ms. Koo of all people.

616
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,071
Goodness.

617
00:36:43,113 --> 00:36:44,323
Mr. Lee.

618
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:45,365
- Dad.
- Sir.

619
00:36:45,407 --> 00:36:48,493
She just doesn't care
how big or small it is.

620
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:50,537
At first,
she probably played it small...

621
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,623
then got greedy.

622
00:36:52,664 --> 00:36:54,541
She's not the type
to refuse...

623
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:57,044
even the smallest amount of money.

624
00:36:57,794 --> 00:36:58,795
That's what I think.

625
00:36:58,837 --> 00:37:02,007
I don't think
that's enough evidence...

626
00:37:02,382 --> 00:37:03,967
to catch her.

627
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:05,677
- Sir.
- Hey.

628
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:08,514
Why do you think
such a greedy woman like her...

629
00:37:08,555 --> 00:37:11,099
supported you...

630
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:13,018
as well as Mr. Cha
who went to China?

631
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,438
Isn't that because she wanted
some competent people below her?

632
00:37:17,523 --> 00:37:20,067
Do you really think
that was the only reason why?

633
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:22,194
Information.

634
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,322
Every time I was proposing
a contract to a buyer in secret,

635
00:37:25,364 --> 00:37:26,907
she'd always ask me first...

636
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:28,242
whether it'd work or not.

637
00:37:30,577 --> 00:37:32,955
I thought she was just trying
to help me.

638
00:37:32,996 --> 00:37:34,873
For the past few years,
the Financial Supervisory Service...

639
00:37:34,915 --> 00:37:37,876
had been keeping an eye
on Joonsu Food's transfer of shares.

640
00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:40,462
But the higher-ups put an end to it
because there was no solid evidence.

641
00:37:40,504 --> 00:37:42,339
But after working here,

642
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:44,132
every time a problem occurred,

643
00:37:44,174 --> 00:37:45,968
the person who stepped up first
to fix it...

644
00:37:47,386 --> 00:37:48,720
was Ms. Koo.

645
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:50,722
Goodness.

646
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:55,310
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

647
00:37:56,687 --> 00:37:57,688
What?

648
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,695
I'll store all the evidence
we've gathered so far at my place.

649
00:38:04,903 --> 00:38:06,488
Keeping it at the company
is too risky.

650
00:38:07,072 --> 00:38:09,825
And make backup files online
just in case.

651
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:38,604
Hello?

652
00:38:38,854 --> 00:38:39,855
Ms. Lee?

653
00:38:40,939 --> 00:38:42,649
I think we need to meet.

654
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:53,869
How about both you and your dad...

655
00:38:54,536 --> 00:38:57,206
continue working for our company?

656
00:38:57,789 --> 00:38:59,041
I'll make that happen.

657
00:39:02,127 --> 00:39:04,379
And about Mr. Ga
being falsely blamed...

658
00:39:05,547 --> 00:39:08,217
Once the new managing director
gets chosen,

659
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:11,595
I'll set things straight for him.
I promise.

660
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:16,433
Do you see those files online?

661
00:39:17,142 --> 00:39:18,894
Let's erase them.

662
00:39:21,855 --> 00:39:23,899
You know I can easily
hire someone to delete them, right?

663
00:39:24,566 --> 00:39:27,778
Ms. Lee? I'm giving you a chance.

664
00:39:30,781 --> 00:39:32,616
With the money you already have,

665
00:39:33,075 --> 00:39:36,328
isn't it enough for you
to live a flourishing life?

666
00:39:37,746 --> 00:39:38,747
What?

667
00:39:43,544 --> 00:39:46,088
I don't understand
why you're going this far.

668
00:39:47,464 --> 00:39:48,757
Does Joonsu Food...

669
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:51,969
mean nothing to you?

670
00:39:53,345 --> 00:39:54,596
I'm sure there was a time...

671
00:39:55,681 --> 00:39:58,433
when this company
was important to you.

672
00:39:59,393 --> 00:40:00,602
Didn't you say...

673
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:03,355
you were like Mr. Ga once?

674
00:40:04,481 --> 00:40:06,191
Weren't you the one...

675
00:40:06,316 --> 00:40:08,944
who revived this company
when it was failing?

676
00:40:10,445 --> 00:40:14,116
Of course, it's important.
I never said it wasn't.

677
00:40:14,825 --> 00:40:16,410
In what way?

678
00:40:17,452 --> 00:40:18,954
Is it important to you...

679
00:40:19,496 --> 00:40:22,833
because you can take dirty money
through rebates?

680
00:40:22,916 --> 00:40:23,959
Or...

681
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:27,045
is it important
because you can control the stocks?

682
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:29,715
What will you do
with all that money?

683
00:40:30,924 --> 00:40:32,384
Are you going to buy the company...

684
00:40:32,843 --> 00:40:35,470
and sell it
for an even higher price?

685
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:40,976
You're quite fearless.

686
00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:44,730
You know well. You're smart.

687
00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:48,859
Does that mean...

688
00:40:50,485 --> 00:40:51,904
everything I just said is true?

689
00:40:54,156 --> 00:40:55,365
I see.

690
00:40:55,657 --> 00:40:56,867
You must be recording this.

691
00:41:04,499 --> 00:41:06,001
Give that back!

692
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,961
Darn it.

693
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,673
You're cute.

694
00:41:17,888 --> 00:41:19,890
To all my beloved employees
at Joonsu Food,

695
00:41:20,516 --> 00:41:21,725
hello.

696
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:25,354
I'm Tak Jung Eun
from Marketing and Sales.

697
00:41:27,689 --> 00:41:29,608
Today will be my last day...

698
00:41:30,692 --> 00:41:33,487
at this company.

699
00:41:35,614 --> 00:41:37,407
But before I go,

700
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:40,661
I'd like to expose
some corrupt deeds...

701
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,455
that are eating away
at this company.

702
00:41:45,582 --> 00:41:46,708
That's right.

703
00:41:48,043 --> 00:41:49,086
This is the Me Too movement.

704
00:41:53,465 --> 00:41:54,466
What?

705
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,801
Me Too?

706
00:41:56,635 --> 00:41:58,053
I'll begin now.

707
00:42:05,477 --> 00:42:07,437
On November 11, 2016,

708
00:42:08,355 --> 00:42:12,359
Mr. Gong Jae Min of Sales Team One
touched my hair...

709
00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:13,819
and said I had nice hair.

710
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:17,030
He said it smelled nice
and asked me which shampoo I used.

711
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:19,324
I told him
that I used a bar of soap.

712
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:21,702
He asked me what kind of bar soap
smelled this good,

713
00:42:21,743 --> 00:42:23,245
put his nose in my hair,

714
00:42:24,288 --> 00:42:25,414
and sniffed it.

715
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:26,540
Wait.

716
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,297
On December 27, 2016,

717
00:42:34,423 --> 00:42:35,966
I was putting on some hand cream.

718
00:42:36,508 --> 00:42:38,677
Mr. Lee Seung Joon
in the Overseas Sales...

719
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,054
asked me for some, so I did.

720
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:43,390
He said I gave him too much
and told me to take some back.

721
00:42:44,766 --> 00:42:46,768
He put some of the cream back
on my hand...

722
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,605
and rubbed my hand.

723
00:42:49,646 --> 00:42:51,815
No, no. I didn't do that.

724
00:42:52,399 --> 00:42:53,483
And then,

725
00:42:54,693 --> 00:42:57,446
on October 30, 2018,

726
00:42:59,698 --> 00:43:01,366
my time as a contract worker
had ended,

727
00:43:01,533 --> 00:43:03,702
and the company
had to give me another contract.

728
00:43:04,953 --> 00:43:07,998
Then someone called me over.

729
00:43:17,424 --> 00:43:19,801
It was Mr. Ahn Sang Jong.

730
00:43:21,803 --> 00:43:23,305
He told me...

731
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:26,391
to work a month...

732
00:43:27,142 --> 00:43:29,311
at Joonsu Frozen Goods,
a subsidiary company.

733
00:43:32,981 --> 00:43:34,024
Hey.

734
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:37,027
What is this?

735
00:43:37,236 --> 00:43:39,279
I knew he was trying
to dodge the law,

736
00:43:40,656 --> 00:43:42,366
but I obeyed him.

737
00:43:45,035 --> 00:43:46,620
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

738
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:49,498
What are you doing?
Please come on out right now!

739
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:53,043
I didn't have any time to eat...

740
00:43:53,085 --> 00:43:54,795
because I was doing
other people's work.

741
00:43:54,962 --> 00:43:56,713
I could only have gimbap.

742
00:43:57,589 --> 00:43:59,341
But the other employees said,
"I know she's a contract worker,"

743
00:43:59,508 --> 00:44:01,510
"but how could she have
the nerve to eat gimbap..."

744
00:44:01,552 --> 00:44:03,178
"when we just got criticized
by our superior?"

745
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:05,264
"That's because
the performance-based system..."

746
00:44:05,305 --> 00:44:06,390
"doesn't apply to me."

747
00:44:07,432 --> 00:44:08,725
That's what I said.

748
00:44:11,186 --> 00:44:14,606
I got used
to that kind of treatment.

749
00:44:14,648 --> 00:44:17,442
Divide them into assortments,
divisions, and administration.

750
00:44:17,484 --> 00:44:19,695
Make sure to pay more attention
to this part.

751
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,156
Sir, I'm afraid I can't do this
because it's not part...

752
00:44:23,365 --> 00:44:24,533
- of my jurisdiction.
- What?

753
00:44:24,575 --> 00:44:27,327
You can't do it?
What is she saying?

754
00:44:27,452 --> 00:44:30,080
I think she's refusing to obey us.

755
00:44:30,205 --> 00:44:32,708
Did I hear her right?
You? A contract worker?

756
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:34,209
Since I'm a contract worker,

757
00:44:35,169 --> 00:44:37,880
I don't have the right
to open the folder.

758
00:44:38,088 --> 00:44:40,007
That's why I can't do it.

759
00:44:40,215 --> 00:44:42,926
Really? I didn't know
there was such a regulation.

760
00:44:42,968 --> 00:44:45,137
I'm sure you can still do it.

761
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:46,555
Who made that regulation?

762
00:44:46,597 --> 00:44:47,723
Hello, sir.

763
00:44:47,806 --> 00:44:49,725
The company, of course. Who else?

764
00:44:51,393 --> 00:44:54,813
Since contract workers
usually leave after two years,

765
00:44:54,855 --> 00:44:57,149
the company did that
to prevent any information leaks.

766
00:44:57,191 --> 00:44:59,359
If she's working for us,
shouldn't we trust her?

767
00:45:00,402 --> 00:45:02,654
I don't care
what kind of contract she's signed.

768
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,867
But I do know
that she's the most reliable.

769
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:08,952
I get how righteous you are.

770
00:45:09,912 --> 00:45:12,080
But don't argue with me.
Do it with the higher-ups.

771
00:45:13,248 --> 00:45:14,249
I was just someone...

772
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,752
who filled in for someone else.

773
00:45:17,878 --> 00:45:19,046
They couldn't care less...

774
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,924
about disposing me
after I had done my work.

775
00:45:23,258 --> 00:45:24,510
But the person who treated me...

776
00:45:24,551 --> 00:45:26,470
like any other employee
for the first time...

777
00:45:28,138 --> 00:45:29,890
was Mr. Ga Yeol Chan.

778
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:33,685
That's right.

779
00:45:38,649 --> 00:45:39,691
Sir.

780
00:45:42,027 --> 00:45:43,111
Mr. Ga.

781
00:45:45,113 --> 00:45:46,907
To our team,

782
00:45:48,784 --> 00:45:50,452
you will be remembered...

783
00:45:51,703 --> 00:45:53,539
as the one and only
angelic superior...

784
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:55,958
and colleague...

785
00:46:05,092 --> 00:46:06,093
Also,

786
00:46:07,344 --> 00:46:09,304
let me say one more thing.

787
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,183
Yoon Soo, babe.

788
00:46:15,018 --> 00:46:16,812
No matter how much I think about it,

789
00:46:17,896 --> 00:46:19,147
I can't help but like you so much.

790
00:46:22,192 --> 00:46:23,735
- "Babe"?
- Oh, my.

791
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:25,487
- "Babe".
- "Yoon Soo, babe."

792
00:46:25,529 --> 00:46:26,613
"Babe".

793
00:47:25,547 --> 00:47:26,965
You acted as if you were
the bravest in the world.

794
00:47:27,007 --> 00:47:28,342
Why is your heart beating so fast?

795
00:47:28,383 --> 00:47:30,260
It's beating fast for you.

796
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,270
(Marketing and Sales Department)

797
00:47:41,355 --> 00:47:42,731
Ms. Tak!

798
00:47:42,773 --> 00:47:44,441
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

799
00:47:45,275 --> 00:47:48,529
- Gosh.
- Oh, my. Good for you!

800
00:47:50,822 --> 00:47:52,157
Oh, my.

801
00:47:53,075 --> 00:47:54,243
Gosh.

802
00:47:54,535 --> 00:47:55,786
Let's do this.

803
00:47:56,495 --> 00:47:58,789
- Goodness.
- Look at them.

804
00:48:00,999 --> 00:48:04,711
(Several days ago)

805
00:48:05,212 --> 00:48:08,590
If a stranger visits you
all of a sudden...

806
00:48:08,757 --> 00:48:11,468
- or if you're in any danger,
- "In any danger"?

807
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:14,096
you have to tell me.

808
00:48:19,893 --> 00:48:21,395
I can't do it.

809
00:48:22,855 --> 00:48:23,939
I'm sorry.

810
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,413
(Lee Man Sic)

811
00:48:40,455 --> 00:48:41,832
Did you record the conversation?

812
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:45,085
No, before I entered the office,

813
00:48:45,127 --> 00:48:47,212
her secretary took my phone away.

814
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:53,594
Ms. Tak.

815
00:48:53,927 --> 00:48:57,639
Do you really want to quit
working for Joonsu Food?

816
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,018
- Yes.
- Then,

817
00:49:01,351 --> 00:49:03,145
pretend that you want
to take her offer...

818
00:49:03,187 --> 00:49:04,605
and call her again.

819
00:49:05,439 --> 00:49:07,649
- What?
- Let's pretend that...

820
00:49:08,233 --> 00:49:10,652
Yeol Chan went on a power trip
and you're going to expose him.

821
00:49:12,988 --> 00:49:14,740
But don't tell anyone.

822
00:49:14,948 --> 00:49:16,533
We must fool even Yeol Chan.

823
00:49:20,412 --> 00:49:22,289
I'm certain that Ms. Koo...

824
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:24,333
will put a tail on us.

825
00:49:24,374 --> 00:49:26,793
Are you saying that I dropped you?

826
00:49:45,312 --> 00:49:46,813
Are you sure you'll be okay?

827
00:49:47,898 --> 00:49:50,025
Compared to what I had to
put up with for five years,

828
00:49:51,026 --> 00:49:52,402
this is nothing.

829
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:00,035
Thank you for everything, Mr. Ga.

830
00:50:03,872 --> 00:50:04,873
Same here.

831
00:50:05,457 --> 00:50:08,377
Thank you for everything.

832
00:50:12,923 --> 00:50:14,967
- This isn't right.
- No.

833
00:50:16,426 --> 00:50:17,594
Good job.

834
00:50:18,512 --> 00:50:19,930
Wait, hold on.

835
00:50:20,889 --> 00:50:21,932
Yes?

836
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:25,435
I passed the evaluation?

837
00:50:25,477 --> 00:50:27,104
What do you mean?

838
00:50:27,354 --> 00:50:28,939
What? Wait.

839
00:50:29,106 --> 00:50:31,567
I passed the evaluation
for the permanent position,

840
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:34,695
but she dropped me on purpose
to use me in her scheme?

841
00:50:36,321 --> 00:50:38,657
And you didn't do anything
when you knew everything?

842
00:50:39,408 --> 00:50:41,785
- This is big news.
- Okay.

843
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:47,708
- Hey, you.
- What happened? What?

844
00:50:47,749 --> 00:50:48,750
What...

845
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:50,127
Those crazy jerks!

846
00:51:06,768 --> 00:51:08,478
You made me an offer last time.

847
00:51:08,937 --> 00:51:10,230
I'll take it.

848
00:51:10,564 --> 00:51:13,066
I'll expose Ga Yeol Chan.

849
00:51:13,609 --> 00:51:14,943
I'm glad you changed your mind.

850
00:51:15,194 --> 00:51:17,446
Don't worry about getting
the permanent position now.

851
00:51:17,779 --> 00:51:20,741
Is it important to you
because you can take...

852
00:51:20,782 --> 00:51:22,451
dirty money through rebates?

853
00:51:22,492 --> 00:51:24,161
Or...

854
00:51:24,203 --> 00:51:26,205
is it important
because you can control the stocks?

855
00:51:26,413 --> 00:51:27,998
What will you do
with all that money?

856
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,209
Are you going to buy the company...

857
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:33,128
and sell it
for an even higher price?

858
00:51:34,004 --> 00:51:36,089
You're quite fearless.

859
00:51:36,131 --> 00:51:38,634
You know well. You're smart.

860
00:51:38,842 --> 00:51:41,637
Does that mean
everything I just said is true?

861
00:51:46,808 --> 00:51:48,018
(Senior Managing Director's Office)

862
00:51:57,194 --> 00:52:00,656
Is it important to you
because you can take dirty money...

863
00:52:02,282 --> 00:52:04,159
All right. Are you going...

864
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:07,162
give someone like her
the highest executive position?

865
00:52:07,204 --> 00:52:10,499
According to unofficial intelligence
I've gathered in advance,

866
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:13,418
she utilized the private equity fund
to short-sell our stocks.

867
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:14,795
She short-sold our stocks.

868
00:52:14,837 --> 00:52:18,090
Then, we have our answer.

869
00:52:20,592 --> 00:52:22,678
We should only consider
Mr. Ga Yeol Chan for the position...

870
00:52:22,845 --> 00:52:24,972
at the general shareholders'
meeting, right?

871
00:52:25,013 --> 00:52:26,390
- Right.
- Yes.

872
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,267
- Let's just do that.
- Yes.

873
00:52:28,308 --> 00:52:29,643
- We should do that.
- That solves it.

874
00:52:29,685 --> 00:52:31,395
This isn't what I expected.

875
00:52:32,187 --> 00:52:33,605
What about me?

876
00:52:34,106 --> 00:52:35,190
Me...

877
00:52:37,568 --> 00:52:38,569
- Dad!
- My gosh.

878
00:52:46,201 --> 00:52:47,286
This...

879
00:52:48,537 --> 00:52:51,790
Mr. Ga, if you have some time,
let's meet there.

880
00:52:52,624 --> 00:52:53,750
I'll wait for you.

881
00:53:09,391 --> 00:53:12,227
This really is the last time,

882
00:53:13,145 --> 00:53:15,647
so I wanted to tell you the truth.

883
00:53:17,316 --> 00:53:20,402
I called you kkondae the other day.

884
00:53:24,323 --> 00:53:25,324
Actually,

885
00:53:27,492 --> 00:53:28,785
I liked you.

886
00:53:29,661 --> 00:53:31,455
But my dad was somehow involved.

887
00:53:32,456 --> 00:53:36,251
And to me,
you were this incredible guy.

888
00:53:36,293 --> 00:53:38,754
And you live in a different world
from mine.

889
00:53:39,296 --> 00:53:40,756
So I was a bit uncomfortable.

890
00:53:45,636 --> 00:53:46,637
I can understand that.

891
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:49,139
My position even
makes me uncomfortable.

892
00:53:50,766 --> 00:53:52,684
But this is a better reason
to get dumped...

893
00:53:53,018 --> 00:53:54,019
than being called kkondae.

894
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,816
Mr. Ga, you're really cool.

895
00:54:00,108 --> 00:54:01,944
- You're not a kkondae.
- Really?

896
00:54:02,152 --> 00:54:05,155
Perhaps, a small part of you still
makes you act like a kkondae.

897
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,281
This small.

898
00:54:13,163 --> 00:54:17,167
Ms. Lee, I want you
to stay at the company.

899
00:54:17,209 --> 00:54:18,544
Gosh.

900
00:54:19,378 --> 00:54:21,338
Are you playing with me?

901
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,465
Of course, I want that too.

902
00:54:24,383 --> 00:54:27,094
The company wants to give you
another chance...

903
00:54:27,135 --> 00:54:29,054
to thank your contribution
in exposing Ms. Koo.

904
00:54:29,596 --> 00:54:31,390
- What?
- It's a contract position.

905
00:54:31,431 --> 00:54:32,516
Is that okay?

906
00:54:37,104 --> 00:54:38,438
It's a no, right?

907
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,316
No. Of course, I'll take it.

908
00:54:42,776 --> 00:54:45,195
I love our company.

909
00:54:50,826 --> 00:54:54,705
But what about my dad?

910
00:54:57,624 --> 00:54:58,834
He has an offer too.

911
00:54:59,293 --> 00:55:00,335
Really?

912
00:55:00,502 --> 00:55:02,129
- A contract position.
- A contract position.

913
00:55:02,171 --> 00:55:03,505
- 2 years.
- 2 years.

914
00:55:07,342 --> 00:55:09,511
(Joonsu Food's 2020
Extraordinary General Meeting)

915
00:55:11,597 --> 00:55:12,598
All right.

916
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,226
I would like to declare that
Mr. Ga Yeol Chan was appointed...

917
00:55:16,518 --> 00:55:19,146
for the managing
directorial position.

918
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:22,983
(Joonsu Food's 2020
Extraordinary General Meeting)

919
00:55:36,288 --> 00:55:39,041
Now, onto the second agenda.

920
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:41,376
I would like to ask
for your approval to appoint...

921
00:55:41,418 --> 00:55:44,004
Namgoong Joon Su
for Co-Managing Director.

922
00:55:47,174 --> 00:55:50,886
In order to strengthen
the capability of our company,

923
00:55:51,011 --> 00:55:53,096
I advise you to hire
another managing director...

924
00:55:53,138 --> 00:55:54,723
instead of having just one.

925
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:57,518
And as the Co-Managing Director
who will lead the company...

926
00:55:57,559 --> 00:55:58,685
with Mr. Ga,

927
00:55:59,186 --> 00:56:01,480
I would like to recommend myself,

928
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:04,024
Namgoong Joon Su, for the position.

929
00:56:04,066 --> 00:56:06,360
I agree to hire
one more managing director.

930
00:56:06,401 --> 00:56:07,486
- Okay.
- I agree.

931
00:56:07,528 --> 00:56:10,906
- I agree.
- I agree.

932
00:56:19,873 --> 00:56:22,167
(Joonsu Food's 2020
Extraordinary General Meeting)

933
00:56:22,668 --> 00:56:26,171
This was the big picture
my dad had in mind.

934
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:30,217
This is so heartwarming.

935
00:56:34,221 --> 00:56:35,597
Thank you.

936
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:08,672
I kicked out Ms. Koo and protected
the president's management rights...

937
00:57:09,882 --> 00:57:11,717
just as you wanted,

938
00:57:12,968 --> 00:57:14,344
so please let me resign.

939
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:18,140
Do you...

940
00:57:18,807 --> 00:57:20,017
have to do this?

941
00:57:22,144 --> 00:57:23,270
I just want to...

942
00:57:26,982 --> 00:57:28,317
focus on work,

943
00:57:29,484 --> 00:57:30,485

944
00:57:38,577 --> 00:57:39,578
Hey.

945
00:57:40,787 --> 00:57:44,416
Hey, a company where
good adults survive.

946
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:46,668
Why don't we try to
make that company together?

947
00:57:47,377 --> 00:57:48,420
Why? You don't like me?

948
00:57:51,256 --> 00:57:53,091
Hey, are you scared
you might get kicked out?

949
00:57:53,634 --> 00:57:56,053
I mean, it's not like
you're my dad's son.

950
00:57:56,512 --> 00:57:59,640
Isn't the co-managing director
a pretty great title?

951
00:57:59,765 --> 00:58:02,726
Do you want to kick me out
and do this alone or what?

952
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:05,771
Hey.

953
00:58:07,022 --> 00:58:08,023
Joon Su.

954
00:58:10,108 --> 00:58:11,443
Will you do a good job?

955
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:13,320
Please?

956
00:58:13,654 --> 00:58:14,655
Okay.

957
00:58:22,913 --> 00:58:23,956
I'll do a good job.

958
00:58:28,168 --> 00:58:29,503
This is great. Okay.

959
00:58:31,588 --> 00:58:33,924
Big news! I have huge news!

960
00:58:34,675 --> 00:58:36,510
- All right!
- Big news!

961
00:58:36,552 --> 00:58:37,553
- All right!
- Thanks.

962
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:39,054
- It's on me for surviving.
- Thank you.

963
00:58:39,096 --> 00:58:40,722
- My gosh.
- You all know the routine.

964
00:58:40,764 --> 00:58:42,391
- Shake it, shake it.
- Shake it, shake it.

965
00:58:42,432 --> 00:58:44,393
Seung Jin, there's no senior
who would pop the straw for you,

966
00:58:44,434 --> 00:58:46,061
- but I did.
- All right!

967
00:58:46,603 --> 00:58:47,729
- My gosh.
- You're the best.

968
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:49,022
You should have some first.

969
00:58:49,231 --> 00:58:50,274
No, let's drink it together.

970
00:58:50,315 --> 00:58:51,859
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

971
00:58:54,236 --> 00:58:55,737
- Let's drink it together.
- Okay.

972
00:58:55,863 --> 00:58:57,197
So? Do you have a date?

973
00:58:57,239 --> 00:58:58,407
- Are you two getting married?
- Come on.

974
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:00,200
- No.
- No, not yet.

975
00:59:00,242 --> 00:59:01,577
- I'm so jealous.
- No, not even "not yet".

976
00:59:01,618 --> 00:59:02,786
You should have a lot of kids.

977
00:59:02,828 --> 00:59:04,079
- Of course.
- Have triplets.

978
00:59:04,121 --> 00:59:06,415
- You should manage your health.
- Triplets?

979
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,126
- Goodness.
- My gosh, seriously?

(Report on Food Distributors
in Samshin-dong)

981
00:59:13,547 --> 00:59:14,590
Goodness.

982
00:59:14,923 --> 00:59:15,966
All right, cheers.

983
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,468
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

984
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:20,012
- My gosh.
- Thank you.

985
00:59:23,515 --> 00:59:25,225
- It's nothing big.
- Really?

986
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:27,102
- It's important.
- Get married and have kids.

987
00:59:27,144 --> 00:59:29,688
- Everyone else lives like that.
- You're right. Yes.

988
00:59:29,813 --> 00:59:30,939
When are you two getting married?

989
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:32,524
Were you lovey-dovey with Mom too?

990
00:59:34,818 --> 00:59:35,944
Goodness!

991
00:59:37,779 --> 00:59:38,780
Of course, we were.

992
01:00:14,525 --> 01:00:15,484
- Really?
- Yoon Soo.

993
01:00:15,526 --> 01:00:17,694
What do you like the most about her?

994
01:00:19,363 --> 01:00:20,405
Gosh.

995
01:00:20,656 --> 01:00:22,824
- What's your favorite feature?
- Everything.

996
01:00:22,866 --> 01:00:24,826
My gosh, Yoon Soo.

997
01:00:29,206 --> 01:00:31,959
- Yes, you're right.
- My gosh.

No way. I want to keep asking you.

(2 years later)

- What about this one?
- I liked it.

1003
01:01:00,237 --> 01:01:01,530
- Oh, okay.
- Hello?

the Ga Yeol Chan Ramyeon challenge?

1010

It's so spicy that it can't be
compared to habanero.

1011
01:01:19,464 --> 01:01:21,884
Yes, how many
would you like to pre-order?

1012
01:01:22,926 --> 01:01:23,927
That many?

1013
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:25,929
Expectant mothers, elderly, weak,
and people with health conditions...

1014
01:01:25,971 --> 01:01:28,098

- Let's see.

- It's spicier than I thought.

- Pass me some water.
- It's too spicy.

- Water.
- I need water.

1021

- I need it first.
- Give me some water.

- We should.

they failed to get a permanent job.)

1026

Gosh, old man.
You were starting to seem useful.

1027
01:02:08,263 --> 01:02:10,516
You can't leave like this, can you?
Can you leave like this? No!

1028
01:02:11,683 --> 01:02:15,437
Mr. Oh. You can't talk
with such an attitude...

1029
01:02:15,646 --> 01:02:16,939
until the very end, can you?

1030
01:02:17,272 --> 01:02:18,690
My gosh, old man.

1031
01:02:20,651 --> 01:02:23,278
Okay, then. Great work, sir.

1032
01:02:23,403 --> 01:02:25,656
If you keep working just as you did,

1033
01:02:25,781 --> 01:02:30,369
I'm sure you'll be treated like
Robert Junior in that movie.

1034

It's Robert De Niro's movie.

- Let it go in a moment like this.
- Yes, of course.

1036
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:38,418
And Tae Lee. You've done well too.

1037

Great work.

01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:45,133
Of course, Ms. Tak.

Yes, Ms. Tak.

Cheer up.

1048
01:03:11,034 --> 01:03:12,870
I'm already feeling cheerful.

1049
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:17,833
I'm already proud that I worked
for such a big-name company.

1050
01:03:19,626 --> 01:03:23,714
I also held out
working for Yeol Chan.

1051
01:03:23,964 --> 01:03:25,465
I'll be able to survive
just about anywhere.

1052
01:03:25,507 --> 01:03:27,342
Of course. You're my dad.

1053
01:03:28,218 --> 01:03:30,470
It's a piece of cake
to get a new job.

1054
01:03:30,596 --> 01:03:32,723
Of course. Let's destroy them.

1055
01:03:32,764 --> 01:03:34,474
Yes, let's destroy them.

1056

Don't be cute with me.

You're all nothing.

1059
01:03:53,243 --> 01:03:54,244
Goodness.

1060
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,373
Who are you?

1061
01:04:02,503 --> 01:04:04,713
So what's it like
to live quietly in there?

1062
01:04:04,755 --> 01:04:06,256
People say your name
decides your life.

1063
01:04:06,298 --> 01:04:08,258
Ms. Koo Ja Sook is living quietly,
like your name "Ja Sook" means.

1064
01:04:09,885 --> 01:04:11,762
That little jerk.

1065
01:04:17,392 --> 01:04:18,560
Ms. Koo, it's you, right?

1066
01:04:23,023 --> 01:04:25,567
Okay. I'll pull some strings...

1067
01:04:26,276 --> 01:04:27,569
for this special release.

1068
01:04:28,654 --> 01:04:30,781
If you have nowhere else to go,
come back and work for me.

1069
01:04:30,822 --> 01:04:31,907

Thank you.

What are you two doing?

1073
01:04:47,256 --> 01:04:49,049
Get lost, you jerk.

1074
01:04:49,883 --> 01:04:51,385
Get lost, jerk.

- Mr. Namgoong.
- Mr. Namgoong is here.

1076
01:04:58,767 --> 01:05:00,561
- Hello.
- Hello.

1077
01:05:00,602 --> 01:05:01,603
Hey.

1078
01:05:38,098 --> 01:05:40,893
Is it just Saengsaeng Food now?

1079
01:05:43,145 --> 01:05:46,398
(You have a new message.)

1080
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:50,819
Ms. Lee Tae Lee, you successfully
became Saengsaeng Food's intern.

1081
01:05:56,116 --> 01:05:57,826
Yes!

1082
01:05:58,744 --> 01:06:00,037
It's a new beginning.

1083
01:06:01,622 --> 01:06:03,749
Let's go, my bag.

1084
01:06:08,003 --> 01:06:09,880
Let's go, Lee Tae Lee.

1085
01:06:13,217 --> 01:06:14,218
Perfect.

1086
01:06:19,014 --> 01:06:20,015
What?

1087
01:06:22,142 --> 01:06:23,101
Hello?

1088
01:06:23,143 --> 01:06:26,063
Ms. Lee Tae Lee,
this is Joonsu Food.

1089
01:06:26,396 --> 01:06:28,732
We recently launched
your old product proposal,

1090
01:06:28,774 --> 01:06:32,319
"This Time, I Tried Adding
Saury to Ramyeon",

1091
01:06:32,528 --> 01:06:33,695
and it's received pretty well.

1092
01:06:33,987 --> 01:06:36,990
We'd like to offer you a job
as a contract worker once again.

1093
01:06:37,282 --> 01:06:38,951
Would you be interested?

1094
01:06:38,992 --> 01:06:39,993
What?

1095
01:06:47,084 --> 01:06:48,710
My gosh, man.

1096
01:06:50,504 --> 01:06:52,214
Extra spicy?

1097
01:06:55,175 --> 01:06:57,219
I heard your business went under.

1098
01:06:58,387 --> 01:06:59,429
Are you okay?

1099
01:07:00,722 --> 01:07:01,807
Do you think I'll be okay?

1100
01:07:02,683 --> 01:07:04,977
It says that people with
a weak stomach shouldn't eat this,

1101
01:07:05,018 --> 01:07:06,770
but they went ahead, ate it,
got gastritis,

1102
01:07:06,812 --> 01:07:08,939
and sued me over that.

1103
01:07:09,565 --> 01:07:12,150
I mean, my business went down
because of them,

1104
01:07:12,192 --> 01:07:14,778
so I'm the one who should file
a damage claim suit against them.

1105
01:07:18,365 --> 01:07:19,491
So what's your plan?

1106
01:07:20,284 --> 01:07:21,535
I'll start over.

1107
01:07:22,786 --> 01:07:24,454
I'll make something spicier.

1108
01:07:24,955 --> 01:07:26,665
Not everyone is
meant to run a business.

1109
01:07:26,707 --> 01:07:29,042
You need to
keep things under a certain level.

1110
01:07:29,084 --> 01:07:32,045
You didn't listen to others
and made it spicier and spicier.

1111
01:07:32,087 --> 01:07:34,214
I knew you'd fail
when you began to do that.

1112
01:07:34,256 --> 01:07:36,592
Hey, is this hardwood charcoal
or ramyeon?

1113
01:07:36,967 --> 01:07:40,012
Goodness, you kkondae.

1114
01:07:40,095 --> 01:07:41,054
You kkondae.

1115
01:07:41,096 --> 01:07:43,056
Kkondae? I'm not a kkondae.

(Ga Yeol Chan Ramyeon)

1117
01:07:48,228 --> 01:07:49,730
You should look for another job.

1118
01:07:49,813 --> 01:07:52,316
I'm sure many would love to have you
with your experience.

1119
01:07:52,357 --> 01:07:55,152
Don't mind my life
and mind your own career.

1120
01:07:55,444 --> 01:07:58,155
You're unemployed too.
Why are you talking about my work?

1121
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:11,418
Really?

1122
01:08:12,294 --> 01:08:13,378
I made it?

1123
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,421
What?

1124
01:08:21,845 --> 01:08:22,846
Hello?

1125
01:08:24,223 --> 01:08:25,224
What?

1126
01:08:26,642 --> 01:08:27,768

01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:17,002
My gosh.

1137
01:10:19,838 --> 01:10:21,590
My goodness, come on.

1138

1139
01:10:54,122 --> 01:10:55,749
The intern's idea?

1140
01:10:55,791 --> 01:10:56,750
I had a chicken.

1141
01:10:56,792 --> 01:10:58,460
A package of ramyeon for 39 cents.

1142
01:11:00,003 --> 01:11:01,672
It's very precious.

1143
01:11:01,713 --> 01:11:02,923
Do you know him?

1144
01:11:05,008 --> 01:11:06,844
- She's my ex-girlfriend.
- Cockroach Kong.

1145
01:11:06,885 --> 01:11:08,971
- It was canceled.
- Yes, canceled.

1146
01:11:09,972 --> 01:11:11,640
Keep looking into it.

1147
01:11:11,682 --> 01:11:12,683
I can't do this.

1148
01:11:13,976 --> 01:11:14,977
Why?

1149
01:11:15,769 --> 01:11:18,313
We all need to share.

1150
01:11:19,022 --> 01:11:21,942
Gosh, I'm not sure
if I can keep eating this.

1151
01:11:21,984 --> 01:11:23,318
They're very strong.

1152
01:11:23,819 --> 01:11:25,362
Moo Seok, we can't win. Let's run.
