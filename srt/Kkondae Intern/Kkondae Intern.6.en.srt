00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,672
(Park Hae Jin as Yeol Chan)

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,468
(Kim Eung Soo as Man Sic)

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:12,888
(Han Ji Eun as Tae Lee)

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:14,973
(Park Ki Woong as Yeol Chan,
Park Ah In as Jung Eun)

5
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,816
(Kkondae Intern)

6
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,939
I didn't know there were
so many cockroaches I couldn't see.

7
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:10,112
The staff of Cockroach Kong
exterminated everything for free.

8
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:15,033
I want to sincerely apologize
to everyone at Joonsu Food.

9
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,789
Fire that man immediately.

10
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,207
What?

11
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:23,876
Why do you ask?

12
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,211
You said Lee Man Sic
took care of that incident.

13
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,798
He totally lost his chance
to get rid of Ga Yeol Chan for good!

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,385
But he stopped our company
from serious damage...

15
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,263
Goodness, will you stop that?
Make sure you take only one side!

16
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,600
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,187
But what should I use
as the reason for his dismissal?

18
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,605
The reason for dismissal?

19
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,984
Just use whatever you can!

20
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,611
Do I have to think of everything?

21
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,821
Mr. Lee, where are you?

22
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,994
Mr. Lee!

23
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,081
- Mr. Ga.
- Get up right now!

24
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,214
My savior who came to ruin...

25
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:11,840
my life.

26
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,510
This is when I thought...

27
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,139
that this man might be...

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,391
the savior of my life...

29
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,810
who came to ruin my life.

30
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,817
- What do you want?
- I heard you ordered...

31
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,569
for Mr. Lee's dismissal.

32
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,863
Yes. Why?

33
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,283
The biggest issue for a food company
is finding foreign substances.

34
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,286
And the one who took care of that
and saved us from danger...

35
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,496
is Mr. Lee.

36
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,084
So what?

37
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,585
What do you mean?

38
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,588
If a guy like him doesn't
get to work with us, who should?

39
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,465
That's that,

40
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,175
but he also caused...

41
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:58,053
a lot of damage to us
because of that ransomware.

42
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,847
Do you think we let one thing go...

43
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,849
just because he did
something else right?

44
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,062
What if I was the one
who spread the ransomware?

45
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,649
- What?
- It was me.

46
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,528
So if you want to fire anyone,
you should fire me.

47
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,366
Okay. I'll do that.

48
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,454
But I can't dismiss you
solely on my authority.

49
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,498
You must have said so knowing that.

50
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,252
But okay. I'll make that happen.

51
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,048
Then I take this as the cancellation
of Mr. Lee's dismissal.

52
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,259
Sure.

53
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,527
I didn't think
you'd go that far for me.

54
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,612
Forget it.

55
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,698
Go to the office and clock in...

56
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,658
if you don't want to be marked off
for coming late.

57
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,956
Wait for me, Mr. Ga.

58
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,846
Mr. Ga, is there anything
you want to eat?

59
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,807
My gosh.

60
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,893
Give me some space.

61
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,229
This much?

62
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,856
More. Farther.

63
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,709
I can't believe that jerk fired me.

64
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:56,964
Do I have to survive
as a real intern now?

65
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,468
Or...

66
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,096
should I suck up to him?

67
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:08,976
Oh, gosh.

68
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,770
Why did I say I was the one
who spread the ransomware?

69
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,280
Yes.

70
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,282
Who's that?

71
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,616
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

72
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,871
Mr. Lee.

73
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,706
Sir, what happened?

74
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,332
Well...

75
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:38,005
It was a close call,
but Mr. Ga saved me.

76
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:41,383
- I knew he'd do that.
- You're the best!

77
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,677
What's this?

78
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:47,014
This is so touching.
You narrowed the generation gap.

79
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,932
That was great.

80
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,934
- Ms. Tak.
- Yes?

81
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,060
Can you survey consumer feedback...

82
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,521
on the Kimchi Broth
Spicy Chicken Ramyeon?

83
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,398
Ms. Lee, please assist her.

84
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,482
Of course.

85
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,901
I...

86
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:00,777
can do that.

87
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,112
What?

88
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,322
You will?

89
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,574
- Put your hand down.
- I'll do it.

90
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:06,700
Put your hand down.

91
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:08,869
Sure.

92
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,667
What's up with him?
Does he trust me now?

93
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,715
But the person who spread
the ransomware was Ga Yeol Chan!

94
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:22,841
Are you sure?

95
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,012
And he blamed it
on the senior intern?

96
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,348
I can't believe he did that.
It's Mr. Ga.

97
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,060
He's like that.
You're being fooled by him.

98
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,397
So wouldn't it be beneficial
for the company...

99
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,068
to fire him now, Dad?

100
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,412
So they say, the higher the stakes,
the worse your temper gets.

101
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,166
He's finally getting spiteful now.

102
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,418
I can...

103
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,630
finally give him a promotion.

104
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:03,799
What?

105
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,929
I get stuck here.

106
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:11,348
Mr. Lee, don't make graphs.

107
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,392
Just copy and paste.

108
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,853
- Aren't you going home?
- Fine. I'll work on the graph.

109
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,062
Aren't you going home?

110
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,605
Mr. Ahn.

111
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,023
- What are you doing?
- Let's see.

112
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:21,859
Hold on.

113
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,362
Is this the consumer feedback report
on the new product?

114
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,656
You did such a poor job.

115
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,367
Don't you know this goes straight
to the chairman?

116
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:32,369
We know, Mr. Ahn.

117
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:35,372
Hey! You know,
and you're going to submit this?

118
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,624
Who are you going to jeopardize?

119
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,377
Then what should we...

120
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,381
You have to make it
look more presentable!

121
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,800
Make it more presentable?

122
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,932
I'm the best at that.

123
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,309
Don't worry.

124
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,104
I'll make it presentable
for the chairman.

125
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:04,902
Sure. I knew you'd understand me.

126
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,947
Let's do better, okay?

127
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:10,449
Okay.

128
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,868
Don't let Ga Yeol Chan know.

129
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,955
If he finds out,
he'll make such a fuss.

130
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,627
- Make it presentable.
- Sure.

131
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,046
- Make it presentable.
- Bye.

132
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,090
I'll have to delete this then.

133
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,076
It turns blurry
when you click "new".

134
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,788
If you want to capture this square,

135
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,541
click and it pops up.

136
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,169
Click this floppy disk to save.

137
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,295
Type...

138
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:09,383
"comment one", and then...

139
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,676
It's easy.

140
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,724
How do you know this?

141
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,602
You just have to keep trying.

142
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:21,687
There's no other way.

143
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,897
When you keep doing it, it gets fun.

144
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,067
You should learn with me.

145
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:30,904
It's okay. I don't need to do this.

146
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,156
I'm not the same intern as you.

147
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,577
Of course, you're also an intern.

148
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,038
My gosh, who do you think you are?

149
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,083
Ok Kyung, why would you say that?

150
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,335
You're at the bottom
of the food chain,

151
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,088
so you need to climb
the ladder again.

152
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,548
Stop hoping you'll get lucky.

153
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,259
By the looks of it,

154
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,929
you'll never mature even
when you become old and crippled.

155
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,434
Keep going.

156
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,269
One more time?

157
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,271
- Do it.
- Go ahead.

158
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,940
You're basically pasting it.

159
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,735
(Kimchi Broth Spicy Chicken Ramyeon)

160
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,571
I've got no time for this.

161
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,156
Why do I need to capture this?

162
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:25,751
Fine. I might have to survive
as an intern.

163
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,302
So?

164
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,056
You saved him,
but you might get fired now?

165
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:40,599
Yes.

166
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,644
Why do you sound happy then?

167
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,730
What do you mean?

168
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,150
The president is
just waiting to fire me.

169
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,321
Why is he doing that to you?

170
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,697
You didn't do anything wrong.

171
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,324
I know.

172
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,161
I don't want his seat,
and he's causing this commotion.

173
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,708
Well...

174
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,213
Did she come again?

175
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,966
What? Who?

176
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,717
The...

177
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:18,554
The curly hair?

178
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,306
- Yes.
- It's been a while actually.

179
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:24,268
She would come every year
after she couldn't find a job...

180
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,144
and cried her heart out.

181
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,065
Maybe she got into a good company.
She's not coming here anymore.

182
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,776
I hope so.

183
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,196
- Hello.
- Welcome.

184
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:39,700
No, don't come. Go, please.
We're full.

185
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,709
Go ahead. I'll come back next time.

186
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,838
We don't have to do that...

187
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,840
anymore.

188
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,138
I can have a meal with you,

189
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,223
but not here.

190
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,020
I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Ga.

191
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,773
Wait.

192
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,400
- Bye.
- Why?

193
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,194
What's the matter?

194
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,571
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

195
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,740
Why? Was that uncomfortable?

196
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:30,584
Why is this so sweet?

197
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,262
Hey, Intern!

198
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:48,268
What? Stop. Hey, stop!

199
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,063
I'm calling you. Don't ignore me.

200
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,191
I'm the president here.

201
00:12:58,654 --> 00:13:00,072
(Namgoong Joon Su)

202
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,082
CEO?

203
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:18,090
Then it wasn't abuse of power.

204
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,050
It was domestic violence.

205
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,093
- Yes.
- I see.

206
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,929
Violence is still bad, right?

207
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,347
Aren't you going to go out with me?

208
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,475
And you didn't break up
with your girlfriend yet?

209
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,687
- No.
- I see. What a jerk.

210
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:35,649
How many girls have you gone out
with at the same time?

211
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,401
8 or 10?

212
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:41,113
Or like 15 at the same time?

213
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,447
No.

214
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,950
It wasn't that much.

215
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,451
I see.

216
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:54,001
This is called
workplace harassment.

217
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,586
Doesn't it count?

218
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,963
He probably can't get fired.

219
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:04,970
So if you break up
with all your girlfriends,

220
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,388
I'll consider it.

221
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,560
So you're telling me to break up
with all of them?

222
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:12,644
Is that it?

223
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,315
Right. That's it.
That should come first.

224
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,692
- Did you get that?
- Who are you to order me around?

225
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,570
I'm Tae Lee, Tae Lee, Lee Tae Lee.

226
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,822
Gosh. You asked me out first.

227
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:24,907
Will you date me, then?

228
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,159
No.

229
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,329
Before we even discuss
whether I will date you or not,

230
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,166
you have to be single first.
You punk.

231
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,877
And when that happens,
I'll maybe think about it.

232
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,796
That should come first. Got it?

233
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,633
- Why would I do that?
- Gosh, he's unbelievable.

234
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:46,595
You can't have multiple girlfriends
like chairs with multiple legs.

235
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,226
As you can see,

236
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:55,020
91 percent of the people...

237
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,523
are aware of the cockroach incident.

238
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,067
But only 43 percent
of the people are aware of...

239
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,277
how the incident was settled.

240
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,488
The percentage
of people's preference...

241
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,074
toward Spicy Chicken Ramyeon
went down by 38 percent.

242
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,869
And to fill in the gap,
our competitors' products...

243
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,454
are preferred more now.

244
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,915
Anyway, what will we do
with Spicy Chicken Ramyeon?

245
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,375
People seem to hate our product.

246
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,924
As it so happens, when this incident
was taking place, we released...

247
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,592
Kimchi Broth Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

248
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,428
I'm thinking of running
another promotional event.

249
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,389
Forget about an additional
promotional event.

250
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,891
Try to market our products
without spending money.

251
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,893
Make millions of people
watch our video or something.

252
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,353
I'm sure you're good at that.

253
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,814
Come on.

254
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,817
Use your brain.
Stop trying to use just money.

255
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,035
Our office was
behind the recent incident.

256
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,205
Why don't we start the campaign...

257
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:59,084
to promote our products
by buying them ourselves?

258
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,795
- Come on.
- Grocery shopping again?

259
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,630
- Grocery shopping?
- Be quiet.

260
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,508
When new products fail completely...

261
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,427
or certain products
don't sell a lot,

262
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,805
they run a campaign to encourage
employees to buy those products.

263
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,224
Is this completely necessary?

264
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,560
Whose fault is it
that we're in this situation?

265
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:19,688
Don't you know you're responsible
for damaging the company's image...

266
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,732
by turning a small incident
like this into a huge scandal?

267
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,359
Don't argue with me.
Just participate in the campaign.

268
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:28,447
Don't forget that this is
a voluntary campaign.

269
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,618
Mr. Ga, report to me the sales...

270
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,620
of the product by 5pm tomorrow.

271
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,581
Employees with the highest sales
of each department will be awarded.

272
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:40,167
So participate
in the campaign proactively.

273
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:41,460
- Okay?
- Okay.

274
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:42,669
Yes, sir.

275
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:43,879
Okay.

276
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,006
Mr. Lee, you are full of energy.

277
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,049
We can do it.

278
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,259
- We can do it.
- Darn it.

279
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,142
Can someone explain this
to the interns?

280
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,729
All right. Let me explain
this campaign to you.

281
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,022
Gosh.

282
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,818
We will set an example
to promote our own products.

283
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,112
For this campaign,
we can purchase our products.

284
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,657
It's a way to prove how devoted
we are to our company.

285
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:16,161
I'd like to say that this is
a perfect chance to do that.

286
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,539
It's very simple to participate
in this campaign.

287
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,999
Go to a big supermarket
and buy our products.

288
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,751
You can upload the photos
of the receipt and the products...

289
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:25,087
on our online campaign forum.

290
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,422
You can purchase
Spicy Chicken Ramyeon...

291
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,341
as it's not selling well
due to the recent incident.

292
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,469
But you cannot buy them
with your employee discounts.

293
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:36,139
You must shop at big chain stores
or supermarkets.

294
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:40,352
This is important. Young people
call this "flex", right?

295
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:43,939
Please keep that in mind. All right.

296
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,109
By the way, we can get employee
discounts at our own stores.

297
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,612
But why must we buy them
at big chain stores or supermarkets?

298
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:52,781
We have to get the sales up
to bring up our rank.

299
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,658
Don't you get that, you fool?

300
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,369
On top of that,
we can flex too. Okay?

301
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,747
Aren't they basically forcing us
to buy this?

Mr. Joo.

310
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,595
Are you participating
in the campaign at all?

311
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:01,266
You said it was voluntary.

312
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:04,853
Do you hear yourself? I knew it.

313
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,276
It'll be reflected
in your evaluation.

314
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,778
- What?
- If it's a voluntary campaign,

315
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,656
why would they calculate
the performance and keep track?

316
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,741
It's because this will be reflected
in your evaluation.

317
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:20,577
That's why everyone is buying
ramyeon like hotcakes.

318
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,079
With that said,

319

what does this mean to the interns?

That's right. Gosh.

323
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:32,673
Then,

324
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,677
did you tell Mr. Lee first
about this?

325

What? That it will be reflected
on your evaluation?

00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,513
No.

327
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,307
I just wanted
to let you in on a secret.

328
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,184
That's why
I called you out in private.

329
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,021
My gosh. There are no better
mentors than me out here.

330
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:49,481
Is there?

331
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:51,441
Hold on.
Now that I think about that,

332
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,528
no one except for me would tell
interns something like this.

333
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,281
Wait. Does it mean
he really bought that much...

334
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,408
out of his loyalty to the company?

335
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,541
Mr. Lee.

336
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,669
My gosh. Don't mention it.

337
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:14,131
I did it out of my loyalty
to the company.

338
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:16,675
That's not what I called you.

339
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:18,886
Are you still not done
with the consumer feedback report...

340

341
00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:22,931
Oh, right. I'm done with it.

342
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,560

How can this report
have only positive feedback?

351
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:50,751
I can easily find countless
disapproving comments online.

00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,211
I see.

353
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,297
Well, I was told
to write a report...

354
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,132
the chairman would be happy with.

355
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,759
That means...

356
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,802
you were supposed to make
the report look presentable.

357
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,930
You weren't supposed
to fabricate the feedback.

358
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,807
How can you think about
deceiving him in this day and age?

kimchi noodles this time?

I can't wait to try it.

362
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:16,735
I'm about to pass out
from anticipation.

363
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:19,238
Did you use your own ID
to leave a favorable comment?

364
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:21,615
Mr. Ga.

365
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,993
It's not that. Well,

366
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,122
Director Ahn asked us to make
a separate report for the chairman.

367
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,751
So...

368
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:37,589
this is what you did behind my back?

369
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,012
Did you accurately calculate...

370
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,764
the consumer satisfaction rate,

371
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,182
the inventory pileup, and supplies?

372
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:48,308
Well,

373
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,979
we came up with the numbers
based on the indexes.

374
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,648
- So they aren't false.
- But?

375
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,984
But as for the negative indexes,

376
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,070
we didn't include them.

377
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,364
Like what?

378
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,324
The product scored the lowest...

379
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,326
by the women in their 20s.

380
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:08,996
So that wasn't reflected
in the report.

381
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,749
What about the numbers
of likes and views?

382
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,001
Well,

383
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:17,838
I heard the chairman is particularly
interested in those numbers.

384
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,631
When the videos didn't hit
target numbers,

385
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:23,844
I have been hiking up
the views in private.

386
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,514
Then, the numbers are false.

387
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:29,183
Shouldn't we tell the chairman...

388
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:30,851
the honest feedback from
the consumers at times like this?

389
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,978
If we keep this up,

390
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,105
the taste and quality
of our products would be doomed.

391
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:36,773
But he will be blinded
by false reports...

392
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:39,735
and continue to neglect
the existing problem.

393
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,655
I'm sorry.

394
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,121
Where's the real report?
Not this fake one.

395
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,845
I will submit this myself.

396
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,188
My gosh. In that report,

397
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,732
there's a part
about the cockroach incident.

398
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:20,692
Is it okay to submit the report
with that?

399
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:24,530
What do you think? Should I tell
Director Ahn about this?

400
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,073
No.

401
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,743
Actually, I didn't feel good
about making a fake report.

402
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,787

and likes go down drastically?

What's wrong with the feedback?

408
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:44,716
It came to my attention...

409
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,009
when our products
weren't doing well,

410
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:48,637
the reports have been rigged
by using the wrong indexes.

411
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:49,721
Listen.

412
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:52,933
Why did the number of views
and likes go down drastically?

413
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:56,270
Those are the correct numbers.

414
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:58,981
No. If the videos don't hit
the target numbers,

415
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:00,482
you must make sure they do.

416
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:06,905
Hey. You still haven't come
to your senses yet.

I was glad to see you
all determined.

418
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:12,536
It's not that you're determined.
You're out of your mind!

419
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:14,872
Hey, kid.
What has gotten into you recently?

420
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:17,291
Do you want to get fired?

421
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:21,336

422
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,601
Ga Yeol Chan, how did you end up...

423
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,813
falling behind that old man?

424
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,199
How did a guy
who even killed a man...

425
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,035
turn into such a fool?

426
00:25:02,377 --> 00:25:05,380
My gosh.
You really can't take a clue.

427
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:07,841
Go push them
to make them work harder.

428
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:10,219
How is that what he meant?

429
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,138
He's telling him to do better
in marketing to raise the numbers.

430
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,183
Goodness,
it's easier said than done.

431
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,353
Make them work harder!
You know what he meant.

432
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:27,277
Is it that tough
to write a report for the chairman?

433
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,947
It's not always great
to be that ethical.

434
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,923
Mr. Ga.

435
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:50,259
What happened?

436
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,012
He told us...

437
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:58,016
to improve our marketing strategy
to reach our goal.

438
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:00,060
Goodness, I knew it.

439
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,522
Did he say anything else?

440
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:04,898
No.

441
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,527
If I had known,

442
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:11,071
we should have always been honest.

443
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:16,034
Man, I went through so much trouble
to write two reports for nothing.

444
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:24,334
Don't you think the chairman loves
everything that Mr. Ga does?

445
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,253
Let's give him a round of applause.

446
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,382
- Ms. Tak.
- Yes?

447
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:32,384
May I take a look at the upload
we'll make on social media?

448
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:33,468
Yes, of course.

449
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:37,181
They just gave it to us
right before you left.

450
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:40,267
We'll release this at 2pm.

451
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,273
You didn't confirm this
as the final version, did you?

452
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:51,737
What? Well, I... I just...

453
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:55,699
We can't increase the view count
with something like that.

454
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:01,914
Don't leave everything
up to our vendors.

455
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:06,460
Try to be more assertive.
Be more assertive.

456
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:07,586
Yes.

457
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,464
Let's do something else
other than that quiz.

458
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,299
Yes, sir.

459
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,108
- You can have this.
- Thanks.

460
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:39,368
Ms. Lee.

461
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:42,496
Why aren't you taking part
in the campaign?

462
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:44,373
What? Well...

463
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,001
Didn't they say this is voluntary?

464
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:52,047
I mean, I would buy some
if I had extra money,

465
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:54,341
but you know.

466
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,846
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

467
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:00,889
Hey, wait. Then can you...

468
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,686
take a look at the edited version
of my old product proposal...

469
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,521
and give me some feedback?

470
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,273
- Me?
- Yes.

471
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,528
I'll do it for you too.

472
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:16,488
No, I mean,

473
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,491
how do you trust me
and show me this?

474
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:21,743
What if I steal your idea?

475
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:25,414
Come on.
You wouldn't do that, Mr. Joo.

476
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,250
My gosh. We're still competitors.

477
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:30,002
Don't be so cold.

478
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:33,630
We can both work in our own style,
and we can both get the job.

479
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:35,174
We don't have to overlap.

480
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,384
We can each decide on a theme
that suits our personality,

481
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:38,635
and we can both benefit.

482
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,012
"We can both benefit"?

483
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:46,143
Ms. Lee, I've been
meaning to say this for a while.

484
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,061
I find it quite uncomfortable...

485
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:50,731
when you do something like this.

486

00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:40,737
Am I their moneylender or something?

646
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:45,659
1, 2, 3!

647
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:48,245
I have 3, but it's basically 1.

648
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:51,164
I went first.

649
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,721
(Lee Man Sic 383.5 dollars,
Marketing and Sales Team)

650
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,681
(Oh Dong Geun 99.8 dollars,
Marketing and Sales Team)

651
00:39:08,307 --> 00:39:09,349
What?

652
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:11,059
- Oh, dear.
- Lies.

653
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:12,728
Darn it.

654
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:30,704
This is tasty.

655
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:33,999
This is tasty.

656
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,876
This is tasty.

657
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:36,877
Hey.

658
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:37,920
Want some?

659
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:49,348
(Why Did We Add Mackerel
To Our Ramyeon?)

660
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:54,770
What?

661
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:58,524
Ms. Lee,

662
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:01,860
the campaign is being incorporated
in performance assessment.

663
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:04,154
It'll be a transition assessment
for us,

664
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:07,824
and I wasn't going to tell you,
but you had no clue what's going on.

665
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,247
What? I didn't think
he was like this.

666
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:22,381
Is that why they were so eager
to buy more?

667
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:26,844
Gosh, what do I do now?

668
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,287
I have no more people
to send these to.

669
00:40:57,749 --> 00:40:59,835
I can't covertly sell these
to our clients.

670
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:06,383
(1st: Lee Man Sic 383.5 dollars)

671
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:07,509
(Lee Man Sic 126 dollars,
today's purchases)

672
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:08,844
What's he doing?

673
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,346
He didn't get any reimbursement.

674
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:14,641
He bought all those,
and he's taking care of it himself?

675
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:23,317
I might...

676
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:25,861
have to survive as a real intern.

677
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,655
- Hey, there.
- Who?

678
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:31,033
It's Man Sic.

679
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:32,409
You're still around.

680
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:33,577
Of course, I am.

681
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,205
Are you selling ramyeon?

682
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:39,708
I work for a ramyeon company,
not a gimbap company.

683
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:42,711
Help me out.

684
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:45,756
This is popular these days.
Kids go crazy over them.

685
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:47,966
Really? This is too much though.

686
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:51,094
- Ma'am.
- Man Sic, you're here.

687
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:52,179
Here.

688
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,806
Kids don't eat these.
No, take them back.

689
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:58,769
My son and his friends
go crazy over these.

690
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:02,231
Add a fried egg...

691
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:04,233
- and cheese on top.
- Oh, dear.

692
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:05,984
Kids don't eat these.
Take them. I don't want them.

693
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:08,403
These are samples. Take them.

694
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,239
Is this free?

695
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,448
Yes, take them.

696
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:13,784
Okay. Thank you.

697
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:17,079
How much is this worth?

698
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,207
This is the good thing about
working for a food company.

699
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:24,920
It would have been even better
if it was a toy company.

700
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:29,258
What kind of toys do you want?

701
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:32,344
Don't buy him anything.

702
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,137
He'll get bad habits.

703
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:36,932
I'm his uncle,
so I can buy him toys.

704
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:39,852
Exactly. He doesn't have a dad,

705
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:43,272
so it would be great
if his uncle can be his dad.

706
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:47,067
You got divorced
because you couldn't handle him.

707
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:50,112
Why are you making your brother
share the burden?

708
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:51,822
He has enough on his plates.

709
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:54,616
Stop it. He's listening.

710
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:56,535
It's not a burden.

711
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:59,037
Right, Bo Ram?

712
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:00,998
Eat dinner.

713
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:09,548
Oh, my. Look at this.

714
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:18,265
Can't you throw this out?
You can afford to buy a new one.

715
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,559
It doesn't fit here. It looks tacky.

716
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:22,769
It's nice and sturdy.

717
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:24,479
Why would I throw it out?
It's a waste.

718
00:43:25,564 --> 00:43:27,900
How come nothing matches
in the house?

719
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:29,776
I can buy brand-new tables for you.

720
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:31,695
Do you think you're a big shot
now that you get a big paycheck?

721
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:33,488
Don't fool yourself.

722
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,908
A big paycheck doesn't mean
you get to save a lot.

723
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:38,285
The size of the paycheck has nothing
to do with how much you save.

724
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:42,372
Instead of living like this,
just move in with me.

725
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:45,167
Gosh. That's my point.

726
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:46,627
His place is huge.

727
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:48,879
What are we doing
in this small house?

728
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:50,172
I don't want to.

729
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:54,009
The chairman gave the place for you,
not me.

730
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:56,595
I'm worried that he might ask you
to pay him back...

731
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:59,181
when you have to move out later.

732
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:02,100
Why would he ask me
to do such a thing?

733
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:06,313
Right.

734
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:28,460
Try the Kimchi Broth Spicy Chicken
Ramyeon and take a photo!

735
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:30,879
Have you had Kimchi Broth
Spicy Chicken Ramyeon?

736
00:44:30,921 --> 00:44:32,130
You haven't?

737
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:35,217
If you eat it and take a photo,
you can get a present.

738
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:38,303
Take a photo of
your secret place and tips...

739
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:41,473
on how to endure this hot summer!

740
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:45,185
How do you expect
the view counts to go up...

741
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:48,981
with this lousy video?

742

746
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:31,190
Hello.

747
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:32,691
- Hello.
- Hi.

748
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:33,984
- Hello.
- Hi.

749
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:35,736
Hello.

750
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:38,822
Hey.

751
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:42,326
I told you to find out
who dubuabba92 is and report to me.

752
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:44,161
I still haven't heard an update yet.

753
00:45:44,203 --> 00:45:45,204
Well,

754
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:47,456
the post was taken down immediately.

755
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:49,416
And it won't cause any trouble.

756
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,211
Why don't you let it go
with your generous heart?

757
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,546
What if something happens later?

758
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:56,715
Can you guarantee that
he won't do the same thing later?

759
00:45:56,757 --> 00:46:00,552
My gosh, that sort of thing will
never happen with our team.

760
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:01,553
Don't worry.

761
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:02,638
What are you talking about?

762
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:04,723
There's a thing, you know.

763
00:46:05,474 --> 00:46:07,100
Gosh. You're unbelievable.

764
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,687
What about
the consumer feedback report?

765
00:46:10,729 --> 00:46:12,272
The chairman was asking for it.

766
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,816
I'll submit it right away.

767
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:17,861
You should know better
to give him your reports on time.

768
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:18,987
What are you up to nowadays?

769
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:22,115
Must I remind you of this too?

770
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:23,325
Mr. Ga!

771
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:26,286
My gosh.
It's way too early to get upset.

772
00:46:27,246 --> 00:46:28,247
Gosh.

773
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:37,464
Ms. Tak. Mr. Lee.

774
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:41,343
Could you redo the research
on the consumer feedback again?

775
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:42,719
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

776
00:46:46,557 --> 00:46:48,267
Is there a problem?

777
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:51,645
Just do what you did before.

778
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:55,399
Give me a nice report.

779
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,152
- Pardon?
- You know, your previous report.

780
00:47:02,656 --> 00:47:04,199
Mr. Ga.

781
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:07,327
You said we shouldn't deceive
the chairman with false information.

782
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:09,413
I was really moved by what you said.

783
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:10,622
So I decided...

784
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:12,624
to become an honest employee
of Joonsu Food.

785
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:15,043
How could you tell me to make a fake
report to deceive the chairman?

786
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:16,837
- What am I supposed to...
- Just...

787
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:23,802
do what you did before.

788
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:31,101
- Mr. Ga!
- Or do a better job with marketing.

789
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:37,399
Mr. Ga. Oh, my.

790
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:48,327
It's you, isn't it? 10chani.

791
00:47:51,663 --> 00:47:55,125
I can tell that the chairman
gave you an earful, right?

792
00:47:55,167 --> 00:47:58,378
See? It would have been much nicer
if you just submitted the report...

793
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,047
we gave you in the first place?

794
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:02,466
Did you think we did that
without giving it some thought?

795
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:05,761
Do you think all the executives
are as clean as you?

796
00:48:06,178 --> 00:48:07,513
You should listen to me...

797
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:09,223
since I've been working
at companies longer than you.

798
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:11,391
You gave us a lecture the other day.

799
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:13,560
You're just wasting our time here!

800
00:48:13,602 --> 00:48:15,479
Just do as you're told!

801
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:27,282
You punk.

802
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,874
Mr. Ga.

803
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:41,380
I'm really sorry
to tell you this.

804
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:42,756

Can you...

806
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:51,306
settle the receipts?

807
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:53,058
This is urgent for me.

808
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:56,937
If I don't pay the bill by today,
the electricity will be cut off.

809
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:02,818
I can't let that happen.

- They literally cry like this.

00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:31,388
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Hold on.

819
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:33,765
- I can't do this anymore.
- The electricity bill...

820
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,058
- is about 70 dollars.
- It's so hard, you know.

Why didn't he just say
we should use our own money?

895

He's the one who said
he'll give us our money back.

Exactly. He made us look so weird.

- I worked here for too long.

- Stop badmouthing him!
- I knew it.

908
00:54:56,922 --> 00:54:59,049
- Ms. Lee, you're crossing the line.

Fall into the pit of destruction.
Go to the underworld.

913
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:15,524
He gave me a thumb up
after he did this?

914
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:21,113
Mr. Ga may not be as good
of a person as you think he is.

915
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:23,365
No.

916
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:25,993
It can't be.

917
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:31,039
Tae Lee. Ms. Lee!

918
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:57,774
You jerk. You jerk!

919
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:09,286
What's wrong with that jerk?
Let go of her!

920
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:17,085
The company is important,

921
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,421
but my team members
are important too.

922
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:27,095
But you did this?

923
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:44,071
Everyone is probably
talking behind my back.

924

- What about this?
- Come on.

928
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:25,529
Take a good look at the ramyeon.

929
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:29,074
What? Did she just buy
Ong Ramyeon and uploaded this?

930
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:30,492
This is huge.

931
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:31,535

Wait, that lunatic!

935
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:46,425
Why can't I ever let my guard down
with at least one of them?

936
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:50,637
Darn it.

937
00:57:57,477 --> 00:57:58,937
- Hello.
- Hello.

938
00:57:59,646 --> 00:58:01,440
- Is Ms. Lee not here yet?
- Not yet.

939
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:04,860
I'm waiting to
give her a good scolding.

940
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:10,073
- I just got here.
- Look at you.

941
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:13,160
I had something to say to you,
Mr. Ga.

942
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:14,912
Are you free right now?

943
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:15,954
Yes.

944
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:20,000
(Have you gone insane?
Are you playing house?)

945
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,676
What about this?
How dare you look at me like that?

946
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:32,387
- Am I not allowed to badmouth you?
- What?

947
00:58:32,429 --> 00:58:34,389
You all talk behind my back too.

948
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:41,021
Darn it. What am I saying?

949
00:58:42,022 --> 00:58:45,734
And think about how I got in trouble
because of your ex-boyfriend.

950
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:47,986
Can't you let this off
as a cute little incident?

951
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:49,029
Cute?

952
00:58:49,071 --> 00:58:50,155
- Mr. Ga, please.
- No way.

953
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:51,240
No, it's okay.

954
00:58:51,281 --> 00:58:53,825
"Cute"? I don't think
you know what "cute" means.

955
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:55,786
- Stop it.
- Do you want to see it?

956
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:57,329
- Hey, stop.
- Do you want to see it?

957
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:59,831
Hey, wait! Wait!

958
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:01,041
The most searched word
right now is...

959

"Joonsu Food forces employees
to buy their products".

960

00:59:03,961 --> 00:59:05,212
What are you saying?

962

One second. Darn it.

00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:08,549
- No way.
- Wait.

Its Employees to Buy Their Product")

What is this?

966
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:14,596
The screenshot of
Used Goods World is here too.

967
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:16,306
I think they've been
saving up the proof.

968
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:20,394
I told you to find out who did this.

969
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:22,312
And now we're here.

970
00:59:22,354 --> 00:59:23,480
Mr. Ga.

971
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:27,401
Did you think I wouldn't know
if you made it private, Mr. Joo?

972
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,575
Get out! Get out of here!
You're done.

973
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:37,452
Get out of here, you jerk.
You're unbelievable.

974
00:59:37,536 --> 00:59:38,787
- Wait.
- What?

975
00:59:39,538 --> 00:59:41,290
Why should Mr. Joo go?

976
00:59:41,748 --> 00:59:43,125
I mean, think about it.

977
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:45,335
Isn't the company at fault
for making us do this?

978
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:47,254
If you fire him,

979
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:49,548
I'll report you for unfair dismissal
to the Labor Administration!

980
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:51,717
An intern can't get dismissed
unfairly. You stay quiet.

00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:53,051
- You, leave.
- Ms. Lee.

982

Why do you want to blow this up?

983
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,389
You think this is unfair too.

984
00:59:57,431 --> 00:59:59,850
We've always done things like this.
I can't do this as I wish!

985
00:59:59,892 --> 01:00:02,936
Shouldn't we get rid of
a bad tradition like this?

986
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:05,272
- Go talk to the president, then.
- Unbelievable.

987
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:07,399
Hey, Ga.

988
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:11,111
- "Ga"?
- You were the same too.

989
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:12,654
Ga?

990
01:00:12,738 --> 01:00:14,740
- Yes, Ga.
- Calm down.

991
01:00:14,781 --> 01:00:17,034
No, I have to talk to Ga right now.

992
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:18,744
- All right.
- Come out with me.

993
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:21,371
Is it a capital offense
to resell it on Used Goods World?

994
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:25,292
Is it okay for you to force a vendor
to buy our products?

995
01:00:28,253 --> 01:00:29,296
You.

996
01:00:30,047 --> 01:00:32,841
What are you talking about?
Hey, you.

997
01:00:32,883 --> 01:00:35,302
Taewoong Farm, Ilwon Products,
and Areum Printing House.

998
01:00:35,344 --> 01:00:38,514
You told me to get their receipt
for buying our products.

999
01:00:38,555 --> 01:00:41,391
You jerk!
What are you talking about?

You!

1001
01:00:42,768 --> 01:00:44,978
Mr. Oh, did you really do that?

1002
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:48,982
Should I report this to the Labor
Administration or the Inspection?

1003
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:52,110
Report me to whom?
The director told me to do that.

1004
01:00:52,152 --> 01:00:53,487
The director?

1005
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:00,160
- Lee Tae Lee, wait.
- Wait.

What is this?
"Have you gone insane?"

1007
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:09,044
"Are you playing house?
Do you think ramyeon is a joke?"

1008
01:01:09,086 --> 01:01:10,796
- One second.
- Ms. Tak.

- Bring it to me!

Do you know what he wrote on mine?

"Spicy Chicken Ramyeon with Eggs?
Think before you speak."

1013
01:01:21,807 --> 01:01:23,642
Do you have a brain or don't you?

1014
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:25,853
You stop talking right now!

1015
01:01:26,812 --> 01:01:29,439
Why do you keep bullying me?

1016
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:30,524
Hey!

1017
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:33,402
I didn't do that.

Hello, I've been appointed to
the Marketing and Sales as of today.

1023
01:03:00,572 --> 01:03:01,615
I'm General Manager Cha Young Seok.

1024
01:03:01,657 --> 01:03:05,202
How can you appoint him to our
department without talking to me?

1025
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:06,620
You're making me really sad.

1026
01:03:06,662 --> 01:03:09,039
Since when did you want to
see the chairman, not me?

1027
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:11,458
Ms. Lee, Mr. Joo.
Until we wait to be appointed again,

1028
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,377
we're taking a trip to Mokpo
to create a new product.

Let's show performance
instead of spacing out.

You know that
you're all in danger, right?

1032
01:03:18,674 --> 01:03:20,092
You do this too!

1033
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:21,385
Stop ordering us around.

You need to work with us.

Do you really want that?

1036

Yes, we do. Yes.
