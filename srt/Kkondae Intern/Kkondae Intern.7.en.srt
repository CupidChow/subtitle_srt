(Kkondae Intern)

6
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:01,455
Open this door immediately!

7
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:04,208
Darn it, all of you.
You can't do this to me.

8
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,210
Do you know who I am?

9
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:09,213
You'll get in huge trouble
for messing with me!

10
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:12,008
I'm the celebrity of the Seoul
Employment and Labor Administration,

11
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,552
an office under the Ministry
of Employment and Labor!

12
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:17,430
- Mr. Joo. Can you shut her mouth?
- Once I make a report...

13
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:18,639
of this occasion,

14
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:22,018
that will be
the end of your careers!

15
00:01:22,435 --> 00:01:23,978
Okay? Darn it.

16
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:28,316
Once I open up my mouth,

17
00:01:28,357 --> 00:01:31,319
- you'll be over!
- That's why she dated Park.

18
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:34,322
- Okay?
- Like attracts like.

19
00:01:40,661 --> 00:01:43,331
Wait, where's the person
who forced us to buy the products?

20
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:44,874
Why are we the only ones
who got locked up?

21
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,213
After foreign substance issue,

22
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:53,382
we were accused of forcing
our employees to buy our products.

23
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:56,177
Our stock price
dropped down by half.

24
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:57,845
The board of directors is furious...

25
00:01:57,887 --> 00:02:00,514
and is insisting on
holding an emergency meeting.

26
00:02:00,556 --> 00:02:02,600
Don't you think...

27
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:05,102
someone should get fired
over something like this?

28
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:11,150
Let's say...

29
00:02:13,486 --> 00:02:14,904
you were behind this, Mr. Ga.

30
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:25,456
Gosh, but Mr. Ahn is the one
who directed the campaign...

31
00:02:25,498 --> 00:02:27,708
The guy who gave the order
didn't do anything wrong.

32
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,335
The one who got caught is at fault.

33
00:02:29,377 --> 00:02:31,629
That's what I'm saying.

34
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:35,216
I still don't understand
what I did wrong.

35
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:38,803
I mean, think about
how we are able to make a living.

36
00:02:39,136 --> 00:02:40,513
When times are tough,

37
00:02:40,554 --> 00:02:43,432
why can't our employees buy
our own ramyeon?

38
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,768
How can they say this is unfair?

39
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:48,896
Even if I go back in time,

40
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:50,481
I will still make the same choice...

41
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:52,400
That's enough, you idiot.

42
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:54,694
- Yes, sir.
- Darn it.

43
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:58,573
So how will you punish him?

44
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:00,741
Will you make it simple
and fire him?

45
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:06,747
(Chairman Namgoong Pyo)

46
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,803
So Chairman.

47
00:03:21,554 --> 00:03:24,932
Is there another reason
for punishing Mr. Ga...

48
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:26,517
in Mr. Ahn's place?

49
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:28,894
Once he gets blamed
for someone else's fault,

50
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:31,981
he'll learn to blame others
for his fault too.

51
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:37,111
Why is he dying to
take down Ga Yeol Chan?

52
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:41,449
But if you fire him,

53
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,076
the Marketing and Sales Department
won't be able to function properly.

54
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:46,078
So what do you want me to do?

55
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,290
Joonsu Food was not aware
of the campaign.

56
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:51,959
It was Ga's decision to do so
out of his love...

57
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:53,252
- for his company.
- What is she saying about him?

58
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:54,629
The company has denied firmly...

59
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,089
that they had anything to do
with this.

60
00:03:57,214 --> 00:04:00,426
The bulletin board has been removed,

61
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:03,429
and Ga will be severely punished
for his actions.

62
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:06,641
- I am Kim Mi Ae of MBS...
- What should we do?

63
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:10,770
What will happen to Mr. Ga?
Could he be...

64
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:12,939
Watch what you say,
or you'll curse him.

65
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,107
There's no more curse left to give.

66
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:17,026
Do we need to perform
an exorcism here or something?

67
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:20,321
Don't you think we should hurry...

68
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:23,449
and request moving
to another department?

69
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,035
Where can we go?

70
00:04:26,827 --> 00:04:30,748
Why are you here?

71
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:36,170
Why are you here?

72
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:41,634
Why are you here?

73
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:44,637
(Marketing and Sales Department)

74
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:49,809
What should we do?

75
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:52,770
I have no idea.

76
00:04:53,312 --> 00:04:54,480
What should we do?

77
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,494
Mr. Cha, what brings you here?

78
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:09,662
No way.

79
00:05:10,997 --> 00:05:14,292
Hello, I've been appointed to
Marketing and Sales as of today.

80
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,211
I'm Manager Cha Young Seok.
I hope we get along.

81
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:18,296
Hello, sir.

82
00:05:31,309 --> 00:05:32,602
Darn it.

83
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:35,521
Gosh.

84
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:38,316
Open the door. Open it.

85
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,072
Mr. Ga, please come out.

86
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,992
You're ordered to wait at home.

87
00:05:48,951 --> 00:05:50,161
At home?

88
00:05:50,202 --> 00:05:53,247
Yes. An anonymous individual
complained to the Inspection Team...

89
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,124
about making you wait
in the waiting room.

90
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,208
Gosh.

91
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:57,960
What about us?

92
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:00,296
You're included as well.

93
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:02,298
So we're not fired?

94
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,676
No. Another person wrote that
it'd be an unfair dismissal...

95
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:08,679
and threatened to report it
to the Labor Administration.

96
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:10,932
What?

97
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:13,434
It wasn't me.

98
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:16,145
- Ms. Tak, you're our only hope.
- What?

99
00:06:16,187 --> 00:06:17,647
You're the only one who can save us.

100
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:20,274
Please. Please complain
to the Inspection Department.

101
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:21,525
- Okay?
- Got it.

102
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:24,570
Ms. Tak, I beg you!

103
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:27,907
(Bulletin Board)

104
00:06:32,203 --> 00:06:33,996
(Save)

105
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:40,086
- Hello.
- Hello.

106
00:06:53,182 --> 00:06:54,684
What are you doing in my chair?

107
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:56,978
Oh, Mr. Ga.

108
00:06:58,354 --> 00:06:59,355
What brings you here?

109
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:02,316
I thought you'd be
at Waiting Room Two for now.

110
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:04,694
They said we could go home.

111
00:07:05,611 --> 00:07:06,988
What about you?

112
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:08,573
I guess you haven't heard.

113
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:10,324
I was transferred
to your department.

114
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,169
They were too dirty.

115
00:07:27,383 --> 00:07:29,844
My mom bought these slippers for me.

116
00:07:37,518 --> 00:07:40,980
You should've prepared a spot
for him.

117
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:42,315
I'm fine.

118
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:46,819
I'm not fine. I'm not.

119
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:51,490
Mr. Kim, please clean your desk
for him.

120
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:52,867
Please move one seat down.

121
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:54,535
- Okay.
- Let's go.

122
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:55,578
Wait.

123
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:57,872
I'm claustrophobic,

124
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:00,458
so I can't stand being
in crowded areas.

125
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:04,629
Look at how much space there is.
You'll be fine.

126
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,340
You'll be waiting at home,

127
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:09,926
so you won't come to work anyway.
Let me use your desk.

128
00:08:11,677 --> 00:08:13,346
And when I come back?

129
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:15,348
We can worry about that then.

130
00:08:15,473 --> 00:08:18,351
Who knows? I might land a big one
in the meantime...

131
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:19,894
and become a general manager.

132
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:28,694
Why would he say such a thing?

133
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,365
Ms. Tak, how's the preparation
for the K Food business show...

134
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:35,201
which will take place in Malaysia
in two weeks going?

135
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:38,079
Why?

136
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:41,290
Mr. Ga has been preparing for that
for the past month.

137
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:43,501
Do you think
he'll be able to participate?

138
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,003
- Then who else will go?
- Who else?

139
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:48,089
Please don't misunderstand me.

140
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,592
I'm not saying
that I'll steal his work.

141
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:54,762
In case he may not be able to go,

142
00:08:54,804 --> 00:08:57,556
I'm just willing to prepare for it
on my own.

143
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,104
We have less than two weeks
until the show.

144
00:09:04,063 --> 00:09:07,024
That's more than enough time.
I just need three days.

145
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:20,788
How could you transfer Mr. Cha
to our department...

146
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,956
without telling me?

147
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:24,959
It was urgent,
so there was nothing I could do.

148
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:27,753
There was no one in charge,
so what could I do?

149
00:09:27,795 --> 00:09:29,797
But still, you should've told me...

150
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,048
Soon, the commemorative event...

151
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,509
for Joon Ramyeon's
55th anniversary will take place...

152
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:36,387
as well as the K Food business show.
Who will take care of them?

153
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:37,930
You're going to send him?

154
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:39,307
Then whom else?

155
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,063
Did the chairman agree to this?

156
00:09:50,985 --> 00:09:52,737
You're making me really sad.

157
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:56,157
Since when did you want to
see the chairman, not me?

158
00:09:56,574 --> 00:09:58,409
If I've decided to send Mr. Cha,

159
00:09:58,451 --> 00:10:00,286
shouldn't you just understand me?

160
00:10:07,877 --> 00:10:10,212
Mr. Cha, we sincerely
and passionately welcome you...

161
00:10:10,254 --> 00:10:13,341
to the Marketing
and Sales Department!

162
00:10:15,593 --> 00:10:17,386
Please say a word or two!

163
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,602
Welcome!

164
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:26,020
Okay.

165
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:32,818
- Let's just drink.
- Hey, Cha.

166
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,487
- He hung up.
- He hung up.

167
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:35,780
Let's just drink.

168
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:38,616
All right, let's do that.
Let's do well.

169
00:10:38,658 --> 00:10:39,700
All right.

170
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:42,662
So you're not going to come?

171
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:44,372
Do you think I'd go there?

172
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:48,876
Let's welcome Mr. Cha
to our department...

173
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,879
and have some beef. Shall we?

174
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:53,923
All right. It's so good.

175
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:57,426
Why, you little...
So you've already sided with him?

176
00:10:58,219 --> 00:10:59,220
My gosh.

177
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:17,905
(Come at me, world!
Fight with me, fiery chicken!)

178
00:11:33,838 --> 00:11:35,840
The more I think about it,
the more upset I get.

179
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:39,844
How could they already side
with him?

180
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:44,098
Thank you.

181
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:46,350
Go home safely.

182
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,561
Bye.

183
00:11:51,063 --> 00:11:52,106
Bye.

184
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:56,027
My gosh. What?

185
00:11:58,613 --> 00:12:00,448
- Did you not see her?
- See who?

186
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:02,116
- She's the ramyeon girl.
- Who? Where?

187
00:12:02,158 --> 00:12:03,200
The afro hair.

188
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:24,847
No. I can't let you go like this.

189
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:27,642
After all those years
looking for you...

190
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:30,561
You've transformed my life.

191
00:12:31,979 --> 00:12:33,481
You're my ramyeon muse.

192
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:41,614
I'll survive.

193
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:45,618
I'll survive and show this world...

194
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,045
that I'm still useful.

195
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:05,471
(Come at me, world!
Fight with me, fiery chicken!)

196
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:15,022
(Come at me, world!
Fight with me, fiery chicken!)

197
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,400
Welcome.

198
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:43,945
Please, one more time.

199
00:14:44,987 --> 00:14:46,530
Please help me one more time.

200
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:04,257
Hey, hear me out.

201
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,009
If Tae Lee...

202
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,053
and Yoon Soo...

203
00:15:09,345 --> 00:15:11,138
get fired,

204
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:14,267
does it mean I'll get
the permanent position?

205
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:19,480
This oldie is pretty sly, isn't he?

206
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:22,650
My gosh. You punk.

207
00:15:24,485 --> 00:15:26,320
I'm Lee Man Sic.

208
00:15:26,988 --> 00:15:29,031
My name is Man Sic.

209
00:15:31,492 --> 00:15:35,580
Where am I going?

210
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:39,333
Man Sic!

211
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:44,005
Where should I go?

212
00:15:44,046 --> 00:15:45,548
- Wrap this up for me.
- Okay.

213
00:15:52,346 --> 00:15:53,347
Let's say...

214
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:56,851
you were behind this, Mr. Ga.

215
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:59,395
The guy who gave the order
didn't do anything wrong.

216
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,315
The one who got caught is at fault.

217
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:10,072
If I've decided to send Mr. Cha,

218
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:12,241
shouldn't you just understand me?

219
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:14,785
They'll drive me out like this?

220
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:16,787
This is such a lame way to go.

221
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,798
I must do something.

222
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:56,369
Tae Lee. Yoon Soo.

223
00:16:57,119 --> 00:17:00,289
Pack a bag and come to the address
I sent you by 7am tomorrow.

224
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:02,875
Until we can get back to work,

225
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:05,586
we'll go to Mokpo
to develop a new product.

226
00:17:06,712 --> 00:17:08,506
- To develop a new product?
- To develop a new product?

227
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:10,675
Since we're suspended,

228
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,593
let's do something
instead of twiddling our thumbs.

229
00:17:13,302 --> 00:17:14,303
You know
you guys could get fired, right?

230
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:15,888
Yes.

231
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:20,851
Wait. If we make something
out of this trip,

232
00:17:20,893 --> 00:17:23,312
wouldn't this be unfavorable
for Mr. Lee?

233
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:24,438
Pardon?

234
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:26,983
I just thought
if we're going on this trip,

235
00:17:27,024 --> 00:17:28,985
we should take him too.

236
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:32,071
At least, he should get a fair shot.

237
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:36,117
Right. Actually,
he could be helpful.

238
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:38,286
Let's delay it a bit.

239
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:40,329
My gosh. He lives in a nice place.

240
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:43,416
Hello.

241
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:44,834
Hi.

242
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:46,419
What about Mr. Lee?

243
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:48,546
There he is.

244
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:51,132
Mr. Ga.

245
00:17:58,347 --> 00:17:59,640
Did Mr. Cha say something
when you said...

246
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:01,142
you were taking a few days off?

247
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:03,311
"You can just take a break forever."

248
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:05,104
That's what he said.

249
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:07,231
Well, I'll have a job
to return to, right?

250
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,736
How dare he threaten my employee?

251
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:13,613
Your employee?

252
00:18:14,614 --> 00:18:16,699
Since everyone is here,
let's get going.

253
00:18:16,741 --> 00:18:17,742
Okay.

254
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,368
Who can drive?

255
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:24,624
Is Mr. Lee the only one?

256
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:25,666
Yes.

257
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,004
I even have to drive them around.

258
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,007
Didn't you learn how to drive?
You guys are old enough.

259
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:34,425
I have a driver's license,
but I rarely drive.

260
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:36,135
I can't afford to buy a car.

261
00:18:36,177 --> 00:18:37,136
Same here.

262
00:18:37,178 --> 00:18:38,679
Why do you keep saying stuff
like that? It's lame.

263
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:40,848
You asked me why I didn't learn
to drive when I'm old enough.

264
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,475
So I just told you that
I only had a driver's license.

265
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:44,602
Okay. I got it. Forget it.

266
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:46,479
Mr. Lee, you can drive first.

267
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,064
Let's switch at a rest stop later.

268
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:49,106
Okay.

269
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:56,030
- We should be in the back, right?
- Yes.

270
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:57,490
Go home safely.

271
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,991
Okay.

272
00:19:02,954 --> 00:19:05,706
Tae Lee, what's up with your bag?

273
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,791
Pardon?

274
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,334
What about my bag?

275
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:11,337
Are you Rambo?
Is that a cartridge belt?

276
00:19:11,837 --> 00:19:15,675
Come on. Are you picking on me
for the way I dress?

277
00:19:15,716 --> 00:19:17,093
No, it's not that.

278
00:19:18,052 --> 00:19:19,553
Do you think we're going
on a trip to have fun?

279
00:19:19,595 --> 00:19:22,431
We're going on a business trip.
That's too small.

280
00:19:23,474 --> 00:19:24,725
Do you think this is a joke?

281
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:28,521
Right here!

282
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:32,942
Are you emigrating?

283
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,070
Why are her bags
either too small or big?

284
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:42,535
"Passenger..."

285
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:45,705
- You cross the straps like Rambo.
- "Terminal".

286
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:47,248
Is that trending these days?

287
00:19:47,582 --> 00:19:49,250
Does everyone wear them like that?

288
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,212
Mr. Ga.

289
00:19:53,879 --> 00:19:55,298
"Everyone"?

290
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:59,844
To be precise,
this is a style that I came up with.

291
00:20:01,137 --> 00:20:03,514
Gosh, you know nothing
about fashion.

292
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:05,641
- You know nothing about fashion.
- Someone like her can't be her.

293
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:07,268
I can't believe you called me Rambo.

294
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,979
I don't understand how
you can compare me to Rambo.

295
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:11,981
I'm going to take a nap.

296
00:20:12,106 --> 00:20:13,608
I didn't get any sleep last night.

297
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:21,574
My legs!

298
00:20:21,782 --> 00:20:23,993
(Maesong Rest Stop)

299
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:39,508
My legs!

300
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:42,595
- Gosh.
- Thank you for driving.

301
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:45,306
Hey.

302
00:20:47,558 --> 00:20:49,310
What are you stuffing
yourselves with?

303
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:53,648
Where's Mr. Ga?

304
00:20:53,898 --> 00:20:57,318
Oh, him? He said
he wanted to sleep some more.

305
00:20:57,568 --> 00:20:59,153
Really? Hey,

306
00:20:59,862 --> 00:21:03,032
is he trying to get out of driving?

307
00:21:03,449 --> 00:21:05,826
Come on, wash your hands first!

308
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:09,080
That's disgusting!

309
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:10,122
(CEO)

310
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:12,250
He's probably tired.

311
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:14,252
No way.

312
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:16,671
Where are you?
Come to my office right now.

313
00:21:17,463 --> 00:21:19,131
What is this about?

314
00:21:19,173 --> 00:21:22,301
How dare you? Don't you remember
the call you made last night?

315
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:26,180
Hey. Is that you, Namgoong?

316
00:21:27,515 --> 00:21:31,227
Don't you know who I am?
It's Man Sic!

317
00:21:32,353 --> 00:21:33,646
It's Man Sic.

318
00:21:33,688 --> 00:21:36,565
The guy you were supposed
to promote to the Vice President.

319
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:38,526
What on earth is he yapping about?

320
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:40,570
You punk!

321
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:43,823
You shouldn't be like that,
you know.

322
00:21:43,864 --> 00:21:45,700
You shouldn't use people...

323
00:21:45,741 --> 00:21:49,537
and throw them out that easily.
You punk.

324
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:51,038
- Man Sic.
- What?

325
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,209
You were the one who switched sides

Are you telling me that
you want to be on my side again?

338

You stay there. I'll be there.

339
00:22:33,247 --> 00:22:35,416
I'll go to
the Vice President's office...

340
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,918

without talking back.

it's impossible for me to...

a secret from everyone.

to develop a new product.

about every second of the trip.

You got it, right?

355

A chance, my foot.

I should keep him on just in case.

supposed to exit there.

Goodness, I was thinking about
something else for a second.

363

You can't think about
something else while you drive.

364
00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:55,413
It's because I've been
driving for five hours straight.

for five hours straight too.

If you're such a good driver,
then you can drive.

You said you'll switch with me
at the rest stop, but you didn't.

No, I put my old ones in the box.

Not only did you put
your old underwear in the box,

488
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,828
The thickness of the noodles
and texture of the noodles.

489
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:14,996
I see, okay.

490
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:16,872
You don't even know the basics.

491
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:18,791
Kkon-tern, can you lift that?

492
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:20,835
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Ta-da.

00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:27,341
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

496
00:32:27,383 --> 00:32:28,384
Sure.

497
00:32:29,552 --> 00:32:31,470
I've never had skate before.

498
00:32:31,512 --> 00:32:33,180
Find out
what their secret ingredient is...

499
00:32:33,222 --> 00:32:35,558
even if you must beg the owner.

500
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,603
Also, find out where and whom
they buy it from.

501
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:39,812
My gosh.

503
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:46,319
Observe the customers' reactions.

504
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,695
Ask them to rate it from 1 to 10...

505
00:32:47,737 --> 00:32:50,489
and which part won their hearts
the most.

506
00:32:51,324 --> 00:32:53,868
That's enough. Just stop, you punk.

507
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,370
Thanks to you,
I might get indigestion.

508
00:32:56,412 --> 00:32:59,206
You've been rambling on and on
the entire day, you punk.

509
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:01,542
Did he just call me "punk"?

510
00:33:01,584 --> 00:33:02,710
I couldn't hear him.

511
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,253
Should I order a soda?

512
00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:05,504
Sure.

513
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:07,590
Ma'am, please give us a soda.

514
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:09,300
- Please give us two.
- How about some makgeolli?

515
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:15,473
I'm so exhausted.

516
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:19,185
Goodness.

517
00:33:19,435 --> 00:33:21,228
Goodness.

518
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:25,107
Make sure your reports are done
by tomorrow morning.

519
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:26,192
What?

520
00:33:31,697 --> 00:33:35,159
Yoon Soo, please write a report
on the ramyeon...

521
00:33:35,201 --> 00:33:37,912
- with long-legged octopus.
- Okay.

522
00:33:37,954 --> 00:33:39,038
You can write
about the spicy seafood...

523
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,164
- and chicken ramyeon.
- Got it.

524
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:41,666
- I'll write about skate ramyeon.
- Okay.

525
00:33:41,707 --> 00:33:43,209
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

526
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:46,295
How spicy was the spicy seafood
and chicken ramyeon?

527
00:33:46,337 --> 00:33:48,047
Maybe it was because
of the capsaicin,

528
00:33:48,089 --> 00:33:49,507
but it was very spicy for me.

529
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,300
And you?

530
00:33:51,634 --> 00:33:54,136
It was okay for me.

531
00:33:54,178 --> 00:33:56,305
Do you think young people
would like skate ramyeon?

532
00:33:56,347 --> 00:33:57,932
Yes, it was tasty for me.

533
00:33:57,974 --> 00:34:00,893
Me too. It had this specific taste.

534
00:34:00,935 --> 00:34:03,312
- The long-legged octopus one?
- Liquid instead of a cube?

535
00:34:03,354 --> 00:34:04,981
I think that's better.

536
00:34:05,022 --> 00:34:07,942
That'll be too much.
They're expensive.

537
00:34:08,317 --> 00:34:09,694
I'm sure other companies
have tried it as well.

538
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:12,905
- We won't add the whole thing.
- Stop right there. Write first.

539
00:34:12,947 --> 00:34:14,198
- Okay.
- All right.

540
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:17,159
Are you better at making tables now?

541
00:34:20,162 --> 00:34:21,497
The lengths are exact.

542
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:23,165
It's a cakewalk.

543
00:34:23,374 --> 00:34:25,001
When did you learn everything?

544
00:34:26,002 --> 00:34:27,545
You've improved so much.

545
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:48,190
Do you think
he'll be able to participate?

546
00:34:51,277 --> 00:34:54,322
That's more than enough time.
I just need three days.

547
00:35:10,713 --> 00:35:12,340
Ms. Tak.

548
00:35:12,548 --> 00:35:15,384
Could you brief me
on how Mr. Cha is preparing...

549
00:35:15,426 --> 00:35:17,053
for the K Food business show?

550
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:22,433
He's already sent out the invites...

551
00:35:22,558 --> 00:35:26,020
and has agreed to meet
some of them that day.

552
00:35:26,187 --> 00:35:29,023
Don't tell me he won over
the buyers that I was interested in.

553
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:31,817
No, he said he wasn't interested
in such small fry.

554
00:35:33,152 --> 00:35:34,654
Then who did he contact?

555
00:35:35,071 --> 00:35:37,406
He contacted MMAG Retail
in Malaysia,

556
00:35:37,448 --> 00:35:40,409
B-Ace Mart in Thailand,
and Bing Group in Vietnam.

557
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:41,953
What do you mean?

558
00:35:41,994 --> 00:35:43,454
They're already selling
Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

559
00:35:43,496 --> 00:35:48,042
He'll be promoting Greasy Ramyeon,
not Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

560
00:35:48,292 --> 00:35:49,335
What?

561
00:35:50,962 --> 00:35:52,672
That ramyeon was discontinued
after its release,

562
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:54,090
and he'll be promoting that?

563
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:04,600
Mr. Ga must be very curious, right?

564
00:36:06,602 --> 00:36:07,603
Sorry?

565
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,689
What do you mean?

566
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:13,818
I expected that, so I emailed him...

567
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:16,988
the invitation list
and the documents.

568
00:36:17,029 --> 00:36:18,072
What?

569
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:21,826
After all, he's the head
of this department.

570
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:24,078
For now.

571
00:36:25,037 --> 00:36:26,038
"For now"?

572
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:31,460
For now

573
00:36:38,384 --> 00:36:39,802

(Business Invitation List)

575
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:48,603
This was the first time
I felt threatened by someone.

576
00:36:49,437 --> 00:36:50,396
In merely two days,

577
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:52,607
he searched up
distributors in Southeast Asia,

578
00:36:52,648 --> 00:36:53,941
got their contact information,

579
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,486
won the buyers' hearts,
and scheduled a meeting in advance.

580
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:04,493
What could he do
with that good-for-nothing ramyeon?

581
00:37:05,912 --> 00:37:08,164
Does he think this will be easy?

582
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,509
I'm done!

583
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:21,594
Me too.

584
00:37:22,678 --> 00:37:25,389
Goodness.

585
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:27,183
I'm done.

586
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:30,144
We're finally done.

587
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,647
Finally.

588
00:37:34,106 --> 00:37:35,524
- Goodness.
- It's over.

589
00:37:43,824 --> 00:37:45,826
- What?
- How could you sleep right now?

590
00:37:45,952 --> 00:37:48,871
Did we come here to have fun?
Hand in your reports.

591
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:50,831
- They're over there.
- You made me come here...

592
00:37:50,873 --> 00:37:52,458
and ask for them myself.

593
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:01,801
Why are you going that way?
Am I driving again?

594
00:38:02,385 --> 00:38:04,428
I've been planning where to go.

595
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:17,650
I'd like to catch
a whale or a shark.

596
00:38:17,692 --> 00:38:19,360
It'll take some time to cook this.

597
00:38:19,402 --> 00:38:20,444
- Okay.
- Let's put it in right away.

598
00:38:20,486 --> 00:38:21,904
1, 2...

599
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:25,032
- You look good.
- I caught one!

600
00:38:25,658 --> 00:38:27,201
Good, good.

601
00:38:27,243 --> 00:38:28,578
- Good.
- My gosh.

602
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:30,121
Here it is!

603
00:38:31,247 --> 00:38:34,083
I, Man Sic, will prepare food
for all of you.

604
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:36,377
I've caught this.

605
00:38:36,419 --> 00:38:38,379
- This isn't working.
- Why would you cut that?

606
00:38:38,421 --> 00:38:39,880
What's there to eat?

607
00:38:39,922 --> 00:38:41,257
Why are you venting at me?

608
00:38:41,549 --> 00:38:42,675
Cut the next one.

609
00:38:49,015 --> 00:38:50,516
- Here it is.
- You're good.

610
00:38:52,143 --> 00:38:54,186
It should look good.

611
00:38:56,063 --> 00:38:57,857
I put it in. It looks good.

612
00:38:57,898 --> 00:38:59,442
This one looks weak.

613
00:38:59,483 --> 00:39:01,068
- Hey!
- What?

614
00:39:01,152 --> 00:39:02,737
- What?
- Wait.

615
00:39:02,778 --> 00:39:03,946
It's a shark.

616
00:39:04,906 --> 00:39:05,990
It's a shark!

617
00:39:06,032 --> 00:39:08,117
- No way!
- What?

618
00:39:08,576 --> 00:39:10,244
- My gosh.
- It's a shark?

619
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:17,627
Why would you take that out?

620
00:39:17,668 --> 00:39:19,003
We're not here to eat hairtail.

621
00:39:19,462 --> 00:39:20,504
What?

622
00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:22,590
This is better with rice
than noodles.

623
00:39:22,632 --> 00:39:24,175
Hurry up and eat.

624
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,551
Gosh, it's hot.

625
00:39:25,927 --> 00:39:27,303
Fix how you hold your chopsticks.

626
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:28,930
If not, you won't be able
to get married.

627
00:39:28,971 --> 00:39:30,598
Don't bother me when I'm eating.

628
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,851
Stop eating. Let's hurry out.

629
00:39:34,602 --> 00:39:35,645
Let's go.

630
00:39:36,604 --> 00:39:38,981
We came all the way to a slow city,

631
00:39:39,023 --> 00:39:41,400
so why is he hurrying so much?

632
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:45,279
How long
have we been doing this for?

633
00:39:45,821 --> 00:39:48,616
You should enlarge that photo
of the squid.

634
00:39:48,658 --> 00:39:50,117
- This one?
- Yes.

635
00:39:51,535 --> 00:39:52,495
Good.

636
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:53,829
- Like this?
- Yes.

637
00:39:54,121 --> 00:39:55,831
Done. This is enough, right?

638
00:39:55,873 --> 00:39:56,874
Yes.

639
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,584
Gosh.

640
00:39:59,085 --> 00:40:01,504
I'm sure Ga Yeol Chan
is sleeping soundly right now.

641
00:40:04,465 --> 00:40:07,385
I guess he doesn't know
how long it takes to make this.

642
00:40:07,426 --> 00:40:09,303
Of course not.
He's not the one making it.

643
00:40:11,347 --> 00:40:14,475
He's not the type
to badmouth others.

644
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:15,851
You're right.

645
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:20,231
I can't take this anymore.

646
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:23,025
I need to wake up.

647
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:25,736
Gosh, I'm so exhausted.

648
00:40:30,032 --> 00:40:31,826
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

649
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:33,703
You'll be directed to voicemail.

650
00:40:44,463 --> 00:40:46,799
Yoon Soo, is something wrong?

651
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:48,509
No, it's nothing.

652
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:52,638
Oh, come on. It's something.
What is it?

653
00:40:54,307 --> 00:40:56,142
My puppy is home alone.

654
00:40:57,018 --> 00:40:59,395
What? What about his food?

655
00:41:00,229 --> 00:41:01,272
Well...

656
00:41:01,814 --> 00:41:05,276
I asked the landlord to feed him,
but she keeps forgetting.

657
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:08,821
Do you have any friends
who live nearby?

658
00:41:10,406 --> 00:41:11,407
No.

659
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:18,664
By the way, why did you do it?

660
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:22,335
You reported my unfair dismissal
to the Inspection Department.

661
00:41:22,543 --> 00:41:24,253
You didn't have to do that for me.

662
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:28,049
- That wasn't me.
- What?

663
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,802
Well, I did take part in it.

664
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:33,137
What?

665
00:41:35,723 --> 00:41:37,934
This is all that I can say for now.

666
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:45,149
I'd like to ask you
the same question.

667
00:41:45,816 --> 00:41:48,027
Why do you put up a wall
in front of me?

668
00:41:52,823 --> 00:41:55,034
Because it'll hurt to see someone
I got close to get disqualified.

669
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,954
If I get disqualified,
I'll feel hurt.

670
00:41:58,913 --> 00:42:00,373
I don't want to hurt for others
on top of that.

671
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:04,377
I don't want to invest
my time and emotions...

672
00:42:05,044 --> 00:42:06,212
in getting to know others.

673
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:19,850
How about you ask Ms. Tak for help?

674
00:42:20,977 --> 00:42:23,104
You live in Sinjin-dong, right?

675
00:42:23,145 --> 00:42:24,897
She lives there as well.

676
00:42:24,939 --> 00:42:28,568
Come on.
Do you think she'd do that for me?

677
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,800
It's okay.

678
00:42:31,571 --> 00:42:33,698
Don't get scolded.
I'll take care of it.

679
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:35,199
Why not? She could do it for you.

680
00:42:35,241 --> 00:42:38,244
Ms. Tak would scowl at me like this.

681
00:42:38,953 --> 00:42:39,996
When she looks at me like that,

682
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:42,206
- it scares me.
- Are you on a date here?

683
00:42:48,296 --> 00:42:49,755
I guess things are
still bearable for you...

684
00:42:50,298 --> 00:42:51,924
seeing how you have time
to hang out like this.

685
00:42:52,842 --> 00:42:55,428
Don't forget why I had to come
all the way down here.

686
00:42:55,803 --> 00:42:56,804
Got it?

687
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,534
Hey, Tae Lee. What is this about?
Why are you calling me this late?

688
00:43:20,286 --> 00:43:21,287
What?

689
00:43:21,787 --> 00:43:23,956
You want me to go to the intern's
house to feed the dog?

690
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:26,042
Hey!

691
00:43:27,543 --> 00:43:30,004
Ms. Tak, please help us out.

692
00:43:33,215 --> 00:43:34,717
I don't think this is right.

693
00:43:35,718 --> 00:43:36,719
It's perfect.

694
00:43:37,929 --> 00:43:39,430
She's such a weirdo.

695
00:43:39,764 --> 00:43:41,432
Gosh, I can't believe her.

696
00:43:48,272 --> 00:43:49,440
Dubu.

697
00:43:49,899 --> 00:43:50,900
Hey.

698
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:53,736
Are you Dubu? Are you?

699
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:57,073
How can a dog be
this friendly to a stranger?

700
00:43:57,365 --> 00:43:59,367
You should bark
when a stranger comes in.

701
00:44:03,746 --> 00:44:06,707
I can't believe I came here
to feed the intern's dog.

702
00:44:09,752 --> 00:44:12,463
Hey, Dubu. Let me feed you.

703
00:44:13,464 --> 00:44:15,132
Wait. Wait.

704
00:44:15,466 --> 00:44:16,467
Wait.

705
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:22,890
Were you hungry?

706
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:24,809
Slow down.

707
00:44:26,394 --> 00:44:27,395
Hey.

708
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:28,980
Hey, Dubu.

709
00:44:29,772 --> 00:44:30,773
Dubu.

710
00:44:31,482 --> 00:44:32,483
Dubu.

711
00:44:51,711 --> 00:44:53,129
I can't live like this.

712
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:57,300
Well, what's your plan then?

713
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,635
I'll stage a coup.

714
00:44:59,677 --> 00:45:01,178
- A coup d'etat?
- A coup d'etat?

715
00:45:15,651 --> 00:45:16,777
What is this about?

716
00:45:19,155 --> 00:45:20,156
You do it too.

717
00:45:21,532 --> 00:45:23,284
- What?
- You should work too!

718
00:45:23,326 --> 00:45:25,870
You should work with us
instead of ordering us around.

719
00:45:27,538 --> 00:45:29,707
Is that what you really want?

720
00:45:29,749 --> 00:45:31,042
Yes, I do.

721
00:45:34,837 --> 00:45:37,465
(Report)

722
00:45:42,428 --> 00:45:43,971
Mr. Ga. Can you look it over?

723
00:45:51,187 --> 00:45:52,480
(Needs lemon and fruit juice)

724
00:45:52,521 --> 00:45:54,315
(Main ingredient: Seafood)

725
00:45:56,317 --> 00:45:58,527
Why didn't you fill in
the secret ingredient box?

726
00:45:58,569 --> 00:46:01,072
I kept asking the owner,
but I couldn't find out.

727
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,033
You should have gotten
the secret recipe.

728
00:46:04,075 --> 00:46:05,409
This is about your attitude.

729
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:08,120
This shows that
you weren't desperate to get it.

730
00:46:08,162 --> 00:46:10,331
Would you share your secret recipe
if you were the owner?

731
00:46:10,373 --> 00:46:12,083
- Her daughter-in-law doesn't know.
- I would...

732
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:15,211
if you seemed more desperate
than my daughter-in-law.

733
00:46:16,295 --> 00:46:18,589
Darn it. Unbelievable.

734
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:26,430
Here you go.

735
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,269
Who staples a report like this?

736
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:32,311
Pardon?

737
00:46:33,229 --> 00:46:35,856
Why would you staple a report
horizontally like this?

738
00:46:35,898 --> 00:46:38,234
Don't you know it's easier to flip
pages when it's stapled diagonally?

739
00:46:38,734 --> 00:46:40,278
If it's horizontal,

740
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,697
the radius of action
is only 90 degrees.

741
00:46:42,738 --> 00:46:44,365
But if it's diagonal,

742
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:46,492
it goes up to 270 degrees.
Don't you know that?

743
00:46:46,534 --> 00:46:48,619
This is the most basic knowledge.
How could you not know?

744
00:46:48,661 --> 00:46:50,621
Stop it!

745
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:57,587
We'll just work...

746
00:46:59,797 --> 00:47:00,881
by ourselves.

747
00:47:02,466 --> 00:47:03,467
Okay.

748
00:47:04,677 --> 00:47:05,803
That's better, right?

749
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:16,897
It was refreshing, albeit brief.

750
00:47:17,023 --> 00:47:18,357
Exactly.

751
00:47:18,566 --> 00:47:22,653
You're the only person
who could scream at him...

752
00:47:23,404 --> 00:47:25,448
and tell him to work too.

753
00:47:26,657 --> 00:47:29,076
Those who lost have nothing to say.

754
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:36,626
(CEO)

755
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:43,925
I hate both of them!
I hate them both.

756
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:47,428
My gosh, I'm so sick of them.

757
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:49,263
I hate both of them.

758
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:52,099
Gosh, I'm so sick of them.

759
00:47:53,684 --> 00:47:56,228
My gosh. They are awful!

760
00:47:56,854 --> 00:47:59,482
I'm so sick of them!

761
00:48:02,485 --> 00:48:05,488
Starting today,
we'll pair up and do our research.

762
00:48:07,698 --> 00:48:09,951
This is the list of remaining
restaurants we must visit.

763
00:48:11,744 --> 00:48:13,996
For me to attend
the K-Food Business Show,

764
00:48:14,038 --> 00:48:16,249
I must be back in Seoul
by the weekend.

765
00:48:16,707 --> 00:48:18,417
I decided this
because realistically,

766
00:48:18,459 --> 00:48:20,169
it wouldn't be possible
to finish this as a group.

767
00:48:20,294 --> 00:48:21,420
That's why we're pairing up.

768
00:48:22,338 --> 00:48:24,507
Who wants to go to Manji Island
this afternoon?

769
00:48:29,845 --> 00:48:31,222
- Come here.
- Gosh.

770
00:48:32,223 --> 00:48:33,432
Let's be democratic about this.

771
00:48:33,724 --> 00:48:36,102
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Why would we do that?

772
00:48:36,727 --> 00:48:38,729
- I'll play scissors.
- Same here.

773
00:48:40,064 --> 00:48:42,108
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors!

774
00:48:44,527 --> 00:48:46,028
You really played scissors?

775
00:48:46,737 --> 00:48:47,989
- It's a pity.
- It's a pity.

776
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,031
How petty.

777
00:48:51,242 --> 00:48:52,243
Let's go.

778
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:53,911
Okay.

779
00:49:13,764 --> 00:49:14,807
- What?
- What?

780
00:49:14,849 --> 00:49:16,058
Namgoong Joon Su?

781
00:49:17,893 --> 00:49:19,437
- Hello.
- Hi.

782
00:49:20,062 --> 00:49:22,690
I came here with my friends...

783
00:49:22,898 --> 00:49:25,568
to go on a yacht.

784
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:26,986
And I saw a familiar car.

785
00:49:27,028 --> 00:49:28,946
And it turned out to be yours.

786
00:49:28,988 --> 00:49:30,406
Funny running into you here.

787
00:49:31,699 --> 00:49:34,035
- So the yacht...
- You came to go on a yacht?

788
00:49:34,076 --> 00:49:35,411
Yes, a yacht.

789
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:39,248
Do any of your friends
know how to sail?

790
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,583
- No, right?
- No.

791
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:42,293
So you don't know much about it.

792
00:49:42,335 --> 00:49:44,837
There are a lot of yachts
around here.

793
00:49:45,296 --> 00:49:46,339
That's great.

794
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,883
If you're free,
do you want to tag along?

795
00:49:48,925 --> 00:49:50,801
We don't have a car.

796
00:49:51,218 --> 00:49:52,929
This is great. You have a car.

797
00:49:53,095 --> 00:49:54,305
And we have a driver.

798
00:49:54,555 --> 00:49:55,973
- Come with us.
- No.

799
00:49:57,516 --> 00:49:58,726
- Hey.
- Join us.

800
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:06,275
Sure. Why not? I'll be your driver.

801
00:50:06,317 --> 00:50:07,693
- What?
- Score!

802
00:50:08,861 --> 00:50:09,946
Go back to Seoul.

803
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:12,782
(Schedule)

804
00:50:12,823 --> 00:50:15,326
Should we pass on the Grandma's
Ramyeon on Manji Island?

805
00:50:16,577 --> 00:50:18,329
We're tight on schedule.

806
00:50:19,622 --> 00:50:21,332
There's only one boat a day.

807
00:50:21,374 --> 00:50:23,459
What are you talking about?
You came all the way here.

808
00:50:24,252 --> 00:50:27,338
You know? Just go in there
and finish a bowl of ramyeon.

809
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,715
Get out before the last boat leaves.
A day will be enough.

810
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,220
Just leave the restaurants on land
to me.

811
00:50:34,262 --> 00:50:36,055
Don't worry. Just go and come back.

812
00:50:37,431 --> 00:50:38,432
Go.

813
00:50:41,352 --> 00:50:43,145
Hey, I should go now
if I plan on going, right?

814
00:50:43,187 --> 00:50:44,522
We don't know
when the next boat will run.

815
00:50:44,563 --> 00:50:45,690
Right.

816
00:50:46,607 --> 00:50:48,985
Wait. What are you talking about?

817
00:50:49,026 --> 00:50:50,027
What?

818
00:50:50,278 --> 00:50:52,863
You just said you don't know
when the next boat will sail.

819
00:50:52,905 --> 00:50:56,617
Oh, that? They issued
a high seas warning for tonight.

820
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:59,078
They said it'd be
over sometime next week.

821
00:50:59,704 --> 00:51:01,998
But the waves seem so calm here.

822
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:04,458
Exactly. My goodness.

823
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,835
It must be a huge one...

824
00:51:05,876 --> 00:51:08,129
seeing how calm the water is now.
Darn it.

825
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,213
Exactly.

826
00:51:13,009 --> 00:51:14,010
Then,

827
00:51:14,885 --> 00:51:17,597
if you sail out now, you won't know
when you'd get back, right?

828
00:51:17,638 --> 00:51:19,599
- Who would know that?
- No one would know.

829
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,891
There won't be any boats.

830
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:22,059
No boats?

831
00:51:22,768 --> 00:51:24,103
Are you happy?

832
00:51:27,523 --> 00:51:30,234
(Sunhwa Tourism)

833
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:35,239
Have a safe trip!

834
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:39,535
Go!

835
00:51:41,954 --> 00:51:45,207
Bye! See you later!

836
00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:47,501
Bye!

837
00:51:59,597 --> 00:52:01,057
- Hello?
- Mr. Ga.

838
00:52:02,934 --> 00:52:04,727
You're no longer suspended.

839
00:52:05,353 --> 00:52:07,438
Stop your little trip
and come back to work.

840
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,481
What?

841
00:52:09,148 --> 00:52:10,149
Really?

842
00:52:14,028 --> 00:52:15,071
I can...

843
00:52:16,072 --> 00:52:17,073
go back to work.

844
00:52:17,406 --> 00:52:20,576
You'll be able to go to Malaysia.

845
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:23,454
Yes.

846
00:52:23,788 --> 00:52:26,123
Let's go and have
Grandma's Ramyeon quickly.

847
00:52:26,165 --> 00:52:27,333
And let's head back to Seoul.

848
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:28,584
Sure.

849
00:52:45,685 --> 00:52:46,686
It's right here.

850
00:52:47,228 --> 00:52:48,854
- Ma'am.
- Hello.

851
00:52:48,896 --> 00:52:50,856
Hello. My goodness.

852
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:51,899
We came to get some ramyeon.

853
00:52:51,941 --> 00:52:53,818
Goodness, I'm glad you're here.

854
00:52:55,069 --> 00:52:57,446
All right, then.
What would you like?

855
00:52:57,488 --> 00:52:58,614
Grandma's Ramyeon, please.

856
00:52:58,656 --> 00:53:00,408
- Grandma's Ramyeon it is.
- Yes.

857
00:53:01,701 --> 00:53:03,452
Any drinks?

858
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:04,996
We have to get on the last ship.

859
00:53:05,955 --> 00:53:07,748
The last ship?

860
00:53:10,293 --> 00:53:14,297
Goodness, here's Grandma's Ramyeon.

861
00:53:15,464 --> 00:53:16,591
How do I turn this on?

862
00:53:16,632 --> 00:53:19,635
- This is very rare.
- I see.

863
00:53:19,677 --> 00:53:21,887
You've never seen
anything like this, have you?

864
00:53:21,929 --> 00:53:23,222
- It's that, isn't it?
- I cleaned...

865
00:53:23,264 --> 00:53:25,141
all these rockfish,

866
00:53:25,182 --> 00:53:28,519
put them out to dry them,
and threw them in here.

867
00:53:30,187 --> 00:53:32,023
Why are you taking so many pictures?

868
00:53:32,565 --> 00:53:36,110
Oh, you're from KBC Station
in Seoul.

869
00:53:36,152 --> 00:53:37,236
No.

870
00:53:37,278 --> 00:53:39,405
He looks pretty like that actor,

871
00:53:39,447 --> 00:53:40,740
- Choi Soo Jong.
- No, we aren't.

872
00:53:40,781 --> 00:53:42,116
Can you give us water?

873
00:53:42,158 --> 00:53:43,951
Give me an autograph before you go.

874
00:53:43,993 --> 00:53:45,161
Give us some water.

875
00:53:45,202 --> 00:53:47,914
- And this is...
- I'm Man Sic. Okay, granny.

876
00:53:47,955 --> 00:53:49,498
- Water. Bring us water.
- Goodness.

877
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:50,625
Thank you.

878
00:53:51,334 --> 00:53:53,753
This looks absolutely amazing.

879
00:54:07,558 --> 00:54:08,809
Try some. Try.

880
00:54:08,851 --> 00:54:10,019
Gosh, kid.

881
00:54:13,648 --> 00:54:15,858
- Just taste the dish.
- You always have to write it down.

882
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,276
- Feel it first.
- First, middle, and last taste.

883
00:54:17,318 --> 00:54:18,444
Write it down on your tongue.

884
00:54:18,861 --> 00:54:22,615
If we turn rockfish into powder,
we can definitely add this.

885
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,086
We still have some time, right?

886
00:54:36,003 --> 00:54:37,046
We do.

887
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:40,341
My gosh.

888
00:54:40,883 --> 00:54:43,427
You finished everything
while I went to get some water.

889
00:54:43,469 --> 00:54:45,096
- That was great.
- That was delicious.

890
00:54:45,137 --> 00:54:47,056
- Wasn't it good?
- Yes.

891
00:54:47,098 --> 00:54:48,683
- We'll pay.
- It's 30 dollars.

892
00:54:48,724 --> 00:54:49,725
That was the best.

893
00:54:51,143 --> 00:54:54,230
Wow, you're handing me
a credit card?

894
00:54:54,272 --> 00:54:58,234
I guess someone who's crazy took
a credit card on this tiny island.

895
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,611
That cat again!

896
00:55:00,903 --> 00:55:04,365
That darned thing
ate all of my rockfish.

897
00:55:04,407 --> 00:55:05,616
I won't let you do that.

898
00:55:05,825 --> 00:55:07,076
So 30 dollars, right?

899
00:55:07,118 --> 00:55:09,745
- Yes, 30 dollars.
- Yes, thank you.

900
00:55:09,912 --> 00:55:12,540
- Go home safely.
- Thank you.

901
00:55:13,124 --> 00:55:14,125
Hey!

902
00:55:14,959 --> 00:55:16,627
Let's go. We have to hurry.

903
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,338
- Thank you for the ramyeon.
- Thank you!

904
00:55:19,422 --> 00:55:21,507
Sure, goodbye. Bye.

905
00:55:24,135 --> 00:55:26,512
- Go home safely!
- Yes, thank you.

906
00:55:26,596 --> 00:55:28,764
- Come and visit again!
- Okay!

907
00:55:30,308 --> 00:55:31,392
Tie it tightly.

908
00:55:32,435 --> 00:55:34,353
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.

909
00:55:34,729 --> 00:55:36,939
It's way past the schedule.
Why isn't the ship coming in?

910
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,399
It was canceled.

911
00:55:38,441 --> 00:55:40,651
Yes, canceled. Canceled.

912
00:55:42,778 --> 00:55:45,156
Then the next one.
When will the next ship come in?

913
00:55:45,197 --> 00:55:47,617
You can't ask us when it'll come in.

914
00:55:47,658 --> 00:55:49,660
- You need to ask up above.
- You're right.

915
00:55:51,746 --> 00:55:54,540
Come on. There will be
a ship coming in tomorrow, right?

916
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:57,001
Tomorrow?

917
00:55:57,501 --> 00:55:58,878
We'll have to see tomorrow.

918
00:55:59,337 --> 00:56:00,463
We have no idea.

919
00:56:00,963 --> 00:56:02,006
Not at all.

920
00:56:04,675 --> 00:56:07,178
The sea will calm down
by the weekend, right?

921
00:56:08,095 --> 00:56:09,847
We have to leave
on the weekend at the latest.

922
00:56:10,139 --> 00:56:12,725
You didn't check the weather
before you came onto an island?

923
00:56:12,767 --> 00:56:15,728
A high seas warning was issued
until next week.

924
00:56:15,853 --> 00:56:17,855
- The wind wave.
- That's right.

925
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:19,398
I don't think
they know what that is.

926
00:56:20,858 --> 00:56:21,859
- Goodness.
- Right.

927
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:24,278
A helicopter.
Can a helicopter come in?

928
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,365
Hey, you can' t use a helicopter
as you wish.

929
00:56:27,406 --> 00:56:28,908
That's all our tax money.

930
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,159
Yes, that's our tax money.

931
00:56:30,201 --> 00:56:33,871
Then could you sail this boat
right now?

932
00:56:34,497 --> 00:56:36,666
Of course, we can set sail,

933
00:56:36,707 --> 00:56:37,833
but we'll all die.

934
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:40,586
We can take off,
but our destination is death.

935
00:56:41,879 --> 00:56:44,298
- To death?
- Hop in if you want to see death.

936
00:56:44,423 --> 00:56:47,260
We couldn't go out
for a year last year.

937
00:56:47,301 --> 00:56:49,470
- Stop saying things like that.
- Goodness.

938
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,846
Do you see this?

939
00:56:50,888 --> 00:56:53,349
- Look at the map. That's the dock.
- Okay.

940
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:55,476
That's Mr. Park's place.
And this is this place.

941
00:56:55,518 --> 00:56:56,477
This place?

942
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:58,521
And Mr. Kim's place is over here.

943
00:56:58,562 --> 00:56:59,897
It's over here.

944
00:56:59,939 --> 00:57:01,232
So this house is...

945
00:57:03,192 --> 00:57:05,236
Darn it! Why did you lose that?

946
00:57:05,278 --> 00:57:06,821
- That's...
- I can't believe your luck.

947
00:57:06,862 --> 00:57:09,115
- That's the house...
- Let's go. It's over there.

948
00:57:09,865 --> 00:57:10,825
That way.

949
00:57:10,866 --> 00:57:13,077
- No, it can't happen.
- Captain.

950
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,706
We have to leave by the weekend
no matter what happens.

951
00:57:16,747 --> 00:57:18,374
- Goodness.
- We missed the last ship.

952
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:20,334
- I can't do that.
- Please save us.

953
00:57:20,751 --> 00:57:24,255
I'll die if he dies. I'll die too.

954
00:57:24,297 --> 00:57:27,466
I'll... I'll pay you
as much as you want.

955
00:57:27,508 --> 00:57:30,261
Please. Please save my life!

956
00:57:30,303 --> 00:57:33,014
No, we can't go.
You won't live if you leave now.

957
00:57:33,055 --> 00:57:34,599
You'll die in the sea!

958
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,017
No, we have to go.

959
00:57:36,058 --> 00:57:37,977
Even if you paid us billions,

960
00:57:38,019 --> 00:57:40,271
no one will want to set sail
to their death.

961
00:57:40,313 --> 00:57:42,440
We have to go sell ramyeon.

962
00:57:42,481 --> 00:57:43,899
- Please help us just once.
- You can't go!

963
00:57:43,941 --> 00:57:45,651
You can try to take off.

964
00:57:45,693 --> 00:57:47,528
- Let me go.
- Please come with us.

965
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:48,905
- Captain!
- No, let me go.

966
00:57:48,946 --> 00:57:50,323
- Let me go.
- Just this once.

967
00:57:50,364 --> 00:57:53,326
- Captain!
- I can't believe him.

968
00:57:53,951 --> 00:57:57,455
Just this once!

969
00:57:59,081 --> 00:58:01,167
Captain!

970
00:58:04,754 --> 00:58:05,755
Hey.

971
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,384
- Hey, It's open.
- Over there.

972
00:58:12,053 --> 00:58:14,722
I can't accept credit cards.

973
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,192
Mr. Lee, cash. Do you have any cash?

974
00:58:28,819 --> 00:58:30,112
Sir, well...

975
00:58:31,364 --> 00:58:33,950
Could we transfer the amount
to your bank account?

976
00:58:34,867 --> 00:58:38,996
Where's the nearest ATM?

977
00:58:39,038 --> 00:58:41,958
If you go down that way,

978
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:44,961
you'll find a machine
in the Fisheries Cooperative,

979
00:58:45,002 --> 00:58:46,254
but my goodness,

980
00:58:46,462 --> 00:58:49,131
someone got drunk and broke it
two days ago.

981
00:58:49,173 --> 00:58:52,051
You can try going there, though.

982
00:58:52,093 --> 00:58:54,470
I'm not sure if you can
stick a card in there.

983
00:58:54,512 --> 00:58:57,473
You should try to flatten it out
and stick it in.

984
00:59:05,064 --> 00:59:06,065
Darn it.

985
00:59:12,488 --> 00:59:15,157
We're sorry. There is
no service in this location.

986
00:59:20,454 --> 00:59:22,790
(No service)

987
00:59:27,295 --> 00:59:28,421
No signals?

988
00:59:28,879 --> 00:59:29,880
Nothing.

989
00:59:36,762 --> 00:59:38,514
Do you have any food?

990
00:59:39,682 --> 00:59:40,850
Let me check.

991
00:59:45,605 --> 00:59:47,857
Man, what's with my phone?

992
00:59:49,233 --> 00:59:50,276
Mr. Ga!

993
00:59:51,193 --> 00:59:52,695
Bun, bun, bun.

994
00:59:52,737 --> 00:59:53,779
Hey!

995
01:00:03,623 --> 01:00:05,958
My bun, bun, bun...

996
01:00:11,047 --> 01:00:12,214
Bun, bun, bun.

997
01:00:22,975 --> 01:00:24,226
Let's clean it off.

998
01:00:31,442 --> 01:00:32,485
Goodness.

999
01:00:33,361 --> 01:00:35,571
- You need to peel it more.
- More?

1000
01:00:35,613 --> 01:00:36,656
Let me see.

1001
01:00:44,247 --> 01:00:45,581
That's good enough.

1002
01:00:49,126 --> 01:00:50,127
Hey.

1003
01:00:52,171 --> 01:00:53,339
That's a helicopter, right?

1004
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:57,343
Hey, a helicopter.
That's a helicopter!

1005
01:00:59,762 --> 01:01:01,806
Over here! Help us!

1006
01:01:03,766 --> 01:01:05,393
Over here!

1007
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:10,231
S-O-S!

1008
01:01:10,982 --> 01:01:14,110
S-O-S!

1009
01:01:14,485 --> 01:01:17,780
- S-O-S!
- S-O-S!

1010
01:01:17,989 --> 01:01:21,075
- S-O-S!
- S-O-S!

1011
01:01:21,158 --> 01:01:23,828
- S-O-S!
- S-O-S!

1012
01:01:23,869 --> 01:01:25,079
They saw us.

1013
01:01:25,997 --> 01:01:29,041
- S-O-S!
- S-O-S!

1014

1015
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,029
Where's Mr. Cha?
Is he not back from Malaysia yet?

1016
01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:59,530
- Mr. Ga.
- You're way too casual.

1017
01:01:59,572 --> 01:02:01,115
- You haven't heard.
- I hate this.

1018
01:02:01,157 --> 01:02:02,867
- Why do you do this to me?
- What?

1019
01:02:02,909 --> 01:02:04,285
I can do worse things.

1020
01:02:04,327 --> 01:02:05,912
How dare you look at me like that?

1021
01:02:05,953 --> 01:02:06,996
Get out.

1022
01:02:08,205 --> 01:02:10,583
I don't think I can taste
the key ingredient.

1023
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:12,168
When you made Spicy Chicken Ramyeon,

1024
01:02:12,209 --> 01:02:13,753
I could feel the spicy chicken
as soon as I had a bite.

1025
01:02:13,794 --> 01:02:16,380
It's nowhere good enough
compared to Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

1026
01:02:18,049 --> 01:02:20,801
Mr. Ga, what's wrong?
Hey, what's going on?

1027
01:02:31,812 --> 01:02:36,234
