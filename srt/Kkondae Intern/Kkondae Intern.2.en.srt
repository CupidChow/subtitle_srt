I see. Ssukussuku in Indonesia?

11
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:43,555
Yes, I'm a guy who has had
quite a lot of ramyeon in Indonesia.

12
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:44,890
Indonesia is big on ramyeon,

recording the second place
in the world ramyeon consumption.

12.5 billion ramyeon in a year.

- Ms. Lee?
- Yes?

Why is your hair dyed in that color?

29
00:01:38,611 --> 00:01:40,321
Don't you know what ombre hair is?

30

This is the hottest style right now.

31
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,118
I believe people who make food...

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,162
should be sensitive about trends.

33
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:51,124

call out a man

Are you telling me
to become a traitor?

73
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:03,423
You're hardly a traitor.

74
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:06,551
Your country abandoned you first.

75
00:04:07,218 --> 00:04:08,511
Once your country abandons you,

76
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:10,346
you abandon your country too.

copied everything we made!

- Hey, man!
- What? We didn't copy anything.

81

copied everything you made!

83
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:40,668

why did you copy...

how much you people try to copy it,

86
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,343
you can't recreate that flavor.

can think of jjambbong ramyeon.

92
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:05,735
Is that why you copied ours?

93
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:07,570
- What?
- You copied Jjapaguri...

94
00:05:07,612 --> 00:05:09,614
and made Dripping Chunjang.

95
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:12,659
You jerk. Are you all finished?

96
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:15,161
Yes, so what? I'm all done.

97
00:05:15,286 --> 00:05:18,456
You make something ridiculous
like Dripping Chunjang.

this Lee Man Sic?

99
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:26,131
I wouldn't work there
even if I was a board member!

100

What? An internship?

102
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:33,179
Go play badminton, you jerk.

103
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:34,264
Intern, badminton?

104
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:36,975
Internship, my foot.

every single product we made.

108

109
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:50,739
Hey, man. Come here.

110
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,960
It's not just an internship.

111
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:05,920
It's a pre-employment internship.

112
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:07,756
Call me if you change your mind.

113
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,692
How long have you been working here?

114
00:06:29,277 --> 00:06:31,363
About three years now.

115
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:33,365
Over the last three years,

116
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:36,659
did you ever think
that you work for...

117
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,495
such a great company?

118
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,375
No, I often thought
that I work for...

119
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,668
such an awful company.

120
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:50,298
Back when I worked for
my old company,

121
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:52,926
it'd get steaming hot outside,

122
00:06:53,843 --> 00:06:56,971
but I'd sit in my office with
the air conditioner blowing on max.

123
00:06:57,514 --> 00:07:01,810
That was one time
when I had a thought...

124
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:04,312
I work for a great company.

125

128
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:14,030
- Guards!
- Darn it.

129
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:15,073
- Guards!
- We should go.

130
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:16,324
You don't see him, do you?

131
00:07:16,366 --> 00:07:19,786
See? I'm working for
such an awful company.

132
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:22,664
- Guards!
- We're running late.

133
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:24,207

- Goodness.

You're...

- I can work somewhere else.
- Man Sic, don't go anywhere.

to work for that kid?

within your boundaries?

I was complimented for once
by our chairman...

167
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,809
after I suggested we implement
a senior internship.

168
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,897
So it doesn't matter
even if this is you.

169
00:09:53,732 --> 00:09:55,108
I can't call this off.

170
00:09:57,777 --> 00:10:00,697
Then I'll have to understand.

171
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:05,410
You shouldn't be focused
on saving face.

172
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:09,330
I heard you spent
all your severance pay...

173
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:11,416
on your ill parent.

174
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:16,713
You won't be an intern forever.

175
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:19,466
You know that our company
has a high percentage...

176
00:10:19,507 --> 00:10:21,051
of turning contract workers
into full-time employees.

177
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,183
I work directly under the CEO.

178
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:30,101
I'll help you.

179
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:32,687
Why?

180
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:36,024
Why are you doing this?

181
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:37,942
Because I'm afraid.

182
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:45,033
As long as he's here,
I won't be able to get a promotion.

183
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:51,289
Let's oust Yeol Chan
and climb up the ladder together.

184
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:53,291
What do you say, Man Sic?

185
00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:58,630
Hey, is he that powerful?

186
00:10:59,422 --> 00:11:01,591
I don't know what he did,

187
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:03,051
but the chairman dotes on him.

188
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:05,053
Rumors say that not only
did he give him a house and a car,

189
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:06,971
but also some of his stocks.

190
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:10,558
How did he become so successful?

191
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,191
The CEO would like to see you soon.

192
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:31,538
You haven't quit your job?

193
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:34,290
How dare you join us? How dare you?

194
00:11:34,332 --> 00:11:36,209
Hey, get rid of that thing.

195
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:39,546
That useless idiot.
Why did you call him here?

196
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:41,214
Who called him?

197
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,759
Hey, did you call him?
Why would you?

198
00:11:57,272 --> 00:11:59,357
What year were you guys born in?

199
00:12:00,984 --> 00:12:02,652
I was born in 1993.

200
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:03,778
I was born in 1992.

201
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,863
I see.

202
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:07,741
Since you guys are younger than me,
I'll speak casually.

203
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:09,659
- Okay.
- Okay.

204
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:11,161
I'm not trying to intimidate you.

205
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:13,496
It's just more convenient
when teaching things to my juniors.

206
00:12:13,872 --> 00:12:16,082
By the way,
what year were you born in?

207
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,876
Why would you ask that?

208
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:19,461
I was born in 1992.

209
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:20,587
- Sorry?
- What?

210
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:21,796
- Sorry?
- What?

211
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:24,841
I was born
near the beginning of 1992.

212
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:27,719
He was born in 1992?

213
00:12:30,346 --> 00:12:33,475
By the way,
may I ask you your age?

214
00:12:35,977 --> 00:12:39,147
People live up to 100 years
these days. I'm still young.

215
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:40,357
You don't have to be
so formal with me.

216
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:42,108
Just call me sir.

217
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:44,194
Right.

218
00:12:45,153 --> 00:12:48,531
How should I address you?

219
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:50,784
How should we address you?

220
00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:53,161
Intern Lee? Sir?

221
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:54,204
Mr. Lee Man Sic.

222
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,877
That's his name.
How else should we call him?

223
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:09,386
You're right.
It's his name, all right.

224
00:13:09,427 --> 00:13:11,554
But why do I feel so uncomfortable?

225
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:13,014
Goodness.

226
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:16,017
I'll only feel uncomfortable
if you think that way.

227
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:19,020
Please treat me the same way
you'd treat them.

228
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:22,065
This is my motto.
"Be an adult, not a kkondae."

229
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:23,900
You're not old-fashioned at all.

230
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:27,737
I really enjoyed that movie
starring Robert Downey, Jr.

231
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,239
- That's Robert De Niro.
- By the way,

232
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,991
how do you and Mr. Ga
know each other?

233
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:38,915
Us?

234
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,923
He said I looked exactly
like someone he knew.

235
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:55,765
(Ga Yeol Chan)

236
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,560
I need to speak with you
on the rooftop.

237
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:15,702
It's you, right, Yeol Chan?

238
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:20,957
You've changed so much.

239
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:23,251
I wouldn't have recognized you
while passing by.

240
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:25,336
By the way,

241
00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:28,923
shouldn't I take some credit
for your Spicy Chicken Ramyeon?

242
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,135
It's obvious that you got that
from my Fiery Squid Ramyeon.

243
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:36,056
You haven't changed one bit.

244
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:38,183
Is that so?

245
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:42,062
How are you here as a senior intern?

246
00:14:42,312 --> 00:14:46,649
Well, after retiring,
I wasn't happy with my life.

247
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:48,068
Why did you leave Ongol?

248
00:14:49,444 --> 00:14:51,196
I decided to quit.

249
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:55,492
Because of me, those below me
couldn't get promoted.

250
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:57,494
You know what I mean.

251
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,206
I didn't know you cared so much
for your juniors.

252
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:08,004
Then why did you treat me that way?

253
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:11,341
Gosh.

254
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:14,344
Are you still upset about that?

255
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:20,183
I just don't get it.

256
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:23,395
You could've opened up a small store
with your severance pay.

257
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:26,690
Or you could've joined
some other company.

258
00:15:26,898 --> 00:15:28,900
Do you think you can work under me?

259
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,278
Why not?

260
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:34,114
I'm completely fine.

261
00:15:38,576 --> 00:15:39,703
Is that so?

262
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:40,912
Sure thing.

263
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:43,832
Then try holding out.

264
00:15:46,084 --> 00:15:47,127
All right.

265
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:52,924
I'd like to make
one more thing clear.

266
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:56,010
You and I...

267
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,473
Mr. Lee, you and I...

268
00:16:01,349 --> 00:16:02,642
have never met before.

269
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,437
Do you understand?

270
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:07,522
Sure.

271
00:16:07,564 --> 00:16:09,649
I'm your superior.
Where are your manners?

272
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:12,569
Yes, sir.

273
00:16:21,536 --> 00:16:22,787
Also, "senior intern"?

274
00:16:23,788 --> 00:16:24,998
I don't care about that.

275
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,292
Don't expect...

276
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:28,960
to be treated well...

277
00:16:30,587 --> 00:16:31,963
just because you're old.

278
00:16:35,383 --> 00:16:36,384
Yes, sir.

279
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:53,234
He's completely changed.

280
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,564
Cheer up.

281
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:36,986
(Analysis of Joonsu's Products)

282
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:41,783
Mr. Ga, I've personally analyzed
our products.

283
00:17:41,825 --> 00:17:43,326
- You did?
- Yes, sir.

284
00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:50,542
(Analysis of Joonsu's Products)

285
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:56,673
300 pages?

286
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:03,763
How could he attach these
to all 300 pages?

287
00:18:08,226 --> 00:18:10,437
Why did he highlight everything?

288
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:20,572
I'll take my time
to read through this.

289
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:22,866
Yes, sir.

290
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:25,410
Thank you, sir.

291
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,130
Ms. Lee, are you eating something?

292
00:18:38,214 --> 00:18:39,257
No, sir.

293
00:18:43,344 --> 00:18:45,764
- Can you give that to me?
- Okay.

294
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:47,348
Please do that.

295
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:50,435
Okay, please make it quick.
Thank you.

296
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:52,270
- Mr. Oh.
- Yes?

297
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:53,605
About what I told you yesterday...

298
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:55,315
A group of idiots...

299
00:18:56,024 --> 00:18:57,108
joined my team.

300
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,402
Thank you, Ms. Tak.

301
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:01,237
Attention, please.

302
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:04,032
Shall we gather
in the meeting room?

303
00:19:04,074 --> 00:19:05,617
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

304
00:19:07,577 --> 00:19:09,329
We have new family members.

305
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:11,039
I'd like to welcome our interns,

306
00:19:11,915 --> 00:19:14,417
Mr. Joo Yoon Soo, Ms. Lee Tae Lee,

307
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,212
and Mr. Lee Man Sic.

308
00:19:19,756 --> 00:19:21,633
This is the Marketing
and Sales Department, and I'm...

309
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:23,343
The leader!

310
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:26,513
Yes, I'm the leader.
My name is Ga Yeol Chan.

311
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:28,139
- Clap.
- Clap.

312
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:30,058
(Marketing and Sales Department)

313
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:31,768
Okay.

314
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:34,813
Let's cut to the chase.

315
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,692
I'll brief you guys
on what you'll be doing.

316
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:42,529
Many people think
interns only do trivial tasks.

317
00:19:42,946 --> 00:19:43,905
That's right.

318
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:46,783
To be frank, that's the basis
and the main job of an intern.

319
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:49,494
Someone needs to do that.

320
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:52,831
Mr. Lee, you're not an exception.

321
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,543
However,

322
00:19:57,502 --> 00:20:00,422
giving only menial tasks
to you guys...

323
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:03,341
is a loss to the company
and a waste of our resources.

324
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:06,636
So you will be able to participate
in real projects as well.

325
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:11,433
Your attitude, projects,
and performance will be...

326
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:13,852
reflected in your evaluation
for the full-time positions. Okay?

327
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:14,894
- Okay.
- Okay.

328
00:20:14,936 --> 00:20:16,688
Up until now, the assistant manager,
Mr. Oh Dong Geun,

329
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,190
was in charge of supervising
the interns.

330
00:20:19,232 --> 00:20:21,735
But as there are three interns
in this quarter,

331
00:20:21,776 --> 00:20:24,029
we will divide the roles again.

332
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:27,240
In order to help the interns
participate in our projects...

333
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:28,450
as soon as possible,

334
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:29,951
we will proceed...

335
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:33,079
with a mentor-mentee program
where each intern will get a mentor.

336
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:36,082
I will now announce
each mentee's mentor...

337
00:20:36,124 --> 00:20:38,209
who will partner up with them
and work as their supervisor.

338
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:42,338
- Mr. Joo Yoon Soo is with...
- I hope we can work well together.

339
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,798
- Mr. Oh Dong Geun.
- Same here.

340
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,925
- Ms. Lee Tae Lee is with...
- I hope we can work well together.

341
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:47,343
Ms. Tak Jung Eun.

342
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,014
And lastly, Mr. Lee Man Sic
is with...

343
00:20:55,643 --> 00:20:56,644
me.

344
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:03,568
Mr. Kim Seung Jin, try to help them
out as much as you can.

345
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,611
Yes, sir.

346
00:21:04,736 --> 00:21:08,323
As Mr. Kim was an intern
like yourselves only a year ago,

347
00:21:08,365 --> 00:21:10,867
you should try to get tips on how to
become a full-time position.

348
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:12,077
- Okay.
- Okay.

349
00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:14,204
My gosh. I hope
we can work well together.

350
00:21:25,131 --> 00:21:27,801
First of all, Mr. Oh talks too much.

351
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:29,886
Whenever he talks, it just ends up
ruining his image. You know?

352
00:21:29,928 --> 00:21:32,931
He speaks thoughtlessly once a day.
And he's a cheapskate too.

353
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:35,850
He likes to use everyone else's
stuff as if it's his.

354
00:21:35,892 --> 00:21:37,477
But he catches on really fast.

355
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,728
So keep a straight face.

356
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,771
Okay.

357
00:21:40,063 --> 00:21:42,982
After returning from his paternity
leave, he became so cheap.

358
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:47,487
What are you doing? Are you taking
care of your health alone again?

359
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:49,197
I'm just using eye drops
because my eyes are dry.

360
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:51,908
Hey, Yoon Soo. You got a haircut
because it's your first day of work.

361
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,910
- Yes, I did.
- Where did you get it?

362
00:21:53,952 --> 00:21:55,662
Are you planning to go there?

363
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:57,288
My gosh, you think I'm crazy?

364
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,749
I was just wondering where you got
that ridiculous haircut from.

365
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,627
You need to trim your bangs, right?
You look stuffy.

366
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,963
It looks like you'll keep having
a frustrating life. Okay.

367
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:08,091
Right. If he acts all friendly
and is nice to you,

368
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:09,759
he's trying to give you his work.

369
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:12,137
- So be careful.
- Your haircut looks great. Okay?

370
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:13,722
Yoon Soo.

371
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,391
Do you want to carry out the analysis
on the dry noodles?

372
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:17,809
I can do it myself,

373
00:22:18,226 --> 00:22:19,853
but I thought you'd be good at it.

374
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:22,272
I don't ask anyone to do this,
you know.

375
00:22:24,274 --> 00:22:25,608
- Is that so?
- Yes.

376
00:22:26,818 --> 00:22:27,819
Let's give it a try.

377
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:29,404
All right. As for Ms. Tak,

378
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:32,365
she's a contract worker
which is rare at our company...

379
00:22:32,407 --> 00:22:35,285
since 95 percent of our employees
have permanent positions.

380
00:22:35,326 --> 00:22:37,245
And it's her fifth year here.

381
00:22:37,287 --> 00:22:38,705
Can you guess
what kind of person she is?

382
00:22:39,122 --> 00:22:40,123
Yes.

383
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,752
(Restroom, Lee Tae Lee)

384
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:45,628
She thinks interns
and other contract workers...

385
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,589
are her competition.

386
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:50,383
She doesn't befriend anyone,
so don't be offended by that.

387
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:52,343
Right. And she won't give you
proper projects.

388
00:22:52,385 --> 00:22:55,638
Why? Because projects will lead
to your performance.

389
00:23:00,477 --> 00:23:02,020
I'm the queen of the copy machine.

390
00:23:02,854 --> 00:23:06,024
No matter how menial a task is,
if I work hard, I'll have a chance.

391
00:23:12,447 --> 00:23:14,324
But it looks like...

392
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:17,702
all I'll be doing is
copying documents.

393
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:19,662
This is the office pantry.

394
00:23:19,871 --> 00:23:22,374
You don't have to worry
about Mr. Ga at all.

395
00:23:22,415 --> 00:23:24,542
He's the best boss ever.

396
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:27,504
He's such an angel.

397
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,673
Is that so?

398
00:23:30,715 --> 00:23:32,801
Yes. This is the coffee machine.

399
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:34,761
You can just press the button
for Americano.

400
00:23:34,803 --> 00:23:35,845
What's the order?

401
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:37,722
- Mr. Ga.
- Next.

402
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,682
- And who's next?
- No.

403
00:23:39,724 --> 00:23:41,559
- It's you, Mr. Oh.
- Okay.

404
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:44,604
- And next?
- And there are employees.

405
00:23:44,646 --> 00:23:46,731
- Right. They are mere employees.
- Yes.

406
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,525
You're very good.

407
00:23:48,817 --> 00:23:52,112
You have already understood
the dynamic of our office.

408
00:23:52,153 --> 00:23:53,780
That's great.

409
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:55,240
Mr. Ga.

410
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:57,367
What should I do?

411
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,459
Don't do anything.

412
00:24:07,252 --> 00:24:08,545
Don't do anything.

413
00:24:13,717 --> 00:24:15,093
It's your first day here.

414
00:24:15,135 --> 00:24:17,637
Rest up.
And try to observe the tasks...

415
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,305
other employees are on.

416
00:24:20,557 --> 00:24:21,808
I see.

417
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:28,064
Should I learn about their tasks?

418
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,191
On my own?

419
00:24:32,027 --> 00:24:33,028
Yes.

420
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:35,071
- Well, we need to make a profit.
- But the date...

421
00:24:35,113 --> 00:24:37,198
- I don't think it will work.
- Okay.

422
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,868
- Can you wait until the first?
- Okay.

423
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:42,287
- Okay. I see. Now...
- Give me that.

424
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:43,747
Hold on.

425
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,083
Wait. I'll call you right back.

426
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:48,668
Yes, sir.

427
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:46,184
(Get ready
to turn off the computer.)

428
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:48,645
All right. It's over.

429
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,814
- How nice.
- Good work.

430
00:25:50,855 --> 00:25:52,649
- Good work.
- Good work, everyone.

431
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:54,234
All right. Good job today.

432
00:26:06,705 --> 00:26:07,664
What's this?

433
00:26:07,706 --> 00:26:09,124
I analyzed the pros and cons...

434
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:13,086
of our products and wrote
how we can improve our products.

435
00:26:15,296 --> 00:26:16,548
(Chapter 6: Conclusion)

436
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:18,299
(Chapter 1: Introduction)

437
00:26:20,844 --> 00:26:22,345
Did you write this yourself?

438
00:26:22,512 --> 00:26:26,224
My gosh. You've been working
in this industry for 30 years.

439
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:27,559
I can tell you're experienced.

440
00:26:28,393 --> 00:26:29,436
You are indeed.

441
00:26:31,563 --> 00:26:32,605
Indeed.

442
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,336
It's awful.

443
00:26:56,171 --> 00:26:57,672
I can't use any of it.

444
00:26:59,257 --> 00:27:00,258
Right.

445
00:27:18,443 --> 00:27:19,819
Mr. Ga is back.

446
00:27:20,528 --> 00:27:21,571
All right.

447
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:23,531
Let's call it a day.

448
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,243
You said we're having a company
dinner with the interns today.

449
00:27:27,452 --> 00:27:29,829
I'm sorry.
I got a last-minute meeting.

450
00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:31,373
Let's have it some other time.

451
00:27:31,873 --> 00:27:32,874
Okay.

452
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,667
My gosh.

453
00:27:36,211 --> 00:27:38,630
Number one, laugh.

454
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:40,757
Number two, laugh louder.

455
00:27:41,132 --> 00:27:43,176
Number three, laugh really loud.

456
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:47,472
- All right. I'm on my way home.
- Bring us snacks!

457
00:27:47,514 --> 00:27:48,598
My gosh.

458
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:52,685
Didn't Mr. Ga seem a bit off today?

459
00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:55,480
What about Mr. Ga?

460
00:27:56,064 --> 00:27:59,234
Think about it. He said he'd be
a mentor to the senior intern.

461
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:01,945
But he didn't talk
to the intern at all.

462
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:03,571
That's not true.

463
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:05,448
He read the intern's analysis
of our products.

464
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,951
Mr. Ga complimented on it.
He was really considerate.

465
00:28:07,992 --> 00:28:09,327
- Exactly, my point.
- Right.

466
00:28:09,577 --> 00:28:10,578
Really?

467
00:28:10,912 --> 00:28:12,247
I didn't know.

468
00:28:13,456 --> 00:28:15,583
Why did they hire someone like him?

469
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,210
How can I order around an intern
as old as him?

470
00:28:17,252 --> 00:28:19,254
His presence is making me
feel very uncomfortable.

471
00:28:30,348 --> 00:28:33,017
Do you want to get drinks?
Just us, the interns?

472
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,019
- Why?
- It's our first day at work,

473
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:36,354
so I don't want to go home yet.

474
00:28:38,106 --> 00:28:39,357
Mr. Lee, do you want to come...

475
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:50,368
Should we clink our glasses?

476
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:52,787
Cheers.

477
00:28:56,332 --> 00:28:59,335
I'll have only one glass
and go home after I finish.

478
00:28:59,377 --> 00:29:02,505
I came with you because it seemed
you desperately wanted to drink.

479
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:06,551
If we drink beer together,
people might talk behind our backs.

480
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:07,677
What?

481
00:29:08,344 --> 00:29:09,804
Let me explain.

482
00:29:09,846 --> 00:29:11,806
If we were having a get-together,

483
00:29:11,848 --> 00:29:14,642
we should have invited Mr. Lee too.
I was wondering why you didn't.

484
00:29:14,684 --> 00:29:16,895
I just thought
you might have an ulterior motive.

485
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:18,188
It's not that, you know.

486
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,441
If he joins us,
it will be just uncomfortable.

487
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:25,528
Besides, I saw that
you two were talking earlier.

488
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,655
And he kept asking
personal questions.

489
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:31,409
He did. It's a good thing
you didn't invite him.

490
00:29:31,451 --> 00:29:34,496
I don't know why he's
so interested in my father's job.

491
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,500
By the way,
when they get new interns,

492
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:41,002
are they supposed to treat us
as if we're nobodies?

493
00:29:41,044 --> 00:29:43,380
And is it normal for them
to skip our welcoming party?

494
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:46,383
Well, other companies don't throw us
a grand welcoming party.

495
00:29:46,674 --> 00:29:48,593
Why? Did you expect a party?

496
00:29:49,094 --> 00:29:51,096
- Yes.
- That's interesting.

497
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:52,931
I guess some people
look forward to those parties.

498
00:29:53,098 --> 00:29:55,100
That kind of occasion
is more uncomfortable for me.

499
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:56,393
It makes me feel uncomfortable too.

500
00:29:57,394 --> 00:29:58,478
Then why...

501
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,647
I wanted to eat meat.

502
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:02,399
Meat?

503
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,067
I wanted beef.

504
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:08,988
And it's my first time...

505
00:30:09,114 --> 00:30:11,282
working for such a big-name company.

506
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:14,119
I think there are things
that are meant to happen.

507
00:30:14,285 --> 00:30:16,371
I kind of expected
to make it this time.

508
00:30:16,413 --> 00:30:20,250
It seemed like Mr. Ga
had a connection with me.

509
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:24,379
Of course. He seemed very open
just as I have heard.

510
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:28,091
I regretted having said something
bad about Spicy Chicken Ramyeon,

511
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:30,510
but I think that captured his heart.

512
00:30:31,344 --> 00:30:34,180
So I plan to continue...

513
00:30:34,222 --> 00:30:37,892
to share my honest opinion
with Mr. Ga.

514
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:39,352
Sounds great.

515
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:40,937
Cheers.

516
00:30:48,737 --> 00:30:50,447
I'll update it right now
and re-print this.

517
00:30:50,488 --> 00:30:52,949
Just stay still! Don't do anything!

518
00:30:52,991 --> 00:30:54,659
Don't do anything from now on, okay?

519
00:30:54,743 --> 00:30:57,078
Mr. Ga? What should I do?

520
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,788
Don't do anything.

521
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:00,248
Don't do anything.

522
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:05,378
It's awful. I can't use any of it.

523
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:10,050
Is that all you got?
Repeating everything that I did?

You're no match for me.

00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:17,140
- Thank you for dinner!
- Thank you!

526
00:31:17,182 --> 00:31:18,475
Let's go for another drink!

527

- Round 2! Round 2!
- Round 2! Round 2!

528
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,228
- Round 2! Round 2!
- Okay, let's go!

529
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,606
- All right!
- Let's go for round two!

I'm so proud of you.

Sure.

I heard our family will
have a doctor one day.

537
00:31:56,304 --> 00:31:58,848
I knew it would be you, Man Sae.

538
00:31:58,932 --> 00:32:02,185
My son! Make sure you get into
Seoul National University.

539
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:04,813
It's a national university,
so it's much cheaper.

Life would be wonderful
if it's always like this.

My husband just got a job

I couldn't believe my luck,

00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:21,371
so I suddenly got scared today.

545
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:23,206
Don't get scared over nothing.

00:32:27,252 --> 00:32:29,003
Have some fruit before you go in.

There are no relationships
that are 100 percent bad.

553
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,105
Life is full of ironies.

554
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:32,901
Something good that happens now
might begin something bad,

555
00:33:32,942 --> 00:33:35,153
and something
that's seemingly bad now...

556
00:33:35,195 --> 00:33:38,031
may become the beginning
of something good.

Relationships between people are
also as such.

There's Mr. Ga.

563
00:34:08,978 --> 00:34:10,855
- Good morning.
- Hello.

564
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:12,899
- Hello.
- You're here, Mr. Ga.

565
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:15,777
Mr. Ga, would you like
a cup of morning coffee?

566
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:17,946
Do you want
a cup of cold iced coffee?

567
00:34:22,075 --> 00:34:24,119
So this is your plan?

568
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:28,748
I don't drink the coffee here.

569
00:34:28,957 --> 00:34:30,542
- Should I go and buy one instead?
- Would you?

570
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:32,377
Of course, let me know.

571
00:34:32,627 --> 00:34:37,173
Well. I take an espresso lungo,

572
00:34:37,215 --> 00:34:39,342
then make it into a dry cappuccino
with whipped cream,

573
00:34:39,384 --> 00:34:41,845
topped with chocolate drizzle
and powdered cinnamon.

Everyone, make your order.

Goodness. How can
an old man like him get that?

You should either make
Ms. Lee or Ms. Joo do it.

00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,689
- Yes, we'll go.
- Yes.

00:34:54,482 --> 00:34:55,483
What should I do, Mr. Lee?

579
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:57,027
I'll go.

580
00:34:57,068 --> 00:34:59,362
See that? Make your order.

Here's my credit card.

Then iced Americano
with an extra shot for me.

583
00:35:04,951 --> 00:35:07,620
- I'll take iced Americano too.
- Iced Americano for me too.

594
00:35:38,526 --> 00:35:41,321
- What does this...
- I'll take that.

595
00:35:42,113 --> 00:35:43,281
One iced macchiato.

596
00:35:43,323 --> 00:35:44,991
5 iced Americano,
but 1 with an extra shot.

597

Espresso doppio in lungo,
dry cappuccino with whipped cream,

604

He said that's how I can help him.

I knew it, Mr. Ga.

606
00:36:09,724 --> 00:36:13,019
We were prejudice against him
because he was too old.

We didn't make him work,
but we talked behind his back.

We learn from you yet again, Mr. Ga.

- Here.
- Thank you.

00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:03,653
Oh, right.

617
00:37:04,738 --> 00:37:07,115
I should've asked you
to get us some sandwiches.

618
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,200
I don't have enough time to eat.

619
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,913
I'll go back.

Will you?

621
00:37:15,665 --> 00:37:18,168
Then can you go
to the Metro Sandwich...

622
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:21,296
and get me bacon basil shrimp BLT?

623

Don't let the bread get too crispy.
A medium crisp will do.

624
00:37:27,343 --> 00:37:30,847
Double cheese, no cucumbers,
add jalapenos, and raw onion.

625

Hot chili sauce and Thousand Island

No, in 4 to 6 ratio.

Then top it with a bit of
truffle oil, salt, and pepper.

Okay?

629

If anyone else wants a sandwich,
go ahead and order.

No, in 4 to 6 ratio.

No, no!
Enough with your prejudice.

642
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:34,244
That jerk has it in for me.

643
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:51,761
What is this energy?

644
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:54,764
This isn't enough.

645
00:38:59,102 --> 00:39:02,230
Gosh, it's raining.
When did it start raining?

646
00:39:03,356 --> 00:39:05,442
I was too focused to notice.

647
00:39:06,526 --> 00:39:08,653
Sir, what should we have
for dinner?

648
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:10,488
Any ideas?

649
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,867
Since it's raining, how about
we have some hot pollack soup?

650
00:39:14,075 --> 00:39:15,994
How about seafood kalguksu?

651
00:39:16,036 --> 00:39:17,454
There's that tasty place nearby.

652
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:19,622
What do you think, Mr. Lee?

653
00:39:19,998 --> 00:39:24,127
I like both pollack soup
and seafood kalguksu.

654
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,091
Since it's raining,
let's have something hot and spicy.

655
00:39:30,258 --> 00:39:31,760
How about hot, spicy pizza?

656
00:39:33,845 --> 00:39:36,097
Hot, spicy pizza?

657
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,018
That guy always needs
some kind of broth when eating.

658
00:39:42,395 --> 00:39:44,898
Are you trying to kill me
with bread?

659
00:39:44,981 --> 00:39:47,025
You forced me to eat it
for lunch as well.

660
00:39:49,944 --> 00:39:51,863
(Yes, you are amazing today
once again.)

661
00:39:55,325 --> 00:39:59,704
It's not bad to have
hot, spicy pizza on a rainy day.

662
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:01,331
Right, Ms. Lee?

663
00:40:04,334 --> 00:40:06,544
Yes, it's scrumptious.

664
00:40:09,381 --> 00:40:10,590
You're eating really well.

665
00:40:10,632 --> 00:40:11,841
It's delicious.

666
00:40:12,967 --> 00:40:14,427
It's really good.

667
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:18,515
You're eating so well.

668
00:40:22,727 --> 00:40:23,895
- Come here and eat.
- Okay.

669
00:40:24,396 --> 00:40:28,149
There should always be
some broth during a meal.

670
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:31,695
Hot, spicy pizza, my foot.

671
00:40:32,404 --> 00:40:34,322
What are you doing here?

672
00:40:36,783 --> 00:40:39,577
I was going to tell you anyway.

673
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,622
He and I are childhood friends.

674
00:40:43,123 --> 00:40:45,750
I just got him something to eat
while ordering mine.

675
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:46,793
What's wrong?

676
00:40:47,836 --> 00:40:49,921
Well... You see...

677
00:40:50,213 --> 00:40:53,967
He wanted both jjamppong
and tangsuyuk.

678
00:40:54,175 --> 00:40:57,303
But the set menu required him
to order two bowls of jjamppong.

679
00:40:57,345 --> 00:40:59,848
They sold beef brisket jjamppong
as a set menu?

680
00:41:05,478 --> 00:41:07,564
What are you doing here?

681
00:41:07,605 --> 00:41:10,692
How dare you come in here
and scold him?

682
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:12,569
Can't you see that we're eating?

683
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:15,030
Stop it. I'm fine.

684
00:41:15,196 --> 00:41:18,408
You're not helping me at all.

685
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:19,701
Sang Jong.

686
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:21,661
This is no place
for your personal relationships.

687
00:41:22,328 --> 00:41:23,288
Sang Jong?

688
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:25,498
Hey! This is my room!

689
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,251
He's calling me by my first name
in my room,

690
00:41:28,293 --> 00:41:29,878
so what's it to you?

691
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,671
Not at all, sir.

692
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:35,341
I'm sorry, sir. I am.

693
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:38,720
Let's talk outside, sir.

694
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,221
Where do you think you're going?

695
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,057
Aren't you going to eat this?

696
00:41:46,061 --> 00:41:49,773
May I quickly eat first?

697
00:41:51,024 --> 00:41:54,903
Your colleagues are stuffing
dry bread in their mouths.

698
00:41:57,155 --> 00:42:00,075
How could you even think
about slurping on that broth?

699
00:42:06,331 --> 00:42:07,999
I'm not the one who ordered pizza.

700
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:12,712
What? Hey, eat this first.

701
00:42:13,463 --> 00:42:14,547
Just take it home.

702
00:42:24,766 --> 00:42:27,811
It's raining today.
We haven't had a drink in a while.

703
00:42:34,693 --> 00:42:38,822
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

704
00:42:42,701 --> 00:42:45,912
I heard that
some interesting interns joined you.

705
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:49,457
Yes.

706
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:55,839
All those oddballs
during the interviews...

707
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,966
joined your team.
Will you be all right?

708
00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:02,637
If I guide them properly,
I'm sure they'll be outstanding.

709
00:43:03,722 --> 00:43:06,474
You're amazing.
There's no boss like you.

710
00:43:07,058 --> 00:43:08,184
You're flattering me.

711
00:43:09,352 --> 00:43:11,938
By the way, are you fine
with drinking alone with me?

712
00:43:12,188 --> 00:43:13,523
- Sorry?
- I mean,

713
00:43:13,565 --> 00:43:16,317
there were rumors at the company
about us dating.

714
00:43:16,776 --> 00:43:18,653
It's possible
since we're both good-looking.

715
00:43:20,613 --> 00:43:22,365
Why? Why are you laughing?

716
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:24,534
I don't feel that great.

717
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:29,205
Anyway,

718
00:43:30,165 --> 00:43:32,167
even if people talk about you,

719
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:35,128
you can easily subdue them
through your competence.

720
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,212
You know that, right?

721
00:43:37,213 --> 00:43:38,214
I do.

722
00:43:41,509 --> 00:43:42,635
I'm always grateful.

723
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:44,846
You know
you're a great supporter, right?

724
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:48,266
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm the one who's grateful.

725
00:43:48,933 --> 00:43:50,643
Thanks to you,
I'm in this position.

726
00:43:53,772 --> 00:43:55,857
Did you say people from Hauhau
are visiting us tomorrow?

727
00:43:55,982 --> 00:43:56,983
Yes.

728
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,819
Those from Mongolia
are after them as well.

729
00:43:59,861 --> 00:44:00,987
Will you be all right?

730
00:44:03,406 --> 00:44:04,491
I'm not too sure,

731
00:44:05,533 --> 00:44:06,534
but I'll have to try.

732
00:44:19,005 --> 00:44:20,048
Ma'am.

733
00:44:20,548 --> 00:44:21,925
Here.

734
00:44:21,966 --> 00:44:22,967
Thank you.

735
00:44:23,218 --> 00:44:24,219
Thank you.

736
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,396
You look so haggard.

737
00:44:34,896 --> 00:44:36,439
Mr. Ga must be giving you
a hard time.

738
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:40,151
Not at all, sir.

739
00:44:43,029 --> 00:44:46,241
I wanted to see you in private
for some time now.

740
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:47,617
I'm sorry it took so long.

741
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,661
I had no idea
you were struggling so much.

742
00:44:51,788 --> 00:44:54,249
So why did you want to see me?

743
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,043
I'm going to be straightforward
with you.

744
00:45:00,255 --> 00:45:02,590
- Make Mr. Ga struggle.
- Sorry?

745
00:45:02,632 --> 00:45:05,593
Six months from now,
they'll be voting for the CEO.

746
00:45:05,635 --> 00:45:07,387
They'll be picking
the board members.

747
00:45:07,429 --> 00:45:10,640
Please make sure
he doesn't undermine me.

748
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:14,602
I'm a mere intern.

749
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,063
I have no power.

750
00:45:17,313 --> 00:45:21,568
Not at all.
You're the only one who can do this.

751
00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:23,153
Goodness.

752
00:45:23,653 --> 00:45:25,447
What could I do?

753
00:45:25,488 --> 00:45:27,365
Nothing.

754
00:45:27,949 --> 00:45:28,992
Sorry?

755
00:45:29,784 --> 00:45:30,952
I don't understand.

756
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:34,581
From the way I see it,
he's already struggling.

757
00:45:34,706 --> 00:45:37,584
When you're having a hard time,
you're bound to make a mistake.

758
00:45:38,334 --> 00:45:39,627
Just hang in there.

759
00:45:39,836 --> 00:45:42,505
Don't whine and talk about quitting.

760
00:45:42,547 --> 00:45:45,508
If you hold out,
I'll repay you in any way you want.

761
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:49,721
By "repay",

762
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,350
do you mean you could hire me
as a full-time employee?

763
00:45:54,392 --> 00:45:55,477
Full-time?

764
00:45:56,269 --> 00:45:59,105
Hey, that's not a big deal.

765
00:45:59,147 --> 00:46:01,399
Come on, I'm the boss here.

766
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:03,068
What's with you? Goodness.

767
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,445
Here, have some soju.

768
00:46:05,487 --> 00:46:06,488
Thank you.

769
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,948
Goodness. Here you go.

770
00:46:11,076 --> 00:46:12,077
Drink.

771
00:46:13,995 --> 00:46:16,414
You can do it, Man Sic.

772
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:18,750
That's right, that's right.

773
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:23,254
It's not like he asked you
to do something bad.

774
00:46:25,256 --> 00:46:27,175
He just wants you to hang in there.

775
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:33,890
That's nothing. I can do that.

776
00:46:34,766 --> 00:46:37,394
My heyday is approaching once again.

777
00:46:46,027 --> 00:46:47,028
My goodness.

778
00:46:50,365 --> 00:46:51,533
What are you doing?

779
00:46:52,325 --> 00:46:53,368
Hey.

780
00:46:56,705 --> 00:46:57,706
Honey.

781
00:46:58,707 --> 00:47:01,167
Where's that red ginseng
your mother brought last time?

782
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:02,210
What?

783
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,255
You said you didn't want it,
so I've been giving it to Man Sae.

784
00:47:05,296 --> 00:47:07,966
You shouldn't. Give that to me.

785
00:47:08,007 --> 00:47:10,427
Why? Why all of a sudden?

786
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:20,437
Mr. Lee, I'm meeting
with a Chinese client. Come with me.

787
00:47:21,312 --> 00:47:22,522
I know you're good at that.

788
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:24,315
Yes, sir.

789
00:47:25,525 --> 00:47:26,609
I'll come.

790
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,902
You seemed to enjoy this place
last time,

791
00:48:08,943 --> 00:48:11,738
so I made another reservation here.
Is that okay with you?

792
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:15,784
I couldn't forget this place.
I've wanted to come back.

793
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:18,953
I'm glad you liked it.

794
00:48:18,995 --> 00:48:20,789
I had such a good meal that day,

795
00:48:21,206 --> 00:48:22,665
so I gained weight.

796
00:48:27,003 --> 00:48:28,588
There's no interpreter?

797
00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:33,176
I canceled it because Mr. Ga told me
to do so this morning.

798
00:48:33,259 --> 00:48:35,095
We can all speak
a bit of Chinese anyway.

799
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:46,106
You'll try to hurt my pride
with my educational background?

800
00:48:51,277 --> 00:48:52,445
By the way, he's...

801
00:48:52,487 --> 00:48:54,823
Wait, did you bring an executive
because this is a big contract?

802
00:48:54,864 --> 00:48:57,325
No, you don't have to get up.

803
00:48:59,035 --> 00:49:01,621
He came here to grill the meat.

804
00:49:03,123 --> 00:49:04,290
What happened? What?

805
00:49:04,332 --> 00:49:07,794
He's the best
at grilling pork belly.

806
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:12,716
I see. I knew it. He did exude
an aura of a master.

807
00:49:15,677 --> 00:49:16,678
Mr. Lee.

808
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:17,971
Yes?

809
00:49:18,304 --> 00:49:19,806
Come over here and grill the meat.

810
00:49:21,683 --> 00:49:22,684
Okay.

811
00:49:24,018 --> 00:49:25,895
Sure. Shall I?

812
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:47,208
My time has come at last.

813
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:57,052
I must place the pork belly after
preheating the grill sufficiently.

814
00:49:57,969 --> 00:50:02,015
It's to quickly grill the meat
while sealing in the juices.

815
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,732
The masters know
one ought to flip the pork belly...

816
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,067
only twice.

817
00:50:12,108 --> 00:50:15,028
Flip it for the first time when
the blood seeps out from the meat.

818
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:18,531
And flip it again when the juice
seeps out from the bottom side.

819
00:50:27,707 --> 00:50:29,584
Mr. Binghao, are you all right?

820
00:50:30,085 --> 00:50:31,127
I'm okay.

821
00:50:31,378 --> 00:50:32,379
I'm fine.

822
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:38,510
I'm sorry. It's been 30 years
since I last grilled meat.

823
00:50:38,551 --> 00:50:40,178
I made a mistake.

824
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:43,681
- Let me grill the meat.
- No.

825
00:50:44,182 --> 00:50:45,392
I'll do it.

826
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:47,811
I got the hang of it.

827
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,109
- Come on!
- My gosh.

828
00:50:54,776 --> 00:50:55,944
Are you all right?

829
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,030
Did you get burned?

830
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,282
Seung Jin, why don't you grill meat?

831
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:02,867
- Okay.
- Let's switch.

832
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:04,744
Just come over here.
And eat the meat.

833
00:51:04,786 --> 00:51:06,121
- No.
- I'll do it.

834
00:51:06,162 --> 00:51:08,289
- I'll do it.
- No, come on.

835
00:51:26,766 --> 00:51:28,518
- You...
- My gosh.

836
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:31,104
Do whatever it takes to stop him.

837
00:51:31,146 --> 00:51:33,815
Stop the contract
from going through. Okay?

838
00:51:35,567 --> 00:51:36,818
Hey, by the way,

839
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:40,739
the company will suffer from this.
Is that the right thing to do?

840
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,574
Why would the company suffer
from this?

841
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,244
Only Ga Yeol Chan
will be suffering from this.

842
00:51:47,162 --> 00:51:48,413
If the contract falls through,

843
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:51,374
we're going to try to steal back
the contract he lost.

844
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:57,505
Goodness. Even I thought
that was a fantastic performance.

845
00:52:07,223 --> 00:52:08,725
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

846
00:52:10,351 --> 00:52:11,519
Binghao.

847
00:52:24,366 --> 00:52:26,534
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

848
00:52:29,037 --> 00:52:30,080
Right here.

849
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:40,048
My gosh, he totally got me.

850
00:52:41,007 --> 00:52:42,217
All right. That's not enough.

851
00:52:46,388 --> 00:52:47,806
- Binghao.
- Me?

852
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:49,432
Don't do it.

853
00:52:58,566 --> 00:53:00,443
Sorry.

854
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,278
- What's wrong with you?
- Are you okay?

855
00:53:02,529 --> 00:53:04,030
- Hey!
- It's okay.

856
00:53:04,698 --> 00:53:06,157
I'm fine.

857
00:53:06,491 --> 00:53:08,034
Binghao.

858
00:53:08,076 --> 00:53:10,078
- No, stop that.
- It's okay.

859
00:53:10,245 --> 00:53:11,579
My gosh. All right.

860
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:15,208
There you go.

861
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:18,294
Nice.

862
00:53:21,214 --> 00:53:23,466
- No.
- Look.

863
00:53:23,842 --> 00:53:25,135
Look at that.

864
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,761
- Binghao.
- Wait, that's...

865
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:31,182
Binghao.

866
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,143
No.

867
00:54:02,088 --> 00:54:03,173
That jerk.

868
00:54:06,468 --> 00:54:09,304
I'll love you unconditionally

869
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:10,430
Binghao.

870
00:54:11,306 --> 00:54:13,683
- Unbelievable. What are you doing?
- Hey.

871
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,477
It's all right.

872
00:54:16,478 --> 00:54:17,479
It's okay.

873
00:54:20,732 --> 00:54:24,277
Call me when you need me

874
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,530
I'll run to you whenever

875
00:54:27,572 --> 00:54:30,742
You can call me
during the day and night

876
00:54:30,784 --> 00:54:34,412
- I'll run to you whenever
- You can call me

877
00:54:34,454 --> 00:54:37,791
When other people call me

878
00:54:37,832 --> 00:54:40,835
I'll think about it for a long time

879
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:41,878
Binghao.

880
00:54:42,921 --> 00:54:43,922
Look at me.

881
00:54:50,929 --> 00:54:57,102
I have unconditional love for you

882
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:04,234
My love for you is special

883
00:55:04,526 --> 00:55:06,361
All right. Cheers.

884
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:09,197
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

885
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,157
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

886
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:13,618
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

887
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:17,247
Mr. Binghao, I can't drink anymore.
I'll drink Sprite.

888
00:55:17,288 --> 00:55:19,332
- Hey, drink that.
- No.

889
00:55:22,001 --> 00:55:25,255
Mr. Binghao hates it
when someone can outdrink him.

890
00:55:25,296 --> 00:55:26,881
- Pretend that you can match him,
- Binghao.

891
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,383
- but you must let him outdrink you.
- Cheers.

892
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:29,426
Okay?

893
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:33,179
Beat him. Outdrink him.

894
00:55:34,222 --> 00:55:35,724
Isn't that your strong suit?

895
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,852
I won't lose. I won't.

896
00:55:41,354 --> 00:55:43,106
Hey, Binghao.

897
00:55:44,399 --> 00:55:46,776
Can you do this?

898
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:51,197
I can't do that.

899
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:06,504
What? Drink that.

900
00:56:13,178 --> 00:56:14,179
Binghao.

901
00:56:17,557 --> 00:56:19,893
1, 2, 3. Game over.

902
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,998
I'm happy that we will be
working together again.

903
00:56:42,582 --> 00:56:46,503
I'm happy to work
with a reliable team.

904
00:56:46,753 --> 00:56:47,962
I'll trust your team.

905
00:56:48,463 --> 00:56:50,840
I hope we can work well together
moving forward.

906
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:53,468
I'll do my best.

907
00:57:07,482 --> 00:57:08,608
Rip the contract.

908
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,485
No. I can't.

909
00:57:11,903 --> 00:57:12,904
No.

910
00:57:15,448 --> 00:57:18,493
I wish you a safe trip back.
Thank you once again.

911
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:21,663
Thank you. I hope
our companies work well together.

912
00:57:23,581 --> 00:57:25,792
Mr. Ga scored a big one once again.

913
00:57:25,834 --> 00:57:28,336
By the way,
what happened last night?

914
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:34,259
Thank you, Man Sic.

915
00:57:36,845 --> 00:57:37,846
Man Sic?

916
00:57:49,357 --> 00:57:50,358
What's wrong?

917
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,694
Hey, are you okay?

918
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:56,156
Are you okay?

919
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:00,160
Hey.

920
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:03,246
What's wrong with you?
Hey, Mr. Bing.

921
00:58:18,762 --> 00:58:19,929
Hey, are you all right?

922
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:27,312
Man Sic...

923
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:39,699
Man Sic, don't tell my team
that I threw up.

924
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:43,119
If they found out,
I'll be teased for life.

925
00:58:43,495 --> 00:58:46,581
What are you talking about
right after you almost died?

926
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:49,751
What? You won't do it for free?

927
00:58:49,834 --> 00:58:51,586
Do whatever you want.

928
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:57,008
Fine, then.

929
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,386
Since you saved my life,

930
00:59:00,595 --> 00:59:02,680
I'll sign the contract
with your company. Happy?

931
00:59:02,722 --> 00:59:03,807
Sure.

932
00:59:03,848 --> 00:59:05,266
- Okay?
- Okay.

933
00:59:06,101 --> 00:59:07,185
Do we have a deal?

934
00:59:07,227 --> 00:59:09,062
Okay. Yes, okay.

935
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:12,357
Why is that young kid
calling me by my name?

936
00:59:12,399 --> 00:59:14,109
Go away.

937
00:59:17,862 --> 00:59:18,947
Goodness.

938
00:59:21,116 --> 00:59:22,117
- Hey.
- Hey.

939
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,494
Did he leave something behind?

940
00:59:43,972 --> 00:59:45,306
What happened?

941
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,937
You said it'll be tough
to seal that deal.

942
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:52,772
You've worked so hard, Mr. Ga.

943
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:58,486
Then who?

944
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:18,256
Well.

945
01:00:19,674 --> 01:00:20,717
Mr. Ga!

946
01:00:21,676 --> 01:00:23,053
We should relieve our hangover.

947
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:25,513
Goodness, look at the time.

948
01:00:26,765 --> 01:00:28,099
Let's all eat lunch.

949
01:00:29,434 --> 01:00:30,685
Why don't we eat...

950
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:32,687
Shock Shock Burger for lunch?

951
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:35,857
What?
Burger? Did he just say burgers?

952
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:43,573
Gosh, I don't feel well.

953
01:00:43,615 --> 01:00:45,241
Hey, put that away.

954
01:00:47,327 --> 01:00:48,953
It smells, man.

955
01:00:50,205 --> 01:00:51,831
Yes, the smell is coming at me.

956
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:53,541
Try some.

957
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,927
Don't you think Mr. Ga is insane?

958
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:31,890
How can we eat burgers
after we drank so much last night?

959
01:02:32,557 --> 01:02:34,059
Yes, exactly.

960
01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:37,645
And he told someone who's old enough
to be his dad to grill meat.

961
01:02:37,896 --> 01:02:39,814
- I loathe that.
- "Loathe"?

962
01:02:41,274 --> 01:02:43,777
What has gotten into him lately?

963
01:02:45,403 --> 01:02:47,864
People should always be consistent.

964
01:02:47,906 --> 01:02:50,450
Is he crazy for money?
He's really annoying.

965
01:02:51,743 --> 01:02:54,662
Mr. Oh,
you should be consistent too.

966
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:20,021
That's when
I reached this conviction.

967
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:22,857
You stand no chance against me.

968
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:32,784
Something is seriously wrong.

969
01:04:06,401 --> 01:04:08,153
(Kkondae Intern)

970
01:04:11,573 --> 01:04:13,283
Those young jerks.

971
01:04:14,242 --> 01:04:17,454
I'll destroy you all.
I'll get you all.

972
01:04:17,746 --> 01:04:21,541
Mr. Lee, you aren't a stumbling
block, but a stepping stone.

973
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:23,752
Don't you know who Hye Soo is?

974
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:26,004
Hye Soo? Do you want me to call her?

975
01:04:26,046 --> 01:04:29,090
Hye Soo, can you do this for me?

976
01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:31,718
I really can't do this to you
if I think about our old days.

977
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,429
I apologize for how rude I was
without recognizing you.

978
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:36,056
What is this?
Are you a troublemaker?

979
01:04:36,097 --> 01:04:38,058
Why do you always get in trouble?

980
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:40,060
A man might have died
because of you!

981
01:04:40,101 --> 01:04:41,895
No one is dying because of me!

982
01:04:41,936 --> 01:04:43,646
Enough is enough!

983
01:04:43,688 --> 01:04:45,357
Car. Watch out for the car!

984
01:04:55,533 --> 01:05:00,622
