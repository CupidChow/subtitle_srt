(Kkondae Intern)

6
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:26,186
That's a helicopter!

7
00:00:28,188 --> 00:00:30,440
Over here! Help us!

8
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:33,902
Over here!

9
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:38,740
S-O-S!

10
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:42,619
- S-O-S!
- S-O-S!

11
00:00:42,953 --> 00:00:44,246
- S-O-S!
- S-O-S!

12
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,290
My goodness! My gosh.

13
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:48,000
My goodness.

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,294
I can... I can see the baby.

15
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:53,505
- S-O-S!
- S-O-S!

16
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:02,097
- It's gone.
- I can't see it anymore.

17
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:08,228
Let's go.

18
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,105
No, wait. No.

19
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:13,525
(Episode 15)

20
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:29,374
I used up my emergency fund too.

21
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:31,877
What are we going to do
starting tomorrow?

22
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:43,263
I still have 12 packages of ramyeon.

23
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:52,189
Hey. Do you have any water?

24
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:57,694
Goodness, these are...

25
00:01:57,903 --> 00:02:01,907
I saw a few of these in your car,
so I tucked away a few.

26
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,584
Do you have a portable battery too?

27
00:02:15,254 --> 00:02:16,672
Those will
probably last you three years.

28
00:02:16,839 --> 00:02:18,048
Gosh, it's kind of cold.

29
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:25,389
A wooden pillow?

30
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,099
Do you want to play a game?
This one, or this one?

31
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,892
You have playing cards too?

32
00:02:29,935 --> 00:02:31,144
Let me know if you need this.

33
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:34,064
How about a drink? No, this is mine.

34
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:35,858
You can eat this.

35
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:54,001
(Joon Ramyeon)

36
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:57,337
Mr. Ga!

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,136
- You caught this?
- Yes, I did over there.

38
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:08,849
It's done.

39
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:10,309
That looks amazing.

40
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:12,477
Ta-da.

41
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:14,479
Where did you get these?

42
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:16,273
Here.

43
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:20,485
How is it?

44
00:03:23,197 --> 00:03:24,198
Here.

45
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:28,702
Is it cooked?

46
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,249
It is.

47
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,918
This is the last round.

48
00:03:38,712 --> 00:03:39,755
All right.

49
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,424
This is the last round.

50
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:54,353
I'm putting in 100,000 dollars.

51
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,396
Me too.

52
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:59,358
How feisty.
Then 200,000 dollars.

53
00:04:00,484 --> 00:04:02,319
I'm putting everything in. Here.

54
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:04,154
You're quite bold for a young man.

55
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:05,364
What do you have?

56
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,495
Isn't this seaweed?

57
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,251
Try this.

58
00:04:19,628 --> 00:04:20,629
How is it?

59
00:04:20,838 --> 00:04:23,549
I like its texture.

60
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,055
Look at how good that is.

61
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:31,056
- Really?
- Flip it.

62
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:33,517
- How do you eat this?
- Not like that. Open it.

63
00:04:44,444 --> 00:04:45,445
Let's go back.

64
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:47,656
It's not coming today either.

65
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:02,588
What is that?

66
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:10,804
Am I seeing things now?

67
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:14,266
By now,

68
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:17,436
he must be in Kuala Lumpur, right?

69
00:05:17,477 --> 00:05:18,729
Come on, now.

70
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:22,274
Just because he's there doesn't mean
he'll clinch the contracts.

71
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:26,486
- Right?
- Sure thing.

72
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:38,081
Chestnuts and egg yolks

73
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:41,084
Chicken breasts and no drumsticks

74
00:05:41,126 --> 00:05:44,087
They're so stuffy
and make my mouth dry

75
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:46,965
The Sahara with no water

76
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:48,550
- Dry, dry, dry
- The Sahara is hot.

77
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:50,010
My mouth is so dry

78
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:52,721
Dry, dry, dry, it dries my brain too

79
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:54,181
- It's dry!
- Dry, dry, dry

80
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:55,933
- You, dance as well.
- They're so dry

81
00:05:55,974 --> 00:05:57,476
- I opened the fridge
- All right.

82
00:05:57,518 --> 00:05:59,102
And found soda

83
00:05:59,144 --> 00:06:01,939
Soda is tasty! Thank you!

84
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,315
- Soda
- Thank you, sir.

85
00:06:03,357 --> 00:06:04,691
- No problem!
- Let's dance!

86
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,485
Soda

87
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:09,530
- Soda is so refreshing
- Soda!

88
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:12,783
Gimbap and soda are musts
for picnics

89
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:21,500
It feels so refreshing
to not have Mr. Ga around.

90
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:25,546
I'm very happy
with that attitude of yours.

91
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:30,801
I'm going to eat this.

92
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:31,885
What is it?

93
00:06:32,094 --> 00:06:34,680
What is that? I've been curious.

94
00:06:35,347 --> 00:06:40,352
This is called ssukgulle.

95
00:06:40,394 --> 00:06:43,981
If you visit Mokpo,
you must try this.

96
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:45,315
- Ssukgulle?
- Yes.

97
00:06:45,357 --> 00:06:46,900
This is grain syrup.

98
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:50,404
Pour it over.

99
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,865
It looks so good.

100
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:55,242
Drench it.

101
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:03,500
I've been craving this.
It's so scrumptious.

102
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:06,128
It's so good. It's chewy yet soft.

103
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,713
It's quite interesting.

104
00:07:07,754 --> 00:07:09,089
By the way,

105
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,302
what do you think
Mr. Ga's new product will be?

106
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:16,388
We're not too sure.

107
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,056
You guys have been together
all this time.

108
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:20,350
I'm sure one of the ramyeon
stood out to him.

109
00:07:20,392 --> 00:07:21,935
Not at all.

110
00:07:21,977 --> 00:07:24,062
He's been nagging us day and night.

111
00:07:24,104 --> 00:07:25,898
He never shared his thoughts
with us.

112
00:07:27,107 --> 00:07:30,652
I personally think
we should look into skate ramyeon.

113
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:32,738
- You're right. It was good.
- Right.

114
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:34,072
Eat.

115
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:35,115
Yes, sir.

116
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:41,288
Oh, right.

117
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:43,624
Have you given any thought
about becoming my girlfriend?

118
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,085
Gosh, we were having fun
up until now.

119
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:49,796
So how are your girlfriends doing?

120
00:07:49,838 --> 00:07:53,759
Hey, because you scolded me
for having so many girlfriends,

121
00:07:53,842 --> 00:07:56,136
I broke up with them.

122
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:58,347
But there's this girl, Ah Reum.

123
00:07:58,388 --> 00:08:00,849
She really can't live without me.

124
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:04,353
So it'll be you, me, and Ah Reum.

125
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:05,687
Let's be a team.

126
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,773
Gosh.

127
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:11,151
How are you so shameless
about being a playboy?

128
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,821
Hey, why should I feel shame
for that?

129
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:17,032
Every single guy out there
is a playboy.

130
00:08:17,074 --> 00:08:19,743
My dad? A playboy. Him? I bet he is.

131
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:22,329
Ga Yeol Chan?
He's most definitely a playboy.

132
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:25,999
You know that woman on your team
who gives off a chilly vibe?

133
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,669
She and Yeol Chan
had been seeing each other.

134
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:31,755
- Miss...
- Ms. Tak.

135
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:36,176
So that's why...

136
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:39,638
she's been staring at him
so sentimentally.

137
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:40,848
What is it?

138
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:43,809
But why did they break up?

139
00:08:45,978 --> 00:08:47,187
You guys have no idea.

140
00:08:48,814 --> 00:08:51,108
All right, so Yeol Chan said
he came up...

141
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:52,943
with Spicy Chicken Ramyeon...

142
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:57,114
after seeing a woman eat
some fiery chicken at a restaurant.

143
00:08:57,698 --> 00:09:00,534
He had thought Chilly Vibe
was her and dated her,

144
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:03,412
but he was wrong.

145
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:08,458
Turns out,
Chilly Vibe lied to him...

146
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:10,210
so that they could go out.

147
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:12,129
You didn't know that, did you?

148
00:09:12,171 --> 00:09:13,172
No way.

149
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:16,175
I guess not.

150
00:09:17,593 --> 00:09:18,635
So that was...

151
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:21,388
I had no idea.

152
00:09:57,758 --> 00:09:58,800
Mr. Cha...

153
00:09:59,384 --> 00:10:02,054
clinched contracts worth
a total of 10 million dollars?

154
00:10:03,597 --> 00:10:04,640
He did?

155
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:11,021
How could he do that
with that good-for-nothing ramyeon?

156
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:13,315
Hey, hey.

157
00:10:13,857 --> 00:10:15,484
- Come here.
- Okay.

158
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:16,735
Sit down.

159
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:20,864
During times like this,

160
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:23,283
you must brace yourself
and fight against him.

161
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:25,619
Here.

162
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:29,081
Have some ramyeon porridge.

163
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:31,625
I'm sick of ramyeon.

164
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:35,546
Think that this is porridge
and have some.

165
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:38,882
How could that not be ramyeon
when ramyeon was part of it?

166
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:40,884
I never said this wasn't ramyeon.

167
00:10:40,968 --> 00:10:44,847
It is ramyeon, but just think
that it's porridge and have some.

168
00:10:44,888 --> 00:10:46,348
Exactly.

169
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:49,434
How can I think that it's porridge
if it's made with ramyeon?

170
00:10:55,607 --> 00:10:57,276
Don't eat, then!

171
00:10:57,317 --> 00:10:59,069
You might as well starve to death!

172
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:02,281
You're being so annoying!

173
00:11:02,322 --> 00:11:04,366
Darn it! You...

174
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:06,952
Forget it!

175
00:11:07,744 --> 00:11:08,787
Gosh.

176
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:27,306
I understand why
you're being impatient.

177
00:11:27,347 --> 00:11:29,016
But things can't always be peachy.

178
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:30,809
You should learn
from this experience.

179
00:11:43,989 --> 00:11:47,034
Oh, yes. I'm so happy that
Man Sic and Yeol Chan aren't here.

180
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:49,494
How could you drink alcohol again?

181
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:51,413
We can't get enough of it.

182
00:11:58,212 --> 00:11:59,171
- Hey.
- Yes?

183
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:00,380
Take a photo of me.

184
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,674
I'll do my best.

185
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:04,760
Let me take a bite.

186
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:05,886
Do you see that?

187
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,598
- Take a picture of the sea.
- Hold on.

188
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:12,976
Then take a selfie.

189
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:17,105
Hold on.

190
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,949
Gosh, it hurts!

191
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,700
- Sir!
- Sir!

192
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:30,869
- Oh, no!
- Oh, dear.

193
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:32,913
Darn it.

194
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:34,623
My goodness!

195
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:44,758
My gosh!

196
00:12:45,384 --> 00:12:48,470
Sir! Can you not swim?

197
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:51,932
- Hold on! I got you!
- Gosh!

198
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:53,725
I got you!

199
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:55,394
I got you!

200
00:12:56,103 --> 00:12:57,604
- My gosh!
- Be still!

201
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:58,897
Come on!

202
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:00,232
I'm drinking so much water!

203
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:08,115
Sir, are you all right?

204
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:10,242
- Are you okay?
- Sir.

205
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:11,743
Are you okay?

206
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:13,078
Hey.

207
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:16,456
If I ask you out again,
will you smack me again?

208
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:20,878
You're fine.
You're making that awful joke again.

209
00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:26,383
Sir, are you all right? Yes?

210
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:28,218
Hey.

211
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:32,472
On the day you save me
for the third time,

212
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,099
you and I should start dating.

213
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:39,771
Tae Lee. Are you all right?

214
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:41,648
Yes, I think I am.

215
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:43,233
What a relief.

216
00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:45,611
Gosh, I'm completely soaked.

217
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:51,575
Mr. Ga is leaving Manji Island too.

218
00:13:51,617 --> 00:13:52,659
- Really?
- Yes.

219
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,494
So he's coming?

220
00:13:57,789 --> 00:13:58,790
What?

221
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:09,760
What happened?

222
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:13,180
Look at her hair.

223
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:23,190
There it is.

224
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:33,325
What?

225
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,160
What on earth happened to them?

226
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:37,704
Why do they look so shabby?

227
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,465
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

228
00:14:48,507 --> 00:14:50,342
I drove here for you.

229
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:56,849
S-O-S.

230
00:14:57,558 --> 00:14:58,892
What happened to you?

231
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:00,060
Are you okay?

232
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:04,773
It looks like
you guys had a good time.

233
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:06,108
Good work.

234
00:15:09,403 --> 00:15:11,321
He's drinking grapefruit ade.

235
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:14,575
- Let's go.
- Yes.

236
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,204
Why are you going
to the passenger seat again?

237
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,373
Are you serious?

238
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:23,959
Darn you.

239
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:38,348
Mr. Lee, how long will it take?

240
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,392
If you're curious,
why don't you look that up?

241
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:42,311
What? Is that how you'll talk to me?

242
00:15:42,728 --> 00:15:44,062
Won't you show me any respect?

243
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:52,362
Honey.

244
00:15:52,613 --> 00:15:54,031
My son.

245
00:15:54,072 --> 00:15:55,949
My gosh, what on earth happened?

246
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:57,659
You said you were going hiking
with the executives.

247
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:59,786
My gosh, you stink.

248
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:01,622
Did you get cast away or something?

249
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:11,298
I understand why you're impatient,

250
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,966
But things can't always be peachy.

251
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,427
You should learn
from this experience.

252
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:29,191
Mr. Ga. Gosh, it's been so long.

253
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:31,902
Hey, everyone.
Let's celebrate Mr. Ga's return.

254
00:16:31,944 --> 00:16:33,612
Mr. Cha. Where's Mr. Cha?

255
00:16:33,654 --> 00:16:34,821
Is he still in Malaysia?

256
00:16:34,863 --> 00:16:36,406
Well, he's...

257
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:37,574
Mr. Ga.

258
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:41,453
I heard you were almost dying.
How did you make it back?

259
00:16:42,037 --> 00:16:43,997
You should just
rest up indefinitely.

260
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:46,542
That's no way to talk to me.

261
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:49,002
You still haven't heard.

262
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:52,506
I got dispatched to the Shanghai
branch as the director.

263
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:55,217
- Director?
- Director?

264
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:57,636
You skipped
the general manager position?

265
00:16:57,678 --> 00:17:01,056
The chairman was very happy
with my export contract.

266
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:02,599
Won't you congratulate me?

267
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:08,313
- Congratulations.
- My gosh.

268
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:10,148
Why don't you mean it?

269
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,317
Be honest. I bet you didn't know
I'd succeed with Greasy Ramyeon.

270
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,443
I didn't.

271
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:16,572
That's my point. Mr. Ga, don't just
focus on Spicy Chicken Ramyeon...

272
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:18,282
like a race horse.

273
00:17:19,032 --> 00:17:21,910
You should broaden your horizon.

274
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:22,953
Okay?

275
00:17:27,124 --> 00:17:29,001
- Good luck.
- I'll try my best.

276
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:31,086
Good luck. Good luck, Mr. Lee.

277
00:17:31,128 --> 00:17:32,129
Okay.

278
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:38,927
Back in my day

279
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:43,223
Back in my day

280
00:17:43,891 --> 00:17:48,979
The days of kkondae are back again

281
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,126
Tae Lee.

282
00:18:11,376 --> 00:18:13,962
We're not going to
eat all of this today, right?

283
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:15,672
Really?

284
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,759
Mr. Ga, are we going
to eat all of this today?

285
00:18:23,096 --> 00:18:25,891
- Don't hesitate to share opinions.
- I can't...

286
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:29,228
taste the main ingredient's flavor.

287
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:30,729
But I added
a lot of the main ingredient.

288
00:18:30,771 --> 00:18:32,147
But the thing is
that we don't taste...

289
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:34,274
the chicken a lot
in the Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

290
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:37,402
- Right.
- When I tasted that,

291
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:39,571
- I knew it'd be a hit right away.
- Right.

292
00:18:39,613 --> 00:18:41,365
- But this one is...
- This tastes like...

293
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:44,243
a downgraded version
of Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

294
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:46,036
- Gosh.
- Let's scrap this one.

295
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:47,371
Okay.

296
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:49,540
Okay. I'll prepare the next one.

297
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:50,791
Clean up.

298
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,836
So we're really going
to eat all of that today.

299
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:04,137
Well,

300
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:08,225
thank you for feeding my dog.

301
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:13,522
I can't believe I went to
an intern's house to feed a dog.

302
00:19:14,147 --> 00:19:16,608
If you can't take care of it,
you shouldn't have raised one.

303
00:19:20,612 --> 00:19:21,905
But your dog was cute.

304
00:20:21,673 --> 00:20:24,384
My ramyeon muse.

305
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:27,179
Hey.

306
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:28,931
Mr. Ga.

307
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:31,475
You didn't drive today?

308
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:33,018
No, I didn't.

309
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:37,272
I found a lot of sand in the car.

310
00:20:37,314 --> 00:20:39,024
I'm getting my car cleaned.

311
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:40,943
I see. That's understandable.

312
00:20:46,198 --> 00:20:49,451
Oh, this.
My hair is a bit hideous, right?

313
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:52,704
Don't tell anyone about my hair.

314
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:56,291
Actually, I have a complex
about my hair.

315
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,085
I was born with this curly hair.

316
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,878
I had to wake up an hour
before everyone...

317
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,797
and straightened
my hair every day.

318
00:21:02,214 --> 00:21:05,008
My gosh, it can't be raining
on a day like today.

319
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:07,719
Go home safely.

320
00:21:08,387 --> 00:21:09,388
Bye.

321
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:12,057
I should have brought an umbrella
on a rainy day.

322
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:14,726
But I didn't even bring an umbrella.
I'm totally ruined.

323
00:21:16,228 --> 00:21:18,814
No, she can't be my muse.

324
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:22,359
Don't tell anyone about my hair.

325
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,031
Do you know the fiery chicken
restaurant in Sinbang-dong?

326
00:21:28,073 --> 00:21:30,367
She doesn't know.

327
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:32,995
Yes, I do. Why do you ask?

328
00:21:33,036 --> 00:21:34,454
Darn it.

329
00:21:36,874 --> 00:21:38,750
Did you go there a few weeks ago?

330
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:40,586
Before our trip to develop
a new product.

331
00:21:40,627 --> 00:21:43,088
She didn't go.

332
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,257
- Yes.
- Darn it.

333
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:50,262
Right.

334
00:21:53,515 --> 00:21:56,560
Have you gone there
five years ago too?

335
00:21:58,854 --> 00:22:00,814
Please tell me you didn't.

336
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:03,525
But why are you asking me
these questions?

337
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:05,777
Have you gone there
five years ago too?

338
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,030
Have you gone there...

339
00:22:08,071 --> 00:22:11,283
with that afro hair
and cried your eyes out?

340
00:22:12,951 --> 00:22:14,411
Yes, I have!

341
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:17,456
Are you picking a fight with me
because I went to...

342
00:22:17,497 --> 00:22:19,917
the fiery chicken restaurant
before I started working here?

343
00:22:20,626 --> 00:22:21,960
What's wrong with you?

344
00:22:22,002 --> 00:22:23,795
Oh, no.

345
00:22:28,008 --> 00:22:29,343
It's spicy.

346
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:34,306
It's so spicy.

347
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:37,059
Seriously.

348
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:40,896
World, you are too spicy.

349
00:22:41,104 --> 00:22:44,024
Seriously.
What have you done for me?

350
00:22:44,107 --> 00:22:47,361
Why are you making me into a nobody?

351
00:22:47,444 --> 00:22:50,405
Seriously. I hate all of you.

352
00:22:50,447 --> 00:22:53,534
This is so annoying, world!

353
00:22:53,575 --> 00:22:55,369
It's spicy!

354
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,163
You've been hysterical these days.

355
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:00,123
When we were going on the trip,

356
00:23:00,165 --> 00:23:02,209
you said this was so small
so I showed you a big one...

357
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:03,877
then you asked if I was emigrating.

358
00:23:04,086 --> 00:23:06,338
What in the world is wrong with you?

359
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:10,926
Yes, it's her.

360
00:23:11,802 --> 00:23:14,555
I can't believe this lunatic is
my ramyeon fairy.

361
00:23:17,182 --> 00:23:19,852
Wait for me. Wait, take me with you.

362
00:23:21,353 --> 00:23:22,354
No.

363
00:23:23,063 --> 00:23:24,898
- No, it can't be.
- What's wrong?

364
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:28,735
- Wait for me.
- No. No way.

365
00:23:31,864 --> 00:23:33,615
Wait for me!

366
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,368
Hey, Ga Yeol Chan!

367
00:23:37,202 --> 00:23:38,662
Gosh, darn it.

368
00:23:38,704 --> 00:23:42,457
I have to go home,
but how am I going to get there?

369
00:23:46,712 --> 00:23:50,549
No, I hate this. I can't take it.

370
00:23:50,591 --> 00:23:53,385
Why does it have to be her
of all people?

371
00:23:57,222 --> 00:24:00,058
I mean, the muse of ramyeon
isn't such a big deal.

372
00:24:00,142 --> 00:24:01,476
She wasn't even a teenager.

373
00:24:01,518 --> 00:24:03,061
Why did I put in
so much meaning into this?

374
00:24:03,103 --> 00:24:07,482
Yes, Spicy Chicken Ramyeon was
just my creation, period.

375
00:24:08,108 --> 00:24:09,109
Okay.

376
00:24:14,114 --> 00:24:16,491
Gosh, I hate this.

377
00:24:16,825 --> 00:24:18,368
I hate this.

378
00:24:19,411 --> 00:24:20,913
I hate this.

379
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,673
Starting today,
I do not have a ramyeon muse.

380
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:33,467
(Trial product 28)

381
00:24:37,137 --> 00:24:38,138
How's this one?

382
00:24:38,764 --> 00:24:40,432
Don't you think
number 29 was better?

383
00:24:40,474 --> 00:24:43,060
No, I like 28 better.

384
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:44,603
- What?
- Yes, 28.

385
00:24:44,645 --> 00:24:46,813
- 28.
- I like 28 better too.

386
00:24:46,855 --> 00:24:48,857
Why can't you figure out
what's better?

387
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,360
How is 28 better?

388
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:53,153
Anyone can tell that 29 is better.

389
00:24:54,154 --> 00:24:56,031
- Was this 29?
- Yes.

390
00:24:56,073 --> 00:24:58,492
This... This was better.
I think it was this one.

391
00:24:58,534 --> 00:25:00,410
- It's 29. Eat up.
- This one, yes.

392
00:25:00,452 --> 00:25:01,745
- Yes, it's totally better.
- Yes, 29, 29.

393
00:25:01,787 --> 00:25:02,913
- Let me try it again.
- All right.

394
00:25:02,955 --> 00:25:04,706
Let's stay focused and try it again.

395
00:25:04,748 --> 00:25:06,667
- Let's try it again.
- Let's do that.

396
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:09,086
How is 108 better?

397
00:25:09,127 --> 00:25:10,420
The 109th one is much better.

398
00:25:12,047 --> 00:25:13,131
Try it again.

399
00:25:13,757 --> 00:25:14,800
Again.

400
00:25:15,592 --> 00:25:17,177
- Yes, sir.
- Okay. Let's try this.

401
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:18,720
Let's eat it again.

402
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,478
Are the trial products
that bad, Mr. Kim?

403
00:25:29,189 --> 00:25:31,233
Oh, no. It's not that.

404
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,152
My stomach hurts,
so I can't eat anymore.

405
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:37,322
So?

406
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:41,869
May I be dismissed first
just for today?

407
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:51,378
Are you going somewhere nice
all by yourself?

408
00:25:52,629 --> 00:25:55,215
No, it's just that my stomach hurts.

409
00:25:55,257 --> 00:25:58,218
There's no one here
whose stomach feels well right now.

410
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:00,888
Give me a second.

411
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:03,682
There's this pill I take,
and it works very well...

412
00:26:03,932 --> 00:26:06,810
Do we have to take painkillers
to do this right now?

413
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:11,940
Hey, man. What's with you?

414
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:14,443
Did you eat something wrong today?
Goodness.

415
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:15,777
I did eat something wrong.

416
00:26:17,154 --> 00:26:19,156
My bowel movements become weird
after just one package of ramyeon,

417
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:21,533
so think about how many
we had until now.

418
00:26:21,617 --> 00:26:23,577
I'm not a part
of the development team.

419
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:25,204
If you want to develop anything,
go do it alone,

420
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:27,873
or go do it with these newcomers.

421
00:26:28,165 --> 00:26:30,876
I'm already busy enough.
How many days do we have to do this?

422
00:26:31,627 --> 00:26:33,754
Hey, man.
You can't say something like that.

423
00:26:33,795 --> 00:26:35,923
Come with me. Get up.

424
00:26:36,465 --> 00:26:37,758
Hey, come on.

425
00:26:38,842 --> 00:26:40,511
Did I just say something wrong?

426
00:26:40,552 --> 00:26:42,221
Okay, so come out. Let's go.

427
00:26:45,265 --> 00:26:46,850
I can't believe how useless this is.

428
00:26:51,688 --> 00:26:53,023
You can all go home.

429
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:57,152
I will work alone to develop
a new product as of this hour.

430
00:26:57,277 --> 00:26:59,446
Mr. Ga, but we should still help...

431
00:26:59,488 --> 00:27:01,156
I don't need any of you!

432
00:27:01,615 --> 00:27:02,658
Just go. All of you.

433
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:05,744
I've always been
the only one who gets work done.

434
00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:09,957
Haven't I been doing all the work
to help all of you make a living?

435
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:08,056
He's going to be so mad...

436
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:10,976
when we actually leave
just because we're told to go.

437
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,861
Mr. Ga.

438
00:28:22,863 --> 00:28:25,115
Mr. Ga. What's wrong?

439
00:28:27,576 --> 00:28:29,494
Hey! What's with you?

440
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:37,336
Goodness.

441
00:28:37,544 --> 00:28:39,463
You're such a fool.

442
00:28:42,674 --> 00:28:45,344
- Mr. Ga, are you okay?
- Mr. Ga!

443
00:28:45,385 --> 00:28:46,470
No!

444
00:28:46,845 --> 00:28:47,888
What happened?

445
00:28:49,556 --> 00:28:51,308
- Mr. Ga! Mr. Ga!
- What happened to him?

446
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,351
- Goodness.
- What's going on?

447
00:28:52,392 --> 00:28:53,560
- Is he unconscious?
- Why is he here?

448
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:55,812
- You have to be quiet.
- Open your eyes.

449
00:28:55,854 --> 00:28:57,773
- Is he unconscious?
- Why isn't anyone here to see him?

450
00:28:57,814 --> 00:29:00,400
- Mr. Ga.
- Mr. Lee, what's going on?

451
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:06,281
Doctor, why won't Mr. Ga wake up?

452
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:07,824
He's just asleep.

453
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:09,493
- What?
- What?

454
00:29:11,286 --> 00:29:14,998
He recovered from the shock,
but he must have been very tired.

455
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,834
He can't seem to wake up.

456
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,426
Are you all right?

457
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:27,594
Hey.

458
00:29:28,095 --> 00:29:29,096
Mr. Ga.

459
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:32,516
- Yes?
- It seems like...

460
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:34,268
this had happened many times before.

461
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:37,354
What have you done to your body?

462
00:29:37,396 --> 00:29:39,314
Goodness, just stay down.

463
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:42,734
Your stomach is in such a bad shape
that you had gastric bleeding.

464
00:29:42,776 --> 00:29:45,737
Let's take a biopsy just in case.

465
00:29:45,904 --> 00:29:47,739
No, I have no time to lie around.

466
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,783
- Goodness, no.
- You can't do that.

467
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:51,827
Do you think
the doctor's order is a joke?

468
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:57,291
Make sure he stays away
from eating spicy food for a while.

469
00:29:57,332 --> 00:29:58,417
Do you understand?

470
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:00,294
Yes, we'll do that.

471
00:30:01,336 --> 00:30:02,421
What?

472
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:05,340
You are banned from
eating spicy food!

473
00:30:09,636 --> 00:30:11,680
- You've had enough.
- Can he do that?

474
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,362
Hey, Mr. Kim.
Why are you suddenly calling me?

475
00:30:27,404 --> 00:30:28,947
Congratulations, Mr. Namgoong.

476
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:30,115
What are you talking about?

477
00:30:30,157 --> 00:30:32,993
The chairman asked me
to get ready to make a gift.

478
00:30:33,285 --> 00:30:34,411
Really?

479
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:37,372
He's going to give me some shares?

480
00:30:37,873 --> 00:30:41,460
Well, he didn't exactly say
who it's for.

481
00:30:41,502 --> 00:30:44,505
But he told me to sell some shares
to make money to pay the gift tax.

482
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:58,519
Mr. Namgoong, the chairman went to
Ga Yeol Chan's hospital just now.

483
00:31:03,106 --> 00:31:06,652
Come on, Yeol Chan.
Try some of this too.

484
00:31:06,693 --> 00:31:08,570
Yes, that's it. Goodness.

485
00:31:09,404 --> 00:31:10,531
One second.

486
00:31:11,615 --> 00:31:13,867
Here. Have some water too.

487
00:31:15,035 --> 00:31:16,787
Goodness.

488
00:31:17,538 --> 00:31:19,540
Above all,
you always have to be healthy.

489
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:23,293
Look, try some of this.
This is good. Try some.

490
00:31:23,335 --> 00:31:24,503
That's it.

491
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:27,840
Who on earth is actually his son?

492
00:31:28,173 --> 00:31:31,385
Gosh, this looks great too.
Here. Try some.

493
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:47,484
Drink this too.

494
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,392
- Hey.
- Mr. Ga.

495
00:32:21,226 --> 00:32:22,853
- Goodness, Mr. Ga.
- Hey.

496
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:24,479
How did you...

497
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:25,981
- Goodness.
- Why didn't you take the day off?

498
00:32:26,023 --> 00:32:27,399
Why didn't you rest a bit longer?

499
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,359
He probably doesn't feel well yet.

500
00:32:30,736 --> 00:32:33,155
Are you all right?
Where are you going?

501
00:32:33,197 --> 00:32:35,199
- Wait.
- Mr. Ga.

502
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:58,263
Why are you here?

503
00:33:00,098 --> 00:33:01,892
I came to eat ramyeon.

504
00:33:02,726 --> 00:33:03,727
What?

505
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:08,148
I mean, I must have gotten addicted
to your trial products...

506
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,525
after having them for days.

507
00:33:10,108 --> 00:33:12,402
I'm starting to crave them.

508
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:15,739
Man, I don't want to
have you around,

509
00:33:15,989 --> 00:33:17,199
but I like the reason.

510
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,452
Instead, promise me
that you will listen to...

511
00:33:20,494 --> 00:33:23,121
my honest opinion,
not forcing me to say something.

512
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,085
You're just an intern.

513
00:33:28,752 --> 00:33:30,921
Are you trying to negotiate with me?

514
00:33:31,588 --> 00:33:32,673
That is the case.

515
00:33:35,592 --> 00:33:36,593
Try it.

516
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:43,809
- Goodness.
- Let it go.

517
00:33:43,976 --> 00:33:45,352
My gosh.

518
00:34:00,242 --> 00:34:01,660
Let me mix the sauce again.

519
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:11,545
This is it.

520
00:34:11,587 --> 00:34:13,422
- This is it.
- This is it!

521
00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:18,343
Yes, this is it. It's perfect.

522
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:21,221
I think you could go with this one.

523
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,766
Let's see.

524
00:34:30,814 --> 00:34:32,357
I think I can...

525
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:35,360
eat an entire bowl of this.

526
00:34:41,408 --> 00:34:42,409
It's good.

527
00:34:47,497 --> 00:34:48,498
No way.

528
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,169
It's because I'm feeling weak.

529
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:55,088
I think you can
just put this out in the market.

530
00:34:59,551 --> 00:35:02,596
I had to come out in a rush,
so I couldn't even wash my hair.

531
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:14,399
This is...

532
00:35:15,192 --> 00:35:16,401
Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon?

533
00:35:17,653 --> 00:35:21,823
(Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon)

534
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:43,053
Darn it. Does he call this ramyeon?

535
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:50,185
But this will rake in some money.

536
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:00,445
(Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon)

537
00:36:08,203 --> 00:36:10,414
(Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon)

538
00:36:15,502 --> 00:36:19,756
(Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon)

539
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:24,094
(The sales status of
Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon)

540
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:27,931
My goodness, all of you.
What on earth are you doing?

541
00:36:28,432 --> 00:36:30,267
You need to be
more like Ga Yeol Chan!

542
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:32,769
How can our company function
without him?

543
00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:35,105
Good work.

544
00:36:35,522 --> 00:36:36,523
Great job.

545
00:36:42,988 --> 00:36:44,907
It's here. It's here.

546
00:36:44,948 --> 00:36:46,909
- We got some snacks!
- Yes!

547
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,660
Have some snacks!

548
00:36:49,703 --> 00:36:51,413
- Gosh.
- All right!

549
00:36:51,455 --> 00:36:53,457
- Come around.
- We're on our way.

550
00:36:53,498 --> 00:36:55,876
Okay, let's see. How should we...

551
00:36:55,918 --> 00:36:57,753
That's not how you open it.

552
00:36:57,794 --> 00:36:59,505
My goodness.

553
00:36:59,546 --> 00:37:02,007
- What is that?
- Open it like this.

554
00:37:03,425 --> 00:37:05,469
- Gosh, it looks great.
- It looks good.

555
00:37:05,677 --> 00:37:06,678
I'm taking this.

556
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,806
Goodness. This one?
Do you want this one?

557
00:37:10,265 --> 00:37:12,392
- That's a good one.
- Then I'll take this.

558
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,771
Gosh, things are
finally peaceful for once.

559
00:37:15,812 --> 00:37:17,773
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

560
00:37:17,814 --> 00:37:19,107
Great work, everyone.

561
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:20,400
Eat up.

562
00:37:20,651 --> 00:37:25,030
Back in my days, corn dogs
used to have thick bread,

563
00:37:25,072 --> 00:37:26,448
and we filled up
our stomachs with this.

564
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,498
Look at this.

565
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:38,377
Look, this is so rad.

566
00:37:38,627 --> 00:37:40,504
Gosh, you know
how to use words like that?

567
00:37:40,546 --> 00:37:42,673
Then I'll say, agreed.

568
00:37:43,048 --> 00:37:44,049
I'm sorry.

569
00:37:47,553 --> 00:37:51,348
Mr. Ga. I'm so sorry
for my behavior last time.

570
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:53,392
It's all right.

571
00:37:53,725 --> 00:37:55,686
What you said wasn't wrong.

572
00:37:58,772 --> 00:38:00,148
But you know,

573
00:38:00,357 --> 00:38:02,484
it will be reflected on your KPI.

574
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:04,778
Cooperation is
a part of the evaluation.

575
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,946
The KPI?

576
00:38:08,323 --> 00:38:10,659
Where's Tak?
Tak, if you don't come and eat,

577
00:38:10,701 --> 00:38:12,411
I might finish it all.
Where are you?

578
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:16,373
She went to have a meeting
with Director Ahn.

579
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:20,085
This time, things will work out.

580
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:23,797
Ms. Tak, you're
such a competent woman.

581
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:27,593
Make sure you prepare reports...

582
00:38:27,718 --> 00:38:29,636
- on your performance and proposals.
- Yes, sir.

583
00:38:29,678 --> 00:38:32,306
Is anything particularly
troubling you these days?

584
00:38:32,514 --> 00:38:34,391
No, everything is all right.

585
00:38:38,937 --> 00:38:40,439
Let's see.

586
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:44,735
If Tak is having a meeting
with Director Ahn,

587
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:49,239
that means the evaluation
for the interns will be held soon.

588
00:38:49,281 --> 00:38:50,282
Yes, okay.

589
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:58,749
I just want to see
what the format is like.

590
00:38:58,916 --> 00:38:59,917
Oh, really?

591
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:01,919
Okay, then.

592
00:39:02,628 --> 00:39:03,629
All right.

593
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:12,638
The contract worker
who has great performance?

594
00:39:14,223 --> 00:39:15,224
Who?

595
00:39:15,724 --> 00:39:16,808
Tak Jung Eun?

596
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:21,146
No, why would I give her
a permanent job?

597
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:26,276
She'll have to sign the contract
even if I don't do that.

598
00:39:26,693 --> 00:39:29,613
Where else can she go
and be treated so humanely?

599
00:39:30,656 --> 00:39:34,451
If anything, she'll sign it
for Ga Yeol Chan's sake.

600
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:36,870
I can send her somewhere else...

601
00:39:36,912 --> 00:39:38,789
then bring her back
after a couple of months.

602
00:39:39,498 --> 00:39:41,333
Where are you? I'll go there.

603
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:44,378
Really? If you're going to
do that for anyone,

604
00:39:44,545 --> 00:39:45,963
don't do it for Tak Jung Eun.

605
00:39:46,588 --> 00:39:49,883
You should give that position to
Park Soo Chan of Overseas Sales.

606
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,301
Yes.

607
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,815
Last month, a four-year-old girl...

608
00:40:04,857 --> 00:40:06,984
lost 90 percent of
her kidney function...

609
00:40:07,025 --> 00:40:09,528
after having a hamburger
made of ground beef,

610
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,823
putting many parents
with little children in huge shock.

611
00:40:12,865 --> 00:40:15,284
This time, benzopyrene,
a first-grade carcinogen,

612
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:17,661
has been found in a product made by
a well-known sesame oil company,

613
00:40:17,703 --> 00:40:18,996
well over the safety level.

614
00:40:19,037 --> 00:40:22,207
Many consumers will fear
what they can put in their mouths.

615
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:23,792
The Ministry of
Food and Drug Safety announced...

616
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:25,669
- sesame oil made by...
- They barely blurred ours out.

617
00:40:25,711 --> 00:40:27,421
- a food company, Taeseon Food...
- What are they doing?

618
00:40:27,462 --> 00:40:28,881
- Hey, wait. That's...
- was detected for having...

619
00:40:28,922 --> 00:40:30,966
- 0.8 micrograms of benzopyrene...
- Spicy Webfoot Octopus Ramyeon.

620
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:34,178
which is over three times
the legal safety level,

621
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:36,096
- and they have requested...
- That's...

622
00:40:36,138 --> 00:40:38,265
- to pull out all of their products.
- the same Taeseon, right?

623
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:40,517
- This company also supplies...
- They make our octopus paste.

624
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,896
- the soup base for a ramyeon.
- No.

625
00:40:43,937 --> 00:40:46,982
- Thankfully, no benzopyrene...
- This can't be real.

626
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:48,984
over the safety level
was found in this ramyeon.

627
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:52,613
I'm an expert on this.

628
00:40:53,655 --> 00:40:54,656
Let's head over together.

629
00:40:57,868 --> 00:40:58,869
Okay.

630
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:05,042
Darn it.

631
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,504
Wait, but isn't it all right...

632
00:41:08,587 --> 00:41:11,715
if they didn't find
any carcinogen in our ramyeon?

633
00:41:11,757 --> 00:41:14,051
Even if it hadn't been found
in our ramyeon,

634
00:41:14,301 --> 00:41:15,928
would you want to eat something
made by a company...

635
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:17,679
that made another product
filled with carcinogens?

636
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,351
Benzopyrene is a substance
that can be created...

637
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:26,063
when carbohydrates
or protein are burnt.

638
00:41:26,104 --> 00:41:28,649
With a large amount of exposure,
it can destroy red blood cells...

639
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,443
- Just get lost already.
- and reduce immunity.

640
00:41:31,485 --> 00:41:32,778
- In Europe, food companies...
- Yes.

641
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:34,446
Did you sell it
before the news broke out?

642
00:41:34,488 --> 00:41:36,448
- Yes, I did.
- only allow 5.0 micrograms per 1kg.

643
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:39,326
I should buy dinner
for our dear President Namgoong.

644
00:41:39,493 --> 00:41:40,827
They have promised...

645
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:43,247
- Work hard.
- to focus more...

646
00:41:43,288 --> 00:41:45,582
on their food's safety.

647
00:41:45,624 --> 00:41:46,792
Let's see.

648
00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:50,045
Come on, now!

649
00:41:50,087 --> 00:41:52,506
What have you done to us?

650
00:41:52,548 --> 00:41:54,049
- Explain this.
- Thanks to you,

651
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:55,634
our company is going to shut down.

652
00:41:55,676 --> 00:41:56,718
How will you take responsibility!

653
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,846
What did you do in the beginning?

654
00:41:58,887 --> 00:42:00,305
Why won't you talk?

655
00:42:00,347 --> 00:42:02,349
- What will you do?
- Take responsibility!

656
00:42:02,391 --> 00:42:04,560
- That's enough!
- What have you done?

657
00:42:04,768 --> 00:42:08,355
You know very well
that he wouldn't do such a thing.

658
00:42:08,897 --> 00:42:11,775
Thanks to his trustworthiness,
he was able to keep this up.

659
00:42:11,817 --> 00:42:15,153
They could've made a mistake
during the test, so calm down.

660
00:42:15,195 --> 00:42:17,739
If he's so trustworthy,
how could there be carcinogens?

661
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:20,826
How could we trust him anymore?

662
00:42:21,034 --> 00:42:24,121
They could've made a mistake.
Let's be patient.

663
00:42:24,288 --> 00:42:26,415
Sir, drink some.

664
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:30,544
They should carry out
another test.

665
00:42:30,627 --> 00:42:32,087
It's obvious
that they've made an error.

666
00:42:32,129 --> 00:42:33,338
I've already contacted...

667
00:42:34,464 --> 00:42:35,632
the Ministry of Food
and Drug Safety...

668
00:42:35,674 --> 00:42:36,884
to do another test.

669
00:42:37,092 --> 00:42:38,927
But they said
they couldn't do it...

670
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,930
because it was already marked
as unfit.

671
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,600
What if it was an error?

672
00:42:44,641 --> 00:42:46,143
Do they just expect you
to take responsibility?

673
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:52,608
I don't get it.

674
00:42:52,649 --> 00:42:55,319
Why would they
suddenly come and do that?

675
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:58,280
What do you mean?

676
00:42:58,322 --> 00:43:00,157
Our products were tested
quite recently,

677
00:43:00,324 --> 00:43:02,326
but they suddenly barged in
and took some more.

678
00:43:07,456 --> 00:43:08,457
Hey.

679
00:43:12,544 --> 00:43:14,421
Enjoy it while you still can.

680
00:43:19,384 --> 00:43:20,427
What is he talking about?

681
00:43:23,889 --> 00:43:26,725
I'm sure they've collected
the entire lot.

682
00:43:27,017 --> 00:43:28,477
What about the products
that were manufactured...

683
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:29,603
before and after that lot?

(Taeseon Sesame Oil)

685
00:43:40,197 --> 00:43:42,199
- What are you planning to do?
- If they won't do the test,

686
00:43:42,282 --> 00:43:43,700
we'll have to ask someone else.

687
00:43:43,951 --> 00:43:46,662
They run tests
all throughout the country.

(Sungwon Food Hygiene Laboratory)

689
00:43:47,913 --> 00:43:49,873
Before they even decide
to accept it or not,

690
00:43:49,915 --> 00:43:53,210
we need evidence
to support our argument.

691
00:43:53,752 --> 00:43:54,920
Let's go.

692
00:43:55,045 --> 00:43:56,964
We've asked a few places,

693
00:43:57,005 --> 00:43:58,590
so let's be patient
for a couple of days.

694
00:44:00,425 --> 00:44:01,468
Sir.

695
00:44:02,427 --> 00:44:04,346
Please don't think
about doing something dangerous.

696
00:44:16,066 --> 00:44:17,067
What?

697
00:44:19,236 --> 00:44:22,030
What? It's Joo Yoon Soo.

698
00:44:22,406 --> 00:44:26,118
You're that intern who told me
to feed your dog.

699
00:44:26,952 --> 00:44:28,871
You... You...

700
00:44:32,457 --> 00:44:33,500
Gosh.

701
00:44:35,794 --> 00:44:37,462
Why did you drink so much?

702
00:44:39,756 --> 00:44:40,883
This is nice.

703
00:44:41,758 --> 00:44:43,969
It was boring to drink alone.

704
00:44:44,011 --> 00:44:45,095
Sorry?

705
00:44:55,981 --> 00:44:57,065
Ms. Tak.

706
00:44:57,608 --> 00:44:59,067
What will happen...

707
00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:00,944
to the Spicy Webfoot Octopus
Ramyeon?

708
00:45:01,361 --> 00:45:04,114
I've wanted that ramyeon...

709
00:45:04,156 --> 00:45:06,909
to completely fail.

710
00:45:10,412 --> 00:45:12,789
Because it was Ms. Lee's idea.

711
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:15,667
Aren't I so lame?

712
00:45:16,793 --> 00:45:17,878
No.

713
00:45:19,004 --> 00:45:21,548
I can understand why
you feel that way.

714
00:45:26,637 --> 00:45:27,638
By the way,

715
00:45:28,472 --> 00:45:30,641
I thought you liked her.

716
00:45:30,724 --> 00:45:32,309
- Me? Me?
- Yes.

717
00:45:32,684 --> 00:45:35,687
Do you mean that weird girl
who does this?

718
00:45:36,396 --> 00:45:37,606
Lee Tae Lee?

719
00:45:38,982 --> 00:45:40,984
Never in my wildest dreams.

720
00:45:41,026 --> 00:45:44,071
You're lying.
I thought you liked her.

721
00:45:44,279 --> 00:45:45,364
Never.

722
00:45:50,035 --> 00:45:54,331
To be honest,
I read your secret notebook.

723
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,167
You wrote down
the number of times...

724
00:45:57,876 --> 00:46:00,754
we went to the toilet
and the office pantry.

725
00:46:00,796 --> 00:46:02,089
- Really?
- Yes.

726
00:46:02,422 --> 00:46:04,883
You must've thought I was so weird.

727
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:07,386
No.

728
00:46:09,513 --> 00:46:11,348
I could understand why as well.

729
00:46:14,059 --> 00:46:15,686
After reading that,

730
00:46:16,645 --> 00:46:19,064
I kept count
of the number of times...

731
00:46:19,481 --> 00:46:22,067
you went to those places.

732
00:46:24,194 --> 00:46:26,989
And you only went once a day.

733
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:31,118
Why did you snoop around like that?

734
00:46:31,368 --> 00:46:32,369
You only went there...

735
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:35,330
once a day.

736
00:47:12,492 --> 00:47:13,660
I'm sorry.

737
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,528
Oh, my gosh.

738
00:48:40,205 --> 00:48:41,248
Hello.

739
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:47,921
Hold on, Taiwan, China was...

740
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:56,555
We've found out all the companies...

741
00:48:56,597 --> 00:48:59,141
that Taeseon delivered ramyeon to...

742
00:48:59,808 --> 00:49:02,519
and announced that
their seasonings were safe.

743
00:49:02,811 --> 00:49:06,356
However, 40 percent
of the products have been returned,

744
00:49:07,316 --> 00:49:09,484
and the sales have halved.

745
00:49:11,695 --> 00:49:13,113
During times like this,

746
00:49:13,155 --> 00:49:15,949
shouldn't we come out strong?

747
00:49:16,325 --> 00:49:18,744
We should recall all our products...

748
00:49:18,785 --> 00:49:21,997
and announce that we've cut ties
with Taeseon.

749
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:24,458
I've requested several laboratories
to test our seasoning,

750
00:49:24,625 --> 00:49:26,460
- so please give us more time...
- Listen up.

751
00:49:27,044 --> 00:49:30,297
People don't care
about such results.

752
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:34,593
Don't you remember
the cockroach incident?

753
00:49:34,635 --> 00:49:37,763
Once the public is aware
of an incident, it's game over.

754
00:49:38,096 --> 00:49:40,307
He's right, Mr. Ga.

755
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:42,601
It's wise to maintain
good relationships...

756
00:49:42,643 --> 00:49:43,936
with our subcontractors,

757
00:49:44,269 --> 00:49:46,188
but if things go awry,
we'll all go down together.

758
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:48,482
We've already gone down.

759
00:49:48,524 --> 00:49:52,277
We should demand compensation
for damages from Taeseon.

760
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:53,612
He's right.

761
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:56,114
We should.

762
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,244
- Sorry?
- Tell Taeseon...

763
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:02,454
to compensate for the damages done.

764
00:50:02,663 --> 00:50:04,289
Wait. Sir...

765
00:50:05,624 --> 00:50:06,667
Sir.

766
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,765
- What did you do?
- What are you talking about?

767
00:50:21,807 --> 00:50:24,434
I know you're responsible for this.

768
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:27,187
My gosh.

769
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,774
Why are you doing this to me?

770
00:50:30,816 --> 00:50:32,109
Darn it.

771
00:50:33,735 --> 00:50:37,030
Hey, I can do worse things.

772
00:50:38,115 --> 00:50:40,200
How dare you look at me like that?

773
00:50:40,242 --> 00:50:41,243
Get out.

774
00:50:42,452 --> 00:50:43,996
How irritating.

775
00:50:49,209 --> 00:50:50,752
It's not confirmed yet.

776
00:50:51,628 --> 00:50:53,797
We've asked several laboratories
to analyze the ingredients,

777
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:54,882
- so please...
- Hey.

778
00:50:54,923 --> 00:50:56,550
The results are out.

779
00:50:56,592 --> 00:50:58,594
- I'll call you back. Let's go.
- Okay.

780
00:51:05,225 --> 00:51:06,685
Why isn't he picking up?

so we're on our...

Please don't get any bad ideas.

786
00:51:39,259 --> 00:51:42,387
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my gosh. What should we do?

787
00:51:46,016 --> 00:51:47,017
No.

Oh, no.

800
00:52:58,088 --> 00:52:59,089
Are you all right?

801

Get a grip!

Wake up.

I'm sorry.

830
00:55:44,129 --> 00:55:45,756
Was it around the end of last month?

831
00:55:46,965 --> 00:55:49,218
The machines started acting funny.

832
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,888
The temperature went up
all on its own.

833
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:53,972
I see.

834
00:55:54,723 --> 00:55:56,642
But fixing them would
cost a fortune.

835
00:55:57,392 --> 00:55:59,144
And they started working well again.

836
00:56:00,354 --> 00:56:03,023
Since I had one more month
until I had to get them inspected,

837
00:56:03,232 --> 00:56:05,192
I just thought I should change
the machines by then.

838
00:56:06,652 --> 00:56:09,613
But the people from the city hall
suddenly came and took the products.

839
00:56:09,655 --> 00:56:10,906
I see.

840
00:56:13,116 --> 00:56:16,954
Even so, you should have told
the truth to Mr. Ga at least.

841
00:56:16,995 --> 00:56:19,581
All the other companies said
we should stop working with you...

842
00:56:19,623 --> 00:56:20,999
and sue you for the damage,

843
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:24,044
but Mr. Ga protected you
from all that.

844
00:56:25,754 --> 00:56:26,880
My gosh.

845
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,301
I should just die.

846
00:56:31,343 --> 00:56:32,344
Stop it!

847
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:34,012
How dare you?

848
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,681
If you die,

849
00:56:36,181 --> 00:56:37,724
what about the people left behind?

850
00:56:37,766 --> 00:56:40,310
What about your family
and your employees?

851
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:47,234
How could you of all people
lie to me?

852
00:56:50,696 --> 00:56:53,156
How could you do this to me?

853
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,033
How could you?

854
00:57:21,476 --> 00:57:22,477
Will you...

855
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:24,897
keep avoiding me?

856
00:57:29,401 --> 00:57:30,611
Is it...

857
00:57:31,486 --> 00:57:33,030
because of Mr. Ga?

858
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:37,284
No. That's not it.

859
00:57:38,035 --> 00:57:40,162
This was just too sudden.

860
00:57:40,537 --> 00:57:42,414
And we don't know much
about each other.

861
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:46,043
I just thought...

862
00:57:47,252 --> 00:57:48,962
if we can afford...

863
00:57:50,172 --> 00:57:51,965
to be dating one another now.

864
00:58:13,779 --> 00:58:14,905
I'm sorry...

865
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,950
that I can't afford to date.
