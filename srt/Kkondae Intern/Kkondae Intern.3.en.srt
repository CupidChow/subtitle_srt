00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:30,065
Thank you, Man Sic.

7
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:31,316
"Man Sic"?

8
00:00:44,246 --> 00:00:46,289
Don't you think Mr. Ga is insane?

9
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:49,626
How can we eat burgers
after we drank so much last night?

10
00:00:49,668 --> 00:00:50,835
Yes, exactly.

11
00:00:50,877 --> 00:00:53,463
And he told someone who's old enough
to be his dad to grill meat.

12
00:00:53,505 --> 00:00:54,506
I loathe that.

13
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:55,549
"Loathe"?

14
00:01:01,304 --> 00:01:04,516
That's when
I reached this conviction.

15
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:10,313
You stand no chance against me.

16
00:01:12,357 --> 00:01:14,484
Something is seriously wrong.

17
00:01:27,372 --> 00:01:28,373
Looking great.

18
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:33,545
Those jerks.

19
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:37,966
Don't let these emotions
get a hold of you.

Right, grapefruit honey black tea.

ICM, ICM.

26
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:04,701
It's all his fault.

27
00:02:05,577 --> 00:02:08,163
I lost my cool because of him
and made an awful move.

28
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:13,084
I need to deal with him
at a higher level.

29
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:21,718
Mr. Ga, are you okay?

30
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:30,936
Don't get carried away
by your emotions.

31
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,688
Yes, I'm fine.

35
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:48,203
What happened?

36
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:50,914
How did Binghao end up saying,

37
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:53,750
"Thank you, Man Sic"?

38
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:57,170
And did we end up
signing the contract because of you?

39
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:58,213
It's...

40
00:02:59,297 --> 00:03:00,340
I don't remember either.

41
00:03:00,382 --> 00:03:02,551
Why can't we work as a team?

42
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:04,719
How can I trust you
and keep leaving you in charge?

43
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:05,929
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:08,807
Goodness.

45
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:18,775
There's no need to
lose your spirits, though.

46
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:22,362
If you ended up getting the contract
while you were wasted,

47
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:25,949
that means you're
a very competent man.

48
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:30,829
That means I wasn't wrong
in hiring you for this position.

49
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:35,834
Okay, listen up.

50
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,420
Now that things ended up like this,

51
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:41,381
- make sure you take the credit.
- Pardon?

52
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:43,216
Don't let him
take your credit for doing nothing.

53
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:45,552
You deserve to take
all the credit for that.

54
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:47,721
I'll make sure
I speak up on that too.

55
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,186
Chairman, you're here.

56
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:02,152
Goodness, I heard
you sealed the deal with Hauhau.

57
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,779
I knew you could do it,
Ga Yeol Chan.

58
00:04:04,905 --> 00:04:06,281
I thought it might be tough,

59
00:04:06,323 --> 00:04:07,949
but you ended up making it happen!

60
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:11,161
See that, Chairman?
I told you he'll make it happen,

61
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:12,454
but you were still nervous.

62
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:17,209
So I thought Mr. Ga did something
to get on your bad side.

63
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,877
Goodness, stop it.

64
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:22,172
Mr. Ga wouldn't do anything
that I disapprove of.

65
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:24,633
He might disapprove of me, though.

66
00:04:24,674 --> 00:04:26,092
Goodness, Chairman.

67
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:30,513
- My gosh.
- No!

68
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:33,642
Wait! That... That contract.

69
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:39,105
Intern Lee Man Sic
got that contract.

70
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:40,565
What?

71
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:42,192
What are you talking about?

72
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:44,027
Yes, he's right.

73
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:46,238
We have an intern named Lee Man Sic.

74
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,283
Our senior intern who just
started here got that contract.

75
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,245
What happened?

76
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:54,829
Well...

77
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,123
He's right.

78
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:59,417
While we were all knocked out,

79
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,045
our senior intern
caught the heart of our buyer,

80
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:03,922
so we ended up
showing this great performance.

81
00:05:05,382 --> 00:05:06,675
Goodness, really?

82
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:09,719
How did you talk him into this?

83
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:13,390
Well, I don't really remember.

84
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:15,600
Goodness.

85
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,145
You're a funny guy.

86
00:05:20,397 --> 00:05:22,732
I'm sure it wasn't easy...

87
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:26,069
to start from rock bottom after
you worked in a higher position.

88
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:28,321
So? Are things going well at work?

89
00:05:28,363 --> 00:05:31,491
Of course, it's going great.

90
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:35,161
Is this what kids these days call
the second chance in life?

91
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:37,872
Gosh, things have been
very refreshing for me.

92
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:40,041
Is that so? Goodness.

93
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:44,170
I learned something huge
from you today.

94
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:46,172
Goodness, don't say that.

95
00:05:46,214 --> 00:05:48,758
My gosh, Chairman. Stop it.

96
00:05:50,135 --> 00:05:52,137
Don't lose your spirit
just because you're an intern,

97
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:54,931
and please continue to show
everything you can like you did now.

98
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:57,976
Yes, of course, I will.

99
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:01,605
So have you eaten?

100
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:02,981
Do you want to grab a bite with me?

101
00:06:03,356 --> 00:06:04,357
Do you?

102
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:06,109
You already ate.

103
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,111
Well...

104
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:11,323
I already had Shock Shock Burger.

105
00:06:12,282 --> 00:06:14,826
I see. Shock Shock.

106
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:15,869
- Yes.
- Okay.

107
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,465
Ga Yeol Chan, how did you end up...

108
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:32,677
falling behind that old man?

109
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:54,032
I guess he did get on his bad side.

110
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:36,408
You're okay. You're okay.

111
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:39,077
You're okay. You're okay.

112
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:19,242
Sir, are you all right?

113
00:08:20,785 --> 00:08:23,079
Go. Go on your way.

114
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,415
How could I when you're like this?

115
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:28,585
I'll be okay soon, so just go.

116
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:29,669
But still...

117
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:31,421
I said, go!

118
00:08:33,924 --> 00:08:36,092
You're okay. You're okay.

119
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:46,561
You're okay. You're okay.

120
00:09:12,963 --> 00:09:14,172
This is all because of you,

121
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,841
Lee Man Sic.

122
00:09:22,347 --> 00:09:26,268
I was surprised that you knew
that intern's name.

123
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:30,897
Don't tell me
you're interested in him.

124
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:34,985
Come on. I'm the one who proposed
the senior internship program.

125
00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:40,365
I learn so much,
watching elderly men act humbly...

126
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:42,158
and doing their best.

127
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,787
They motivate me to do better.

128
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:55,005
Speaking of which,
how about you give me...

129
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:59,009
just five percent of your share
as a compliment?

130
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:07,559
Six months from now,
they'll be voting for the CEO.

131
00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:10,020
Is it that hard to support
your own son?

132
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:12,856
Let's be frank. You do know that
I'm the only conglomerate's son...

133
00:10:12,898 --> 00:10:14,691
who doesn't have a single share
of the company, right?

134
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:17,068
This is why I lose dignity
in the company.

135
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,321
I have no power both inside
and outside of the company.

136
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:22,365
You little punk. You little...

137
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:25,535
What are you blabbering about?

138
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:26,995
- Dad.
- Hey.

139
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:28,121
Dad!

140
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:32,834
I'm so humiliated to hang out
with my friends.

141
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:36,004
Even those 10-year-olds
bragged about their shares.

142
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:37,756
So why won't you give me any?

143
00:10:37,797 --> 00:10:39,216
You little punk!

144
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:41,426
Darn it.

145
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:44,721
If it's because of the tax,
I have a plan.

146
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:47,891
You and I...

147
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:50,769
can marry women from Monaco.

148
00:10:51,937 --> 00:10:55,607
In Monaco, there's no such thing
as inheritance or gift tax.

149
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,443
We can get our citizenship there.

150
00:10:58,485 --> 00:11:01,404
What kind of nonsense is that?

151
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:05,617
Women there are beautiful.
They're better than your bookkeeper.

152
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:12,082
That little punk.
I'm not a bookkeeper.

153
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:25,011
All right, all right.

154
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:31,977
Come on, now.
You can just make them do it.

155
00:11:32,018 --> 00:11:34,771
That's absurd.

156
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:39,442
I'm just grateful
that I can work again.

157
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,779
Goodness. All right, then.

158
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:52,372
I may be gluing receipts right now,

159
00:11:52,956 --> 00:11:55,667
but I will succeed in the end.

160
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:57,335
Amen.

00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:20,942
What?

166
00:12:21,985 --> 00:12:24,446
What's going on? What is this?

167
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:25,989
Goodness!

168
00:12:26,698 --> 00:12:29,075
This is ransomware.

169
00:12:29,117 --> 00:12:31,036
- What?
- What? What is that?

170
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:33,330
Did you open a phishing email?

171
00:12:33,496 --> 00:12:35,957
- Goodness.
- No, it was from our company.

172
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:39,169
Don't you know that
they disguise themselves like this?

173
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:40,253
You probably don't.

174
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:42,505
I heard Sangsae Food
was a victim as well.

175
00:12:42,547 --> 00:12:45,800
I heard that as well.
All their computers shut down.

176
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:47,636
Goodness. What?

177
00:12:47,677 --> 00:12:49,179
This is a security test.

178
00:12:49,846 --> 00:12:50,847
- What?
- What?

179
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:54,392
The Security Team said that
they'd randomly send an email.

180
00:12:55,101 --> 00:12:57,062
Hold on. Didn't they say
if you opened the email,

181
00:12:57,103 --> 00:12:58,855
your teammates would all get
their security points deducted?

182
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:00,357
What are you talking about?

183
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:01,733
Darn it.

184
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:03,526
Oh, come on!

185
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:04,778
Mr. Lee...

186
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:07,572
- My gosh!
- I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

187
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:09,241
What are you going to do?

188
00:13:09,282 --> 00:13:10,575
- Come on.
- Lee Man Sic...

189
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:21,503
I'm just glad
that it wasn't real ransomware.

190
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:31,805
About that security email test,

191
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:34,474
could you send them
to our interns as well?

192
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:35,475
The interns as well?

193
00:13:35,517 --> 00:13:38,103
Yes. I'd like to include that
in their evaluation.

194
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:39,896
Sure.

195
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:43,358
Please send one
to our senior intern as well.

196
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,527
Okay. But you do know that
your entire team...

197
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:47,737
would be put at a disadvantage
if they open it, right?

198
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:50,323
Oh, really?

199
00:13:51,283 --> 00:13:52,909
Then let's forget about it.

200
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,162
It won't matter
if the interns open it.

201
00:13:56,788 --> 00:13:58,498
Is that so?

202
00:13:59,457 --> 00:14:01,251
Get your facts straight.

203
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:05,005
Everyone thinks the same way.
Why are you venting at me?

204
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:21,855
Come on.

205
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:24,065
Should I tell them?

206
00:14:24,816 --> 00:14:28,486
Which scumbag sent the ramyeon
to the Yeonggok Borough Office?

207
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:33,116
- It was me. Is something wrong?
- Gosh.

208
00:14:33,325 --> 00:14:34,284
Did you send
Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon...

209
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:35,452
to the elderly who are living alone?

210
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:39,331
I told you to send them
White Chicken Ramyeon.

211
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:41,958
How could you send them these?

212
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:43,793
Are you trying to kill them?

213
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:44,961
What do you mean?

214
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,088
Take a look at this.

215
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,007
- Are you serious?
- I'm so humiliated.

216
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:51,635
- My gosh.
- Gosh.

217
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:54,429
- Look at that title.
- What is this?

218
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:56,431
The comments are even worse.
I'm so ashamed.

219
00:14:56,473 --> 00:14:57,807
Let me see. Scroll down.

220
00:14:58,183 --> 00:15:00,018
- What?
- Goodness.

221
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,895
- Why are they laughing so much?
- No way.

222
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:03,939
- I can't believe this.
- Why did he do this?

223
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,482
That can't be.

224
00:15:05,523 --> 00:15:06,524
- Seung Jin!
- Sir?

225
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:08,693
You didn't explain...

226
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:09,861
the types of ramyeon properly,
did you?

227
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:12,906
Are you serious?

228
00:15:13,156 --> 00:15:15,617
Mr. Lee, it was only yesterday
that I told you to memorize...

229
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:18,161
the newly-released ramyeon
from our company.

230
00:15:18,203 --> 00:15:19,829
White Chicken Ramyeon
and Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

231
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:22,791
Didn't I tell you
not to confuse them?

232
00:15:22,832 --> 00:15:25,126
I said the former was made
with boiled chicken soup...

233
00:15:25,168 --> 00:15:26,711
and that the latter
was five times spicier...

234
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:27,796
than Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

235
00:15:27,837 --> 00:15:31,174
Is it that hard
to differentiate them? Really? Gosh.

236
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:34,010
I explained it to him yesterday.

237
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:38,807
- What should we do?
- What should we do?

238
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:41,059
What should we do?

239
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:42,185
(Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon)

240
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:43,353
I'm so ashamed.

241
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:45,397
Why is Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon
written here?

242
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:48,817
How should I know?

243
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,318
(Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon)

244
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,531
(Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon)

245
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:00,996
How will you work with those eyes?

246
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:05,584
I'm sorry.
I'll get cataract surgery.

247
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,961
Did you hear that?

248
00:16:08,587 --> 00:16:09,713
Forget it.

249
00:16:09,754 --> 00:16:12,215
Retrieve the ramyeon
before any of them eats it!

250
00:16:12,257 --> 00:16:13,717
Right now!

251
00:16:14,342 --> 00:16:16,761
Even if we all went, we wouldn't
be able to retrieve all 300 boxes.

252
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:18,471
We should go immediately.

253
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,932
Mr. Oh, please ask
the other teams for help.

254
00:16:20,974 --> 00:16:21,933
Yes, sir.

255
00:16:21,975 --> 00:16:23,727
- My gosh!
- Let's hurry.

256
00:16:24,144 --> 00:16:27,230
Saying sorry isn't enough.
I can't believe you.

257
00:16:28,106 --> 00:16:30,734
This is the Marketing Department.
Yes, sir.

258
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:33,570
We heard. We're about to.

259
00:16:34,154 --> 00:16:35,864
You four should cover that area.

260
00:16:35,906 --> 00:16:37,991
We'll go this way. Let's go.

261
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:39,242
Okay.

262
00:16:39,451 --> 00:16:42,746
- Okay. Let's go.
- All right.

263
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,080
Darn it.

264
00:16:59,763 --> 00:17:02,307
Gosh, it's so tiring.

265
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:13,610
Stop! Stop!

266
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:17,656
- What? What is it?
- Sir.

267
00:17:18,823 --> 00:17:20,283
- What are you doing?
- Let go.

268
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:21,326
Sir.

269
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:24,704
Sir, try this instead. You won't
get a stomachache from this.

270
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:26,998
Let us take that back
and give you this instead.

271
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,041
Darn it.

272
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:30,794
- Darn it.
- Gosh.

273
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:32,546
- Hey, Yoon Soo.
- Yes.

274
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:35,715
All right. Here it goes.

275
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:37,133
Get it.

276
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:43,014
All right. 1, 2, 3.

277
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:45,934
My goodness.

278
00:17:50,355 --> 00:17:51,940
- Gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

279
00:17:52,857 --> 00:17:54,734
Ms. Tak, your shoes.

280
00:17:55,277 --> 00:17:56,903
I like wearing heels.

281
00:17:57,487 --> 00:17:58,613
All right.

282
00:17:58,822 --> 00:17:59,823
Hurry.

283
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:01,575
Let's climb up.

284
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:02,826
Hurry.

285
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:05,579
Hurry up.

286
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:09,541
(Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon)

287
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:28,018
Goodness.

288
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:41,531
(White Chicken Ramyeon)

289
00:18:53,585 --> 00:18:55,212
All right.

290
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:11,728
Mr. Ga.

291
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:14,564
- Let me help you.
- No.

292
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:15,607
No.

293
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:22,572
My gosh.

294
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:34,084
Mr. Ga.

295
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:52,477
All right. I'll call you. Okay.

296
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,438
Gosh, we're done.

297
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:56,856
That was awful.

298
00:19:57,107 --> 00:19:58,650
- Good work.
- Okay.

299
00:19:58,817 --> 00:20:00,569
- Good work.
- That was so awful!

300
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,029
- I'm so sick of it. Seriously.
- Good work.

301
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:05,657
- Good work.
- I'm glad nothing happened to them.

302
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:08,285
Let's call it a day today.

303
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:10,078
Good job.

304
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,706
- Good work.
- Good work.

305
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:14,666
See you tomorrow. Bye.

306
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,293
- Good work.
- Good work.

307
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:19,504
I know that there's a bench,
but how can you sit right now?

308
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:29,639
Good work.

309
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,517
Everyone can make mistakes.

310
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:34,352
Don't beat yourself up.

311
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:36,229
Go home and rest up.

312
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:39,274
I'm sorry.

313
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:43,236
Goodness.

314
00:20:43,695 --> 00:20:44,696
My gosh.

315
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:48,491
- Are you crying?
- No, I'm not.

316
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:52,120
I feel like I'm only
a stumbling block of our team.

317
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,456
No one thinks that way.

318
00:20:54,497 --> 00:20:56,583
You were the one who got us
that big deal yesterday.

319
00:21:02,047 --> 00:21:05,675
Mr. Lee, you aren't
a stumbling block,

320
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:07,844
but a stepping stone.

321
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:15,310
Gosh.

322
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:23,693
Yes, this is it.

323
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:26,988
I'll make him look bad indirectly.

324
00:21:31,493 --> 00:21:34,746
Well, you guys had to go through
so much because of me.

325
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:36,456
As an elder,

326
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:40,460
I think it's only fair
for me to buy you a drink.

327
00:21:40,502 --> 00:21:43,547
I don't think that's right.

328
00:21:44,881 --> 00:21:46,716
I'll get going now, Mr. Ga.

329
00:21:48,552 --> 00:21:50,762
- Bye.
- Good work today.

330
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,324
We should have called Mr. Lee too.

331
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,368
Gosh, I feel bad.

332
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,537
Oh, no. Think about all the trouble
we went through...

333
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:17,205
because of that old geezer.

334
00:22:17,247 --> 00:22:19,958
He humiliated the entire team.
I won't drink with him.

335
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,084
I agree.

336
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:22,502
Who will go home if he comes?

337
00:22:22,544 --> 00:22:23,545
Me.

338
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,970
Gosh, I have a cramp.

339
00:22:32,762 --> 00:22:36,057
By the way, do you think
we can keep him on at the company?

340
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:37,142
We don't know
what kind of trouble...

341
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:39,019
- he will cause next.
- My gosh.

342
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,229
But nothing happened yet.

343
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,361
- I'm going to use the restroom.
- Okay.

344
00:22:52,032 --> 00:22:54,576
My gosh, is Mr. Ga the Buddha
or something?

345
00:22:55,577 --> 00:22:58,747
How can you say
you loathe him? He's an angel.

346
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:00,790
Take that back now.

347
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,002
Who said what to whom?

348
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:06,296
I'm sorry.

349
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:07,964
I take back that I loathe Mr. Ga.

350
00:23:08,006 --> 00:23:10,091
I should loathe someone else.

351
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:12,302
Hey, we should consider
ourselves lucky.

352
00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:15,013
How could we get such a nice boss?
And he's good at his job too.

353
00:23:15,055 --> 00:23:17,682
Right. He's the best boss.

354
00:23:17,724 --> 00:23:18,725

355
00:23:19,017 --> 00:23:20,018
You bet.

356
00:23:26,775 --> 00:23:28,026
Goodness.

357
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,489
This all happened...

358
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:35,367
because he made me do...

359
00:23:35,784 --> 00:23:38,995
such menial jobs
when I'm the key player.

360
00:23:45,418 --> 00:23:47,337
By the way, what are they doing?

361
00:23:48,046 --> 00:23:50,131
- Hello.
- Hello.

362
00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:51,800
- There are 6 of us.
- 6?

363
00:23:51,841 --> 00:23:53,593
- Yes.
- This way, please.

364
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:56,304
All right.

365
00:23:59,182 --> 00:24:00,183
Let's see.

366
00:24:01,226 --> 00:24:03,770
For the second round,
you can come to Ax and Ax...

367
00:24:03,812 --> 00:24:05,772
on the second floor
of the next building.

368
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:07,440
Okay.

(Kim Seung Jin: Okay.
Ga Yeol Chan: Got it.)

370
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:13,822
Right. Kkon-tern called me
and asked to have drinks with him.

371
00:24:14,364 --> 00:24:15,323

376
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:23,790
So what? Are you going to join him?

377

(Oh Dong Geun: So what?
Are you going to join him?)

378
00:24:26,084 --> 00:24:27,085
Do you think I'm crazy?

379
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:29,629
Should we invite him here?

380
00:24:30,046 --> 00:24:31,798
If he really comes,
it'd kill the mood.

381
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:33,383
How will you handle that?

382
00:24:33,758 --> 00:24:35,552
If he comes, I'm leaving.

383
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:38,471
See? Let him have drinks by himself.

384
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:39,598
Okay.

385
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,476
By the way, who is this?

386
00:24:44,477 --> 00:24:46,646

Kkon-tern?

391
00:25:02,746 --> 00:25:05,582
How dare they?
They have no idea what I can do.

392

397
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:50,168
That stings.

398

What on earth happened to him?

399
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:15,277
- Hello.
- Good morning.

It was here just now.

Is it gone?

414

Man, I was about to get finished.
How can it disappear like this?

- It's gone now.

Yes, it'll begin this afternoon,

from the advertisement agency.

Mr. Hong, can we go over
and persuade her?

437

Yes, okay.

438

Eun Hye Soo suddenly said
she doesn't want to do it.

450
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:18,043
Should I give her a call?

451

You're lying.

457
00:29:35,393 --> 00:29:37,395
She doesn't want
a group of people there,

458
00:29:37,437 --> 00:29:42,025
so she pointed out only Mr. Lee

492
00:32:02,874 --> 00:32:04,543
Then the goblin will say...

493
00:32:04,584 --> 00:32:07,420
Let me put out that fire.

494
00:32:09,005 --> 00:32:10,340
Then you two will kiss!

495
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:13,885
Wait, wait.

496
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:17,514
Do you expect me to kiss him
after eating this junk food?

497
00:32:17,556 --> 00:32:19,558
That's gross.

498
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,811
That goblin is a little kid.

499
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:24,312
It seems like he's not even weaned.

500
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:25,564
He still smells like breast milk!

501
00:32:25,605 --> 00:32:26,940
And you're telling me to do what?

502
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:29,234
Kiss him? Forget about kissing him.

503
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:39,536
We can go with this. You're making
Spicy Chicken Ramyeon at home,

504
00:32:39,578 --> 00:32:40,579
and suddenly...

505
00:32:41,246 --> 00:32:42,998
The goblin suddenly walks in.

506
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,209
And the goblin sees
bright red sauce on your mouth...

507
00:32:46,585 --> 00:32:47,752
and says this.

508
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:49,087
Did you eat a rat alive?

509
00:32:50,297 --> 00:32:51,756
And you answer him.

510
00:32:52,632 --> 00:32:55,385
No, I had chicken.

511
00:32:55,427 --> 00:32:56,970
Then the goblin goes...

512
00:32:57,012 --> 00:32:58,638
What kind of chicken did you eat...

513
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:01,725
to make you look so sexy?

514
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:04,519
I want to eat you alive too.

515
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:06,021
Then he kisses you!

516
00:33:09,774 --> 00:33:11,359
My gosh, this is killing me.

517
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:13,862
Eat what? Why should anyone
eat anything alive?

518
00:33:13,904 --> 00:33:15,906
Stop making me eat.
I'm already full as is.

519
00:33:15,947 --> 00:33:18,658
And it's sexual harassment to say...

520
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,577
something like that these days.

521
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:22,454
Goodness.

522
00:33:22,746 --> 00:33:25,498
My puppy, I'm sorry I just shouted.

523
00:33:30,212 --> 00:33:32,172
Come on, do something.

524
00:33:38,011 --> 00:33:39,387
Hey, Hye Soo.

525
00:33:39,763 --> 00:33:42,224
Can't you do this for me?

526
00:33:42,474 --> 00:33:44,351
Think of our old days.

527
00:33:45,143 --> 00:33:46,228
Exactly.

528
00:33:47,312 --> 00:33:48,730
I shouldn't do this to you...

529
00:33:48,772 --> 00:33:50,941
for old times' sake.

530
00:33:52,776 --> 00:33:56,196
I still keep
what you told me back then...

531
00:33:56,238 --> 00:34:00,116
right here, deep in my heart.

532
00:34:03,036 --> 00:34:06,206
Come on, don't say that.

533
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:09,668
What did I say to you?

534
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:15,715
I know our noodles are thick,

535
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:18,093
"but where did you get
a thick girl like her?"

536
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,262
"I'll eat my hat
if she gets her break."

537
00:34:20,303 --> 00:34:22,514
Goodness, just go back home...

538
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:24,224
and try to get married.

539
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:26,226
"You're very thick, so you're
an eldest daughter-in-law material."

540
00:34:26,268 --> 00:34:28,603
"You'll have no trouble
having kids."

541
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,982
- Me?
- "I told you to just pretend!"

542
00:34:32,023 --> 00:34:33,275
Why did you eat everything?

543
00:34:33,316 --> 00:34:34,776
You just grew even bigger.

544
00:34:34,818 --> 00:34:36,027
Are you a Hulk or what?

545
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:37,904
Who said something like that?

546
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:39,114
I said, "You grew even bigger"?

547
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:41,324
Me? No way.

548
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:44,452
You know that
I'm not a guy like that.

549
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,414
After that traumatic experience,

550
00:34:47,664 --> 00:34:49,916
not only did I stay away from
my favorite Osori thick noodles,

551
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:52,127
I didn't go anywhere near
any kind of ramyeon.

552
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:53,879
I don't like this product placement.

553
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:56,006
And it's not just
the product placement.

554
00:34:56,506 --> 00:34:57,674
I hate him even more.

555
00:34:57,716 --> 00:34:59,301
I'm not doing this. Never. Never.

556
00:34:59,342 --> 00:35:00,427
No, no, no!

557
00:35:02,178 --> 00:35:04,306
I'm sorry I just shouted, Deng Deng.

558
00:35:17,277 --> 00:35:18,445
What are you going to do now?

559
00:35:18,945 --> 00:35:21,197
It's all because of you.

560
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:25,201
How can you forget what you said
to kill someone's heart?

561
00:35:27,078 --> 00:35:28,288
How will you take responsibility?

562
00:35:29,497 --> 00:35:32,334
How will you
take responsibility for this?

563
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:46,139
The least I can do is
clean up her dog poop.

564
00:35:47,891 --> 00:35:50,143
Deng Deng! Come here.

565
00:35:50,185 --> 00:35:51,186
Goodness.

566
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,576
My gosh, you startled me.

567
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,582
Who is this old woman?

568
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:15,877
Where's Ms. Yoo? Why is she here?

569
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:17,295
Well...

570
00:36:19,756 --> 00:36:21,466
Who is she?

571
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:24,386
The chairman said
you always caused trouble...

572
00:36:24,427 --> 00:36:25,720
with the secretaries,

573
00:36:25,762 --> 00:36:29,516
so he wanted a senior intern
to take place.

574
00:36:29,558 --> 00:36:30,559
Hello.

575
00:36:31,476 --> 00:36:34,521
I'm Ok Kyung, a senior intern.

576
00:36:34,563 --> 00:36:36,106
Whatever.

577
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:39,067
Ok... "Ok Kyung"?

578
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:40,735
Darn it.

579
00:36:48,326 --> 00:36:50,287
Hey, how's it going over there?

580
00:36:51,454 --> 00:36:52,789
It's not that good, sir.

581
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:55,876
Is that so?

582
00:36:57,335 --> 00:37:01,172
I'm sure you're doing well.

583
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:06,428
Of course, sir.
Everything has turned into ashes.

584
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:08,763
Good. Keep going.

585
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:11,933
Better yet, turn Ga Yeol Chan
into ashes.

586
00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:13,351
Don't worry too much.

587
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,604
It's only difficult
to make things successful.

588
00:37:15,729 --> 00:37:17,606
Ruining things is a piece of cake.

589
00:37:17,647 --> 00:37:18,648
Right.

590
00:37:21,735 --> 00:37:22,736
He's awesome.

591
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:28,408
I wonder where in the world
such a talented man has been.

592
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:34,623
Now that we've come to this,
should I destroy everything?

593
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:39,502
But why do I feel hesitant?

594
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:53,350
Don't come!

595
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,811
Go away!

596
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,903
Darn it.

597
00:38:08,698 --> 00:38:09,699
Gosh.

598
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:13,078
Where in the world is he?

599
00:38:13,536 --> 00:38:15,956
Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee!

600
00:38:16,957 --> 00:38:18,166
Do something.

601
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:22,963
Gosh, how could
such a well-built man be so afraid?

602
00:38:23,004 --> 00:38:24,297
It's just a tiny dog.

603
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:27,175
I'm allergic to dogs.
It could be fatal!

604
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:30,637
All right.
I'll take care of this. Hey.

605
00:38:31,263 --> 00:38:32,264
Go.

606
00:38:32,389 --> 00:38:35,559
What? You little rat.

607
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,643
Go!

608
00:38:36,768 --> 00:38:39,104
You little punk.
Are you looking down on me?

609
00:38:39,396 --> 00:38:40,897
Go!

610
00:38:42,774 --> 00:38:45,068
You can't even take care
of that little dog?

611
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,194
Go!

612
00:39:16,516 --> 00:39:19,728
Mr. Oh, please tell everyone
that they can leave.

613
00:39:22,355 --> 00:39:23,523
It's not going too well.

614
00:39:23,565 --> 00:39:26,359
Hey! Did you guys
check out the portal sites?

615
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,695
Do you know what
the most-searched word is?

616
00:39:30,405 --> 00:39:31,907
Someone fainted after eating
our Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

617
00:39:31,948 --> 00:39:32,908
What?

618
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:34,367
"Joonsu Food" is
the second most-searched topic,

619
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:35,827
and the list goes on.

620
00:39:35,869 --> 00:39:37,120
What are you talking about?

621
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:41,958
(The most searched word)

622
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,127
(A man faints after eating
Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon)

623
00:39:44,169 --> 00:39:46,379
(A man faints after eating
Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon)

624
00:40:06,691 --> 00:40:09,611
Sir. Sir! Are you okay?

625
00:40:09,653 --> 00:40:11,196
- Oh, no!
- Is that it?

626
00:40:11,238 --> 00:40:13,657
Are they even allowed
to upload that video?

627
00:40:13,698 --> 00:40:16,201
He looks familiar.

628
00:40:17,744 --> 00:40:19,537
Hold on...

629
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:26,753
It's Mr. Park Mak Doong.

630
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,005
He's an elderly
who received our ramyeon.

631
00:40:29,047 --> 00:40:31,216
We retrieved all the ramyeon.

632
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:32,926
I thought we took them all.

633
00:40:36,972 --> 00:40:40,684
Mr. Oh, please put me
on speakerphone.

634
00:40:40,725 --> 00:40:41,768
Yes, sir.

635
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:43,895
- Gather around.
- Okay.

636
00:40:46,898 --> 00:40:47,983
Can you hear me?

637
00:40:48,024 --> 00:40:48,984
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

638
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:52,112
Mr. Oh, contact the Response Team
and ask them to delete the video.

639
00:40:52,153 --> 00:40:55,115
I'm sure the video
has been shared already.

640
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,242
Contact the video platform directly.

641
00:40:57,284 --> 00:40:58,994
Make the videos inaccessible.

642
00:40:59,035 --> 00:41:01,037
- Yes, sir.
- Also, please find out...

643
00:41:01,204 --> 00:41:02,789
- who uploaded it.
- Yes, sir.

644
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:05,292
Ms. Tak, let's block
all malicious articles.

645
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:06,877
We should delete the ones
that have been posted as well.

646
00:41:06,918 --> 00:41:07,919
Yes, sir.

647
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:10,380
It won't be easy,
but I need the rest of you...

648
00:41:10,547 --> 00:41:12,716
to look for Mr. Park.

649
00:41:12,757 --> 00:41:13,884
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

650
00:41:14,217 --> 00:41:16,052
Mr. Lee and I will join you
right away.

651
00:41:16,094 --> 00:41:17,512
Yes, sir.

652
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,181
Seung Jin, take him
and leave right now.

653
00:41:20,223 --> 00:41:21,266
Yes, sir.

654
00:41:24,936 --> 00:41:26,396
Hello, this is
the Marketing Department.

655
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:27,731
Hello, this is
the Marketing Department.

656
00:41:27,772 --> 00:41:29,441
Are the cameras ready?

657
00:41:29,691 --> 00:41:32,235
Let's begin filming.

658
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:38,366
Let's go.
We don't have time for this.

659
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:40,660
Are you going to give up
on Eun Hye Soo like this?

660
00:41:40,744 --> 00:41:41,745
I should stay behind...

661
00:41:41,786 --> 00:41:42,871
And do what?

662
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:45,415
I should find a way to convince her.

663
00:41:45,457 --> 00:41:48,251
She won't give in. Don't you get it?

664
00:41:48,919 --> 00:41:50,462
How do you know?

665
00:41:50,795 --> 00:41:52,839
Because if it were me,
I wouldn't listen to you.

666
00:41:53,506 --> 00:41:54,633
Ever.

667
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,637
How do you know how I feel so well?

668
00:42:09,773 --> 00:42:10,815
Hye Soo.

669
00:42:11,483 --> 00:42:12,567
I was wrong.

670
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:14,819
I shouldn't have been
so rude to you.

671
00:42:15,737 --> 00:42:17,989
I apologize. I did you wrong.

672
00:42:18,615 --> 00:42:20,867
How could I make you feel better?

673
00:42:22,035 --> 00:42:22,994
Do you want to slap me?

674
00:42:23,036 --> 00:42:26,706
If that'll make you feel better,
be my guest.

675
00:42:27,082 --> 00:42:29,626
Whom are you trying to console?

676
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:31,920
Me? You?

677
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:33,964
Look, here.

678
00:42:34,005 --> 00:42:37,467
You shouldn't apologize
just because you feel like it.

679
00:42:45,433 --> 00:42:47,435
Fine, then. Forget it.

680
00:42:47,686 --> 00:42:49,229
Forget it.

681
00:42:49,271 --> 00:42:51,481
Let's be honest.
If this falls through,

682
00:42:51,523 --> 00:42:52,607
it's better for me.

683
00:42:52,649 --> 00:42:53,608
Do you even know that?

684
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:56,778
You have no idea.

685
00:42:56,861 --> 00:42:59,906
Also, how long do you think
you can maintain your fame?

686
00:42:59,948 --> 00:43:02,117
You'll become a nobody very soon.

687
00:43:02,158 --> 00:43:04,995
The younger ones will soon
replace you.

688
00:43:06,204 --> 00:43:09,708
Goodness. Look at all those wrinkles
around your eyes!

689
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:12,794
Come down! I'm sorry. Come down!

690
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:15,755
I have no wrinkles yet!

691
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,258
Mr. Kim! Bring me some salt!

692
00:43:18,925 --> 00:43:19,926
My goodness!

693
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,514
What's your deal?
Are you the spy in "X-Man"?

694
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:26,933
Why do you cause trouble
wherever you go?

695
00:43:28,435 --> 00:43:30,145
Does it feel good to say
what's on your mind?

696
00:43:30,312 --> 00:43:31,563
Do you still not get it?

697
00:43:32,689 --> 00:43:34,900
Someone may be in
critical condition because of you.

698
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:37,027
Don't be ridiculous!
No one will die because of me.

699
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:40,113
I'm not the one who came up
with that ramyeon to begin with!

700
00:43:43,575 --> 00:43:44,534
Is it...

701
00:43:45,493 --> 00:43:46,703
my fault again?

702
00:44:03,678 --> 00:44:04,679
Excuse me, sir.

703
00:44:05,555 --> 00:44:08,475
Please don't get any bad ideas.

704
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,495
What is that sound?

705
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,706
- Goodness.
- My goodness.

706
00:44:31,748 --> 00:44:33,708
What happened?

707
00:44:34,084 --> 00:44:36,419
My goodness.

708
00:44:43,093 --> 00:44:45,428
I do admit that I was wrong.

709
00:44:45,929 --> 00:44:49,474
But it is your fault as well
for not checking the order list.

710
00:44:50,058 --> 00:44:51,685
That's what your position is for.

711
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:54,604
That's enough.

712
00:44:58,942 --> 00:45:01,736
The superiors are busy
causing a mess.

713
00:45:01,778 --> 00:45:03,947
And those under them need to be
taken care of all the time.

714
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:05,699
I said, enough!

715
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,367
Watch out!

716
00:45:16,126 --> 00:45:17,794
Be careful!

717
00:45:39,524 --> 00:45:40,942
How is Yeol Chan handling
the situation?

718
00:45:41,693 --> 00:45:43,069
He's trying to fix this,

719
00:45:43,111 --> 00:45:44,529
but the video
has spread too much already.

720
00:45:44,571 --> 00:45:46,865
A decline in sales seems inevitable.

721
00:45:46,907 --> 00:45:48,408
Darn it.

722
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,035
Dad!

723
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:53,705
Did you see the video? Did you?

724
00:45:53,747 --> 00:45:57,334
I knew Ga Yeol Chan
would mess up badly one day.

725
00:45:57,626 --> 00:46:01,296
By the way, can we sell
such dangerous ramyeon?

726
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:02,756
That's crazy.

727
00:46:02,797 --> 00:46:04,716
Dad, did you know?

728
00:46:04,841 --> 00:46:07,469
There are people who died
from eating...

729
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:09,512
- really spicy chili peppers.
- You punk.

730
00:46:09,554 --> 00:46:11,681
Are you happy now? Are you?

731
00:46:11,723 --> 00:46:14,100
The company's reputation is
about to go down the drain.

732
00:46:14,142 --> 00:46:15,101
How can you laugh now?

733
00:46:15,143 --> 00:46:17,896
You punk.

734
00:46:18,647 --> 00:46:19,898
Punk.

735
00:46:20,607 --> 00:46:22,525
Are you abusing
your power right now?

736
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,072
Listen. I don't know how powerful
your position is at the company.

737
00:46:27,113 --> 00:46:28,490
You'd better stop now.

738
00:46:28,531 --> 00:46:30,450
I'm really close with the people
at the Labor Office.

739
00:46:30,492 --> 00:46:34,162
Hey, aren't you the intern
in my department?

740
00:46:34,371 --> 00:46:35,830
- What?
- What?

741
00:46:35,872 --> 00:46:37,540
- Gosh.
- I'm sorry.

742
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:39,668
Hey. Turn it off now.

743
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:41,169
Stop!

744
00:46:41,211 --> 00:46:42,796
Stop. Don't come any closer to me...

745
00:46:43,171 --> 00:46:45,215
If you take a step toward me,

746
00:46:45,882 --> 00:46:47,842
I'll hit the send button right away.

747
00:46:47,884 --> 00:46:49,803
Don't you know how the chairman
of our company looks?

748
00:46:51,096 --> 00:46:52,055
Chairman?

749
00:46:52,514 --> 00:46:53,515
Turn it off!

750
00:46:58,395 --> 00:47:00,397
Wait. I mean,

751
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:02,524
even if he's the chairman,

752
00:47:02,566 --> 00:47:04,609
he doesn't have
the right to mistreat...

753
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:07,237
a powerless employee.

754
00:47:07,487 --> 00:47:09,864
A man fell and got beaten up.

755
00:47:09,906 --> 00:47:11,408
He was definitely violent.

756
00:47:12,492 --> 00:47:14,411
Don't you remember the violent
incident with the airline?

757
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:18,957
Who is this crazy woman?

758
00:47:21,126 --> 00:47:22,794
- Let's just go.
- Yes, sir.

759
00:47:26,882 --> 00:47:28,174
I know that she's an intern,

760
00:47:28,216 --> 00:47:30,218
but you should make her remember
the face of her boss.

761
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,845
- I will. I'm sorry.
- Gosh.

762
00:47:32,512 --> 00:47:33,513
Darn it.

763
00:47:35,974 --> 00:47:36,975
Goodness.

764
00:47:41,855 --> 00:47:43,023
Darn it.

765
00:47:44,774 --> 00:47:48,862
Darn it. You must've gone mad.
You're insane, Lee Tae Lee.

766
00:47:48,904 --> 00:47:52,741
You promised yourself
to live a normal life. Darn it.

767
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,410
Hey. Hey!

768
00:47:55,452 --> 00:47:58,204
Darn it. What does he want
from me now? Why is he calling me?

769
00:47:58,246 --> 00:47:59,414
Hey, let's talk.

770
00:47:59,456 --> 00:48:02,209
Come on.
I don't want to make this worse.

771
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,793
Don't talk to me.

772
00:48:04,044 --> 00:48:05,962
- You got it wrong.
- My gosh.

773
00:48:06,796 --> 00:48:08,882
Listen. If I lose my job,

774
00:48:08,924 --> 00:48:10,634
will you take responsibility for it?

775
00:48:10,926 --> 00:48:15,138
Nothing happened
between you and me today.

776
00:48:16,097 --> 00:48:17,307
Hey, date me.

777
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,564
You are...

778
00:48:26,066 --> 00:48:27,859
the first woman who saved me...

779
00:48:27,901 --> 00:48:29,152
after my mother died.

780
00:48:32,405 --> 00:48:33,406
What?

781
00:48:44,501 --> 00:48:46,461
Yes, Mr. Yang.
Who's giving us trouble?

782
00:48:46,503 --> 00:48:48,213
Hankyung. It's falling on deaf ears.

783
00:48:48,255 --> 00:48:49,422
Hankyung Sports.

784
00:48:50,423 --> 00:48:51,716
I'll call them myself.

785
00:48:57,722 --> 00:48:58,682
This is Hankyung.

786
00:48:58,723 --> 00:49:01,935
How could you release an article
without checking the facts first?

787
00:49:02,686 --> 00:49:03,979
We'll check again.

788
00:49:05,188 --> 00:49:06,273
Please do so.

789
00:49:06,314 --> 00:49:08,066
Okay. I'll check again.

790
00:49:13,029 --> 00:49:14,656
When we were moving
the ramyeon boxes,

791
00:49:14,698 --> 00:49:16,783
were you eating candies?

792
00:49:17,367 --> 00:49:18,994
No, it's not that.

793
00:49:19,035 --> 00:49:23,164
That old man asked me to leave
Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

794
00:49:23,206 --> 00:49:25,333
He said he wouldn't eat it
and would give it to his grandson.

795
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:27,085
So I couldn't take it from him.

796
00:49:27,127 --> 00:49:29,296
Then, why didn't you tell me that?

797
00:49:29,337 --> 00:49:31,798
I'm sorry. I didn't know
this would happen.

798
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,885
Forget it. If something happens
to the old man, it's all your fault.

799
00:49:34,926 --> 00:49:36,094
Did you get that?

800
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,056
Mr. Oh. Why would she
take all the responsibility?

801
00:49:40,098 --> 00:49:41,975
This wouldn't have happened...

802
00:49:42,017 --> 00:49:43,018
if Mr. Lee didn't mess up
in the first place.

803
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:44,394
That's not important right now.

804
00:49:44,436 --> 00:49:46,605
She was eating candies.

805
00:49:46,646 --> 00:49:48,398
Let's figure out who to blame later.

806
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,816
Let's find him first.

807
00:49:50,817 --> 00:49:52,319
- Mr. Ga.
- Mr. Ga.

808
00:49:53,236 --> 00:49:54,446
Goodness.

809
00:49:56,781 --> 00:50:00,535
Sir, have you seen a man
named Park Mak Doong?

810
00:50:00,994 --> 00:50:02,203
What did you say?

811
00:50:02,245 --> 00:50:04,956
Have you seen a man
named Park Mak Doong?

812
00:50:05,624 --> 00:50:07,459
What are you saying?

813
00:50:08,168 --> 00:50:09,169
Thank you.

814
00:50:09,669 --> 00:50:12,005
My gosh. Darn it.
What am I doing here?

815
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:13,590
Gosh.

816
00:50:14,216 --> 00:50:15,926
Hello.

817
00:50:16,092 --> 00:50:19,012
By any chance,
do you know where this man is?

818
00:50:19,054 --> 00:50:20,263
He's not at home?

819
00:50:20,305 --> 00:50:21,306
No.

820
00:50:21,473 --> 00:50:22,807
I wonder where he's gone.

821
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:23,934
You don't know?

822
00:50:24,893 --> 00:50:27,103
No, I don't know.

823
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:32,442
Right. I mean...

824
00:50:32,484 --> 00:50:34,569
So when did you see that old man?

825
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:36,738
- Didn't we see him yesterday?
- It was in the afternoon.

826
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,406
We were hanging out here.
He passed by us.

827
00:50:38,448 --> 00:50:39,616
Did he seem fine?

828
00:50:39,658 --> 00:50:41,034
- Why?
- Yes, he looked fine.

829
00:50:41,076 --> 00:50:43,370
- He looked fine. Why?
- Did something happen to him?

830
00:50:43,954 --> 00:50:44,996
No.

831
00:50:45,538 --> 00:50:47,207
It's not that.

832
00:50:51,294 --> 00:50:53,838
Ms. Tak and I will be checking
hospitals nearby.

833
00:50:58,927 --> 00:51:01,346
Was a man in his 80s
transported to this hospital?

834
00:51:01,388 --> 00:51:03,807
His name is Park Mak Doong.

835
00:51:04,224 --> 00:51:06,309
- Hold on. Let me check.
- Okay.

836
00:51:08,853 --> 00:51:10,647
Were you able
to take down the video?

837
00:51:11,815 --> 00:51:12,899
And the account holder?

838
00:51:13,316 --> 00:51:14,776
- Listen.
- Yes?

839
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:17,612
That old man said he had a grandson.

840
00:51:17,654 --> 00:51:21,825
My gosh. No.
He doesn't have a grandson.

841
00:51:22,284 --> 00:51:24,494
If he was in touch
with his children,

842
00:51:24,536 --> 00:51:26,997
do you think he'd live out here
all alone?

843
00:51:27,038 --> 00:51:29,040
Goodness.

844
00:51:30,041 --> 00:51:32,294
This student comes here
to volunteer.

845
00:51:32,335 --> 00:51:33,962
Perhaps, he was
talking about that student.

846
00:51:34,004 --> 00:51:35,755
- A volunteer student?
- Yes.

847
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:39,843
I think the student was
from Sehyeong University.

848
00:51:39,885 --> 00:51:41,219
- Sehyeong University?
- Yes.

849
00:51:41,261 --> 00:51:43,889
That student comes here
once every two months.

850
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:47,976
Mr. Park was especially friendly
to that student.

851
00:51:48,018 --> 00:51:50,395
- I see. Sehyeong University.
- Sehyeong University.

852
00:51:50,437 --> 00:51:51,646
- A volunteer student.
- Okay.

853
00:51:51,771 --> 00:51:53,106
Thank you.

854
00:51:53,148 --> 00:51:54,733
- Up top.
- Okay.

855
00:51:57,652 --> 00:51:59,321
Wait. Hey.

856
00:51:59,529 --> 00:52:01,489
- Yes?
- Where did you get that?

857
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:04,576
Who gave that to you?

858
00:52:05,535 --> 00:52:06,536
There.

859
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:13,460
Hey, look. Have a drink first.

860
00:52:13,501 --> 00:52:16,296
- Mr. Park, have a drink.
- I need to cook ramyeon.

861
00:52:16,338 --> 00:52:17,756
- Is that so? Okay.
- Drink up.

862
00:52:17,797 --> 00:52:19,299
- Just drink.
- Okay.

863
00:52:19,341 --> 00:52:20,508
Have a drink.

864
00:52:20,675 --> 00:52:21,676
Drink up.

865
00:52:21,885 --> 00:52:22,969
- Here.
- Okay.

866
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,721
Sir!

867
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:26,765
My gosh.

868
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:30,685
What are you doing here
after all the mess you created?

869
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:33,521
You're having a feast
for the entire town.

870
00:52:33,688 --> 00:52:36,733
I thought something
had happened to you.

871
00:52:36,775 --> 00:52:37,776
Come here.

872
00:52:40,737 --> 00:52:41,905
Where are you going?

873
00:52:42,906 --> 00:52:43,907
Sir!

874
00:52:44,366 --> 00:52:45,992
Stop there! Mr. Park!

875
00:52:47,535 --> 00:52:48,536
Sir!

876
00:53:14,396 --> 00:53:15,772
Park Mak Doong is back.

877
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:18,316
- I'm killing him now.
- What?

878
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:19,401
What does he mean?

879
00:53:19,442 --> 00:53:21,194
(I'm killing him now.)

880
00:53:21,236 --> 00:53:23,697
He means, "Park Mak Doong is alive.
I'm chasing him."

881
00:53:23,863 --> 00:53:26,491
I have to hurry. Okay.

882
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,118
Hello.

883
00:53:28,827 --> 00:53:30,328
Well,

884
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:31,746
I came here because I heard...

885
00:53:31,788 --> 00:53:34,249
the volunteer student who visits
Mr. Park Mak Doong is here.

886
00:53:36,334 --> 00:53:37,460
My gosh.

887
00:53:37,586 --> 00:53:39,045
I found the person
who uploaded the video.

888
00:53:39,087 --> 00:53:40,672
I'll upload the full video now.

889
00:54:02,694 --> 00:54:03,862
- Sir!
- Sir!

890
00:54:04,279 --> 00:54:05,405
- Sir!
- Sir!

891
00:54:05,614 --> 00:54:06,615
- Sir!
- Sir!

892
00:54:06,656 --> 00:54:07,616
- Sir!
- Sir!

893
00:54:07,657 --> 00:54:09,409
- Are you okay? Sir.
- Are you okay?

894
00:54:09,868 --> 00:54:10,869
Sir.

895
00:54:13,496 --> 00:54:14,789
It's good.

896
00:54:20,086 --> 00:54:22,422
This is so good.

897
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,508
It's so good
that I almost passed out.

898
00:54:32,015 --> 00:54:33,558
I have to film this.

899
00:54:39,064 --> 00:54:40,523
- Come on.
- What?

900
00:54:40,565 --> 00:54:41,816
Were we all fooled?

901
00:54:41,858 --> 00:54:42,859
He got us.

902
00:54:44,194 --> 00:54:45,195
It was a prank.

903
00:54:55,747 --> 00:54:56,915
I'll take the photo now.

904
00:54:57,874 --> 00:54:59,960
Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

905
00:55:00,126 --> 00:55:01,962
- Super!
- I'll take it at "super".

906
00:55:02,003 --> 00:55:03,004
- Ms. Lee.
- One more.

907
00:55:03,046 --> 00:55:05,465
Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon. Super!

908
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:06,758
Super!

909
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,759
One more.

910
00:55:07,801 --> 00:55:09,886
- Hey.
- Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

911
00:55:09,928 --> 00:55:10,929
Super!

912
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:12,430
That was great.

913
00:55:13,306 --> 00:55:15,058
- My gosh.
- Good job.

914
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,893
- My gosh.
- Good job.

915
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:20,188
So they are the ones
who made the ramyeon?

916
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:21,231
Yes.

917
00:55:22,023 --> 00:55:26,278
Oh, my. How did you come up
with such a great product?

918
00:55:26,736 --> 00:55:29,114
It's the best.

919
00:55:29,739 --> 00:55:31,408
It's the best ramyeon ever!

920
00:55:39,124 --> 00:55:40,917
Wait. Is this the wrong time
to be excited?

921
00:55:40,959 --> 00:55:42,210
Gosh, no.

922
00:55:43,587 --> 00:55:46,339
I'm sorry.
I uploaded the video for fun.

923
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,550
I didn't know it'd cause
this much trouble.

924
00:55:48,592 --> 00:55:50,760
I was going to upload
the full video right away.

925
00:55:51,303 --> 00:55:52,929
When things got out of control,

926
00:55:52,971 --> 00:55:54,764
I was scared to upload it.

927
00:55:54,806 --> 00:55:56,433
But she told me
that she'd be dead...

928
00:55:56,474 --> 00:55:58,101
- if I didn't upload the full video.
- As if!

929
00:55:59,227 --> 00:56:00,687
Gosh. Don't say that.

930
00:56:01,438 --> 00:56:03,356
That was a great promotion for us.

931
00:56:04,024 --> 00:56:07,110
Well, of course,
it did make us a bit anxious.

932
00:56:10,947 --> 00:56:12,824
How can we compensate for this?

933
00:56:14,576 --> 00:56:16,494
As long as your health is all right,

934
00:56:16,995 --> 00:56:21,958
we will sponsor any food product
from Joonsu Food that you'd like.

935
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,213
That's such great news.

936
00:56:27,797 --> 00:56:30,091
I don't need anything else.

937
00:56:31,009 --> 00:56:35,138
All I want to get is
Super Spicy Chicken Ramyeon.

938
00:56:37,849 --> 00:56:38,850
Yes, sir.

939
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:43,104
Now that we have
all these precious people here,

940
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,148
let's take one more picture.

941
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:46,566
- Yes, of course.
- Sure.

942
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,152
- All right, come around.
- Okay.

943
00:56:49,986 --> 00:56:52,197
Mr. Lee, please take
a picture for us.

944
00:56:53,865 --> 00:56:55,617
- Let's take a picture.
- Okay.

945
00:56:57,827 --> 00:56:59,079
Okay, come to the center.

946
00:56:59,204 --> 00:57:02,457
- Park Mak Doong.
- Super!

947
00:57:02,499 --> 00:57:05,377
You covered your face.
Can you lift up the ramyeon?

948
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,630
Can you lift it up a little more?
Park Mak Doong!

949
00:57:10,715 --> 00:57:11,841
Gosh, my knees.

950
00:57:11,883 --> 00:57:13,718
I think I ran enough to never
run again for the rest of my life.

951
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:16,972
Great work, everyone.

952
00:57:17,013 --> 00:57:21,017
Go home, get a good rest,
and come to work late tomorrow.

953
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,978
I'll cover for you all.

954
00:57:23,019 --> 00:57:24,145
- Goodness.
- Thank you!

955
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:26,565
I knew it, you're the best.

956
00:57:27,065 --> 00:57:29,401
The moment you showed up at the office,

957
00:57:29,442 --> 00:57:32,362
I felt so reassured that
I knew everything will be okay.

958
00:57:32,404 --> 00:57:34,864
Tak's eyes and my eyes met
at that moment,

959
00:57:34,906 --> 00:57:37,033
and she looked like
she could cry any minute now.

960
00:57:37,075 --> 00:57:39,244
I wasn't like that, Mr. Oh.

961
00:57:39,452 --> 00:57:40,495
You were like that.

962
00:57:41,871 --> 00:57:44,749
This is amazing.
The view count is unbelievable.

963
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,043
And the media
have changed their tones too.

964
00:57:47,961 --> 00:57:51,214
"Will Park Mak Doong become
the next Park Mak Rye?"

965
00:57:51,548 --> 00:57:53,675
"A happening broke out when
Joonsu Food misdelivered..."

966
00:57:53,717 --> 00:57:55,719
"and turned into
an unexpected promotion."

967
00:57:56,511 --> 00:57:59,681
Goodness, that old man is
unbelievably lucky.

968
00:58:00,557 --> 00:58:02,475
We went through
a whole lot of trouble,

969
00:58:02,517 --> 00:58:04,561
but everything is well
when the result is great.

970
00:58:04,936 --> 00:58:07,314
I heard that...

971
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,233
my physiognomy shows that
I was born with such great luck,

972
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,694
one who might be born
once every 100 years or something.

973
00:58:17,115 --> 00:58:21,328
Old man, what happened today
will be included in your evaluation.

974
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:30,420
Ms. Tak, did you run in those heels?

975
00:58:31,755 --> 00:58:34,716
Oh, I believe Ms. Lee's feet are
probably in a bigger mess.

976
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:36,092
What?

977
00:58:38,386 --> 00:58:39,846
- You're bleeding.
- Me?

978
00:58:41,264 --> 00:58:42,515
