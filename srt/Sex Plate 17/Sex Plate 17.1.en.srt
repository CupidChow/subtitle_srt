1
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,560
Busy?

2
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,050
Well, brother, I'm busy outside right now, can't talk.

3
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,150
Now? What is it?

4
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,490
I have things to do today

5
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,660
Today

6
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,060
It is okay.

7
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,090
The event was over and all stayed.

8
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,430
Good for a break today.

9
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,990
Over here

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,620
I am hanging up now if you have nothing to say.

11
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,320
Ah?

12
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,190
Uh

13
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,060
I'll talk to you tonight.

14
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,930
Looks like it's not good to be too tired.

15
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,330
I'll call you back.

16
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,490
OK

17
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,890
Where are you going?

18
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,760
Do you want me to help you....

19
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,060
Songs and Songs

20
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,390
Song and Song Dynasties

21
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,790
Aish!

22
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,660
Bastard

23
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,990
Why are you still sleeping?

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,930
Cry?

25
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,090
Why are you crying?

26
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,050
Why is it because the company's business is still about Yingyuan?

27
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,020
I'm not the one saying

28
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,760
Is there anything in this world to be sad about?

29
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,250
So my own woman cannot be satisfied.

30
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,350
So you lost Yingyuan

31
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,520
It's really...

32
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,930
Yes

33
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,020
Well, don't say that, get out soon.

34
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,290
you

35
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,920
Don't you have Yingyuan?

36
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,860
Can't do it

37
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,890
I can't do it, how scared are you.

38
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,990
Then you look like this for a reason.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,790
I have to cry for you.

40
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,290
You get out

41
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,320
What is this

42
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,890
I'm out and you clean.

43
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,160
Tonight, let's have a few drinks.

44
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,030
Come out soon

45
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,290
Can this stupid brat understand?

46
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,630
Do you have money?

47
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,760
Money will come soon

48
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,820
If you don't have wine, you will fall.

49
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,790
What are you doing

50
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,420
Not green

51
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,760
You must be angry now, why is your head down?

52
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,860
Bastard

53
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,590
Just let it out.

54
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,760
B*tch

55
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,090
What do you say you love?

56
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,730
Who loves her, I don't love her.

57
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,660
Don't love

58
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,530
After breaking up, you said that you never liked it.

59
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,690
Peace broke?

60
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,090
Yes, do you think I should live?

61
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,190
Do you know how I am with her?

62
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,820
Woman

63
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,860
Don't worry about the next days.

64
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,190
No matter what you become, I will help you.

65
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,360
You are waiting?

66
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,850
Woman waiting for you ...

67
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,990
Brother

68
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,590
Why aren't you answering me?

69
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,830
Do you have something to say to me?

70
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,230
Are you drunk?

71
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,630
This things

72
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,420
I give back to you.

73
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,990
Your stuff is in there

74
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,860
I'm leaving

75
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,260
Your c*nt smells like this ~

76
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:49,050
Why did you do this to me why why...

77
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,160
Who are you?

78
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,320
This smell ...

79
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,430
I

80
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,990
I'm new, I just moved next door.

81
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,090
Can you help me?

82
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,930
Very tired

83
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,020
No, don't stop, just go.

84
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,060
Thank you... thank you

85
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,850
Thank you

86
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,490
Oh, it is okay.

87
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,590
But

88
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,930
Is there a window in here?

89
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,720
No windows.

90
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,290
It's only temporary, so it's okay.

91
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,160
Oh, I see.

92
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,430
My name is Qiao Xi.

93
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,690
I... my name is Song Geometry.

94
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,090
Geometry Song

95
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,020
Thank you for helping me.

96
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,430
Would you like to drink?

97
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,090
Must be abandoned

98
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,260
Can't do it

99
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,890
If not found

100
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,920
I will always meet other men.

101
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,730
Still because I'm against women

102
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,130
Don't understand them at all

103
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,320
It seems that you are always hurt.

104
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,690
Not all women are the same

105
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,320
All women are the same

106
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,420
Men are also same

107
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,590
I am not

108
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,290
Are you not?

109
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,230
Very different?

110
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,160
Not the same

111
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,790
What's not

112
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,620
How many really good people in the world?

113
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,130
Calls me brotherlike this

114
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,930
When we broke up, nothing happened.

115
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,790
Don't talk about this topic if you hate it.

116
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,360
What is this all of a sudden?

117
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,060
I do not want this

118
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,460
Wake up

119
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,330
Didn't you say before

120
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,890
Don't take women now.

121
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,390
No

122
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,330
I

123
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,130
I am also very uncomfortable in my heart because of this

124
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,630
I'm not without pride

125
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,790
I've done it before

126
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,590
Have you ever had it?

127
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,930
Does that woman trust you?

128
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,490
Do skunks believe in me?

129
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,590
I should consider

130
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,620
making love

131
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,160
I'm not saying that I need to make love right now.

132
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,960
Making love doesn't solve everything.

133
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,690
But we have to have it.

134
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,420
Then do it with me.

135
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,220
Do it with me

136
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,690
Ah, really terrible.

137
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,260
It's really too disgusting

138
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,290
You look at me now.

139
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,690
Am I too good to be cheated?

140
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,860
Ah?

141
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,660
Even if I don't have it

142
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,290
I won't do it

143
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,860
That

144
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,360
If you're just kidding,

145
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,460
Isn't it wrong?

146
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,090
Wine?

147
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,430
Just finish up and go.

148
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,930
I'm sincere

149
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,630
I want to have sex with you.

150
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,250
Can I do this?

151
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,290
Of course.... It doesn't matter.

152
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,160
I don't need anything

153
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,250
Don't make it too complicated

154
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,820
Can I do it all I want?

155
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,160
So?

156
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,730
Like that ...

157
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,220
You are like my fantasy

158
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,960
Is that okay? Anything can be done.

159
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,360
One condition

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,450
I

161
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,550
will leave after three weeks

162
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,190
We can

163
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,760
stay together in these three weeks?

164
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,620
Wait....

165
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,960
What university are you currently a student at?

166
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,830
You can think like that.

167
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,690
But only three weeks

168
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,790
One more thing

169
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,420
After doing it

170
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,760
I have a wish

171
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,630
What is that?

172
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,190
Done

173
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,090
Dreaming?

174
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,690
Is this what you want to do?

175
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,090
Video call

176
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,550
Yes

177
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,890
But would this video call be alright?

178
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,290
No

179
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,690
You gotta take it off

180
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,860
What?

181
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,660
This... this dress

182
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,890
Enough, enough of that.

183
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,290
So?

184
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,690
Yes

185
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,560
Is that okay?

186
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,960
If not?

187
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,830
Gotta take it all off.

188
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,460
I am ready

189
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,260
Why can't you do it?

190
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,620
I can not take it anymore.

191
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,790
Body

192
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,190
Can not stand

193
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,290
So, who said something?

194
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,950
Still have no feelings?

195
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,460
Come again?

196
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,390
Where am I?

197
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,790
This... originally... wasn't a dream.

198
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,530
Woke up already?

199
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,160
You slept a long time

200
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,420
I sleep a lot... a lot

201
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,150
I just slept very late last night.

202
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,490
Sleep... sleep a lot

203
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,120
Scorching hot

204
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,460
Can I use your bathroom?

205
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,260
Mine seems broken and can't get water out.

206
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,350
Please use it.

207
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,520
Let's go

208
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,930
Well, take a walk

209
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,260
Brother

210
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,350
Where's the shower gel?

211
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,920
It's right there...

212
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,860
Where?

213
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,730
Right side of the box

214
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,890
Box?

215
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:45,020
It is on the side of the box

216
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:50,390
I'll help you find it, so don't move it.

217
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,590
Brother, let's go.

218
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,990
Where to?

219
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,330
Where do you want to go?

220
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,360
Then wash first.

221
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,090
Very cool

222
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,260
What is that?

223
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,660
That's too cool

224
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,960
Very beautiful

225
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,290
Coffee is coming

226
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,230
Thank you

227
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,730
The weather suddenly changed.

228
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,290
Did you enjoy today?

229
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,690
Very very

230
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,090
Even though I like it too

231
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,430
But it will be better than sunny days.

232
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,550
Do you like dates like this?

233
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,890
Do you do this often?

234
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,220
I think it's very special.

235
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,860
Special... special?

236
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,990
I have a familiar feeling like I've been here before.

237
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,860
I come here often

238
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,020
But

239
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,590
Have we met before?

240
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,690
Why are you so close...

241
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,560
Maybe.

242
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,190
Seoul is quite small.

243
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,290
Small?

244
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,030
Eat well

245
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,090
What are you doing

246
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,320
Your underwear ..

247
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,430
Not like that underwear.

248
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,990
What happened to the underwear?

249
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,950
It's not... it's not... it's no

250
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,450
Those... those panties... think want to be touched...

251
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,990
Do you know someone?

252
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,020
I have more important things now.

253
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,430
You go first

254
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,830
Are you crazy

255
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,460
I'm crazy, right.

256
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,120
Geometry Song

257
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,190
Hello, nice to meet you.

258
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,590
Hello, how are you?

259
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,690
Why are you here?

260
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,960
What could be the reason why a chicken soup shop must come to eat chicken?

261
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,930
Girlfriend?

262
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,730
Ah.... that

263
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,750
Yes, the girlfriend

264
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,320
Then wait a moment.

265
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,590
What's the situation?

266
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,160
Suddenly

267
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,030
A strange woman comes to my house

268
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,190
So?

269
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,290
We had sex...

270
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,160
Is that true?

271
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,590
Wait

272
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,930
are you like this after the end of Yingyuan?

273
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,790
Can you tell me?  Song Geometry

274
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,660
Song Geometry in that case

275
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,690
In my opinion, you are not an ordinary person.

276
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,090
You

277
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,490
having any difficulties?

278
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,360
You need money? Do you want me to help?

279
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,690
Can you not be nervous?

280
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,090
Absolutely not

281
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,890
It's all like a dream for me.

282
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,320
I don't know anything, suddenly you had sex.

283
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,190
I just can't figure it out.

284
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,290
Yes, please go.

285
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,160
I also want to eat ginseng chicken.

286
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,720
You just go, go on quickly.

287
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,590
Walk and walk

288
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,460
You dirty boy

289
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,860
What is dirty... dirty

290
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,660
Where is he going?

291
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,930
Oh no, forget about him.

292
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,560
Eat... eat cold... cold

293
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:34,790
Eat it

294
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,590
Right

295
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,930
My brother doesn't eat ginseng.

296
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,090
Har?

297
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,420
How.... do you know?

298
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,120
Ah?

299
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,620
Look

300
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,190
Just learning from your face

301
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,520
I

302
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,390
Is there a face type?

303
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,490
Let me share

304
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,060
something

305
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,920
Rock scissors cloth

306
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,420
Rock scissors cloth

307
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,830
The legs win and win.

308
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,930
Sorry

309
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,330
What?

310
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:00,860
Let's go

311
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,350
Are you having a hard time?

312
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,230
You need money. Do you want me to help?

313
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,790
Can you not be nervous?

314
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,820
Has she a hidden secret?

315
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,890
Please ask her again.

316
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,560
A strange woman for no reason comes to have sex with you.

317
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,120
Is it true?

318
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,090
What is that?

319
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,430
My seniors thinks it's ​​too good?

320
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,520
Ah scares me

321
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,930
Is there something wrong?

322
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:42,860
No

323
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,190
Good, I have nowhere to go.

324
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,890
Ah?

325
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,830
Let's go

326
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,990
Oh oh

327
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,990
What can I have?

328
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,430
Do you draw?

329
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,990
No, I don't paint

330
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,090
But really like it.

331
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,720
Me too

332
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,290
Still really like it?

333
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,790
Then you really like.

334
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,130
Cooking and walking

335
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,220
What do you not like?

336
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,390
I like it too.

337
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,160
Do you still like it?

338
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,790
Where is your hometown?

339
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,590
Don't want to mention

340
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,930
Are you alone in Seoul now?

341
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,720
Where did you go for school?

342
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,690
Can't you not ask me like this?

343
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,990
As long as I am still here

344
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,660
Don't want to talk about it

345
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,690
What you want to know?

346
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,720
I am just a little worried that you are staying with me.

347
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:58,460
I want to know some of your information.

348
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,550
We only have three weeks.

349
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,890
Can we be sexual for three weeks

350
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,990
This is enough.

351
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,530
Where are you going after three weeks?

352
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,620
I can keep a secret

353
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,730
Sex or nothing

354
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:16,890
Choose one

355
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,920
No matter which one you choose, I still have to go.

356
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,660
Can't choose?

357
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,330
No

358
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,660
Sex

359
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,220
What are the problems?

360
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,190
Ah is Dong Che

361
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,360
Aren't you going take it?

362
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,690
What?

363
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,560
Can you blame a stranger?

364
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,960
What is that

365
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,120
Have a drink

366
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,930
I definitely don't want to drink with you.

367
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,560
Wine? Drink up

368
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,650
Come to me please.

369
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,460
Okay, I'll be there.

370
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:01,690
Hang up

371
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,620
Hang up

372
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,590
What is Dong Che's friend?

373
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,860
Strong possessiveness for my family

374
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,530
Sorry that's true.

375
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,620
Brother

376
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,090
What happened? We met at this place.

377
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,490
Why did she call you brother?

378
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,090
Girl... friend?

379
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,720
Uh

380
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,290
I am his ex-girlfriend.

381
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,860
Very beautiful?

382
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,890
That's beautiful

383
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,920
Let's go, brother.

384
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,390
Song Geometry?

385
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,360
It is impossible.

386
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,860
Who is that?

387
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,730
She's beautiful.

388
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,450
Are you so stingy?

389
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,490
God, I agree with you.

390
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,290
I really hate drinking like that.

391
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,390
We're not little girls anymore

392
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,560
Yes

393
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,890
She's too big

394
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,690
Let's sing a song like this.

395
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,320
You don't girlfriend?

396
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,190
No, never have

397
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,650
Why?

398
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,530
Couldn't find the type like you

399
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,160
Have you never been there?

400
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,090
Previous

401
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,190
Such a beauty

402
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,590
Later

403
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,790
I want to be prettier, I haven't found her yet.

404
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,090
Now that the wine is done, you can go.

405
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,890
What to say, there is still plenty of wine to drink.

406
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,460
The bottles were empty and all were gone.

407
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,260
No problem with wine now.

408
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,290
Now there's no problem with wine.

409
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,860
I really today.

410
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,490
As long as you don't get it,
you will not give up

411
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,990
You go too.

412
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,890
You left Dong Che and left, I've cleaned up myself.

413
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,390
Really leaving?

414
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,730
Are you leaving?

415
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,150
What are you doing?

416
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,990
I really did not know

417
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,090
What do you know

418
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,590
Heard Hahahehe's voice

419
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,090
Can I do it in the morning?

420
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,590
No, I didn't know Dongge Ge would be here.

421
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,160
Listen to this, do you think I'll think so?

422
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,190
This is my house, why should I go out?

423
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,590
It's up to you to go

424
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,390
When is it finished?  This is stingy.

425
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,560
Stingy?

426
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,290
If you take back what you said, I won't let you go.

427
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,690
Then don't let people say anything.

428
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,390
Did you not close your mouth?

429
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,560
Yes

430
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,430
Don't you want me?

431
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,890
Do not know

432
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,520
Answer me, do you miss me?

433
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,790
Miss you

434
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,590
Let's do it

435
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,290
Now

436
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,390
Now

437
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,020
This is so crazy, so unpredictable.

438
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,590
I don't have time, I'm like this.

439
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,620
You come

440
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,730
Here, help me take it off

441
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,360
Your

442
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,690
Expression?

443
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,260
Marathon runners

444
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,060
Their expression when they
reach the finish line like this

445
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:58,950
Would it have worked out with my senior if I have given him money?

446
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,520
Which senior?

447
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,560
My brother probably doesn't remember it.

448
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,960
University time

449
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,390
I went back and forth and I got to know the seniors at that time.

450
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,890
Mine

451
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,990
Have you done anything like that at university?

452
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,160
Like it?

453
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,230
Like it?

454
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:35,590
Like it?

455
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,160
Oh, be quiet.

456
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,330
Like it?

457
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,490
Oh really.

458
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,360
Say no more.

459
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,090
Even if I like it, I still need to work hard

460
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,720
How do you work hard?

461
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,750
So what's the point of thinking?

462
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,650
Ah, but not all can satisfy me.

463
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,690
Geometry Song

464
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,320
Song Geometry?

465
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,650
There's this guy, Song Geometry

466
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,920
The most satisfying person in my life.

467
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,090
Geometry Song

468
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,290
God geometry

469
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,330
Is there a name called Qiao Xi?

470
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,730
Qiao Xi?

471
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,990
The seniors didn't seem to know Qiao Xi.

472
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,320
I don't know. I don't know.

473
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,730
I seem to remember.

474
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,760
Yes who

475
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,630
Tell me after the meeting

476
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,490
I'm uncomfortable right now

477
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,760
Can we meet?

478
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,030
Of course, we have to meet, how long have we not met?

479
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,290
Now I'm back to contact you in the field.

480
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,230
Geometry

481
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,860
I'm very glad

482
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,830
Ah, really.

483
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,160
How much?

484
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,760
- Thank you
- Thank you

485
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,330
Isn't she here?

486
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,350
The window is not closed

487
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,720
What is that?

488
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,490
Has she left?

489
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,790
It's right here.

490
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,990
I bought the pizza my brother liked.

491
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,450
Ohh!

492
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,960
I also bought the sandwich you like.

493
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,390
Was this bought at a roadside supermarket?

494
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,020
Uh

495
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,450
Weren't we awkward yesterday?

496
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,330
A similar situation did not arise

497
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,960
It's time to eat.

498
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,290
Yes, you have to eat well.

499
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,560
Eat well

500
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,490
Qiao Xi

501
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,830
Let's talk.

502
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,860
I hasn't been 21 days yet.

503
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,490
Why do I have to come

504
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,660
if you come

505
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,060
I still have to know

506
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,390
I only said that for three weeks

507
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,960
Can't say anything now

508
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,290
Who are you?

509
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,620
You know everything in the beginning.

510
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,650
So it becomes a strange woman who lives in my house.

511
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,990
Did I bother you?

512
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,090
There is nothing...

513
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,890
I

514
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,690
... am from the future

515
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,660
What do you say, will anyone believe?

516
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,020
Ok, then .. just leave it with you.

517
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:37,050
No matter what, I am very positive to tell you

518
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,860
What? You come from the future?

519
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,190
Then I am from the past

520
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,290
Come on.

521
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,890
Did you come from the future?

522
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,990
But I really believe in you.

523
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,860
Yan Yingyuan

524
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,750
Geometry seems to be drinking too much.

525
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,390
Oh

526
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,790
Ah, here it is

527
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,190
I'll send you the address.

528
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,530
Uh huh

529
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,790
Um Qiao Xi

530
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,820
I'm Dongche.

531
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,090
Qiao Xi

532
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,490
Dongche

533
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,690
Where is Geometry?

534
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,090
Don't mention him

535
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,030
What?

536
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,660
Why?

537
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,090
Aren't you fighting? Men need a little space.

538
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,660
Then, let him live alone.

539
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,830
Tonight

540
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,690
Drink with me.

541
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,630
Can you?

542
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,260
Waiter!

543
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,930
Beautiful, beautiful

544
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,390
Dongche!

545
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,490
Brother

546
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,990
Dongche

547
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,620
Brother

548
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,290
Why are you here?

549
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,030
Why are you here?

550
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,330
What's your situation

551
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:19,660
Brother

552
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,490
You're the same

553
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,890
I do not know anything.

554
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,760
Have you ever seen it with your own eyes?

555
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,790
Women are all the same, so are you

556
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,890
All the same evil woman

557
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,990
Evil woman?

558
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,090
Correct evil woman

559
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,090
Then man are the same.

560
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,190
You also know what I'm talking about.

561
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,290
It's all over

562
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,820
It's me... this is a mistake.

563
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:06,090
You don't have to apologize.

564
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,960
I drank a lot.

565
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,890
But

566
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,990
Dongche and you weren't right.

567
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,620
I think about this, I will...

568
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,430
me and Yingyuan were a mistake however

569
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,990
I haven't done anything with Yingyuan, so I said

570
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,660
So I said what I shouldn't say.

571
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,230
I'm also sorry that I'm in a bad mood.

572
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,090
I didn't say what I wanted to say.

573
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,360
My heart... is very depressed

574
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,690
Besides, I'm afraid you suddenly...

575
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,790
disappear, so...

576
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,120
I'm scared

577
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,250
Come and sit down

578
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,860
Why did you say this?

579
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,950
Just because I like you

580
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,890
Repent

581
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,060
No regrets

582
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,860
The weather is too hot, a little bit of heat

583
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,190
I know too

584
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,530
Don't mention that, the past is past

585
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,550
But I know

586
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,290
we forgot after we fought, we started again now.

587
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,230
okay

588
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,560
But

589
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,290
What do you mean by man?

590
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,630
Just a word, what can you do?

591
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,650
What does that mean? Who is that?

592
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,920
In my hometown

593
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,730
I had bad experience with love

594
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,060
So I came to Seoul.

595
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,690
Being tired is too tired

596
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,720
How about later?

597
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,830
What else can

598
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:34,760
Starting is good

599
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,320
After I don't like it, I just have to forget about it.

600
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,730
Who is that?

601
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:39,890
Secret

602
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,620
Qiao Xi

603
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:44,560
Ah?

604
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,490
Shall we ...

605
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,830
Is there a place we can go together?

606
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:48,520
Where?

607
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,620
Just the two of us

608
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,250
Go and go

609
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,690
I have something I want to do.

610
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,730
What?

611
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,430
It's so annoying that I've never done it before.

612
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:38,690
I want to explode, really.

613
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:43,590
Smelly dog, the most shameless boy in the world

614
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,930
Geometry is completely unaffected

615
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:08,330
What about us?

616
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,030
Come on, quickly.

617
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,160
My brother, I like the feeling of being with you now.

618
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,720
Sure enough, I have to do more.

619
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,060
Everything else doesn't seem important.

620
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,120
But good is good

621
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,760
Is it time to find a job?

622
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,630
What job?

623
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,650
You said I could work part time.

624
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,530
Does not work

625
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,390
Not working all this time

626
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,960
So far today

627
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,220
I hate that such a topic is here.

628
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:56,390
I know

629
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,890
I really hope that tomorrow will come soon.

630
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,920
I saw it for the first time.

631
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,790
Really looking forward to it?

632
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,530
Me too

633
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,960
I brought something very interesting.

634
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,660
What?

635
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,830
Wait

636
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,560
Interesting

637
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,660
What?

638
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:30,930
What's up with this?

639
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,590
Real happiness

640
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,560
Let's take a photo

641
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,690
1 2 3

642
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,960
That... that

643
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:50,530
Looks expensive

644
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,090
1 2 3

645
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:58,000
1 2

646
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,490
The ex-boss?

647
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,760
Don't know people you don't know

648
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,330
Ah?  What is that

649
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,660
Then I'll go first

650
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,390
Yes, do you have to ask me Is the end over?

651
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:23,660
Then I'll finish the coffee...

652
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,630
It hasn't been that long we haven't met.

653
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,230
Can you still not let it go now?

654
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,330
Life needs to be looked forward to

655
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,230
Have you worked on interviews recently?

656
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:02,390
What?

657
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,890
Surely you don't need to tell me when you are so busy recently.

658
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,530
No interview?

659
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:12,190
I have to work hard, why are seniors worried about it?

660
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,990
Come to my company to try it.

661
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,090
Can give you a representative position

662
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,260
Trust you

663
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,190
Is it true?

664
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,220
Of course, doing well would be like this.

665
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,620
Conditional

666
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:25,030
It is not easy to get it easily.

667
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,320
After coming, let's meet elsewhere in the company.

668
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,590
I suddenly remembered going out with Joe Hee.

669
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,760
Then

670
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,620
One time

671
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,030
with me

672
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,120
Where can you find such a good thing?

673
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,790
Fine ...  One time

674
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,590
But

675
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:51,390
Even though it was once

676
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,830
Is this special?

677
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:36,890
Is there something wrong?

678
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,920
There are many and

679
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,020
It's a bit noisy outside

680
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,830
How was the chat with your ex-boss?

681
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,460
Not going well?

682
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,490
It's like talking to someone like that...

683
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,530
My brother is not feeling well.

684
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,160
What happened?

685
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,960
Nothing, I'm fine

686
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,520
Really nothing?

687
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:02,790
Did your ex-boss not ask you anything?

688
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,890
You

689
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,160
Do you want to ask the ex-boss?

690
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,320
No

691
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,830
Just to get us ready

692
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,490
Wow that woman is terrible.

693
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,190
Brother

694
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,220
Let's face it sooner or later.

695
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,420
Brother, I am sincere.

696
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:27,060
Aren't you sincere too?

697
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,490
Contact with Ella's ex-boss

698
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,890
NO

699
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,990
Don't you want to do anything else?

700
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,620
Don't talk about this anymore.

701
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,730
Really

702
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,220
Put it back

703
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:17,920
No

704
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,330
Put it back

705
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:20,020
No

706
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:23,290
You put it back, let it go!

707
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:27,260
What's wrong with you?

708
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,360
You

709
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,990
Are you okay?

710
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:46,160
Are you really okay?

711
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,990
Come

712
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,860
Come in

713
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,960
Your girlfriend?

714
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,750
Prettier than other people.

715
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:16,960
The company is not bad.

716
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,360
Sit

717
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:22,550
This is a new place.

718
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,890
I haven't started making money yet.

719
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,630
But it's just a matter of time

720
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,290
Would you like to drink red wine?

721
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,490
What are we going to do here tonight?

722
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,890
Uh

723
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,160
The taste is quite unique.

724
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:47,520
I'm the one who has the final say.

725
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,020
Come on

726
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:58,730
From now on

727
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:00,130
Wait

728
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:02,220
Sign the agreement first.

729
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:02,920
What?

730
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,420
Wait for him to finish drinking before signing

731
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,160
Just stamp your fingerprints here.

732
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,920
Song Geometry, your girlfriend is really worried.

733
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,760
My brother is also ready to sign it.

734
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,160
Then we have to obey it

735
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,030
We will come to work tomorrow.

736
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:42,590
Ok, let's start now.

737
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,360
Why did you do it?

738
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:06,630
What are you doing

739
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,160
Joe He are you okay?

740
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,430
What are you doing?

741
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:45,590
Are you kidding me?

742
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,090
This is totally wrong for seniors.

743
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,190
Let's go.

744
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,790
Back

745
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,660
This cannot be done

746
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,060
Back soon

747
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,460
Whatever will be

748
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,730
It's okay to die.

749
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:16,390
It won't die, but even if it won't die, this too...

750
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:18,260
This is really... very wrong.

751
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,660
My brother really

752
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,930
Obviously it costs money

753
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,720
What?

754
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,360
Don't chase

755
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,760
Qiao Xi

756
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,390
What?

757
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,260
Sorry

758
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:56,990
You got the wrong person

759
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,320
That fool knows how long I've been waiting for you.

760
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,600
I've actually found the answer.

761
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,760
Why

762
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,690
I

763
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:50,190
I will get bored after starting serious work.

764
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,590
Maybe counterproductive

765
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,090
The most uncontrollable thing in evil society is the human heart.

766
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:58,590
if you insist, you will be eliminated.  I love you.

767
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,620
Don't tell me if you know.

768
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,360
Right for me

769
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,450
On my way back, I saw someone who looked like you.

770
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,090
It's exactly the same person.

771
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,520
Is this a worker at a convenience store?

772
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,390
Have you seen her too?

773
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,420
Then of course you are prettier

774
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:23,090
It happens so fast.

775
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,820
I want to take care of my sister.

776
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:28,690
Are you right

777
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,420
She is me

778
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:34,760
I am a student.

779
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,560
Qiao Xi is my mother's name.

780
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:43,850
Brother, come on in, it's kind of cold in here.

781
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,930
Time passes so quickly.

782
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,790
I

783
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,660
am going back to the future

784
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:14,190
I told you before, even though it's hard to understand.

785
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,290
I am really back from the future

786
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,730
Because your brother hurt me.

787
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:23,990
At that time, there was someone

788
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,330
Give me this, let me come back

789
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,650
Back again

790
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,460
Brother, the worker you met.

791
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,330
This was me

792
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,360
What?

793
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:40,560
I said it before.

794
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:43,830
I came to Seoul from my hometown.

795
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,090
We also met at that time

796
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:49,660
At that time, you always helped me.

797
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,850
I don't really know you, but you always do a lot for me.

798
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:58,530
I am filled with thanks for what you did.

799
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:01,330
Brother, you always protect me.

800
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:04,130
At that time, we worked together.

801
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:08,090
Brother, you always work hard.

802
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,190
Just act on you

803
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,990
Where are you not feeling well?

804
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,660
I'm fine, this is reality.

805
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:19,290
100% correct

806
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,850
Speaking of which, no one believes in reality

807
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,430
Hey, let's move on, let me listen.

808
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:30,020
I am very grateful to my brother.

809
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,820
I'm so pissed off

810
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:36,330
Reluctantly to Seoul

811
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,290
Whatever you do, you plan to leave.

812
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:43,090
My brother wants to take care of me.

813
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,490
This is huge

814
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,690
What you said is really great.

815
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,960
It's not listening to your words, so sad.

816
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,590
But

817
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,460
So what is it?

818
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,860
Like that

819
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,890
How do you explain this twin and Joe Hee?

820
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,760
I am not finished.

821
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:06,190
After my sister was hospitalized

822
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,290
The doctor said

823
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,160
My brother's situation is too serious.

824
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,420
I don't know if I can wake up.

825
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,390
At that time, there was an uncle.

826
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:20,190
Give me this device

827
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,230
Say that I can go back in time

828
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:24,860
What can I do casually?

829
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,260
You

830
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,660
must be kidding

831
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,530
Name the Song Geometry

832
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:31,860
You used to have a good grandmother.

833
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,660
Something failed, don't do anything

834
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:38,390
In University you majoring in computer

835
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:40,960
Always good character

836
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,830
Angry but disappear quickly

837
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:45,620
Someone who is very lonely sometimes

838
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,120
You know my life

839
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,760
And its predecessors too...

840
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,320
We have too many of these

841
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,120
Why me?

842
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:01,260
When you choose to go back in time, you can change the reason you found me.

843
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:02,890
I thought about it.

844
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:08,030
I want to meet my brother in my destiny.

845
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,460
Go back to the past and see my brother's life.

846
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,030
My brother has a lot to do.

847
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:18,760
How depressed watching my brother broken hearted

848
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,850
Because of women

849
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:23,420
I saw how sad my brother was.

850
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,790
I want to come to my brother to heal pain.

851
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,590
Sincerely

852
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,490
The call you made is busy

853
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,760
Please leave a message after the beep

854
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,330
I looked for you everywhere.

855
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,330
Where are you going?

856
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,350
Just turned around

857
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,990
It is over

858
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,490
I come back when I go outside.

859
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,460
Live like this, nothing.

860
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:42,490
This is a great place to be with Dong Che

861
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,360
After all, he's very rich.

862
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,160
Brother

863
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,950
I want to be with you now.

864
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,690
Let's stick together for the last few days.

865
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:56,260
Are you really

866
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,990
going back to the future?

867
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,990
What do you want to do today?

868
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,030
Make love

869
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,290
Looks like I can do better here.

870
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,320
And my brother?

871
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:39,660
It's great fun together

872
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,520
We ...

873
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,860
Is it possible to meet again?

874
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:48,130
That

875
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,220
No one knows

876
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:52,090
Then

877
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:54,890
Is this over?

878
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,760
Uncle

879
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,850
Didn't say anything

880
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:01,420
Back to the past

881
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:04,690
Do lots of things

882
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,260
I don't know what will happen in the future.

883
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,060
But

884
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:11,690
I will not regret

885
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:14,960
Qiao Xi

886
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:17,290
I love you

887
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,390
me too

888
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,330
That

889
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:05,590
There is a student here who worked part time?

890
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,460
Did she come today?

891
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:09,090
We don't have this person here.

892
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,720
Oh okay

893
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:17,230
This kind of work is no good.

894
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:20,250
I'm new and haven't done in a few days.

895
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,360
You can't do it

896
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:23,530
That is, too

897
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:25,390
You can use more snacks.

898
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:06,220
Now, whoever feels that you have power, you can do it.

899
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:08,320
Aish..

900
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,590
I see it with more difficulty.

901
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:13,690
Ah?

902
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,790
Some new hires are coming.

903
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:18,120
Hey, it's a woman.

904
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,790
Hello, I'm a student.

905
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:41,930
That chick is very beautiful.

906
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,720
She must have a boyfriend.

907
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:48,220
Hey

908
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:51,960
Ah, ah, ah.

909
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,390
Hey I... let me

910
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:19,260
Thank you

911
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:26,260
Here

912
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,660
Thank you

913
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,030
Sorry

914
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,890
No, nothing

915
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,090
Yes, yes

916
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:50,290
Yes, I'll be right away.

917
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:58,460
Hi

918
01:14:58,460 --> 01:14:59,620
Waiting for you

919
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:00,320
Yes

920
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:01,490
Run fast

921
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,290
Run fast.

922
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,560
It is okay.

923
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,490
What to do

924
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,820
Tears have been left

925
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,030
The original lacrimal glands are highly developed.

926
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,260
Geometry won't die

927
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:41,630
Only the tears can't stop

928
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:46,760
I don't know why it hurts so much.

929
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,020
Who is that?

930
01:15:57,030 --> 01:15:58,430
This smell...

931
01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:59,830
I

932
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:02,160
I'm new, I just moved next door.

933
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:04,490
Can you help me?

934
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,530
Eat well

935
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:38,760
I

936
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,090
Remember it all

937
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,260
Hey

938
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,660
What?

939
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,390
Geometry is fine.

940
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,020
Do you know how much I worry about you?

941
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,520
Brother

942
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:01,390
you

943
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:04,420
When I was here

944
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:07,920
Tears flowed

945
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,420
Past memories came to me.

946
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:13,530
I remember it all

947
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,790
All the time spent with my brother

948
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,460
It's me, Joe Hee.

949
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,120
Qiao Xi

950
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,730
Qiao Xi

951
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,330
Brother

952
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:07,650
We've been here a few times tonight.

953
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,990
Oh thirty times.

954
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:13,020
I don't want to stop like this.

955
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:15,120
I know that I will meet you.

956
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:16,990
Brother is too fast

957
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,160
Wait a minute
