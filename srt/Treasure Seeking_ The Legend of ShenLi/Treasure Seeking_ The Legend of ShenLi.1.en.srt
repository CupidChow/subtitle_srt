1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,920
This is the D City.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,520
We're sitting
in the family heads' seats.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:09,840
(Madam and Lord)

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,320
Are they having a wedding?

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,760
So we are a wedding services company.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,200
Right.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,560
GPS.

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,680
This is GPS.

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,200
We wish you two

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,920
a lifetime of happiness together.

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,200
May you have children soon.

12
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,320
We're having a wedding.

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,320
(Set up the bridal chamber)
It symbolizes a life without worries.

14
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,320
We need to breathe on and wipe it?

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,840
Don't come over.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,680
What is there to be afraid of?

17
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,416
(Help)

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,320
No way.

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,960
Congratulations to young master
and miss on the ceremony.

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,120
(We wish you a lifetime of happiness
together and may you have children soon.

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,120
(Ghost bride reappears on the wedding day)
It's the ghost bride.

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,400
What's going on?

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,600
It's me.

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,000
Qin Li.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,560
There are many story plots

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,080
that are corresponding
to some plots in our drama.

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,400
It feels as if we were still on the set.

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,520
I think I've taken a liking to you.

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,360
Congrats on getting married.

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,480
Thank you,
all friends in front of the screen,

31
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,800
for your fondness
of The Legend of ShenLi.

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,440
I think what you all say is right..

33
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,720
How should I put it?

34
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,568
(What exactly did Zhao Liying say
to the The Legend of ShenLi audience?)

35
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,760
Rumor has it that in ancient times,

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,440
Chimei was sealed
by Lord Bicang, ShenLi,

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,800
together with other immortals.

38
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,720
But a wisp of its soul accidentally fled

39
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,800
to somewhere unknown.

40
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,040
And it's been recently heard

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,320
that D City has been experiencing
continuous terrifying events,

42
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,640
disturbing the peace
of the common people's lives.

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,400
There are significant signs
of Chimei's reappearing.

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,640
The winds of turmoil brought by Chimei

45
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,680
have finally reached D City.

46
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,329
Wait. Where is D City?

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,240
It's a metropolis that exists
within a parallel universe.

48
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,080
Here, the night sky
is always shrouded in dark clouds,

49
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,320
And there are all sorts
of oddly shaped towering buildings.

50
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,160
In order to ensure the city's
long-term stability and security

51
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,200
and completely quell the chaos of Chimei，

52
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:47,800
start deducing.

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,280
We've invited the original cast
of The Legend of ShenLi

54
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,160
to Treasure Seeking.

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,640
ShenLi,

56
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,560
Xingzhi,

57
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,360
Heavenly Lord,

58
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,280
Furong,

59
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,160
Ms. Jin,

60
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,000
and Mo Fang, who's reborn and revived,

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,520
will become mortals

62
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,640
to undertake the special mission
of sealing Chimei.

63
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,640
They must join hands to find

64
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,480
the incarnation of Chimei
in the Mortal Realm

65
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,440
and the three spiritual relics
for sealing Chimei.

66
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,040
According to secret reports
from the Divine Realm,

67
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,360
these three powerful spiritual relics

68
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,960
are hidden in the Qin Mansion
in the city

69
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,160
and places near it.

70
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,832
(Baihua Hotel)

71
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,920
Can they track down

72
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,120
the root cause of the disturbance
by Chimei in D City.

73
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,120
And what kind of ending

74
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,160
will the special encounter
lead the immortals to?

75
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:03,040
(Here comes Grandfather)

76
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,640
This is the D City.

77
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:08,544
(Liu Guanlin as Heavenly Lord
in The Legend of ShenLi)

78
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,720
We are all here in the Mortal Realm
for a mission.

79
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,160
How come I, the high and mighty
Heavenly Lord, am the first to arrive?

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,360
Come out.

81
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,984
(He Yu as Furong
in The Legend of ShenLi)

82
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:23,008
(Wang Yiyao as Ms. Jin
in The Legend of ShenLi)

83
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:24,011
(Xin Yunlai as Mo Fang
in The Legend of ShenLi)

84
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,360
(These youngsters)
You've gone too far.

85
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,840
You actually made me,
the Heavenly Lord, come by myself.

86
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,520
You are all late.

87
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,680
(So unruly)

88
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,920
How about I knee down and slip in?

89
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:33,428
(Here comes a classic scene)

90
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:34,560
Where is Li?

91
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,160
Call her. She should have arrived too.

92
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,440
Li?

93
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,200
ShenLi?

94
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,240
I'm here. How dare you?

95
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,256
(Zhao Liying as ShenLi
in The Legend of ShenLi)

96
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,880
She is here.

97
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,160
Li!

98
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,400
ShenLi, long time no see.

99
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,191
(Isn't this my fiancée?)

100
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,840
We have arrived at D City.

101
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,360
Where is the last one of us?

102
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,320
Lord Xingzhi.

103
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,960
Your Excellency?

104
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:12,960
Xingzhi?

105
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,840
- Your Excellency?
- Would you dare to answer?

106
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,840
Your Excellency?

107
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,800
(He presumably doesn't dare)

108
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,680
Let's look for him.

109
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,552
(Where on earth
is the Lord Xingzhi hiding?)

110
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,080
There is a vat.

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,880
(The vat issue)
Here?

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Not particularly ideal either.

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,720
My vat!

114
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,480
There is a vat.

115
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,440
For real?

116
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,960
Is he really here?

117
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,280
Is it hot?

118
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,440
Come out.

119
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,680
Have you been here since last night?

120
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,480
I arrived too early.
So I took a nap for a while.

121
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,200
You just like vats.

122
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,800
Hello, everyone! I'm

123
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,520
the last old thing of ancient times.

124
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,400
No, the last god
of ancient times, Xingzhi.

125
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:06,520
(Lin Gengxin as Xingzhi/Xingyun
in The Legend of ShenLi)

126
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,040
How about we just sit here and talk?

127
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,600
We're sitting
in the family heads' seats.

128
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,680
Really?

129
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,560
Let me tell you something.

130
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,080
Well.

131
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,720
We came down from the Divine Realm

132
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,920
for a mission.

133
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,200
Heavenly Lord, how about you sit here?

134
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,520
No need, I'll just stand.
Otherwise, I might forget my lines.

135
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,400
You have quite a lot to say, huh?

136
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,480
We came to D City for a big mission.

137
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,040
My secretary from the Divine Realm

138
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,440
has already
transmitted the mission here.

139
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,480
But the signal in the Mortal Realm
might not be so good.

140
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,000
It's already scattered
around here, so we should look for it.

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,864
(The mission is hidden
within the Qin Mansion)

142
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,760
Let's start.

143
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,840
We should turn things over, huh?

144
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,480
Let's search.

145
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,880
Now we can start looking.

146
00:06:42,272 --> 00:06:44,896
(Current mission:
to find the celestial token)

147
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,120
Are they having a wedding?

148
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:01,400
(Where could the token be placed?)

149
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,520
The first challenge is so hard.

150
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,400
It's here.

151
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,440
Here is a pouch.

152
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,840
(Highlight moment: pouch spotted)
Bring it out.

153
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,080
ShenLi is really good.

154
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,960
Well done.

155
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,400
The bearer of wisdom is here.
Do you see it?

156
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,400
Let me see what it is.

157
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:26,016
(New item acquired:
identity card, celestial token)

158
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,040
Your identity for today is:

159
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,120
Zhao Liying in Mortal Realm.

160
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,840
Your position in Mortal Realm
is the president of Joyous Club

161
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,760
in The Legend of ShenLi.

162
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,680
Characteristic:
sentimental and sensitive.

163
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,080
Lin Gengxin in Mortal Realm.

164
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,800
Bold but meticulous.

165
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,080
The Joyous Club is from ancient times.

166
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,520
It offers wedding services.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,880
Hence the decorations.

168
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,160
So we're a wedding celebration company,

169
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,520
Yes, we are its employees.

170
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,560
The celestial token.

171
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,320
For three years, Chimei has been
causing trouble in D City.

172
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,920
We must find the incarnation of Chimei
in the Mortal Realm

173
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,800
in the Qin Mansion and nearby

174
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,520
and acquire
the three spiritual relics of Chimei

175
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,200
to successfully seal it.
We must seal it.

176
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,112
Now, the Mortal Realm is in the era
of the Republic of China.

177
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:15,720
In order not to disturb the mortals,

178
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,240
this mission requires stealth.

179
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,840
Everyone will be unable
to use divine powers.

180
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,040
We will have no divine powers then.

181
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,960
And you must act here
under new identities.

182
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,560
Additionally, the Divine Realm
has prepared a special treasure for you.

183
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,800
It's called GPS.

184
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,600
What?

185
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,280
What is that?

186
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,960
The GPS thing.

187
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,720
Geposi.

188
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,880
Here is one.

189
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,080
We found something.

190
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,040
Underneath this platform is a safe

191
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,320
with a password.

192
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,960
This is a navigation GPS.

193
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,840
It will guide you
to find the spiritual relics of Chimei

194
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,560
and assist you
in completing the mission.

195
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,280
There's no time to lose.
Open it quickly

196
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,600
and start today's special mission.

197
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,600
It was so difficult just now
to find these cards.

198
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,320
This thing...

199
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,280
The key is that we
haven't found the password.

200
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,880
What are you doing?

201
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,000
What are you doing?

202
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,720
Someone is talking inside?

203
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't touch me.

204
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,840
I'm warning you again. Don't touch me.

205
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,920
Don't touch it.

206
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,120
Are you from Henan?

207
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Do you know who I am
to touch me so casually?

208
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,240
So who are you?

209
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,160
Who are you?

210
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
Since you've asked so sincerely,

211
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
I'll be magnanimous and tell you.

212
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,960
I am the little chest
protecting the treasure.

213
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,800
Little check?

214
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,880
Little chest.

215
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,400
Tell me what your password is.

216
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
I'll give you a question.

217
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,611
If you answer correctly,
you'll be able to open the lock.

218
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:43,771
But I'll only say the question once.

219
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:45,171
Listen carefully.

220
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:47,851
Here I go.

221
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:49,491
If you don't speak, we'll leave.

222
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:51,531
The question is,

223
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:53,651
seven minus thirteen.

224
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:55,731
Seven minus thirteen?

225
00:09:55,731 --> 00:09:56,571
What?

226
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:57,451
Negative six.

227
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,291
And what does that have to do
with this chest?

228
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:02,131
Is that all?

229
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:04,611
Alright then.

230
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:07,851
Negative six.

231
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:09,611
Let me study these letters for a moment.

232
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:16,451
Each wheel has ten letters.

233
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:17,371
Ten?

234
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:18,491
Ten letters.

235
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:24,051
QJSS.

236
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,451
*Seven minus thirteen, right?

237
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:29,491
Okay, let me see if there's a Q.

238
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:30,771
There's no Q?

239
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:31,651
There is.

240
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:37,331
That's not right.
The second where doesn't have a J.

241
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:38,851
That is...

242
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:39,771
There isn't?

243
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:40,931
Each where is different.

244
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:44,731
*F SIX.

245
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,691
FSIX.

246
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:49,331
There's no F.

247
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,291
Negative means B.

248
00:10:53,931 --> 00:10:55,451
B is underground or negative.

249
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:56,891
Is there an S?

250
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:57,531
There's no S.

251
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,491
What is B?

252
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:00,531
- B1 and B2.
- They are not negative

253
00:11:01,251 --> 00:11:02,291
They're not negative one or two.

254
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:04,971
An underground parking garage?

255
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:09,571
*There should be 'liu' for six.

256
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:12,931
But this one doesn't have an I.

257
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:15,811
What are you doing?

258
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:17,451
*I can't believe it.

259
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:18,491
It does not have an F.

260
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:21,411
FLOW, right?

261
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:25,171
There is no F.

262
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,771
Bro, it's unbelievable.

263
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,291
My brain cells are gone。

264
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,011
Had I known it was this hard,
I wouldn't have come.

265
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:34,891
Let's go back.

266
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,771
I'll return to my snow mountain.

267
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:37,931
Use your brain.

268
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:41,531
Use your brain.

269
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:51,451
There is no F.

270
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:55,131
I think we should consider the pun.

271
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:55,891
Yes, the pun.

272
00:11:55,891 --> 00:11:56,771
It must be a pun.

273
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:59,651
Yes, negative six.

274
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:01,371
*I can't believe it.

275
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:02,811
Negative six.

276
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:04,491
I think it's related to...

277
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:07,051
Although it's a pun,
is it related to us?

278
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:07,771
Negative six.

279
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,931
How do you say 'negative six'
in Henan dialect?

280
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,091
Say 'negative six'.

281
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:17,651
What?

282
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,371
Say it again.

283
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:20,891
*Gourd?

284
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:22,491
Gourd.

285
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,011
Does the first wheel have an H?

286
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:26,051
Yes.

287
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:26,811
Is there an H?

288
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:27,251
Yes.

289
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:28,891
Is there a HU?

290
00:12:29,491 --> 00:12:30,331
Yes, HU.

291
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:37,051
We did it!

292
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:38,531
We did it!

293
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:42,451
How did we do that?

294
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:43,611
What is it?

295
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:45,171
It's *gourd.

296
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:48,731
Gourd! Oh my goodness!

297
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:50,651
Which accent is this?

298
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,691
What are you doing?

299
00:12:57,216 --> 00:13:00,811
(New items acquired: GPS,
GPS User Guide, Dazzling Brilliance)

300
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:02,291
GPS User Guide.

301
00:13:02,691 --> 00:13:04,211
This treasure is named 'GPS'.

302
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:05,851
It can locate Chimei's spiritual relics.

303
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,011
However, its use requires
a large amount of spiritual power.

304
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:11,491
Therefore, it must always be carried
on the back by an ancient god.

305
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,931
Carry it then.

306
00:13:12,931 --> 00:13:13,651
What medicine
are you selling (from the gourd)?

307
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:15,611
To provide it with energy at any time.

308
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:17,331
It has three modes.

309
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:18,491
First, treasure-hunting mode.

310
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:22,011
If it senses that Chimei' spiritual relics
are hidden within a space,

311
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:24,171
GPS will give a prompt.

312
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,771
Second, appraisal mode.

313
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:29,251
If you location an item suspected
to be a spiritual relic of Chimei,

314
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:32,411
you can sincerely ask GPS together
and say,

315
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:36,371
"GPS,
is this a Chimei's spiritual relic?"

316
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:38,051
If it is confirmed
to be a spiritual relic,

317
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,091
GPS will give a prompt,

318
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:41,451
saying, "It is".

319
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:43,131
Third, assistance mode.

320
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:44,291
At critical moments,

321
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,771
GPS will provide miraculous assistance.

322
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,171
Please check the messages.

323
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:49,611
But due to unstable signal,

324
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,571
GPS will not be online all the time.

325
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:53,691
Note, GPS is naturally
haughty and tsundere.

326
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:55,411
When conversing with it,
be sure to use

327
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:56,971
the most gentle tone of your life.

328
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:57,931
We need to be gentle.

329
00:13:58,091 --> 00:13:59,371
Let me try first.

330
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,131
Let's use this. Zhao Liying, ask GPS.

331
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,011
You have to use your gentlest tone.

332
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:04,851
Alright, gentle.

333
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:10,611
GPS?

334
00:14:10,611 --> 00:14:11,691
This is GPS.

335
00:14:13,891 --> 00:14:15,571
You are asking the wrong one.

336
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:22,571
You mistook GPS.
It might not be too happy.

337
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:29,131
GPS,

338
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:34,291
is this the spiritual relic
from Immortal Realm?

339
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:38,811
It's not this one.

340
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:40,451
Look how sweet it is.

341
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:41,611
And then look at you.

342
00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:42,571
It's so sweet.

343
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:44,651
Clear your throat.

344
00:14:48,171 --> 00:14:49,331
What's that light for anyway?

345
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:53,491
A spiritual relic from Divine Realm
that shines brightly.

346
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:55,931
Signal is unstable. So it's on and off.

347
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:57,651
Please always carry with you.

348
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,091
If you have a request,

349
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:01,531
please ask for help
loudly and sincerely.

350
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:03,331
This is one of the spiritual relics.

351
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:05,371
GPS,

352
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,971
is this one of those three spiritual relics?

353
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:13,131
You're asking it wrong.

354
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,251
You're asking it wrong.

355
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:16,531
You need to use your sweetest tone.

356
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:17,051
You're asking like this.

357
00:15:17,051 --> 00:15:18,251
You do it.

358
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:24,051
GPS,

359
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:29,131
is this a Chimei's spiritual relic?

360
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:31,371
No, it's not.

361
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:32,171
No, it's not.

362
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:39,811
What's that?

363
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:43,411
What is this, head steward?

364
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:45,411
Hello.

365
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:46,611
I'm not well.

366
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:52,051
Are you the bride and groom?

367
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,691
Do we look like it?

368
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:58,331
Please introduce yourself simply.

369
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:00,451
I am the new steward of the Qin mansion.

370
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:02,211
(Portrayed by Cui Shaoyang, Steward Cui of Qin Mansion) You can just call me Steward Cui.

371
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:02,891
Steward Cui

372
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:07,131
(Portrayed by Lin Shihan, Mistress Lin, the female steward of Qin Mansion) I am Mistress Lin, the female steward of Qin Mansion.

373
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:10,331
Steward Cui, Mistress Lin

374
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:13,051
Today is our young master A'shou's sixteenth wedding.

375
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:14,251
Sixteen times.

376
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,411
That's right, you didn't hear wrong.

377
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:19,851
Your young master must be in great health.

378
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:23,211
There are many positions at our weddings.

379
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:26,251
Like the master of ceremonies, musicians, and the bridal crying troupe.

380
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:28,731
I hope that you will actively compete for every position,

381
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:30,211
With great enthusiasm.

382
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:41,211
Is it this one?

383
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:42,731
No, come back quickly.

384
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:47,611
We thought each of us had to copy one task.

385
00:16:47,611 --> 00:16:49,171
Having a special fondness for that gong.

386
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:54,051
And I personally have a lot of experience in weddings,

387
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:55,251
Very experienced indeed.

388
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:56,651
How could I not be experienced?

389
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,811
Our master recently acquired from the Westerners,

390
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,291
A novel item.

391
00:17:03,611 --> 00:17:04,611
A flute from the West.

392
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:06,851
Let's call it a Western flute.

393
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:08,931
Western flute.

394
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:11,531
Each of you needs to play the Western flute

395
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,691
And perform a piece,

396
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:14,211
Which you think is most suitable for

397
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:15,731
A wedding performance.

398
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:16,611
We will decide the final choice.

399
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:19,571
Come on, let's start with Liu Guanlin.

400
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:22,571
Then I'll play something festive.

401
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:23,451
No problem

402
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:32,891
Like

403
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:40,131
Good

404
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:42,091
Out of breath

405
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:43,651
There's something

406
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:45,811
A little tune

407
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,371
It's silent love

408
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:02,051
What are you doing?

409
00:18:03,011 --> 00:18:05,051
It doesn't have enough note on it.

410
00:18:12,411 --> 00:18:14,491
Yes, I understand that
genius requires a process.

411
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:15,251
It's okay.

412
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:16,691
You're great.

413
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:18,851
It feels like we are playing charades.

414
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:20,371
All these hard work
but couldn't get the answer right.

415
00:18:21,971 --> 00:18:23,251
Come on, Xin Yunlai.

416
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:30,091
Isn't it inappropriate
to do this at a wedding?

417
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:31,291
I love you?

418
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:33,691
I thought there was a cow.

419
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,451
And he's also the conductor.

420
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:44,731
You didn't keep the rhythm at all.

421
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:48,451
Come on.

422
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:50,011
Okay, it's Wang Yiyao's turn.

423
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:04,971
Good?

424
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:06,931
Very impressive, a sad love song.

425
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:10,011
Our marriage is a joyful occasion,
not a funeral.

426
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:12,931
Your music is for dead people.

427
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:14,171
Come on, Zhao Liying.

428
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:24,331
How did she do it?

429
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,371
How is she so funny?

430
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:26,451
A small vibrato.

431
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:36,371
Our young master, Qin Shou,

432
00:19:36,371 --> 00:19:37,691
this is his favorite song.

433
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:38,291
Favorite.

434
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,931
"Pigsy Carrying His Wife"

435
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:41,984
Just exactly what he wants.

436
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:43,651
He Yu, come on.

437
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:49,851
They're doing an ensemble.

438
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:55,851
Great.

439
00:19:57,091 --> 00:19:57,971
It sounds happy, indeed.

440
00:19:57,971 --> 00:19:58,971
Brilliant.

441
00:20:00,411 --> 00:20:04,451
Okay, in terms of emotion and appeal,

442
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:06,371
our chief musician this time will be

443
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:16,211
Liu Guanlin.

444
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:21,731
Personally,
I think it should be Zhao Liying.

445
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:23,291
Your opinion means nothing to me.

446
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:27,611
Here I present,

447
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:29,891
our host of this wedding ceremony

448
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:32,371
will be Lin Gengxin.

449
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:39,251
And the chief wedding singer
is Zhao Liying.

450
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:39,691
Okay!

451
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:43,891
Okay!

452
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:45,607
(The staffs of Qin Shou's Wedding:
Host, Lin Gengxin)

453
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:46,592
(Music Band: Liu Guanlin,
Xin Yunlai, He Yu)

454
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:47,611
(Singer: Zhao Liying, Wang Yiyao)

455
00:20:47,611 --> 00:20:49,251
Help me with these.

456
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:51,371
One more thing I need to say.

457
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:56,971
Come on, lean in closer.

458
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:03,011
In the past three years, we might have

459
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,411
offended some kind of "ghost".

460
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:07,131
Every time at a wedding,

461
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:09,971
when the groom is about to
lift the bride's veil,

462
00:21:11,091 --> 00:21:12,371
he's always uncertain

463
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,531
whether he'll see
the bride's beautiful face

464
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:15,808
or a...

465
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:21,251
I'm sorry.

466
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:21,811
Sprite.

467
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:34,051
Stay away from me.

468
00:21:34,051 --> 00:21:35,331
I'm scared.

469
00:21:35,331 --> 00:21:37,811
You scared me to death.

470
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:39,531
I'm just messing around.

471
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,771
It's not scary.

472
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:48,611
Let me finish the story first.

473
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:51,331
When the terrifying bride appears,

474
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:53,131
Don't...

475
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:55,331
there will be a bunch of singers

476
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:58,731
pop up all at once.

477
00:21:59,571 --> 00:22:01,131
They come with the ghost wind.

478
00:22:01,531 --> 00:22:03,891
They would howl and cry,

479
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:04,931
begging the bride to stay.

480
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:10,331
It's the terrifying bride every time?

481
00:22:10,331 --> 00:22:11,931
Because when the groom lifts the veil,

482
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,931
he can't tell if it's the bride

483
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:16,051
or an extremely horrified face,
with blood all over.

484
00:22:18,091 --> 00:22:19,651
What should we do?

485
00:22:19,651 --> 00:22:22,091
After these strange things,

486
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,371
the real bride will be missing.

487
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,091
Now we...

488
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,571
I really don't want to...

489
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:37,131
I just don't want to stand there.

490
00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:42,371
But don't worry, luck is on our side.

491
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:44,291
This certainly won't happen to us.

492
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:46,811
So, Lin Gengxin and Zhao Liying,

493
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:49,691
you two are fully in charge
of the bridal chamber

494
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:50,931
to see if everything is in place.

495
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:52,171
The checklist,

496
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,651
we put it on the table
in the bridal chamber.

497
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:55,731
The remaining four, follow Miss Lin.

498
00:22:55,731 --> 00:22:57,331
To review the funny wedding slogans.

499
00:22:57,331 --> 00:22:57,611
Okay.

500
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:58,171
Is that alright?

501
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:01,371
He's going out?

502
00:23:01,371 --> 00:23:02,051
Yes.

503
00:23:03,411 --> 00:23:05,371
Okay, repeat after me.

504
00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:08,451
Congratulations to young master
and miss on the ceremony.

505
00:23:13,011 --> 00:23:17,771
Wishing you bath in love forever,
and prosperous offsprings.

506
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:25,531
Okay, we good?

507
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:26,771
What was the first line again?

508
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:28,971
Wish young master
and miss on the ceremony.

509
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:31,211
Congratulations to young master
and miss on the ceremony.

510
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:34,291
Congratulations first,
then the wishes. Okay.

511
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,931
The two of you, come on.

512
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:37,131
Let's review it one more time.

513
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:38,531
Facing the direction
of the bridal chamber.

514
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:38,931
Okay.

515
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:43,136
Congratulations to young master
and miss on the ceremony.

516
00:23:52,992 --> 00:24:02,080
(Bridal Chamber)

517
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:04,931
Shall we take a look inside?

518
00:24:06,691 --> 00:24:07,691
I have an idea.

519
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:10,571
I think you might be quite careless.

520
00:24:10,571 --> 00:24:12,211
I'll lock the door for you first.

521
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:15,931
After you've dealt with all matters.

522
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:16,971
I will let you out.

523
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,531
The checklist, we put it

524
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:24,211
on the table in the bridal chamber.

525
00:24:24,211 --> 00:24:25,051
It's there.

526
00:24:26,651 --> 00:24:27,611
Here.

527
00:24:27,611 --> 00:24:28,091
Okay.

528
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:29,371
Clear the mirror.

529
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:31,091
Please sit on the wedding stools.

530
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:34,331
Together, wipe the dressing mirror
three times, carefully.

531
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:36,851
Be sure to breathe upon
and wipe it repeatedly.

532
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,651
Leave not a single speck of dust on it.

533
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:40,571
That means a worry-free life.

534
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:44,691
Breathe upon and wipe it repeatedly.

535
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:46,211
I'll breathe on it, and you wipe.

536
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,411
Sit here, it says the two of us.

537
00:24:49,211 --> 00:24:51,136
You have to wipe it too.

538
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:53,851
But we still have to breathe on it.

539
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:55,371
Don't come over.

540
00:24:56,531 --> 00:24:57,331
Don't come over.

541
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:00,051
What's there to be afraid of?

542
00:25:02,891 --> 00:25:04,971
Is there something that might burst out?

543
00:25:21,984 --> 00:25:24,442
Why is it so terrifying?
She better not come out.

544
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:49,251
Don't be scared, don't be afraid.

545
00:25:58,371 --> 00:25:59,171
Young Miss?

546
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:00,371
What?

547
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:03,851
The strange thing he talked about.

548
00:26:04,651 --> 00:26:06,411
When the terrifying bride appears,

549
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,891
there will be a bunch of singers pop up,
all at once.

550
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:12,491
They would howl and cry,

551
00:26:12,491 --> 00:26:13,760
begging the bride to stay.

552
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:20,468
Has this been checked?

553
00:26:22,308 --> 00:26:23,228
The next step is here.

554
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:25,828
Please hold the "Happiness" cutting
together.

555
00:26:25,828 --> 00:26:29,708
Place it in the center of this window.

556
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:33,028
Make sure it's aligned
with the window above and below.

557
00:26:33,028 --> 00:26:35,028
Keep balance means overflowing joy.

558
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:36,908
This "Happiness" character?

559
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:37,788
Yes.

560
00:26:39,388 --> 00:26:39,948
Okay.

561
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:57,228
It's you.

562
00:27:13,348 --> 00:27:14,348
It's dark here.

563
00:27:20,948 --> 00:27:22,108
It fell off.

564
00:27:23,748 --> 00:27:24,908
Young Miss.

565
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:27,908
Come on, Young Miss.

566
00:27:32,388 --> 00:27:33,228
Is there anything else?

567
00:27:33,628 --> 00:27:34,508
Here.

568
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:39,968
The bed decoration.

569
00:27:40,548 --> 00:27:42,348
Please spread them,

570
00:27:42,348 --> 00:27:44,108
the red dates, peanuts,
longan, lotus seeds and stuff,

571
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:45,908
evenly on bed.

572
00:27:45,908 --> 00:27:48,308
And form a "Child" character.

573
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:50,828
Make sure it's clear and beautiful.

574
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:51,788
It means prosperous offsprings.

575
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,708
Come on, here it is.

576
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,508
Red dates, peanuts, longan, lotus seeds.

577
00:27:57,028 --> 00:27:57,988
Use these.

578
00:27:57,988 --> 00:27:58,348
Right.

579
00:27:58,988 --> 00:27:59,828
Are you ready?

580
00:28:00,948 --> 00:28:01,828
Ready for what?

581
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:02,308
Get ready.

582
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:05,348
When I finish this character...

583
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:06,908
Young Miss will be out.

584
00:28:06,908 --> 00:28:08,708
Right, Young Miss will come out again.

585
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:12,548
I can hold it for you.

586
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:18,308
Where will she rush out from?

587
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:19,948
She won't come out, will she?

588
00:28:22,588 --> 00:28:24,028
Okay, it's done.

589
00:28:26,148 --> 00:28:26,656
Child.

590
00:28:28,588 --> 00:28:30,588
We are ready, come on out.

591
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:36,148
Here.

592
00:28:38,948 --> 00:28:39,668
No.

593
00:28:39,908 --> 00:28:40,548
Come on.

594
00:28:45,228 --> 00:28:45,948
I can't do it anymore.

595
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:49,708
I'm telling you, she will...

596
00:28:50,908 --> 00:28:51,828
She's crawling out.

597
00:28:51,828 --> 00:28:53,868
No. Please don't grab my feet.

598
00:28:56,828 --> 00:28:57,628
Young Miss.

599
00:29:07,428 --> 00:29:09,108
See? Do you see it?

600
00:29:10,108 --> 00:29:13,628
Congratulations to young master
and miss on the ceremony.

601
00:29:16,948 --> 00:29:20,628
Wishing you prosperous offsprings
and bath in love forever.

602
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:24,908
Congratulations to young master
and miss on the ceremony.

603
00:29:25,068 --> 00:29:27,548
Congratulations to young master
and miss on the ceremony.

604
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:30,708
Wishing you bath in love forever,
and prosperous offsprings.

605
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:37,268
Young Miss, these are leather shoes,
I might step on you.

606
00:29:37,388 --> 00:29:37,988
Right.

607
00:29:37,988 --> 00:29:40,108
Don't get hurt,
don't stretch out your hand.

608
00:29:41,668 --> 00:29:42,268
Young Miss.

609
00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:48,308
Am I right?

610
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:50,028
She exactly comes out from there.

611
00:29:58,148 --> 00:29:59,788
Let me see, this room,

612
00:30:00,388 --> 00:30:01,988
we need to look around.

613
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:04,148
We've come to here with difficulty.

614
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:06,388
Is there something inside...?

615
00:30:07,788 --> 00:30:08,508
There is an...

616
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:10,628
an empty box.

617
00:30:11,348 --> 00:30:12,028
Let's take a look.

618
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:16,268
Qin Shou's diary.

619
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:18,388
This is a clue, the 12th.

620
00:30:21,268 --> 00:30:22,908
Okay, let me read this.

621
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:26,348
Father has been too strict with me.

622
00:30:26,348 --> 00:30:29,188
Over the past two years,
he often kept me confined,

623
00:30:29,188 --> 00:30:30,468
not allowing me to go out.

624
00:30:30,468 --> 00:30:33,428
Fortunately, me and my attendant

625
00:30:33,428 --> 00:30:34,668
made a secret door.

626
00:30:35,468 --> 00:30:39,228
Every time we'll collaborate to open it.

627
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:41,228
No one can trap me.

628
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,788
I've married so many women,

629
00:30:47,788 --> 00:30:50,948
yet I still have no child.

630
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:54,228
I want to take all their brides.

631
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:55,508
- No one...
- That is his problem,

632
00:30:55,508 --> 00:30:58,108
- No one can have children.
- why blame it on the bride?

633
00:30:58,628 --> 00:31:00,788
He can't get what he wants.

634
00:31:00,788 --> 00:31:02,228
So, he snatches other people's brides.

635
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:07,588
There is one last piece.

636
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:11,588
Today is the 16th time
I am getting married.

637
00:31:11,588 --> 00:31:15,468
That woman, her name is Xu Bandong,

638
00:31:15,468 --> 00:31:18,348
she has a lucky face,
she must be able to bear a child.

639
00:31:18,348 --> 00:31:21,548
I must marry her today.

640
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:23,428
But this Xu Bandong,

641
00:31:23,428 --> 00:31:25,748
she didn't even
come to the wedding rehearsal.

642
00:31:25,748 --> 00:31:27,388
I asked that guy

643
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:29,388
to speak with her father again.

644
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,788
She must be present
at the wedding tonight.

645
00:31:32,788 --> 00:31:33,668
Who is that guy?

646
00:31:37,788 --> 00:31:39,268
Now we have two clues.

647
00:31:39,908 --> 00:31:42,308
There is a secret door in the room.

648
00:31:42,508 --> 00:31:43,548
Okay, let me find it first.

649
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:46,948
A secret door that requires cooperation
from inside and outside.

650
00:31:48,748 --> 00:31:49,108
This is...

651
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:49,628
The secret door.

652
00:31:54,428 --> 00:31:56,628
What I want most is...

653
00:31:59,908 --> 00:32:00,948
Another password.

654
00:32:05,428 --> 00:32:07,068
Do you want to come in and take a look?
Come on in.

655
00:32:08,148 --> 00:32:08,640
Okay.

656
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:09,908
Okay.

657
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:11,628
I'll be the inside one.

658
00:32:14,668 --> 00:32:16,308
What he wants most is...

659
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:18,628
Let me see.

660
00:32:21,668 --> 00:32:22,388
His...

661
00:32:23,628 --> 00:32:24,348
Bride?

662
00:32:25,548 --> 00:32:26,188
One moment.

663
00:32:27,348 --> 00:32:28,668
Every year, whenever I meet others...

664
00:32:38,228 --> 00:32:39,668
What he wanted most was a child.

665
00:32:41,788 --> 00:32:44,388
He prays devoutly every day for a child.

666
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:46,588
The lock is a zodiac

667
00:32:47,308 --> 00:32:48,468
The twelve zodiac signs.

668
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:57,028
What he wants most is...

669
00:32:59,468 --> 00:33:00,788
Do you see a mouse on it?

670
00:33:01,268 --> 00:33:03,508
There's a mouse on today's calendar.

671
00:33:03,508 --> 00:33:05,348
Yes, there's a mouse.

672
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:07,108
Try arranging three mice.

673
00:33:14,468 --> 00:33:16,228
There is no mouse in the middle.

674
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:19,068
No mice, but are there any mice?

675
00:33:19,668 --> 00:33:21,268
One with mice.

676
00:33:21,508 --> 00:33:22,108
You take a look.

677
00:33:22,988 --> 00:33:25,828
If 1924 is the year of the mouse.

678
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:27,668
Does the third one have a mouse?

679
00:33:27,828 --> 00:33:28,148
Yes.

680
00:33:28,668 --> 00:33:29,868
Arrange the third one as a mouse.

681
00:33:32,268 --> 00:33:35,748
Let me do the math, this is 1924,
the year of the mouse.

682
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:38,908
The year 1922 is...

683
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:44,348
Does the second one have a dog?

684
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:51,428
No.

685
00:34:04,708 --> 00:34:05,228
It's open.

686
00:34:06,348 --> 00:34:07,868
Mouse, pig, mouse.

687
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:12,188
Does the second one have a dog?

688
00:34:12,188 --> 00:34:14,388
No, there's a pig and a dragon.

689
00:34:21,588 --> 00:34:22,948
Do you see any mice on it?

690
00:34:22,948 --> 00:34:24,348
Try arranging three mice.

691
00:34:24,348 --> 00:34:25,508
Does the second one have a dog?

692
00:34:25,508 --> 00:34:26,668
Does the first one have a dog?

693
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:37,668
It's open, mouse, pig, mouse.

694
00:34:40,548 --> 00:34:41,828
Mouse, pig and mouse?

695
00:34:43,068 --> 00:34:43,908
Mouse, pig, mouse.

696
00:34:47,508 --> 00:34:48,228
Let me check.

697
00:34:49,108 --> 00:34:50,908
Is this a door?
There won't be anyone there, right?

698
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:54,228
There's another lock?

699
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,548
The inside one is open,
then how do we get around it?

700
00:34:58,548 --> 00:34:59,748
Are we supposed to get out?

701
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:01,988
Collaborate from inside and outside.

702
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,188
Are you all doing well?

703
00:35:11,948 --> 00:35:12,908
Not so good.

704
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:15,748
Have you finished all the things
you needed to do?

705
00:35:15,748 --> 00:35:17,268
Not yet, still one step to go.

706
00:35:17,828 --> 00:35:18,428
Then let's do this.

707
00:35:18,428 --> 00:35:20,228
I'll unlock it first to let you out.

708
00:35:20,348 --> 00:35:20,748
Is that okay?

709
00:35:20,748 --> 00:35:22,308
You should ask your pals to help you.

710
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:23,188
Okay.

711
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:23,788
Alright then.

712
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,428
Okay.

713
00:35:28,868 --> 00:35:30,228
There's something wrong with this lock.

714
00:35:32,228 --> 00:35:33,068
The key has been changed.

715
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:37,068
It's bent.

716
00:35:38,628 --> 00:35:40,748
No, did you switch my keys again?

717
00:35:40,748 --> 00:35:42,348
No, how could it be me?

718
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,908
Go to the storeroom and find me a spare,
I'll go find a locksmith.

719
00:35:44,908 --> 00:35:45,748
Wait for us.

720
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:47,148
We don't need to do anything?

721
00:35:47,148 --> 00:35:48,508
Just cheer them up.

722
00:35:50,828 --> 00:35:51,628
What are you doing?

723
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:54,108
We saw the bride.

724
00:35:56,148 --> 00:35:58,068
Now let them see

725
00:35:58,068 --> 00:35:58,908
the new mistress.

726
00:35:58,908 --> 00:35:59,468
Come here, take a look.

727
00:35:59,788 --> 00:36:00,228
She's beautiful, right?

728
00:36:00,228 --> 00:36:00,868
Husband prosperer.

729
00:36:01,468 --> 00:36:01,988
Right?

730
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:03,268
There's a mole.

731
00:36:04,388 --> 00:36:06,988
It means many children and blessings.

732
00:36:06,988 --> 00:36:09,268
Mole of many children and blessings.

733
00:36:09,388 --> 00:36:11,388
I still need to remind you of a taboo.

734
00:36:11,988 --> 00:36:13,108
When walking around our mansion,

735
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:15,628
if you encounter
our young master Qin Shou,

736
00:36:15,628 --> 00:36:16,948
what you must absolutely not mention

737
00:36:17,748 --> 00:36:18,348
...is children.

738
00:36:19,068 --> 00:36:19,508
Okay.

739
00:36:21,948 --> 00:36:23,668
Is there a mole?
A mole at the corner of the eye?

740
00:36:23,668 --> 00:36:24,268
Is there a mole?

741
00:36:25,108 --> 00:36:26,828
No, I didn't dare
to look at the bride too much.

742
00:36:26,828 --> 00:36:27,628
It's a bit scary.

743
00:36:29,868 --> 00:36:31,228
Here is a diary entry.

744
00:36:31,868 --> 00:36:32,748
He likes someone.

745
00:36:33,948 --> 00:36:37,028
It's Xu Bandong
living at the village entrance.

746
00:36:37,268 --> 00:36:37,868
Xu Handong.

747
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,628
-No, what Xu Handong?
-Xu what Dong?

748
00:36:39,628 --> 00:36:41,068
Xu Bandong.

749
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:43,268
And the first diary entry reads that...

750
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,068
there is a secret door in this room.

751
00:36:45,428 --> 00:36:47,668
We have cracked the password.

752
00:36:47,868 --> 00:36:51,268
But this secret door needs collaboration
from both inside and outside.

753
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,708
It means there is another lock
in the room next door.

754
00:36:55,068 --> 00:36:55,908
The room next door.

755
00:36:56,188 --> 00:36:57,148
Let's go check it out.

756
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,228
This.

757
00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:02,028
I see it.

758
00:37:02,308 --> 00:37:03,068
Are you two alright?

759
00:37:03,068 --> 00:37:04,108
Hello.

760
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,988
This lock consists of three letters.

761
00:37:07,428 --> 00:37:08,028
Letters?

762
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:12,188
It consists of three letters.

763
00:37:12,828 --> 00:37:14,308
It's GPS.

764
00:37:14,308 --> 00:37:15,148
GPS, right?

765
00:37:15,428 --> 00:37:16,668
GPS.

766
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:17,468
GPS.

767
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:19,988
Close it first, let me see...GPS.

768
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,388
Not GPS. It might be a new password.

769
00:37:25,748 --> 00:37:27,548
The one we want
consists of three letters, right?

770
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:28,028
Yes, three.

771
00:37:28,308 --> 00:37:29,228
Xu Bandong.

772
00:37:29,908 --> 00:37:30,988
Yes, a name.

773
00:37:31,548 --> 00:37:32,628
Xu Bandong.

774
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,508
Is it "pan" or "ban"?

775
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:35,268
Ban, start with B.

776
00:37:36,468 --> 00:37:38,588
There is no letter B.

777
00:37:40,028 --> 00:37:42,268
I think it's related to this.

778
00:37:44,108 --> 00:37:47,348
Tianshen, Shenshen, Shishen.

779
00:37:47,788 --> 00:37:48,908
What kind of "shen" is this?

780
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:52,068
What "shen"?

781
00:37:52,508 --> 00:37:53,828
Looks like Shanshen.

782
00:37:56,948 --> 00:37:58,588
Shanshen, right?

783
00:37:58,588 --> 00:37:59,508
Chushen?

784
00:38:04,788 --> 00:38:06,468
In fact, this red one must be different.

785
00:38:07,108 --> 00:38:08,348
There must be a sequence.

786
00:38:13,588 --> 00:38:16,268
Try this Tian, Shen, Shi or whatever.

787
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:18,348
Anyway, change their direction.

788
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,788
T, the first one is T.

789
00:38:23,508 --> 00:38:24,388
Can we choose T?

790
00:38:24,788 --> 00:38:26,268
T is there,
but there is no S for the second.

791
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:27,628
So the second one is not S.

792
00:38:28,988 --> 00:38:29,868
This is so difficult.

793
00:38:32,028 --> 00:38:34,028
I feel like there's something more here.

794
00:38:34,028 --> 00:38:34,908
I need to look around.

795
00:38:35,308 --> 00:38:36,148
Don't miss it.

796
00:38:43,748 --> 00:38:44,108
What?

797
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,828
I may have sensed something.

798
00:38:48,468 --> 00:38:52,428
It seems that
there is a spiritual relic of chimei.

799
00:38:53,988 --> 00:38:56,268
Lead me around this room.

800
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:57,548
Let's search.

801
00:38:57,828 --> 00:38:59,268
Yes, it can prompt.

802
00:39:01,148 --> 00:39:02,988
There should be something nearby.

803
00:39:07,788 --> 00:39:09,108
This painting.

804
00:39:10,668 --> 00:39:11,188
Right?

805
00:39:26,788 --> 00:39:27,468
Come on.

806
00:39:29,028 --> 00:39:29,628
What was it again?

807
00:39:29,628 --> 00:39:30,268
GPS.

808
00:39:30,628 --> 00:39:36,068
GPS,
is this the spiritual relic of Chimei?

809
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:46,708
No.

810
00:39:48,108 --> 00:39:49,428
Not this one, but it dropped.

811
00:39:51,868 --> 00:39:53,468
What else is nearby? It said...

812
00:39:53,628 --> 00:39:55,068
We just walked here, right?

813
00:39:57,468 --> 00:39:58,788
Let me look under this.

814
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:06,588
Don't!

815
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:07,948
It's all broken.

816
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:09,428
Is this a hint?

817
00:40:09,948 --> 00:40:10,908
Maybe we need this painting?

818
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:21,188
GPS,
is this the spiritual relic of Chimei?

819
00:40:25,028 --> 00:40:25,908
No.

820
00:40:29,188 --> 00:40:29,828
Wait a minute.

821
00:40:30,548 --> 00:40:34,028
I may have sensed
the spiritual relic of Chimei.

822
00:40:34,028 --> 00:40:35,348
It's right around here.

823
00:40:39,908 --> 00:40:41,108
It's right around here.

824
00:40:42,428 --> 00:40:44,668
It seems like you're about to succeed.

825
00:40:48,308 --> 00:40:49,588
It says it's right around here.

826
00:40:53,028 --> 00:40:54,388
The cabinet on top cannot be opened yet.

827
00:40:58,268 --> 00:40:59,548
I saw it on top of the wardrobe.

828
00:41:05,268 --> 00:41:06,428
I saw a small box.

829
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:12,508
A hairpin.

830
00:41:14,948 --> 00:41:18,708
GPS,
is this the spiritual relic of Chimei?

831
00:41:22,628 --> 00:41:25,828
Yes, this one.

832
00:41:25,988 --> 00:41:26,548
Yes, this one.

833
00:41:28,896 --> 00:41:32,960
(Obtained the first spiritual relic)

834
00:41:33,828 --> 00:41:35,588
I found a spiritual relic.

835
00:41:36,508 --> 00:41:37,388
What does it say on it?

836
00:41:37,388 --> 00:41:38,988
No, it's a hairpin.

837
00:41:40,908 --> 00:41:42,788
Is there any letter hint on the hairpin?

838
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,268
Hairpin, "zhan", is it?

839
00:41:47,028 --> 00:41:48,308
"Z-an"?

840
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:49,268
"Zh-an".

841
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:51,068
"Zan zi".

842
00:41:51,548 --> 00:41:53,108
Not "zhan zi", "zan zi".

843
00:41:54,268 --> 00:41:55,988
I can't choose A for the second letter.

844
00:41:56,468 --> 00:41:56,788
No.

845
00:41:58,468 --> 00:42:00,588
Do you have any text on your side?

846
00:42:01,668 --> 00:42:03,348
Let me check that calendar.

847
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,788
Look, today is...

848
00:42:08,868 --> 00:42:09,988
just three letters, right?

849
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:12,388
March, big.

850
00:42:13,588 --> 00:42:14,588
Wednesday.

851
00:42:15,588 --> 00:42:16,548
The eighth day.

852
00:42:19,028 --> 00:42:19,788
Not going to work.

853
00:42:24,068 --> 00:42:24,828
Oh, my God.

854
00:42:24,828 --> 00:42:25,468
We'll be doomed.

855
00:42:26,188 --> 00:42:27,388
The bride is coming.

856
00:42:30,188 --> 00:42:30,668
What?

857
00:42:41,868 --> 00:42:43,188
It's so terrifying over there.

858
00:42:45,668 --> 00:42:48,148
Congratulations to the bride and groom.

859
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:52,428
The ceremony is complete.

860
00:42:52,428 --> 00:42:58,548
Wishing you a long and happy marriage
and early birth of a healthy baby.

861
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:02,388
A long and happy marriage.

862
00:43:03,428 --> 00:43:04,428
Right, there's a password.

863
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:07,908
Should we ask her?

864
00:43:08,988 --> 00:43:11,228
Calling Young Miss.

865
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:12,108
Young Miss.

866
00:43:14,268 --> 00:43:16,388
Hello, Young Miss.
Give us a hint, please.

867
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:22,748
A square is drawn on this.

868
00:43:23,348 --> 00:43:24,868
Look at the square.
There is a square here.

869
00:43:25,188 --> 00:43:26,588
Isn't this a square?

870
00:43:27,748 --> 00:43:29,268
Look, this square
must be referring to that.

871
00:43:29,268 --> 00:43:29,508
Yes.

872
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:30,588
I'll give it a try.

873
00:43:43,828 --> 00:43:44,668
I've got an idea.

874
00:43:45,868 --> 00:43:47,468
There's also
a big ginseng in the middle.

875
00:43:52,028 --> 00:43:53,388
Look, they are different in size.

876
00:43:53,628 --> 00:43:54,188
Right.

877
00:43:58,548 --> 00:44:01,708
Tianshen, Shenshen, Shishen.

878
00:44:01,988 --> 00:44:03,428
Isn't this a square?

879
00:44:08,628 --> 00:44:09,348
I see.

880
00:44:09,428 --> 00:44:10,868
This one is the character of "xiao".

881
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,468
The two horizontal lines on top
make it become the character "shi".

882
00:44:14,868 --> 00:44:18,708
This is "zhong",
and that one line makes it "shen".

883
00:44:20,028 --> 00:44:22,668
This is "da",
and that line on top makes it "tian".

884
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:26,028
And then a character "da"
inside a square is "yin".

885
00:44:27,308 --> 00:44:28,228
"Yin" as in "yinwei".

886
00:44:32,148 --> 00:44:33,828
It's open.

887
00:44:38,028 --> 00:44:38,948
We have opened it.

888
00:44:38,948 --> 00:44:39,828
Opened it.

889
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,228
Can you get out?

890
00:44:41,228 --> 00:44:42,228
Yes.

891
00:44:42,628 --> 00:44:43,828
Slow down, don't bump your head.

892
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:44,668
Come quickly.

893
00:44:45,188 --> 00:44:45,988
Are you two alright?

894
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:50,628
So, where can we get out from?

895
00:44:50,628 --> 00:44:51,228
Here.

896
00:44:53,428 --> 00:44:54,908
Show you guys that diary.

897
00:44:54,908 --> 00:44:56,308
Take a look at what has been written.

898
00:44:57,308 --> 00:44:58,868
This is about the secret door back then.

899
00:44:58,868 --> 00:45:00,388
Secret door,
this is no longer useful, right?

900
00:45:00,588 --> 00:45:03,508
Yes. "24 years" refers to Xu Bandong.

901
00:45:03,748 --> 00:45:05,908
Then, he had THAT person seen her dad,

902
00:45:05,908 --> 00:45:07,108
to go and have a talk with him.

903
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,988
Who is THAT person?

904
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:13,588
THAT person...

905
00:45:14,068 --> 00:45:15,348
This is the young master's diary

906
00:45:15,508 --> 00:45:16,668
Yes, Qin Shou's.

907
00:45:18,548 --> 00:45:18,948
Qin Shou.

908
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:21,468
No, "Qin Shou's diary".
It is written on that book.

909
00:45:24,228 --> 00:45:25,828
Need keep this.
It is related to tonight's task.

910
00:45:26,188 --> 00:45:26,948
It reads meet tonight.

911
00:45:27,508 --> 00:45:28,428
We have to see her tonight

912
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:31,068
So is the Chimei the Young Miss?

913
00:45:31,268 --> 00:45:32,508
Can't be that straightforward.

914
00:45:34,988 --> 00:45:36,108
Is Qin Shou the Chimei?

915
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:40,308
THAT person.

916
00:45:43,148 --> 00:45:44,068
Yes, I think it's him.

917
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:45,308
It could be THAT person.

918
00:45:45,308 --> 00:45:46,308
The person who worked for Qin.

919
00:45:46,308 --> 00:45:46,908
A mysterious one.

920
00:45:46,908 --> 00:45:48,428
The one whose name we don't know.

921
00:45:52,828 --> 00:45:53,628
Ancestral temple.

922
00:45:53,628 --> 00:45:54,588
Let's go and take a look.

923
00:45:55,468 --> 00:45:57,548
You must worship
before entering the ancestral temple.

924
00:45:57,548 --> 00:45:59,188
Do not enter if you don't worship.

925
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:02,748
After entering the ancestral temple,
close the door tightly.

926
00:46:02,748 --> 00:46:04,708
Please offer incense
to the ancestral spirits.

927
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:05,428
One stick of incense.

928
00:46:05,588 --> 00:46:07,548
You may leave only
after the incense has burned out.

929
00:46:07,828 --> 00:46:11,268
After entering the ancestral temple,
close the door tightly.

930
00:46:13,908 --> 00:46:14,388
You go.

931
00:46:15,468 --> 00:46:15,988
You go.

932
00:46:15,988 --> 00:46:17,068
Me alone?

933
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:18,908
This way. As a team, we go together.

934
00:46:20,468 --> 00:46:21,388
Alright, let's go in.

935
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:30,080
(ancestral temple)

936
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,828
Isn't this scene frightening?
How is it not scary?

937
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:38,108
This is really scary.

938
00:46:43,908 --> 00:46:45,548
You two are staying here like door gods.

939
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:47,628
We are afraid.

940
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:48,628
Come on.

941
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:49,668
We have four men here.

942
00:46:49,668 --> 00:46:50,788
Come on.

943
00:46:51,028 --> 00:46:53,028
You can hide in the middle.
We'll block the sides.

944
00:46:53,548 --> 00:46:54,388
We can surround you two.

945
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:56,588
This is really scary.

946
00:47:00,548 --> 00:47:01,428
It won't open, right?

947
00:47:01,428 --> 00:47:01,888
Can't open.

948
00:47:04,548 --> 00:47:05,788
There's incense, a stick of incense.

949
00:47:07,988 --> 00:47:09,108
Wait, don't light it yet.

950
00:47:09,108 --> 00:47:11,388
Let's take a look at these things first,

951
00:47:11,388 --> 00:47:12,268
while the light is on.

952
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:15,228
It's different.

953
00:47:15,228 --> 00:47:16,588
Qin Cai.

954
00:47:16,588 --> 00:47:17,108
Yes.

955
00:47:17,108 --> 00:47:20,068
Qin Pu, Qin Se, Qin Jiu.

956
00:47:23,948 --> 00:47:26,468
My palm is sweaty. Save me.

957
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:28,468
It feels like no one
should be able to come out of this room.

958
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:39,068
It is locked.

959
00:47:41,068 --> 00:47:41,748
There are locks.

960
00:47:45,188 --> 00:47:45,948
Wait a moment.

961
00:47:46,528 --> 00:47:49,708
Only warmth can change ta's...

962
00:47:50,308 --> 00:47:52,108
Beiju.

963
00:47:53,388 --> 00:47:55,028
Only warmth can change ta's beiju.

964
00:47:55,028 --> 00:47:57,028
Love. Love is warm.

965
00:48:00,908 --> 00:48:01,548
his or her...

966
00:48:01,548 --> 00:48:03,668
Before we came in, who did we say
we were offering incense to?

967
00:48:03,988 --> 00:48:05,148
Ancestral spirits.

968
00:48:05,668 --> 00:48:06,628
These are the spirits.

969
00:48:06,628 --> 00:48:07,748
Right, offer the incense first.

970
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,588
Then come on, are you ready?

971
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:10,228
Where to put it?

972
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:11,068
Here.

973
00:48:11,668 --> 00:48:12,148
It goes here.

974
00:48:15,308 --> 00:48:16,588
Something should come out of this.

975
00:48:16,588 --> 00:48:17,628
You hold the incense.

976
00:48:18,108 --> 00:48:18,508
Ready.

977
00:48:19,108 --> 00:48:20,108
There's a sound.

978
00:48:28,068 --> 00:48:29,468
Bro, not many chances left for you.

979
00:48:29,468 --> 00:48:30,268
Come, take the incense.

980
00:48:30,268 --> 00:48:30,908
It's damp.

981
00:48:38,468 --> 00:48:38,908
Be careful.

982
00:48:54,828 --> 00:48:55,388
Lean the door.

983
00:48:55,788 --> 00:48:56,828
Can we be fine by doing this?

984
00:48:56,828 --> 00:48:57,828
Just lean against the door.

985
00:49:03,588 --> 00:49:03,988
Insert here.

986
00:49:05,268 --> 00:49:06,148
Just light one stick.

987
00:49:06,148 --> 00:49:07,988
Time to worship the ancestral spirits.

988
00:49:10,268 --> 00:49:12,308
Don't come, Young Miss.

989
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:29,628
They are bowing.

990
00:49:29,628 --> 00:49:30,388
They are bowing.

991
00:49:31,908 --> 00:49:32,548
Who are they?

992
00:49:34,988 --> 00:49:36,188
We should also bow.

993
00:49:36,188 --> 00:49:38,428
Bow down.

994
00:49:40,748 --> 00:49:42,108
Stop laughing.

995
00:49:42,108 --> 00:49:42,988
Please, I beg.

996
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:44,948
I see.

997
00:49:45,468 --> 00:49:47,908
If this incense goes out
and we can't open this,

998
00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:49,428
we'll be trapped here.

999
00:49:49,428 --> 00:49:51,108
Right, so the warmth...

1000
00:49:53,668 --> 00:49:55,348
Only warmth can (change) ta's beiju.

1001
00:49:55,828 --> 00:49:56,188
Beiju

1002
00:49:57,668 --> 00:49:58,268
Too difficult.

1003
00:49:59,348 --> 00:50:00,868
Warmth has to do with fire as well.

1004
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:01,468
Right.

1005
00:50:04,308 --> 00:50:06,068
Let me take a look to figure this out.

1006
00:50:07,228 --> 00:50:08,748
Warmth. Hot.

1007
00:50:17,028 --> 00:50:18,228
But there is no H in the first line.

1008
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:18,828
Neither.

1009
00:50:25,348 --> 00:50:27,708
Only warmth can change ta's beiju.

1010
00:50:28,828 --> 00:50:30,108
Only warmth can.

1011
00:50:31,188 --> 00:50:32,148
What is this?

1012
00:50:32,148 --> 00:50:34,228
Is this a spiritual relic?
It looks so strange.

1013
00:50:35,828 --> 00:50:36,468
I think so.

1014
00:50:39,548 --> 00:50:41,068
Isn't this "beiju"?

1015
00:50:41,388 --> 00:50:42,428
These are cups, "beiju".

1016
00:50:42,428 --> 00:50:42,908
Beiju.

1017
00:50:46,868 --> 00:50:48,228
So, the warmth indicates hot water?

1018
00:50:50,588 --> 00:50:51,108
No water in it.

1019
00:50:55,908 --> 00:50:56,188
Two.

1020
00:50:57,628 --> 00:50:57,988
Two.

1021
00:50:59,948 --> 00:51:00,548
Three.

1022
00:51:02,668 --> 00:51:03,108
Four.

1023
00:51:03,668 --> 00:51:05,188
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1024
00:51:05,748 --> 00:51:06,908
Correspond to six letters.

1025
00:51:07,948 --> 00:51:09,548
Right? Corresponds to six letters.

1026
00:51:13,868 --> 00:51:15,468
ABCDEF.

1027
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:17,148
No way.

1028
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:18,348
What?

1029
00:51:18,988 --> 00:51:21,988
Only warmth can change ta's beiju.

1030
00:51:22,548 --> 00:51:24,628
Ta is written in Pinyin.

1031
00:51:24,628 --> 00:51:25,188
Right.

1032
00:51:27,548 --> 00:51:28,468
Ta.

1033
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:31,868
I thought it was a tower.

1034
00:51:32,108 --> 00:51:32,988
Ta.

1035
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:34,068
I thought it was a tower.

1036
00:51:34,588 --> 00:51:35,228
It means tower.

1037
00:51:35,548 --> 00:51:36,228
Tower's temperature.

1038
00:51:36,228 --> 00:51:37,068
Tower.

1039
00:51:40,108 --> 00:51:41,388
Does that mean to burn it?

1040
00:51:41,388 --> 00:51:41,988
Yes.

1041
00:51:42,908 --> 00:51:43,908
Wait a second.

1042
00:51:43,908 --> 00:51:45,428
I'll use this incense first.

1043
00:51:45,428 --> 00:51:46,748
We don't have many chances.

1044
00:51:51,228 --> 00:51:52,588
You think something will appear, right?

1045
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:53,668
Yes, I'll try again.

1046
00:51:58,388 --> 00:52:01,068
No, I don't have many chances
to burn things now.

1047
00:52:04,948 --> 00:52:06,428
Should I burn it?

1048
00:52:09,108 --> 00:52:10,468
Only warmth can change.

1049
00:52:10,468 --> 00:52:11,068
Burn what?

1050
00:52:11,788 --> 00:52:12,308
Burn the tower.

1051
00:52:15,588 --> 00:52:16,228
Can it be burned?

1052
00:52:17,588 --> 00:52:20,868
Tear out some pages of the diary, quick.

1053
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:22,028
The back pages.

1054
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:31,788
Lord had better not play with fire.

1055
00:52:35,748 --> 00:52:36,948
He wants to burn props.

1056
00:52:38,228 --> 00:52:39,868
But it must be related to burning.

1057
00:52:40,428 --> 00:52:42,788
Related to burning? It can't be.

1058
00:52:56,188 --> 00:52:58,708
See, this is clearly a layer of wax.

1059
00:53:07,628 --> 00:53:09,668
I rubbed this out myself.

1060
00:53:09,668 --> 00:53:11,348
Rub, friends.

1061
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:13,188
Use the warmth of our hands.

1062
00:53:13,508 --> 00:53:14,148
Correct.

1063
00:53:14,148 --> 00:53:15,708
U, this number three.

1064
00:53:19,748 --> 00:53:20,908
This is too difficult to rub.

1065
00:53:21,508 --> 00:53:22,228
Mine is H.

1066
00:53:22,548 --> 00:53:23,148
What about yours?

1067
00:53:23,388 --> 00:53:23,788
H.

1068
00:53:24,308 --> 00:53:24,868
Mine is six.

1069
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:25,348
I.

1070
00:53:25,348 --> 00:53:26,148
The fourth one is S.

1071
00:53:26,548 --> 00:53:27,668
The second one is H.

1072
00:53:30,548 --> 00:53:32,348
Let's try it out.

1073
00:53:33,028 --> 00:53:34,068
The first one is C.

1074
00:53:34,068 --> 00:53:34,868
CHU.

1075
00:53:43,508 --> 00:53:44,668
Done.

1076
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:45,068
Bravo.

1077
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:45,708
Unlocked this one.

1078
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:46,628
S.

1079
00:53:46,628 --> 00:53:47,068
I.

1080
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,312
Best wishes to the bro...
Congratulations to young master,

1081
00:54:17,312 --> 00:54:20,896
Congratulations to young master
and mistress on the perfect ceremony.

1082
00:54:20,896 --> 00:54:23,628
Best wishes to
the young master and young mistress,

1083
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:25,788
be blessed with a child soon
and be together forever.

1084
00:54:25,788 --> 00:54:28,108
Be together forever
and blessed with a child soon.

1085
00:54:32,308 --> 00:54:33,828
I was startled enough to break my cup.

1086
00:54:34,848 --> 00:54:35,548
It fell off.

1087
00:54:35,548 --> 00:54:36,428
What was the sixth again?

1088
00:54:36,428 --> 00:54:37,628
The sixth is I.

1089
00:54:39,988 --> 00:54:40,908
It opened.

1090
00:54:42,268 --> 00:54:43,508
You guys are so...

1091
00:54:45,748 --> 00:54:46,428
A memorial tablet.

1092
00:54:46,428 --> 00:54:49,348
The seat of Qin Li
the eldest daughter of the Qin Family.

1093
00:54:49,348 --> 00:54:49,788
Where to put?

1094
00:54:49,788 --> 00:54:50,468
Qin Li.

1095
00:54:50,468 --> 00:54:51,548
Let me ask.

1096
00:54:51,548 --> 00:54:52,788
It's possible
that it is one of those.

1097
00:54:53,268 --> 00:54:55,228
You do the high-pitched voice,
that is the only way.

1098
00:54:55,548 --> 00:54:58,668
GPS, is this a...

1099
00:54:58,668 --> 00:54:59,388
What was it again?

1100
00:54:59,388 --> 00:55:00,228
Chimei spiritual relic.

1101
00:55:00,228 --> 00:55:01,708
A Chimei spiritual relic?

1102
00:55:03,588 --> 00:55:05,108
No, it's not.

1103
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,388
I found a letter, too.

1104
00:55:07,948 --> 00:55:09,588
It says that, a few days ago,

1105
00:55:09,588 --> 00:55:12,708
the master believed
the words of a respected witch in town,

1106
00:55:18,308 --> 00:55:20,588
betrothed the young lady Qin Li...

1107
00:55:20,588 --> 00:55:24,108
to another wealthy
young master in the town.

1108
00:55:24,108 --> 00:55:27,468
But the young lady died mysteriously
on the day of her wedding.

1109
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:34,028
The young lady had previously
shown kindness to me, a mere chef.

1110
00:55:34,028 --> 00:55:34,668
Related to kitchen.

1111
00:55:35,028 --> 00:55:36,348
I won't forget her favour,

1112
00:55:36,348 --> 00:55:38,348
so I secretly worship
the young lady in this place.

1113
00:55:38,348 --> 00:55:39,680
Worshipped since 1921.

1114
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,228
The cook
has been secretly worshipping her.

1115
00:55:43,428 --> 00:55:45,984
Then let's give the young lady
a formal offering, place it here.

1116
00:55:45,984 --> 00:55:46,624
Good.

1117
00:55:48,668 --> 00:55:50,588
Then let's pay respects
on behalf of the cook.

1118
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,268
Come, let us pay respects
to the eldest daughter, Qin Li.

1119
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,708
Qin Li,

1120
00:55:55,708 --> 00:55:56,468
We hope you...

1121
00:55:56,468 --> 00:55:58,148
rest in peace.

1122
00:55:58,148 --> 00:55:59,468
May your spirit in heaven bless us.

1123
00:55:59,468 --> 00:56:01,148
Bless us.

1124
00:56:01,148 --> 00:56:01,988
Thank you.

1125
00:56:09,028 --> 00:56:09,828
Try the door.

1126
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:10,588
It can be opened.

1127
00:56:13,148 --> 00:56:13,748
Thank you.

1128
00:56:14,988 --> 00:56:17,268
Then the kitchen door
should be open as well.

1129
00:56:17,268 --> 00:56:17,748
Door is open.

1130
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:20,028
I have to enter again, really...

1131
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:22,748
To secure the place as staff-only,

1132
00:56:22,748 --> 00:56:25,548
this door is only open
when the chef is working inside.

1133
00:56:26,108 --> 00:56:26,748
I'm going in now.

1134
00:56:28,668 --> 00:56:30,908
Don't scare us again, please. Thank you.

1135
00:56:30,908 --> 00:56:31,668
It's just the kitchen,

1136
00:56:34,464 --> 00:56:39,948
(Kitchen)

1137
00:56:39,948 --> 00:56:41,588
But think about what it says,

1138
00:56:41,588 --> 00:56:44,028
We can only enter when the cook is here.

1139
00:56:44,028 --> 00:56:45,028
Actually, the cook is...

1140
00:56:45,028 --> 00:56:45,588
Not in here?

1141
00:56:45,588 --> 00:56:46,308
Inside.

1142
00:56:46,308 --> 00:56:47,188
The cook IS inside, then.

1143
00:56:49,228 --> 00:56:49,988
Or rather...

1144
00:56:49,988 --> 00:56:51,668
Right, the cook may have already...

1145
00:56:51,668 --> 00:56:52,588
Climb out from somewhere?

1146
00:56:52,588 --> 00:56:53,948
...been existing here in a certain form.

1147
00:56:53,948 --> 00:56:54,348
Close door.

1148
00:56:54,592 --> 00:56:54,988
Close it.

1149
00:56:55,468 --> 00:56:56,628
Can we keep it open?

1150
00:56:56,628 --> 00:56:58,148
I'm close by, no worries.

1151
00:57:00,308 --> 00:57:01,228
They require us to cook?

1152
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:02,908
No need to, right?

1153
00:57:03,148 --> 00:57:04,388
I don't think they require us to do.

1154
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,428
Who's there?

1155
00:57:12,224 --> 00:57:13,148
It's a dough.

1156
00:57:13,376 --> 00:57:14,028
Who's there?

1157
00:57:14,988 --> 00:57:15,828
The cook.

1158
00:57:15,948 --> 00:57:17,668
So scary, thieves, aren't ya?

1159
00:57:18,628 --> 00:57:20,068
-It's a small dough ball.
-Or robbers?

1160
00:57:20,068 --> 00:57:22,080
Are you thieves? Here to steal things?

1161
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,908
I warn you, although you outnumber me,

1162
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:25,228
I've learned Kung Fu, you know?

1163
00:57:25,228 --> 00:57:27,068
You are all tall and strong,
quite handsome too.

1164
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,428
Don't try anything funny, I warn you.

1165
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,787
(Liu Yi as the Cook)

1166
00:57:30,787 --> 00:57:31,628
I know Kung Fu!

1167
00:57:31,628 --> 00:57:32,308
Look at this letter.

1168
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:35,840
We've just paid respects to Shen...
to Qin Li for you.

1169
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,548
"Shen"?

1170
00:57:37,268 --> 00:57:37,748
Qin Li.

1171
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:39,028
Thank you.

1172
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,548
What?

1173
00:57:44,576 --> 00:57:45,508
Little Steamed Bun.

1174
00:57:47,148 --> 00:57:47,628
What's wrong?

1175
00:57:47,948 --> 00:57:49,228
How can you look so similar?

1176
00:57:49,828 --> 00:57:50,508
Similar to Qin Li?

1177
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,228
I resemble Qin Li?

1178
00:57:52,308 --> 00:57:53,308
Too similar.

1179
00:57:55,188 --> 00:57:57,308
Only those who are familiar
will be able to tell the difference.

1180
00:57:57,708 --> 00:57:59,068
You look so similar to the young lady.

1181
00:58:03,588 --> 00:58:05,428
All right, let me introduce myself.

1182
00:58:05,428 --> 00:58:07,628
I am the Royal Chef of the Qin Mansion.

1183
00:58:08,548 --> 00:58:10,868
Just now, this stove stopped working,

1184
00:58:10,868 --> 00:58:12,108
so I went in to clean it up.

1185
00:58:12,468 --> 00:58:14,748
Who are you guys?
Why are you all so tall, especially you?

1186
00:58:14,748 --> 00:58:16,628
We are the Joy...

1187
00:58:16,628 --> 00:58:17,788
Joyous Club.

1188
00:58:17,788 --> 00:58:20,268
We came here
for today's wedding rehearsal,

1189
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:22,068
for the wedding ceremony tonight.

1190
00:58:23,788 --> 00:58:24,908
I see.

1191
00:58:24,908 --> 00:58:27,388
So, did you come to the kitchen
because you are hungry?

1192
00:58:27,388 --> 00:58:29,348
Yes, hungry.

1193
00:58:30,428 --> 00:58:31,468
Come, have a sit.

1194
00:58:32,588 --> 00:58:34,908
Well, since we're hungry,
cook some dishes for us, please.

1195
00:58:34,908 --> 00:58:36,068
No rush.

1196
00:58:36,068 --> 00:58:36,628
Are you hungry?

1197
00:58:36,628 --> 00:58:37,508
Hungry.

1198
00:58:37,508 --> 00:58:40,428
Rest assured,
as long as you can help me out,

1199
00:58:41,308 --> 00:58:44,108
just lending me a hand will do,

1200
00:58:44,108 --> 00:58:46,348
I will definitely let you
taste my cooking skills.

1201
00:58:47,348 --> 00:58:50,268
I'm in a hurry to prepare
the guests at tonight's wedding banquet

1202
00:58:50,268 --> 00:58:52,028
...a ginseng chicken soup.

1203
00:58:52,948 --> 00:58:54,748
Haven't you guys
been doing that too, in the show?

1204
00:58:54,748 --> 00:58:55,548
He was selling ginseng.
[*"ginseng" and "body" are homophones(shen)]

1205
00:58:56,188 --> 00:58:56,988
Who the hell are you?

1206
00:58:59,108 --> 00:59:00,148
I'm just...

1207
00:59:00,588 --> 00:59:02,668
selling ginseng, and playing with you.

1208
00:59:05,748 --> 00:59:07,268
Alright, time to help me.

1209
00:59:07,948 --> 00:59:10,748
Go and find a rooster cage,
which is full of roosters, at entrance,

1210
00:59:10,748 --> 00:59:11,508
carry it inside for me

1211
00:59:12,748 --> 00:59:13,308
Carry the cage.

1212
00:59:13,588 --> 00:59:13,948
Let's go.

1213
00:59:14,508 --> 00:59:15,388
Let's go.

1214
00:59:17,948 --> 00:59:19,308
We may need to catch the roosters.

1215
00:59:21,668 --> 00:59:22,908
Holy moly.

1216
00:59:23,948 --> 00:59:24,668
This...

1217
00:59:24,668 --> 00:59:25,708
I can't handle this, really.

1218
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:26,868
I can't do it either.

1219
00:59:26,868 --> 00:59:29,188
Right, you're afraid of
that sharp beak, aren't you?

1220
00:59:30,828 --> 00:59:32,428
Hold the bottom
it'll be trouble if they run out.

1221
00:59:32,428 --> 00:59:33,188
Hurry, press it.

1222
00:59:33,308 --> 00:59:35,068
One, two, three, go.

1223
00:59:37,628 --> 00:59:38,228
Come on.

1224
00:59:38,228 --> 00:59:39,068
Don't meddle in.

1225
00:59:39,068 --> 00:59:39,588
Don't come...

1226
00:59:39,588 --> 00:59:40,228
We don't need you.

1227
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:46,508
Come on.

1228
00:59:47,628 --> 00:59:49,388
Walk fast.

1229
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:53,788
Why won't they let me
move my own rooster?

1230
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:55,468
- Can't get in
- Blocked

1231
00:59:55,468 --> 00:59:56,148
Go that way.

1232
01:00:01,908 --> 01:00:03,548
Tilt it a bit.

1233
01:00:08,508 --> 01:00:09,668
You know Kung Fu, don't you?

1234
01:00:09,668 --> 01:00:10,908
I do.

1235
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:14,668
Just don't peck me, okay, put it down.

1236
01:00:15,108 --> 01:00:16,508
Aren't there gloves?

1237
01:00:17,828 --> 01:00:18,748
Prepared gloves for you,

1238
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,508
because I want you
to move those roosters...

1239
01:00:20,508 --> 01:00:22,428
Into THAT rooster cage.

1240
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:25,548
Tricks, all of them.

1241
01:00:28,228 --> 01:00:28,948
Blocked me for nth.

1242
01:00:29,508 --> 01:00:30,748
Come on, lift it out first.

1243
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,064
That's...

1244
01:00:35,148 --> 01:00:36,708
Let's go.

1245
01:00:49,748 --> 01:00:50,628
It can fly.

1246
01:00:50,828 --> 01:00:53,628
These roosters are too healthy,
how can we catch them?

1247
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:55,588
I dare not catch it.

1248
01:00:58,268 --> 01:00:59,068
Come on, I'll go first.

1249
01:01:09,268 --> 01:01:10,228
That scared me.

1250
01:01:10,228 --> 01:01:11,708
They run really fast.

1251
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:13,948
What a bunch of high-quality roosters.

1252
01:01:19,348 --> 01:01:21,028
Caught it.

1253
01:01:21,028 --> 01:01:22,028
You're so impressive.

1254
01:01:25,388 --> 01:01:26,348
Here I come.

1255
01:01:27,028 --> 01:01:27,988
Get in.

1256
01:01:30,668 --> 01:01:32,228
I'll do it.

1257
01:01:32,988 --> 01:01:34,548
Just grab its wings.

1258
01:01:35,228 --> 01:01:36,148
I caught it right away.

1259
01:01:49,508 --> 01:01:50,068
Impressive.

1260
01:01:56,388 --> 01:01:58,748
It runs so swiftly.

1261
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,748
Let that rooster tremble.

1262
01:02:09,108 --> 01:02:10,548
Stop running.

1263
01:02:10,548 --> 01:02:11,948
Okay.

1264
01:02:11,948 --> 01:02:14,188
This, compared with
all the tricks that came out earlier...

1265
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:15,588
is more frightening.

1266
01:02:16,148 --> 01:02:16,988
Let's go.

1267
01:02:16,988 --> 01:02:17,988
Impressive.

1268
01:02:19,148 --> 01:02:20,508
Go inside.

1269
01:02:20,508 --> 01:02:22,148
"The steamed bun", we are done here.

1270
01:02:22,148 --> 01:02:23,788
Let me count the roosters.

1271
01:02:23,788 --> 01:02:24,788
I'll open it and take a look.

1272
01:02:24,788 --> 01:02:26,268
Don't.

1273
01:02:26,268 --> 01:02:27,908
Respect your hard work, then.

1274
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:30,188
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

1275
01:02:30,708 --> 01:02:31,428
Let's move.

1276
01:02:33,868 --> 01:02:34,788
Come on, come in.

1277
01:02:35,428 --> 01:02:36,908
Come, have a sit.

1278
01:02:38,508 --> 01:02:40,548
I haven't finished
setting the plates for you yet.

1279
01:02:41,028 --> 01:02:43,308
Didn't expect you to be so fast.

1280
01:02:43,308 --> 01:02:44,468
Quite nimble, one could say.

1281
01:02:44,468 --> 01:02:45,068
Too nimble.

1282
01:02:45,068 --> 01:02:46,908
We are much nimbler
than those roosters, you know.

1283
01:02:46,908 --> 01:02:48,468
Still, the roosters are nimbler.

1284
01:02:50,348 --> 01:02:52,988
Okay, if you have any questions,
go ahead and ask.

1285
01:02:52,988 --> 01:02:53,868
I'm quite busy.

1286
01:02:56,788 --> 01:02:58,108
How many roosters are there in total?

1287
01:02:58,308 --> 01:02:59,908
Ten.

1288
01:02:59,908 --> 01:03:01,388
What's the name of each one?

1289
01:03:05,628 --> 01:03:06,748
Well, you got me.

1290
01:03:06,748 --> 01:03:08,748
This girl sure knows how to
pick irrelevant questions to ask.

1291
01:03:10,628 --> 01:03:11,788
I have a question.

1292
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:12,468
Go ahead.

1293
01:03:12,468 --> 01:03:16,468
The young master, Qin Shou...

1294
01:03:16,468 --> 01:03:19,708
has had someone
by his side all these years.

1295
01:03:20,188 --> 01:03:21,628
That person said,
the village entrance...

1296
01:03:21,628 --> 01:03:24,788
That person also said today is a rare good day.

1297
01:03:24,788 --> 01:03:26,628
I had that person speak with her...

1298
01:03:26,628 --> 01:03:27,948
Her father again, to discuss.

1299
01:03:29,828 --> 01:03:31,348
To help him do the bride kidnapping.

1300
01:03:31,348 --> 01:03:32,268
To help him do bad things.

1301
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,268
I really didn't know that.

1302
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:36,068
Have you ever heard of it?

1303
01:03:36,868 --> 01:03:40,708
I have, however,
heard of some other matters.

1304
01:03:43,548 --> 01:03:46,428
Something about
our family's eldest daughter, Qin Li.

1305
01:03:51,068 --> 01:03:54,348
We local people worship the Moon God,

1306
01:03:56,308 --> 01:03:58,628
who governs
all the matrimonial fate in the world.

1307
01:03:59,828 --> 01:04:02,348
Three years ago,

1308
01:04:02,788 --> 01:04:05,588
A witch who claimed
to be an envoy of the Lunar God...

1309
01:04:05,588 --> 01:04:06,588
came to our place.

1310
01:04:11,828 --> 01:04:14,788
She possessed the witchcraft
bestowed upon her by the Lunar God,

1311
01:04:14,788 --> 01:04:16,708
had a body indestructible as diamond.

1312
01:04:17,468 --> 01:04:19,108
Her wounds would heal automatically?

1313
01:04:19,108 --> 01:04:22,988
She could also obtain the divine nectar
given to her by the great Lunar God.

1314
01:04:25,588 --> 01:04:28,068
The witch,
according to the will of the Moon God,

1315
01:04:28,068 --> 01:04:30,908
would provide guidance
on the matrimonial matches in our town.

1316
01:04:31,748 --> 01:04:32,428
The witch said,

1317
01:04:32,908 --> 01:04:34,948
that if both families comply,

1318
01:04:34,948 --> 01:04:37,628
then they will prosper.

1319
01:04:38,748 --> 01:04:40,228
But if there is violation,

1320
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:42,208
Then both families...

1321
01:04:42,208 --> 01:04:45,268
will both suffer from
misfortune and calamity.

1322
01:04:47,828 --> 01:04:49,108
Not only that,

1323
01:04:49,588 --> 01:04:51,188
I've also heard rumors.

1324
01:04:52,308 --> 01:04:54,188
The witch has said in private,

1325
01:04:54,188 --> 01:04:56,828
that if a family’s accumulated past sins

1326
01:04:56,828 --> 01:04:58,268
are too heavy,

1327
01:04:58,748 --> 01:05:00,788
Then, even if
they accept her arranged marriage,

1328
01:05:00,788 --> 01:05:02,468
they cannot avoid the misfortune.

1329
01:05:03,268 --> 01:05:05,748
The sins will cling to the bride,

1330
01:05:06,268 --> 01:05:08,668
and reveal themselves at the wedding.

1331
01:05:09,628 --> 01:05:12,268
Those faces,
originally beautiful as flowers and jade

1332
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:14,388
will become extremely terrifying,

1333
01:05:15,068 --> 01:05:15,828
horrific.

1334
01:05:17,228 --> 01:05:20,388
It is just pitiful, for those brides,

1335
01:05:20,868 --> 01:05:22,388
they had no choice
but to sacrifice themselves

1336
01:05:23,028 --> 01:05:25,068
to ward off disaster for their families.

1337
01:05:27,068 --> 01:05:29,348
Poor young lady Qin Li from our mansion,

1338
01:05:30,108 --> 01:05:30,788
three years ago,

1339
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:34,788
was originally arranged
with a good marriage by the witch, too.

1340
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:37,348
But the witch said,

1341
01:05:39,188 --> 01:05:42,016
that the Qin family has caused
too many resentful souls in the past,

1342
01:05:42,948 --> 01:05:47,468
so the eldest lady could only
sacrifice herself to avert disasters.

1343
01:05:49,348 --> 01:05:50,148
She died this way.

1344
01:05:50,148 --> 01:05:51,908
Yes, her soul scattered to the winds.

1345
01:05:51,908 --> 01:05:54,028
What is the relationship
between Qin Li and Qin Shou?

1346
01:05:54,028 --> 01:05:55,628
Big sister and little brother.

1347
01:05:55,628 --> 01:05:58,588
But this younger brother
goes around snatching brides,

1348
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:00,308
then the elder sister...

1349
01:06:00,308 --> 01:06:02,668
Did not escape the family's misfortune.

1350
01:06:03,308 --> 01:06:04,188
Sacrificed.

1351
01:06:04,988 --> 01:06:07,828
And then,
the day our eldest miss disappeared,

1352
01:06:07,828 --> 01:06:11,788
was presumably April 1st, 1921,
three years ago, if I remember well.

1353
01:06:11,788 --> 01:06:13,508
And I heard that, on that day,

1354
01:06:13,988 --> 01:06:16,628
The witch and the Young Mistress...

1355
01:06:16,628 --> 01:06:20,188
also went to the second floor
of the Baihua Hotel next door.

1356
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:21,628
Baihua Hotel.

1357
01:06:21,628 --> 01:06:23,468
The second floor of the Baihua Hotel.

1358
01:06:24,148 --> 01:06:26,388
It's possible that,
that's the place where the witch...

1359
01:06:26,388 --> 01:06:28,028
cast the spell on our Young Mistress,

1360
01:06:28,628 --> 01:06:30,468
which led to the misfortune of her.

1361
01:06:36,308 --> 01:06:36,948
This...

1362
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:38,668
Another hairpin?

1363
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:41,588
is our Young Mistress's favorite hairpin.

1364
01:06:41,828 --> 01:06:42,868
Why is it in your hands?

1365
01:06:43,228 --> 01:06:43,828
Hear me out.

1366
01:06:44,548 --> 01:06:46,708
I saw this in a pawnshop three years ago,

1367
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:48,068
and I redeemed it,

1368
01:06:48,068 --> 01:06:50,148
because the Young Mistress
has been kind to me.

1369
01:06:50,148 --> 01:06:53,988
But I heard the pawnshop owner say...

1370
01:06:55,108 --> 01:06:57,988
that the witch sold this to him.

1371
01:07:02,828 --> 01:07:04,708
You remind me a lot of our Young Miss

1372
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:06,028
You are strikingly similar.

1373
01:07:07,388 --> 01:07:08,228
I would rather...

1374
01:07:08,908 --> 01:07:09,868
Rather?

1375
01:07:10,588 --> 01:07:11,748
let you keep it.

1376
01:07:13,108 --> 01:07:14,428
You must take good care of it.

1377
01:07:15,148 --> 01:07:15,868
Take good care of it.

1378
01:07:16,508 --> 01:07:17,388
Will you let go or not?

1379
01:07:20,268 --> 01:07:21,988
There's a reaction, it's reacting.

1380
01:07:21,988 --> 01:07:23,108
Let's ask it.

1381
01:07:25,828 --> 01:07:27,948
GPS,

1382
01:07:27,948 --> 01:07:30,868
is this the spiritual relic of Chimei?

1383
01:07:32,028 --> 01:07:33,508
Let me sense it...

1384
01:07:38,348 --> 01:07:39,748
Yes, it is!

1385
01:07:39,748 --> 01:07:41,908
This is indeed a Chimei spiritual relic.

1386
01:07:43,722 --> 01:07:47,552
(Obtained the second spiritual relic)

1387
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:49,148
Are you guys hungry?

1388
01:07:49,788 --> 01:07:52,068
Good, now you can try the dishes for me,

1389
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,068
the dishes for the banquet tonight.

1390
01:07:55,028 --> 01:07:56,708
Is this called
Stir-fried Beef with Chinese Kale?

1391
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:01,708
These two boys' appearance
goes really well...

1392
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:02,788
with plates in their hands.

1393
01:08:04,468 --> 01:08:07,588
Have a taste, these dishes
are designed for wedding banquet.

1394
01:08:08,068 --> 01:08:09,668
Try my cooking.

1395
01:08:10,028 --> 01:08:11,628
The "little steamed bum"
sure know how to cook

1396
01:08:12,348 --> 01:08:13,548
It's on par with a restaurant

1397
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:14,228
Exactly.

1398
01:08:14,388 --> 01:08:16,868
All the chicken catching wasn't in vain,
we even got a hairpin.

1399
01:08:35,548 --> 01:08:36,348
Still eating?

1400
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:37,668
We come out?

1401
01:08:39,188 --> 01:08:40,268
Grab the spiritual relic, hurry.

1402
01:08:40,268 --> 01:08:42,468
The wedding is about to start
and you're still eating?

1403
01:08:48,348 --> 01:08:50,148
Master, Madam.

1404
01:08:51,028 --> 01:08:51,628
Greetings.

1405
01:08:52,668 --> 01:08:54,548
Distinguished guests,
please take a short break.

1406
01:08:55,028 --> 01:08:56,228
Master, Madam.

1407
01:08:56,228 --> 01:08:58,308
They are our employees from Joyous Club.

1408
01:08:58,308 --> 01:08:59,628
Master of ceremonies,
here are your lines.

1409
01:08:59,628 --> 01:09:00,188
Got it.

1410
01:09:00,188 --> 01:09:03,148
Make sure to get this straight, okay?

1411
01:09:03,148 --> 01:09:04,748
No mistake is allowed in
procedures of hosting.

1412
01:09:04,748 --> 01:09:05,268
Got it.

1413
01:09:05,588 --> 01:09:06,788
The music performers, line up.

1414
01:09:07,908 --> 01:09:09,348
And the weeping bridesmaids,
stand together.

1415
01:09:10,428 --> 01:09:11,228
Listen,

1416
01:09:11,668 --> 01:09:14,228
wait for the bride and groom to walk in,

1417
01:09:14,228 --> 01:09:16,548
then watch my gesture,
watch the cues from my hand.

1418
01:09:16,548 --> 01:09:17,388
Hand cues

1419
01:09:18,148 --> 01:09:20,348
Make sure to sound , alright?

1420
01:09:20,348 --> 01:09:20,788
Understood.

1421
01:09:21,308 --> 01:09:22,668
Then let us begin.

1422
01:09:30,628 --> 01:09:33,308
A matchmaker's contract, witnessed by heaven and earth

1423
01:09:33,308 --> 01:09:35,708
Two families joined in a favorable union

1424
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:38,028
Greetings everyone, I am the host Lin Gengxin

1425
01:09:38,948 --> 01:09:41,308
Today we have guests from all directions here to celebrate

1426
01:09:41,308 --> 01:09:43,748
The noble Son of Qin Mansion, Qin Shou, takes a wife

1427
01:09:43,748 --> 01:09:45,908
The treasured daughter of the Xu family, Xu Bandong

1428
01:09:45,908 --> 01:09:48,988
Now, please welcome the newlyweds to the stage

1429
01:09:48,988 --> 01:09:49,468
Good

1430
01:09:56,588 --> 01:09:58,428
Music, let the weeping bride proceed

1431
01:10:10,028 --> 01:10:11,068
Hurry up

1432
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,228
I told you to walk faster, can't you hear?

1433
01:10:15,508 --> 01:10:15,908
Stop

1434
01:10:17,828 --> 01:10:21,988
Good, today's couple can now be united perfectly

1435
01:10:21,988 --> 01:10:24,028
Firstly, we must give special thanks to our matchmaker

1436
01:10:24,028 --> 01:10:27,068
Not only has she created a good marital match

1437
01:10:27,068 --> 01:10:29,988
But has also brought two families under her protection

1438
01:10:29,988 --> 01:10:32,268
With continuous blessings and everlasting fortune

1439
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:34,028
Good, thank the matchmaker

1440
01:10:34,308 --> 01:10:35,428
Thank the matchmaker

1441
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:39,788
Now, our newlyweds shall bow to heaven and earth

1442
01:10:39,788 --> 01:10:41,148
Rise, family members

1443
01:10:43,148 --> 01:10:43,948
Alright

1444
01:10:44,508 --> 01:10:46,708
I say, this is my sixteenth marriage already

1445
01:10:46,708 --> 01:10:48,428
Some procedures should be skipped if possible

1446
01:10:48,428 --> 01:10:49,668
Let's just unveil the bridal veil, shall we?

1447
01:10:53,108 --> 01:10:54,148
Why are you crying?

1448
01:10:59,268 --> 01:11:00,108
What bad luck

1449
01:11:01,228 --> 01:11:02,028
Hurry up

1450
01:11:11,228 --> 01:11:12,508
Why have you taken a seat, young master?

1451
01:11:19,388 --> 01:11:20,188
Ghost bride

1452
01:11:21,348 --> 01:11:22,708
Who is that person?

1453
01:11:23,148 --> 01:11:23,748
Ghost bride

1454
01:11:25,188 --> 01:11:26,228
Why did the light go out?

1455
01:11:33,148 --> 01:11:34,148
What's going on?

1456
01:11:37,788 --> 01:11:38,948
The character for 'happiness'
