1
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,628
What's going on? Help us.

2
00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:33,992
Hurry. No!

3
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,480
Look below. Behind us.

4
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,520
Who are you?

5
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,200
I'm the housekeeper. Are you okay?

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,240
- We're fine. We're used to it.
- Are you okay?

7
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,760
We just need to recite that "spell".

8
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:17,320
(Watch the Tank Lord expel the evil)

9
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,520
May you grow old together
and have children soon.

10
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,680
May you grow old together
and have children soon.

11
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,680
Housekeeper, take a look.

12
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,960
- Me?
- Go ahead.

13
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,360
I'm a bit scared.

14
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,520
Someone, help me pull this cloth.

15
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,360
Everyone's gone. What's all this about?

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,120
Who are you, exactly?

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,208
Wait.

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,320
He's a guy?

19
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,680
How come you're a man?

20
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,040
Someone hired me to get married today.

21
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,600
Something's wrong.

22
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,480
Where is our young mistress?

23
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,160
Hurry up and find her.

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,360
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,160
- Let's go.
- Find the young mistress.

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,520
Do you know where to start?

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,120
Have you heard of
a big restaurant called Baihua?

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,560
We heard from the chef

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,720
that Qin Shou's younger sister
at the Baihua Restaurant

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,320
- was taken...
- By the Sorceress.

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,400
By the Sorceress.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,360
- She's taken to Baihua Hotel.
- Right.

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,520
Please hurry and go.

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,640
- Find her.
- Let's go.

36
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,712
Go.

37
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:38,816
(The Qin Mansion)

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,760
Which way to go? This way.

39
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,120
Here. Baihua Hotel.

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,960
This is so dark. What's it like inside?

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,560
So scary.

42
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,400
What should we do?

43
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,680
(Baihua Hotel)

44
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,400
- Isn't this a bit too dark?
- So many chickens on the floor.

45
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,240
- Screaming chickens.
- Screaming chickens.

46
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
I'm stepping on it.

47
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,888
- I'm closing the door.
- No.

48
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:13,000
- No.
- No.

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,088
- Sorceress.
- Sorceress.

50
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:18,208
- Sorceress
- Sorceress, come out.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,240
- We are here.
- Let's move forward.

52
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,120
I'm also quite scared.

53
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,840
Where are you?

54
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,280
Can someone walk in front of me?
I don't want to go first.

55
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,960
We are in front of you.

56
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,720
Let's go straight ahead.

57
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,680
Anybody? Who are you?

58
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,960
- I'm behind you.
- Go in front of me.

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,560
- I'm here.
- Got you. Who are you?

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,960
I'm here.

61
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,680
- Let's stay together.
- Listen to us and follow.

62
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,080
- Don't bump into the wall.
- My hand is...

63
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,280
- I touched someone.
- My hand is here.

64
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,800
- I touched someone.
- You did?

65
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,160
- He gave me...
- It's your left hand.

66
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,560
- No, that wasn't me.
- What?

67
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,280
- Close your eyes.
- It's too dark.

68
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,520
Let's light up your little candle.

69
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,880
- Right.
- Where's our light?

70
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,320
Spiritual relic.

71
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,880
I earnestly beg
for your illumination, thank you.

72
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,776
I earnestly beg...

73
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,040
Let's take a look around.

74
00:04:38,735 --> 00:04:41,560
(First Floor of the Hotel)

75
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,720
There's a seal here.

76
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,720
Due to the horrifying incident
on the second floor,

77
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,360
this place will be
temporarily closed from now on.

78
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Please conduct yourselves with dignity.

79
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,720
So we shouldn't
break this gate. This way.

80
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,040
I need to hold onto something.

81
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,280
This painting may be useful.

82
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,880
I think this cloth is moving.

83
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,520
Which one?

84
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,000
This one. This cloth is moving.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,040
- Screaming chicken.
- Don't leave us behind, okay?

86
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,824
Don't move.

87
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,080
There's nothing. It's just a box.

88
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,920
Can we turn our backs on each other?

89
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,120
Let's stand back to back.

90
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
- Do you feel safer now?
- Yeah.

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,520
Problem solved.

92
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,360
I think it's by the sofa. Keep up.

93
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Wait, by the sofa.

94
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,760
There was a lamp.

95
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,080
- We've come back here?
- Yeah.

96
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,480
It has no light bulb.

97
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,480
Look for clues, come on.

98
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,960
- There.
- The Matchmaking Wall.

99
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,320
(The Matchmaking Wall)

100
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,400
- What does it say?
- Let's see.

101
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,160
One by one. I escape, he chases.
I can hardly fly away.

102
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,960
It's almost rhyming.

103
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,320
There must be some information.

104
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,960
- Yeah.
- Is there anything special?

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,880
Look for clues
that can lead to the bride.

106
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,360
Xu Bandon.

107
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,720
Xu Bandon is the bride.

108
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,400
Father wants to
turn his luck at gambling.

109
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,400
I do not wish to become a tool
for fulfilling his desires.

110
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,920
I implore the heavens
to hear my plea and save me.

111
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,280
Take this down.
I pray for heavenly blessing.

112
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,600
(Qin Li's wish tablet)
May I and Zhi escape this place.

113
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,440
Another character, Zhi.

114
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,680
To hold your hand
and spend a lifetime together.

115
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,760
- Qin Li, in 1921.
- Anything else?

116
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,720
One for Xu Bandong. One for Qin Li.

117
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,400
Dao, Dou.

118
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,520
None of these.

119
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,760
These two are the key.

120
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,440
Let's study these carefully.

121
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,560
- Oh no, here they come.
- They're here.

122
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,320
- Don't push.
- Let's merge.

123
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,880
I have finally seen it.

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,480
- Give me the light.
- Divine object.

125
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,360
- Divine object.
- Don't scream.

126
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,880
- Close your eyes.
- Talk.

127
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,040
Don't catch me.

128
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,720
You are Qin Li.

129
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,800
- No.
- She is Xu Bandong.

130
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,560
- Xu Bandong.
- She has a mole on her face.

131
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,440
- Who are you?
- We are immortals.

132
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,840
No, we are here...

133
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,320
I don't know what you are saying.

134
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,400
Who are you?

135
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,640
We're here for the wedding tonight.

136
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,440
So you're from the Qin Mansion.

137
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,960
- No, we are not.
- Definitely not.

138
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,600
He asked us to come here
or he wouldn't pay us.

139
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,960
So you are here
to catch me for the money?

140
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,080
No, we won't catch you.
We are here to rescue you.

141
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,920
- Are you human?
- Are you?

142
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,440
Yeah, touch my arm.

143
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,880
We feel that something is fishy

144
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,800
about this marriage.

145
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,440
That's why we came to this hotel.

146
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
To do you justice.

147
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,160
Yeah, to do you justice.

148
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,280
Take a vow. You'll be unlucky
for the rest of your lives

149
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,920
if you catch me.

150
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,880
Come on.

151
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,280
The six of us assure you that

152
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,240
we did not come here to catch you,

153
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,040
- but to uncover the truth.
- Yeah.

154
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,440
Then I shall believe you.

155
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,720
- Sit over there.
- Okay.

156
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,200
I'll switch on the light.

157
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,240
Wonderful.

158
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,360
- Why did you come here?
- Where is the matchmaker?

159
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,768
Found a clue.

160
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm marrying Qin Shou today.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,120
- You know Qin Shou, right?
- Yeah.

162
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
(Ning Yi as Xu Bandong)
But I never

163
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,680
agreed to this marriage.

164
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,520
- But my father...
- He owes gambling debts.

165
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
How do you know?

166
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,000
We saw your wish tablet.

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,720
Yeah, my father is a compulsive gambler.

168
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,160
The Sorceress you mentioned told him

169
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,360
that once he married me off today,

170
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,800
he'd win every gamble from now on.

171
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
I was planning
to feign illness to avoid it,

172
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,960
so I didn't come
to the rehearsal this afternoon.

173
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,360
And I've also heard that

174
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,920
our bridal chamber would be the room

175
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,920
of his sister, Qin Li,
who died three years ago.

176
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,520
It's just frightening.

177
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,560
This key works here.

178
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
What did you take?

179
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,640
Keys. I can't give them to you.

180
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,880
Don't bother.

181
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,720
I warn you.

182
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,960
Xu Bandong, these are my keys.

183
00:10:57,376 --> 00:10:58,840
- No.
- Don't.

184
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,240
You can't have it.

185
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,280
Please lend us the lantern.

186
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,320
- No, I'm too scared.
- We'll take you with us then.

187
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,880
- Come with us.
- Come along.

188
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,400
The Singer is here. So scary.
I dare not run around.

189
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,600
- What's scary?
- The Singer.

190
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,120
The two of us are scary?

191
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,000
What else would you like to tell us?

192
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,320
The Singer is here.

193
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,160
You're looking for something, right?

194
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,840
Go to the second floor.

195
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,800
Everything you're looking for is there.

196
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:35,136
Who's this? Who are you?

197
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:36,416
Me. He Yu.

198
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,520
Turn on the Divine Realm Lantern.

199
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,120
Divine Realm Lantern.

200
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,320
Spiritual relic, I sincerely ask you
to turn on the light for me.

201
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,920
Spiritual relic, I sincerely ask you
to turn on the light for me.

202
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,760
Spiritual relic, I sincerely ask you
to turn on the light for me.

203
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,320
It's not working.

204
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,520
Who dares to go upstairs?

205
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,240
Spiritual relic, I sincerely ask you
to turn on the light for me.

206
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,960
Please turn it on.

207
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,480
- It's here.
- Where?

208
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,040
Who's here? Don't move.

209
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,960
Spiritual relic, I sincerely ask you

210
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,520
to light up the candle for me.

211
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
It doesn't work.

212
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,800
- Let's go.
- It lit up.

213
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,160
I'll open the door.

214
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,800
- Lin Gengxin, open the door.
- Light it up for me.

215
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,240
Open up.

216
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,720
I can't. More locks.

217
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,840
- Can you open it?
- Hurry up.

218
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,880
- They're coming out.
- Hurry, push.

219
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,680
- Close it.
- Lock the door.

220
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,160
Hurry.

221
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,120
Hurry.

222
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,840
- His gaze is frightening.
- Let's go.

223
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,240
Go upstairs.

224
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,080
- Upstairs.
- I'm in front.

225
00:13:21,964 --> 00:13:23,040
This is too scary.

226
00:13:27,136 --> 00:13:28,320
(Second Floor of the Hotel)

227
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,520
Another space.

228
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,440
Isn't that...

229
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,600
(I'm here, who dares to be reckless?)
Isn't this Qin Li? ShenLi?

230
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,840
Who? Is there light?

231
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,160
Looking up to you,
chasing after you, becoming you.

232
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,240
You are her idol.

233
00:13:49,924 --> 00:13:53,720
(Qin Li sees ShenLi as her goal)

234
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,040
Zhi's... This is Zhi's tailoring shop.

235
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,040
- Who is Zhi again?
- He's Qin Li's...

236
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,400
Beloved one.

237
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,680
The key doesn't open it.

238
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,840
- We need to find the key.
- Find the key.

239
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,480
Let's search through this whole place.

240
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,400
I found the keys in the fireplace.

241
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,760
Nothing in the drawers.

242
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,440
So many locks.

243
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,440
It's such a big place.

244
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,640
Yeah, there's room 992.

245
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,440
Poster. ShenLi's poster.

246
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,360
Take a close look at the poster.

247
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,080
- Looking up to you...
- Let's look up.

248
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,240
- Your head.
- The ceiling.

249
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,000
- Looking up.
- To treat a stiff neck.

250
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,520
We don't know
what we're looking for. Just look up.

251
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,280
Looking up to you...

252
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,920
- This umbrella must be useful.
- Do we need to use it?

253
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,160
- This umbrella seems...
- Familiar.

254
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,536
Does it?

255
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,600
There's something here.

256
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,880
There are words here, look.

257
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,920
Zhi's key is at 13...

258
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,080
The key is at 13...

259
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,240
What are the room numbers over there?

260
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,640
- 992.
- 992.

261
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,560
There's a tape measure.

262
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:35,480
- Found it.
- Does it have a 13?

263
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,360
- There's a key here.
- That must be it.

264
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,920
Zhi's Tailor Shop.

265
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,440
Let me observe the formation first.

266
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,640
One of them must be real.

267
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,080
Let's see if there is a girl.

268
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,240
- For now...
- There's no real one.

269
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,472
There are no real people.

270
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,320
Will they move if I take off
the red paper strips

271
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,720
on their heads?

272
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,200
- No way.
- They probably will.

273
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,440
Don't scare me.

274
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,320
Then I'll go first.

275
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,240
The door is open.

276
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,320
The light. The magic lamp.

277
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,440
The door is open. Get in.

278
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,480
- Get in.
- Get the light first.

279
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,600
Spiritual relic, I earnestly beg

280
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,760
for your illumination, thank you.

281
00:16:33,248 --> 00:16:34,440
Okay, let's go.

282
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:41,536
(Zhi's Tailor Shop)

283
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,440
Please don't leave me in the back.

284
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
I'll do it.

285
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:58,320
(May you be happy
and prosperous forever)

286
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,600
May you be happy and prosperous forever.

287
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,760
Bath in love forever.

288
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,320
God, her head fell off.

289
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,400
Her head has fallen off.

290
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,760
Find the light first, there's a switch.

291
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,200
- Here.
- This one inside.

292
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,240
- We overreacted.
- Who knows?

293
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,520
Her head can even fall off.

294
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
Should we be looking for
the key to that room?

295
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,160
- Why is there blood?
- Why is there blood on the ground?

296
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,840
Wait a moment, this definitely
didn't be here for no reason.

297
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Why is there blood?

298
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,000
- A letter, where did you see that?
- On the ground.

299
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,120
Zhi.

300
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,800
Even though our family are so different,

301
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,120
we have always believed that
love can overcome all difficulties.

302
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,200
But that witch
somehow bewitched my father.

303
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,920
Tomorrow at 3:00 in the afternoon.

304
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,880
Let's meet at the dock.

305
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,440
You must remember to bring it.

306
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,376
The one from our 992 room at the hotel.

307
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:36,320
- The wedding dress you sewed by hand.
- The wedding dress.

308
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,640
- The key is hidden in the extra thing.
- The extra thing?

309
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,440
I will never forget.

310
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,080
The words you said
when you expressed your feelings for me.

311
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,320
I am the nightmare
of nine hundred million girls.

312
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,600
The nightmare
of nine hundred million girls.

313
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,080
And you are my dream.

314
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,680
I had always loved you.

315
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
Li.

316
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,200
Okay.

317
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,280
April 1st, 1922.

318
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,240
Li wrote it for her beloved Zhi.

319
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,000
Anyway, I think the room is definitely...

320
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,040
Yes, 992 is that room with a cheongsam.

321
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,240
- It's hidden in a extra thing.
- The extra thing.

322
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,560
This model.

323
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,840
Is it extra?

324
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,600
But it's the only one
wearing a bridal dress.

325
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,720
Yes, it's wearing the bridal dress.

326
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,320
The others are not bridal dresses.

327
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,400
The extra thing.

328
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
The extra thing.

329
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,200
What is the extra thing?

330
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,960
The extra thing.

331
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,520
Let's see which item is unreasonable.

332
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,160
Do we need a number?

333
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,200
No numbers, the room number is 992.

334
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,720
The key is hidden in the extra thing.

335
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,040
What is the extra thing?

336
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,040
"I hand you."

337
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:43,853
(I had always loved you.)

338
00:20:44,755 --> 00:20:45,920
(Hand)

339
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,640
Touch, is there an extra "t" in it?

340
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,160
Yes, it's 'Ouch' in the line.

341
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,200
Not "Touch".

342
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,800
Yes, there's an extra "T".

343
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,400
- "T" might mean hand, on the hand.
- The hand.

344
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,120
Didn't dare to move Guan Yu.

345
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,960
It was really at there.

346
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,600
Yes, on his sword hilt.

347
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,920
On this hand.

348
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,040
Guan Yu's hand.

349
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,480
I found nothing there.

350
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,480
This should be the key for 992.

351
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,200
Then we should head to 992 now.

352
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,280
992.

353
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,760
Find out the next riddle.

354
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,280
Wait for me.

355
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,360
Make a wish, spiritual relic,
I sincerely make a wish.

356
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,560
Could you please light the candle for me,
thank you.

357
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,360
Spiritual relic,
I sincerely make a wish.

358
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,440
Could you light the candle in my hand?

359
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,280
Then we'll go to room 992.

360
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,000
Come on, move forward, in the dark, go.

361
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,120
- No.
- Hold me.

362
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,520
No, there aren't any stairs
in the middle, right?

363
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
- I forgot.
- It's fine, just go slower.

364
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,680
Turn right, follow me.

365
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,800
To your left are stairs.

366
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,480
Listen to my voice,
listen to the footsteps.

367
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,120
All holding hands,
because I am worried about what's ahead.

368
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,760
Is there any place
where we might fall off?

369
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,160
Everyone be careful.

370
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,520
- Go.
- Go straight ahead.

371
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,800
I remember it's right in front.

372
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,160
No, it's the counter now.

373
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,520
Head towards that light.

374
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,280
It's a counter, a cabinet.

375
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,720
A bit more to the right.

376
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,560
It's okay, follow me.

377
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,000
Everyone, line up.

378
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,320
How can we still not be used to dark?

379
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,000
- To the right.
- I'm at the far left now, it's fine.

380
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,760
Just follow me.

381
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,680
This is definitely not the staircase.

382
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,040
It's not the stairs we came up.

383
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,800
Is this a corridor?

384
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,000
It should be.

385
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,840
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

386
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,080
Spirit relic, I pray to you once more
with sincerity.

387
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,200
Please light the candle for me.

388
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,640
Don't make me slap you.

389
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,400
I can't open the spirit relic.

390
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,440
Here comes the candle.

391
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,640
Alright, there's a door on the left.

392
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,680
- Who has the key? Hand it to me.
- I've got it.

393
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,440
- Okay.
- Push to see if it can be opened first.

394
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,608
Pull it.

395
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,000
There's a light.

396
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,336
(Room 992 on the second floor
of the hotel)

397
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,120
This is the one that Li mentioned.

398
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,520
The dress Zhi bought for her.

399
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,160
Sewn by hand.

400
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,440
Li looks quite familiar.

401
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,400
Isn't this the two of you?

402
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,520
- With a mole.
- They're exactly the same.

403
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,760
Mole, both of you have moles.

404
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,760
She has a mole on her nose.

405
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,760
Wait, there's something on this wall.

406
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,200
I resent this evil witch.

407
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,680
She sent someone to kill you
at the tailor's.

408
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,640
I don't want to live alone.

409
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,480
I won't accept it.
The brides in this town,

410
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,480
they can wear the dresses you made
and marry the ones they love,

411
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,840
while I can never see you again,
wearing your favorite wedding dress,

412
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,200
preparing a suprise for me.

413
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,240
- So she was...
- She committed suicide, right?

414
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,840
And she cursed the witch.

415
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,840
She never wore that dress.

416
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,920
Right, she never wore it.

417
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,120
- Is the Chimei Qin Li?
-Qin Li has passed away.

418
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,280
It's possible that Qin Li
became a Chimei after she died.

419
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,680
She turned into a Chimei,
lingering in Mortal Realm.

420
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,680
So, we have to go find Qin Li.

421
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,240
- Seal her.
- Seal her.

422
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,800
Wait, is it the spiritual relic?

423
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,080
Yes.

424
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,720
There's still blood on it.

425
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,680
Then we have collected them all.

426
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,400
Once collected, we can find Chimei.

427
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,400
(All three spiritual relics
have been collected)

428
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,160
(You have gathered
the three spiritual relics needed)

429
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,920
(Now, go to Zhi's Tailor Shop)

430
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,160
(I have sent the method to seal Chimei there)

431
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,240
- Near the tailor shop, hurry.
- Come on, come on.

432
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,360
Should I prepare any jewelry?

433
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,160
No, have you ever thought about it?
She is Qin Li, right?

434
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,240
- Yes.
- Reincarnated.

435
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,272
That's me.

436
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,760
Come on, are you Qin Li or not?

437
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,560
Once again?

438
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,880
This is the sealing ceremony.

439
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,960
Qin Li and Zhi fell in love
and pledged to each other in secret.

440
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,560
(Sealing ceremony)
Alas, their love was not the destiny.

441
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,040
Zhi was kill by the witch,
the night before their elopement.

442
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,560
Qin Li never got to see her lover,

443
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,880
and the surprise he prepared.

444
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,680
To seal the Chimei,

445
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,560
we must collect
three spiritual relics, done.

446
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,760
Insert them one by one,

447
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,960
into the three happiness boxes
on the second floor of the Baihua Hotel.

448
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,400
The second floor is here, right?

449
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,840
And that will trigger something.

450
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,320
Please, redo the surprise that Zhi

451
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,560
prepared for Qin Li with love again.

452
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,160
And dispel the Chimei's resentment.

453
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
What is a happiness box?

454
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,920
- Let's find the box first, shall we?
- What is a happiness box?

455
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,800
This is already sealed.

456
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,040
The happiness box is here,
is this the second floor?

457
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,880
- Yes.
- Second floor.

458
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,920
This happiness box...

459
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,048
It's...

460
00:28:06,048 --> 00:28:08,280
(Cherishing the deep love,
not wasting our destiny)

461
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,440
Three, three happiness boxes.

462
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,920
- 1, 2, 3. I'm so scared.
- Insert them.

463
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,120
- That's the right thing to do.
- Yes.

464
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,440
Come on, read it.

465
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:27,360
(Break the boundary
that defines our love)

466
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,720
- Don't move.
- Isn't this the lyric?

467
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,160
This is a song lyric.

468
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,240
This is our song "As Before".

469
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,560
This is Zhi's surprise.

470
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,760
- Right.
- So, now the surprise is here.

471
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,000
- We should perform it with deep love.
- Right.

472
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,320
How do we perform this?

473
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,240
You two, redo the scene.

474
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,840
The "I think I might like you."

475
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,600
In that case, I think a hug is good.

476
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,920
I think that will do.

477
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,080
This is a passionate rendition.

478
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,640
I think you should sing it.

479
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,960
Let's do this, prepare for both ways.

480
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,200
After we hug, you guys sing from behind.

481
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,520
You hug, we sing.

482
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,320
Come on, get ready.

483
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,464
- What?
- ♪Toast to the love and hate engraved into our bones♪

484
00:29:10,464 --> 00:29:14,124

What's the matter?

496
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,520
It's over.

497
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,120
Blessings.

498
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,120
- Who?
- What's wrong?

499
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,000
I pray to you sincerely.

500
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,680
It was you who sealed the Chimei.

501
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,680
What? Who's speaking?

502
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,400
We've already sealed her away.

503
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,960
Why did you seal her?

504
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,120
She is such a good person.

505
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,960
- What?
- Who are you, who are you?

506
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,640
You are Qin Li, Xu Bandon.

507
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,240
No, not Xu Bandon.

508
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,120
Xu Bandon was the one
down there just now.

509
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,320
You are the Witch.

510
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,400
I am the Witch?

511
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,800
How could I possibly be such a villain?

512
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,680
- Then who are you?
- I want to see for myself.

513
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,160
Who is ruining my good fortune tonight?

514
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,440
What was spoiled, sister?

515
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,120
- Wait a minute.
- What?

516
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,640
Wait for me.

517
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,320
Heavenly and earthly spirits,
turn on the light, turn on the light!

518
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,400
Oh my god, you guys...

519
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,040
Ms. Jin, Heavenly Lord.

520
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,800
You are characters
from "The Legend of ShenLi".

521
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,920
We are all Diviners,
shall we pay our respects?

522
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,840
Even Diviners are frightened.

523
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,120
They're about to wet their pants.

524
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,640
Diviners, take your seats, please.

525
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,280
The seats are all prepared for you.

526
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,880
- Here.
- They're scared.

527
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,040
Yet still, you're still
putting on a brave front.

528
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,600
Come on, have a seat, sit down.

529
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,720
Do you know who I am?

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,560
You are Qin Li?

531
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,600
Not Qin Li, but Shen Li.

532
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,480
- Xu Bandon.
- You are the Witch.

533
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,000
- And Dao.
- Dao

534
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,320
You're smart.

535
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,040
Why are you guys here?

536
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,120
We've come to seal away the Chimei.

537
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,720
Yes we have a task in the mortal world.

538

Good intentions to evil deeds.

539
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,000
You're saying Chimei is good, why?

540
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,520
Chimei is of course a good person.

541
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,840
Don't you know?

542
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,320
- No.
- Tell us about it.

543
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,800
I know all the truth.

544
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,720
I can only tell people I trust.

545
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,760
- Can I trust you?
- We look very trustworthy, don't we?

546
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,200
You already know we are Diviners.

547
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,440
- What's there not to trust, right?
- Right.

548
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,880
Look, she looks
exactly like this painting.

549
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,800
It does look very similar.

550
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,120
Even though you all resemble the
characters from "The Legend of ShenLi".

551
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,880
But how do I know
you're not liars, so...

552
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,200
I have a book that
I've been reading since I was young.

553

- "ShenLi Diary"
- "ShenLi Diary"

554
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,560
It contains all the classic scenes
from "The Legend of ShenLi".

555
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,960
If you can reenact the scene
in front of me,

556
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,440
- then I'll believe you are genuine.
- Let's do it.

557
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,000
It has to be exactly the same
as what's in the play.

If there is the slightest mistake,

559
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,160
I will think that you are fake.

560

However, what Your Excellency just said

make me wonder.

that you are such an eloquent person.

594

Don't make random guesses, Your Excellency.

Three years ago, my father and the Witch

651
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,800
forced me to marry a man I didn’t like at all,

652
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,640
so I escaped.

653
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,360
When I had nowhere to go,

654
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,720
Qin Li took me in.

her body emitted a golden light

and turned into a Chimei.

659
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,640
- The Chimei has spiritual power.
- So the Chimei is on the good side.

660

those matchmaking walls you saw

662
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,320
on the first floor of the Baihua Hotel, right?

663
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,400
- There were many prayer plaques on those walls.
- We saw that.

664
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,400
We found many girls
who shared the same wishes with us

665
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,200
through those prayer plaques.

666
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,120
- They are all Singers.
- Exactly.

667
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,360
Everything happened in the Qin Mansion today

668
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,600
was my doing.

669
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,720
I used a bit of spiritual power

670
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,560
to make a chilly wind blow at the scene,

671
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,160
and the lanterns flash violently.

672
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,320
Then we also

673
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,600
had many agile men disguised as brides.

674
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,760
The brides were men?

675
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,080
It was the perfect time to escape.

676
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,800
Actually, before the marriage,

677
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,480
we had already abducted the real bride.

678
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,720
You people saved Xu Bandong,
that was good.

679
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,960
I saved her.

680
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,440
Impressive.

681
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,880
I came up with a brilliant plan before,

682
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,080
which is when the Witch

683
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,040
holds another brainwashing session tonight.

684
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,080
I will show people her true color.

685
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,600
But you sealed my spiritual power,

686
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,440
I don't have the spiritual power
to fight against her anymore.

687
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,800
Then we're the ones

688
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,840
- who help you unmask the Witch's trickery.
- Right.

689
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,640
But I don't know how...

690
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,480
Can you give us more information?

691
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,880
We are definitely going to help you.

692
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,200
I'm so silly. I remember now.

693
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,320
There is a secret room near the hotel,

694
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,160
and the Witch's witchcraft secrets
are hidden in it.

695
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,320
If you can open this secret room,

696
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,960
then you can find a way to deal with her.

697
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,200
But you don't have the key.

698
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,560
- I have it.
- Thank you.

699
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,440
I thought we had to look for the key again.

700
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,960
Here's the thing,

701
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
the key to that secret room
is inside this box.

702
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,600
But I've tried it for several years
and never got it opened.

703
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,960
The key is inside the box.

704
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,160
I'll leave it to you then.

00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,680
However, just in case,

707
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,160
I have another favor to ask.

708
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,760
Qin Li and ShenLi look very much alike,

709
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,040
so I've got an idea.

710
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,760
But I need ShenLi's help.

711
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,240
- Okay.
- Dao wants to take a photo with her.

712
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,080
No.

713
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,720
Do we need to take a group photo?

714
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,760
A group photo.

715
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,800
You guys can work on the box here.

716
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,680
I will take ShenLi away first.

717
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,120
Should we go to the entrance then?

718
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,480
After unlocking the box.

719
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,800
'After unlocking the box.'

720
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,760
I've got a flight to catch.

721
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,480
Seriously?

722
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,040
- You...
- Do you really believe that?

723
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,720
There is a key inside indeed.

724
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,760
Look at the bottom,
does it mean anything?

725
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,760
Four letters, right?

726
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,080
Yes, the combination consists of four letters.

727
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,480
I think this could be the letter X.

728
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,560
- They are all X‘s.
- All X's? No, that's not right.

729
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,960
This is the only clue?

730
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,040
I think it's the only one.

731
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,360
Because nothing else is related to it.

732
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,320
Put it here.

733
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,560
Two dots, binary code.

734
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,320
If binary code is involved,
I don't think we can solve it at all.

735
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,960
It's beyond our...

736
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,800
- I am confused.
- Try a different angle.

737
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,960
Spin it.

738
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,040
- Faster.
- Are you guys playing around?

739
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,920
I think it's about the angle.

740
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,400
No, angle doesn't matter.

741
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,120
- Any clue?
- My eyes are getting crossed.

742
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,120
You can try to look at it with your eyes crossed.

743
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,440
Maybe you can see something else.

744
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,440
- What?
- Rain.

745
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,880
The blue pattern here, it's the character for 'rain', right?

746
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,480
Yes,

747
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,840
And the red pattern is the character for 'wind'.

748
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,680
Wind and rain.

749
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,400
- How many 'rain' characters?
- How many 'rain' characters?

750
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,520
-Five 'wind's.
-Five 'wind's and ten 'rain's.

751
00:45:43,823 --> 00:45:46,944
(Five 'wind's and ten 'rain's)

752
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:49,266
(WFSY)

753
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,720
- Great job.
- We got it right?

754
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,800
Wow.

755
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,120
Yes!

756
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,240
Let's find the secret room.

757
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,400
On the main street to our right.

758
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,520
On the main street, right.

759
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,120
We've finally made it outside.

760
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,840
- Right here.
- Open the door.

761
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,896
Let's go inside.

762
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,560
Private.

763
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,560
A little witch. I'll take a look.

764
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,920
I learned a few tricks today
from the master on the western ship.

765
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,800
People in this city
are superstitious about fortunes.

766
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,160
We pose as the Lunar God's envoys,
which can give blessings

767
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,160
to make a fortune.

768
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,280
The Witch of the Lunar God's envoy
came to us.

769
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,120
She possesses the witchcraft
bestowed by the Lunar God.

770
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,800
She's just a charlatan.

771
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,200
Yesterday I had someone kill the tailor Zhi.

772
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,040
Yesterday she had someone kill the tailor Zhi.

773
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,320
Qin Li killed herself for love.

774
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,880
But I disguised her death as a sacrifice
to avert disaster for the family.

775
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,320
After all, Master Qin had no doubts at all.

776
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,360
The frequent bizarre incidents at weddings
in recent years

777
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,840
are by no chance about anything supernatural.

778
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,440
If supernatural creatures do exist
in this world,

779
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,160
Qin Li would have led the spirits
to take revenge on me a long time ago.

780
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,160
You look very much like our young mistress.

781
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,880
Qin Li and ShenLi look very much alike,

782
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,600
so I've got an idea.

783
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,080
Zhao Liying might have to
impersonate Qin Li.

784
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,800
See? She said, "by no chance
about anything supernatural."

785
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,360
"If supernatural creatures do exist
in this world,"

786
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,560
those things would have come to her
a long time ago.

787
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,120
So she's terrified of this.

788
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,160
- Right.
- Dao is taking Liying to do this.

789
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,240
Right, to scare the Witch.

790
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,000
Tonight, I'm going to hold a brainwashing session.

791
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,960
- March 12th.
- Is it today?

792
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,880
Yeah, she wrote this diary today.

793
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,080
Tonight, I'm going to hold a brainwashing session.

794
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,920
I will once again perform tricks
to deceive everyone.

795
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,120
Unless someone else in this city
can perform the same tricks,

796
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,360
otherwise, I will remain
the only deity of the D City.

797
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,040
tricks?

798
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,920
She said if someone else in this city
could perform the same tricks

799
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,280
and exposed her,

800
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,880
otherwise, she would remain the only deity.

801
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,600
- So we need to open this.
- Right.

802
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,720
(Witch's spare prop box)
These are spare props for the tricks.

803
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,400
We have to imitate her tricks.

804
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,480
Now we need to find the key.

805
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,960
Take all these things out first.

806
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,680
- Is there anything useful?
- This is not useful, right?

807
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,720
- Have you looked at both of these?
- Yes.

808
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,880
- Nothing useful.
- There's more of the diary.

809
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,160
Be sure to drink plenty of hot water.

810
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,400
Only with good health
can I deceive more people.

811
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,040
Drink plenty of hot water?

812
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,400
Hot water.

813
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,360
- The hot water...
- That's hot water.

814
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,040
Does this bottle contain hot water?

815
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,880
A key?

816
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,440
- Be sure to drink plenty of hot water.
- Right.

817
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,320
Let's see what props are inside.

818
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,760
- "I must remember"
- "I must remember..."

819
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,760
"to check often the scroll painting on the wall."

820
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,760
"I can't let anyone discover the secret behind it."

821
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,360
- There's a secret behind it.
- There's a secret.

822
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,960
- Withdraw wine from an empty jar.
- The wound heals itself instantly.

823
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,760
- One time for one trick.
- Gengxin, take you time to read.

824
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,000
- I'll take one trick first.
- Okay.

825
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,320
- Pour the water until it's 90% full.
- 90% full.

826
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,680
Find the small hole at the pattern
around the spout of the wine pot.

827
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,760
I found it.

828
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,920
- Block it.
- Done.

829
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,440
Turn the wine pot upside down,

830
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,600
and it presents a state

831
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,800
where no water pours out
from the wine pot.

832
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,080
She might show the audience like this.

833
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,680
If you block the hole, the water won't come out.

834
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,880
It really is.

835
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,360
See? I am right.

836
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:26,120
Turn the pot around,
and pretend to retrieve wine in the air.

837
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,600
- Wine, please come.
- And turn the wine pot over again.

838
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,080
At this time,
the pot can pour half a glass wine.

839
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,480
Once poured,
you can't block that opening.

840
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,480
It's able to pour half a glass of wine.
It has been poured.

841
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,600
That's it, right?

842
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,120
Yes, you've learned the trick, right?

843
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,760
- Just learn it.
- Right.

844
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,080
- Integrate and apply it.
- Okay.

845
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,840
Let's move on to the second one,
wound healing.

846
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,040
Wang Yiyao, learn this one.

847
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,760
I'll learn it. I'll heal myself.

848
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,400
Wound healing.

849
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,040
Prepare chilled knives.

850
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,520
This one tub of ice?

851
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,800
Draw a horizontal line
with blood-like paint.

852
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,280
Then the paint will resemble skin tone
after drying.

853
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,840
- Okay, now
- Grab the ice knife.

854
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,000
if you show your hand...

855
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,440
Show that there are no wounds.

856
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,640
- Slash with the knife.
- Get a knife.

857
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,400
- I think you should grip it.
- Yes.

858
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,480
Wow!

859
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,320
- Then, after three seconds, it heals.
- It's healed.

860
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,640
So we have also understood
the principle behind it.

861
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,840
- We must go to the scene to expose her.
- Yes.

862
00:51:37,654 --> 00:51:39,790
(Qin Mansion)

863
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:48,864
Witch.

864
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,200
Today, we have all gathered here.

865
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,720
Because of the power of the moon God,

866
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,600
it brings us here.

867
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,640
Thank the great Moon God.

868
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,680
Thank Moon God.

869
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,920
The power Moon God gave me is endless.

870
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,800
As long as you believe in me,

871
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,360
I will bring you endless good fortune.

872
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,920
- The Brainwashing Conference starts.
- The conference is right here.

873
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,480
I just sprinkle a cup of the divine dew.

874
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,680
The witch
is very effective and accurate.

875
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,840
It can make all people here
have a long life.

876
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,560
Remove illness and poison.

877
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:43,760
Here comes the divine dew. It's gone.

878
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,440
- Does anyone else want a second cup?
- Yes.

879
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,040
- The second cup is coming.
- Good.

880
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,840
I know someone don't believe
or respect me, but that's okay.

881
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:11,880
Now I continue to show my divine power.

882
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,640
- Get a knife.
- Pretend to wipe it.

883
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,640
It's not necessary.

884
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,280
You take it.

885
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,320
Open your eyes.

886
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,800
Instantly without a trace.

887
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,720
That's amazing.

888
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,120
Divine power has worked.

889
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,320
As long as you follow my orders,

890
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,040
all your wishes will come true.

891
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,520
The divine power that Moon God gave me

892
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,680
cannot be replaced by anyone.

893
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,400
Witch.

894
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,760
- Expose it?
- It's time.

895
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,880
Is it time?

896
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,800
- Let's go, bro.
- You're lying.

897
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,600
- Who's lying?
- You're lying.

898
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,000
- You're a fraud.
- You're lying.

899
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,280
- Fraud.
- Guys, let me expose her.

900
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,920
I have brought a pot like hers.

901
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,120
How does he have the same pot?

902
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,240
Where did it come from?

903
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,160
I'm here to tell you
that the witch is a fraud.

904
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,000
This is impossible.

905
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,328
Look.

906
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,360
- It's gone.
- There's nothing magical about it.

907
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,120
But look.

908
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,720
- Here comes the water.
- Really?

909
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,720
- It's real.
- Do you see it?

910
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,640
- Her instant healing is also fake.
- Right.

911
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,720
- There's nothing there.
- Take out a knife.

912
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,520
It will heal slowly.

913
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:34,440
Understand? So the witch is fake.

914
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,200
Those are deceptive props.

915
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,240
Witch,
why do they also have divine power?

916
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,520
Right, why do they have it, too?

917
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,400
How can his divine power
compare to mine?

918
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,080
I give it to the people of Tui Market.

919
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,520
Witch, what is this sound?

920
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,680
- It's coming from over there.
- There's a fire.

921
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,872
It's here.

922
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,960
Legend has it that
when Mortal Realm is not peaceful,

923
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,480
hundred elves will appear.

924
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,600
Hundred elves.

925
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,800
Punish the evil and uphold justice.

926
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,440
Qin Li, how could it be you?

927
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,920
Could this be the legendary Night God
of hundred elves?

928
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,088
I'm here. How dare you?

929
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:48,440
Three years ago, you killed my lover
and caused my tragic death.

930
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,920
Now I lead
all wronged souls you've killed

931
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,720
to return to Mortal Realm to punish you.

932
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,920
Witch, do you plead guilty?

933
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:03,320
Do you plead guilty?

934
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,920
I plead guilty.

935
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,400
I beg you to spare me. Please spare me.

936
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,880
I'm wrong. I won't dare to do it again.

937
00:58:09,926 --> 00:58:12,416
(Witch was jailed for murder)

938
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,560
(The real culprit is finally caught.)

939
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,200
(The obsession on Qin Li's wedding dress
drifts away with the wind)

940
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,080
(and finally relieved.)

941
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,160
(The life of the people of Tui Market
returns to happiness and peace.)

942
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,760
(Henceforth, the lovers of Tui Market
are finally united in matrimony.)

943
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,200
(Thus, Tui Market is at peace.)
(Continue to write happy story of love.)

944
00:58:33,631 --> 00:58:37,800
(Tui Market task is completed.)

945
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,920
(Congratulations on finishing the task.)

946
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,400
(How does everyone feel
about going to Mortal Realm today?)

947
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,600
The feeling in Mortal Realm
about doing this task today?

948
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,120
- It was heart-stopping.
- Quite interesting.

949
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,000
Because I rarely
play this kind of secrets game.

950
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,480
This is my first experience.

951
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,040
Because I was particularly afraid
to play before.

952
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,280
- You played quite well today.
- I think it's okay. I have grown.

953
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,840
How to adapt when after half a day,
I still can't see?

954
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,560
Wow, the head fell off.

955
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,400
Be together forever
and blessed with a child soon.

956
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,920
Here is a kit.

957
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,640
Then take it out.

958
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,800
There is something here.
The key is at thirteen.

959
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,040
But Witch somehow bewitched my father.

960
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,560
- This wedding box.
- Yes.

961
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,680
I'm here. How dare you?

962
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,600
Fantastic!

963
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,360
- Firstly, I think I did a good deed.
- Yes.

964
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,400
- Exposed a deceptive trick.
- Yes.

965
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,800
There are so many storylines.

966
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,320
It actually corresponds to some episodes
in our play.

967
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,200
The production team is very attentive

968
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,000
and meticulously designs

969
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,200
some of the plots within our play.

970
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,640
The plots, the character relationships.

971
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,520
Involved in this decoding session today,

972
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,920
it vaguely seems to be on the set.

973
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,080
And the whole thing is very meaningful.

974
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,280
It means demons and ghosts are all fake.

975
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,480
But

976
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,720
there are no such things
as demons and devils.

977
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,760
It's just bad people doing evil.

978
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,560
It is just the evil in one's heart.

979
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,760
- The evil inside
- I want to be a kind person.

980
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,400
Yes.

981
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,440
Secondly, I think I

982
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:40,080
- need to improve my intelligence.
- Yes.

983
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,320
You wouldn't know
without going to Mortal Realm.

984
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,560
We Divine Realm and Immortal Realm
are quite timid.

985
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,040
No courage, and no intelligence, either.

986
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,680
about the team we have here today,

987
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,720
have you seen it?

988
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,840
- Practiced before.
- It's called Ying Ge Dance.

989
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,600
Ying Ge Dance.

990
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,360
It's a folk culture.

991
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,440
It can be found
in Chaoshan and Southern Fujian areas.

992
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,040
It's quite spectacular and imposing.

993
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,680
(Stilt Yangge)
And their makeup is particularly good.

994
01:01:11,438 --> 01:01:14,788
(Nuo dance)

995
01:01:14,788 --> 01:01:18,899
(Sichuan opera fire breathing)

996
01:01:18,899 --> 01:01:21,240
(Piaose)

997
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,600
- Very stunning.
- I also find it particularly stunning.

998
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,240
Let everyone think
because the teleplay is over,

999
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,480
and the episode has been broadcast.

1000
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,640
What do you want to say to the audience?

1001
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,480
My current feeling is

1002
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,200
that it truly has come to an end.

1003
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,960
- Gone.
- No, it was just...

1004
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,000
- Can be blocked now.
- Yes, can be blocked now.

1005
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,360
It means our part has come to an end.

1006
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,720
Yes, and then

1007
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,000
thank you. Thank you everyone.

1008
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,280
Thank you so much for your love

1009
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,680
about our show The Legend of ShenLi,

1010
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,520
and this production team.

1011
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,400
Thank you for your support.

1012
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,760
Thank you for your tolerance.

1013
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,200
We are here because of you.

1014
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,160
Since we recorded first,
we also don't know

1015
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,640
what kind of results we can achieve.

1016
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,600
In any case, thank you very much.

1017
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,280
That Excellency is right.

1018
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,680
And indeed, we also don't know
what kind of results will be obtained.

1019
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:54,880
Of course,
we hope for the better and better.

1020
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,440
Yes, better and better.

1021
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,000
And we can meet everyone again sooner.

1022
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,120
When we meet again, we will shoot
the second part of The Legend of ShenLi.

1023
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,400
The story of The Legend of ShenLi
will never end.

1024
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,200
Who knows.
We might have to record another program.

1025
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,640
The Legend of ShenLi may be presented
in different forms.

1026
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,520
We hope everyone will always be
towards The Legend of ShenLi,

1027
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,680
keeping attention and liking.

1028
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,120
I think what you all say is right.

1029
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,440
Are you nervous?

1030
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,480
The frequency of fanning with this fan
represents the turmoil in my heart.

1031
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,080
To relieve the anxiety in my heart.

1032
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,160
It's too heavy and not symmetrical.

1033
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,400
How should I put it?

1034
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,600
The design I'm wearing now

1035
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,600
gives the feeling of a judge.

1036
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,760
So welcome the audience
to judge The Legend of ShenLi.

1037
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,280
The audience's fondness and support

1038
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,600
are definitely
what we want to express gratitude for.

1039
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,280
But we also accept everyone's

1040
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,840
interpretation and suggestions
for our different characters.

1041
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,520
Criticisms are also welcome.

1042
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,240
Then let's discuss more.

1043
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,920
We hope The Legend of ShenLi
in March and April

1044
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:06,880
can bring everyone a joyful time.

1045
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,720
- Right.
- Good.

1046
01:04:09,206 --> 01:04:14,547
♪Our silent gaze speaks more than words♪

1047
01:04:14,547 --> 01:04:19,614
♪I only feel complete around you♪

1048
01:04:19,616 --> 01:04:22,278
♪You are right there when I turn♪

1049
01:04:22,278 --> 01:04:25,490
♪How I wish to immerse in your fondness♪

1050
01:04:30,918 --> 01:04:32,318
Let me blow on it for you.

1051
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:35,328
Actually, I have been
into you for a long time.

1052
01:04:36,262 --> 01:04:38,140
No! Grandfather.

1053
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,695
I'm sorry.

1054
01:04:49,222 --> 01:04:51,068
It was almost scary enough
to wet my pants.

1055
01:04:51,068 --> 01:04:52,216
We are Diviner.

1056
01:04:55,302 --> 01:04:56,489
One, two, three, come on.

1057
01:04:56,678 --> 01:04:58,368
One, two, three, come on.

1058
01:04:58,368 --> 01:05:00,818
Goodbye The Legend of ShenLi.

1059
01:05:07,264 --> 01:05:13,090
Goodbye The Legend of ShenLi, but
looking forward to The Legend of ShenLi.

1060
01:05:16,088 --> 01:05:18,240
I am the performer
who breathes fire at the opening.

1061
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:21,393
Fire itself has the meaning
of exorcising evil spirits.

1062
01:05:21,393 --> 01:05:22,656
When we lift the sedan for Qin Li,

1063
01:05:22,656 --> 01:05:24,414
the fire-breathing performance begins.

1064
01:05:24,414 --> 01:05:27,218
We have incorporated
many modern performance forms.

1065
01:05:27,218 --> 01:05:29,600
Costumes and masks have added
many new elements

1066
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,052
to set the tone for the night parade
in punishing evil.

1067
01:05:32,052 --> 01:05:33,280
Chaoyang Ying Dance

1068
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,184
is a type of performance that combines
martial arts, dance, and drama.

1069
01:05:37,184 --> 01:05:39,619
It's a traditional Chinese folk dance.

1070
01:05:39,619 --> 01:05:41,544
It embodies the promotion of justice
and suppression of evil,

1071
01:05:41,544 --> 01:05:43,136
and the implication
of peace and good fortune.

1072
01:05:43,136 --> 01:05:46,172
It is known as the Chinese war dance.

1073
01:05:46,172 --> 01:05:47,840
During the performance
of Hundred Elves Night Parade,

1074
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:51,456
the formation of the troupe constantly
changes according to the rhythm.

1075
01:05:51,456 --> 01:05:55,179
The rhythm of the drumsticks striking
sets the momentum for the night parade.

1076
01:05:55,179 --> 01:05:57,728
Wuchuan Piaose
originated in the Qing Dynasty.

1077
01:05:57,728 --> 01:06:04,928
It is an art form that combines drama,
music, magic, acrobatics, and mechanics.

1078
01:06:04,928 --> 01:06:07,808
into a comprehensive performance art.

1079
01:06:07,808 --> 01:06:10,221
So what everyone sees in the show

1080
01:06:10,221 --> 01:06:12,620
is a few children playing the roles of

1081
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:15,056
emperor, empress, and generals

1082
01:06:15,056 --> 01:06:17,767
along with the dragon and phoenix.

1083
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:19,680
It symbolizes good luck and good wishes.

1084
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,421
Nuo originated from ancient times,

1085
01:06:23,008 --> 01:06:26,304
with ceremonies held to
exorcise ghosts and eradicate epidemics.

1086
01:06:26,304 --> 01:06:27,936
Behind Nuo is ritual.

1087
01:06:27,936 --> 01:06:33,372
Nuo dance is used to pray for children,
a good harvest, and to bring blessings.

1088
01:06:33,372 --> 01:06:36,853
It is a folk dance
for driving away ghosts and disasters.

1089
01:06:36,853 --> 01:06:38,327
On a deeper level,

1090
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:41,184
it conveys the wish for unity
between heaven and man.

1091
01:06:41,184 --> 01:06:43,904
Stilt walking originated
from the needs of human life.

1092
01:06:43,904 --> 01:06:46,840
It integrates into performance forms
such as dance and acrobatics later,

1093
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,641
and develops into acts
that ward off evil and avoid harm,

1094
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:51,232
and symbolizes the blessing
of good fortune as a folk activity.

1095
01:06:51,232 --> 01:06:53,216
In Hundred Elves Night Parade,
the stilt-walking team

1096
01:06:53,216 --> 01:06:55,008
is specially dressed up as Singer

1097
01:06:55,008 --> 01:06:56,320
to escort Qin Li onto the stage,

1098
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,677
crossing over evil forces
to bring good luck and auspiciousness.
