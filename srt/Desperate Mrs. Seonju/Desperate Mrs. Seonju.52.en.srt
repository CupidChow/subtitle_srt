1
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,769
What are you doing?

2
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,010
(Episode 52)

3
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,640
Do you want to compare our DNA?

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,110
It's best to be sure. It was your idea.

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,950
Yes. It's not too bad to get tested
and confirm where you really stand.

6
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:27,759
A personnel restructuring is coming up.

7
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:29,730
Do you want to get caught doing this?

8
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:31,230
You can worry about that...

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,829
when the results are out.

10
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,899
Let's hash it out when we're sure
if we're on the same side or not.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,510
If you're going to the lab,
you might as well compare us both.

12
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:46,609
You lost all sense of reason...

13
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:49,609
and fell for Pi Seon Ju's husband.

14
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:53,249
I'd like to know if you're actually
the child I gave birth to.

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,550
Tell me when the results are out.

16
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,790
If you want to marry for love
and live however you wish,

17
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,830
wait until you have everything.

18
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:08,970
Until you have everything
within your grasp,

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,470
don't let go of So Woo completely.

20
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,490
A personnel restructuring is coming up.

21
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,490
Do you want to get caught doing this?

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,630
Until you have everything
within your grasp,

23
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,100
don't let go of So Woo completely.

24
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:41,159
We chose...

25
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,700
Team B's design.

26
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,320
The photos of Woo Sang.

27
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,490
Flood the Internet with them.

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,570
(The photos were not sent.)

29
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,049
Did you run the idea by your chief?

30
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,589
- Yes.
- And? Did he like it?

31
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:38,989
I mentioned it to him
and got called crazy.

32
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,260
Really?

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,889
You said he wanted a crazy idea.

34
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:44,989
You need a drastic idea
to be called crazy.

35
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:47,700
He said it was nonsense
to get couples to seduce each other...

36
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,369
and break families up.

37
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,339
He said our public couldn't handle it.

38
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,070
He called it going crazy to get revenge,

39
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,440
and I almost got slapped.

40
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,280
You have no idea
how much the public loves...

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,109
revenge and survival.

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,109
This could become the "Squid Game"
of dating variety shows.

43
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:05,820
Forget it. I'm busy.

44
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,880
How dare he?

45
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,359
I just tried to help him out
because he was grumpy.

46
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,600
Why didn't you come today?

47
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:27,000
I was busy.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Doing what?

49
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,839
What was important enough
to make you miss our court date?

50
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,810
I didn't want to let you have your way.

51
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,310
What?

52
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,910
You're living with Seon Ju.

53
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,149
You're in no position to demand a divorce.

54
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:42,649
You lost the Hansung deal.

55
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,350
If you are to get divorced
for having an affair too,

56
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:47,260
are you afraid
your father will be disappointed?

57
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:50,630
And your position within the company
will be threatened?

58
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,730
I told Dad you were living with Seon Ju.

59
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:56,130
Now that he knows what you're truly like,

60
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,040
he won't think so highly of you anymore.

61
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,100
So what?

62
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,410
You want to keep things complicated?

63
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,010
If you don't like how complicated it is,
end what you have with Seon Ju.

64
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,540
Keep her out of my sight.

65
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,450
You can work here if you want.

66
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,649
Why should I do that?

67
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,850
Because I won't divorce you if you don't.

68
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,959
You get to do and live however you want.

69
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,089
I should get to do the same.

70
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,659
I can't let you off so easily.

71
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,329
That's my condition.

72
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:32,370
I'll see what you do...

73
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,039
and attend or skip our next court date.

74
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,420
Darn it.

75
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,360
- Hello?
- Hey.

76
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,399
I tried to hold my tongue,
but I must say one thing.

77
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:06,099
- About what?
- You only just got divorced.

78
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:07,399
You went on a blind date...

79
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,240
and now you're living with some guy?

80
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,110
Don't you care what people will say?

81
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:14,579
Ms. Wang. Be sure not to take Ji Hyun
without my permission.

82
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:16,279
I'll block your number now.

83
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,310
What?

84
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:18,610
Hey.

85
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,250
I'm not afraid of what people will say.

86
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,060
I'm more afraid of your calls.
Gosh, seriously.

87
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,200
- Hello.
- Hi.

88
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,539
The contest is over, so I'll move seats.

89
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,440
I'll work outside with the others.

90
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,139
Okay.

91
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,950
Why do you look displeased?

92
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:57,820
Parting with someone can do that to you.

93
00:05:58,289 --> 00:05:59,519
No.

94
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,519
Ms. Jin was a no-show.

95
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,990
What? She didn't come?

96
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,969
Yes.

97
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,200
Can you swing by my office tomorrow?

98
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,639
Oh, perfect. See you then.

99
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:19,810
Who was that? Albert?

100
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,550
Yes. He'll come by tomorrow.

101
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:27,180
We can tell Mr. Jin and arrange a meeting.

102
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,589
Did everything go well
at Family Court today?

103
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,750
I didn't go.

104
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,659
What? Why not?

105
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,990
To tease So Woo.

106
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't know
if he and Seon Ju want to date,

107
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,370
but if I were to divorce him now,
they'd get too excited...

108
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:45,969
and carried away.

109
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,300
I didn't want to give him an out.

110
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,370
What are you up to?

111
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,170
I don't think it's time
to cut So Woo loose.

112
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,180
It might be worthwhile
to string him along and taunt him.

113
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,550
That's stupid.

114
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,380
Do you still have feelings for him?

115
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,250
Don't you trust me?

116
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,860
Do you know what I said to him?

117
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,860
I said I'd divorce him
if he got rid of Seon Ju.

118
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,930
Isn't that in your favor too?

119
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,130
Even so,

120
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,630
was that your only option?

121
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,539
If we secure Albert's project,

122
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,700
my dad will come back to our side.

123
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,639
Then it would become much easier
to get rid of those two,

124
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,409
but I want to keep them close
as another bargaining chip.

125
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:31,279
Do you want to work in
the same building as them forever?

126
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,279
Oh, right.

127
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,550
The Hansung contest is over,

128
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,560
there will be a personnel shuffle,
and people will start to talk.

129
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,860
It won't look good for us
to continue to share an office.

130
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:46,130
Go back to your old seat.

131
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,659
For now,

132
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,700
I'll do as you say.

133
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,539
If you're toying with me,

134
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,010
I don't think I can forgive that.

135
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:22,670
Why did she do something like that?

136
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:24,370
Why the change of heart?

137
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:27,500
Wasn't she madly in love with Nam Jin...

138
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,909
that she wanted to
move in with him desperately?

139
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,579
- Hello?
- The CEO wants to see you and Ms. Pi.

140
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:41,150
Okay.

141
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,599
Take a seat.

142
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,280
Is it true...

143
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,520
you two are living together?

144
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,859
Yes.

145
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,729
What kind of nonsense is this?

146
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,859
Is that how two people act when they say
they have no personal feelings?

147
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:28,829
I just can't understand.

148
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,300
It's not what you worry it is.

149
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:33,839
I bought a house...

150
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:35,570
and it belonged to Ms. Pi's mother.

151
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,209
I realized that fact
only after I'd bought it.

152
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:40,640
Why are you living together, then?

153
00:09:40,739 --> 00:09:44,150
The house is a bit too big
for just Tae Ri and me,

154
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,650
and Ms. Pi's family had nowhere to go,
so it just ended up this way.

155
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,349
Yes. We had to sell the house
to get the money...

156
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:55,890
to settle for the car accident,
and we were struggling.

157
00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:00,329
Mr. Kim let us stay
out of the goodness of his heart.

158
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:02,969
It's not at all what you might think.

159
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,200
Okay. You can leave, Ms. Pi.

160
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:11,369
Okay.

161
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,719
Will you...

162
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,790
continue to work with her?

163
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,320
She proved her skills by helping me...

164
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,190
win the Hansung contract.

165
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,629
Now we must start construction,

166
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:33,129
and I don't want her
to suffer any injustice...

167
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,030
because of the circumstances.

168
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:38,430
Are you defending her...

169
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:41,469
from the start
in case I might do something?

170
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,170
That's not true.

171
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:45,310
I'm just stating a fact.

172
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:49,379
We didn't and won't do anything
anyone would consider immoral.

173
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,650
(Team Leader's Office, Kim So Woo)

174
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,959
- Shall I put this here?
- Yes.

175
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,690
- I'll get the cables.
- Okay.

176
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:20,879
I never got to sit across from you
while we were married.

177
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,950
Here we are now.

178
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,219
Is this what you wanted?

179
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,190
For us, as a divorced couple,
to meet every day...

180
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:32,150
and clash?

181
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,920
Of course not.

182
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,329
You were always like this.

183
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,229
You never let me be at ease.

184
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,270
If you wanted to do this
just to get on my nerves...

185
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:46,300
You succeeded.

186
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,969
Still, I feel so embarrassed.

187
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,410
That you were my past.

188
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:58,810
I didn't want to sit across from you
in these circumstances,

189
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,280
but knowing I get on your nerves...

190
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:03,489
and that you're not at ease...

191
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,849
is quite comforting.

192
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:08,920
I'm embarrassed too...

193
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,959
that you were my past.

194
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:13,560
You bragged so much...

195
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:16,869
and pretended to be busy, and your desk...

196
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:18,869
ended up...

197
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,599
being right across from mine
in the same space.

198
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,009
- How dare you...
- Mr. Jeon.

199
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,310
I'm a regular employee now,
so don't speak as if I'm beneath you.

200
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:32,609
Or shall we
speak casually to each other...

201
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:36,190
since we joined the company
just months apart?

202
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,430
Hey.

203
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:45,890
Is this how you're seated?

204
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,560
Ms. Pi.

205
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,170
If you feel uncomfortable,
shall I switch you with Mr. Ko?

206
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:54,440
No. I don't mind at all, Mr. Kim.

207
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:57,440
Okay, then.

208
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:06,780
Darn you.

209
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,060
Oh, my gosh.

210
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,359
What on earth...

211
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,030
What is happening? Oh, dear.

213
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:30,109
The person is unable to answer the phone.

214
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,239
He won't pick up.

217
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:42,579
He's filming.

218
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:46,150
Tell him to call
as soon as the shoot is done.

219
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,420
Okay.

220
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,200
What's that about? Is something wrong?

Good work, everyone.

224
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,290
Your mother wanted you to call her.

225
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,320
Did she? Why?

226
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,560
What's up?

227
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,200
- Hello?
- You!

228
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:30,270
What's this article about?

229
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,629

Hello?

232
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:04,369
Reporter Heo. What is this?

233
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,300
You told me
to plaster the photos everywhere.

234
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,900
Thanks a lot.

235
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,640
It was my first-ever exclusive scoop.

236
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,040
This wasn't what I told you to print.
I gave you something even bigger.

237
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:18,410
The photos I sent yesterday.
My passionate kiss with Woo Sang.

238
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:20,320
That's what I wanted you to print.

239
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,020
Your passionate kiss with Jeong Woo Sang?

240
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,020
You sent me something like that?
I didn't get it.

241
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,619
That's not big at all.
What I printed was way more provocative.

242
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,930
- Take down that story.
- Why?

243
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,459
It has spread already.
There's nothing I can do now.

244
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:35,629
Jin Chu Ah.

245
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:38,670
I'll repay the favor for this huge story
by writing something...

246
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,739
in your defense
if you ever hit rock bottom.

247
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:42,400
Thanks a lot.

249
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:46,839
Darn it.

250
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:51,209
(The photos were not sent.)

251
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,249
Isn't this you?

252
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:01,790
And isn't this you?

253
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,089
Well...

254
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,229
It is us,

255
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:08,999
but it's not what you think.

256
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:10,499
You partied all night in a hotel suite.

257
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:12,599
Nothing happened?

258
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,670
I got really drunk that night.

259
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,040
You were there too.

260
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:18,369
- I was.
- I felt nauseous...

261
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:20,540
and we were forced to stay a while.

262
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:22,879
It's not what you think.

263
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,079
Then...

264
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,150
deny everything.

265
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:29,249
Deny it until the drama is over.

266
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:31,550
No one is to say...

267
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,489
who the woman in the photo is.

268
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,790
Okay.

269
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,959
Get your agency
to prevent this from spreading further.

270
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,190
Or it'll ruin our drama's love story.

271
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,759
- Okay.
- Yoon Gi.

272
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,759
Yes?

Everyone is talking about
his night-long hotel party.

275
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:50,239
Even if it's a fictional TV show,
him kissing his step-sister...

276
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,540
will make the Internet go crazy.

277
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,410
Okay. I'll contact the editor.

you might as well compare us both.

Don't we have to tell Mr. Jin
about Professor Albert's visit tomorrow?

303

I'll tell him.

We lost out on the Hansung project,

307

Are you okay with that?

312
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,989
Do you want me to sit out there
and work across from Seon Ju...

313
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:21,690
all day every day?

314
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:25,059
I'll talk to Dad about it
when the timing is right.

00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:27,830

You wouldn't have wanted to admit
you weren't a true Jin.

322

Was it a shock?

323
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,999
You're really something.

324
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,069
Why did you turn me into
a member of this family?

325
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,140
Why do you think?

326
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,680
I said it was because
I felt bad for your dad,

327
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,779
but do you think that was it?

328
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,809
I did it for you,

329
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,450
and thanks to that,
you enjoyed an affluent life.

330
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,360
Chu Ah is an actor,

331
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,959
but no one knows how long she can do that.

332
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:33,729
I plan to leave my business to her.

333
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:38,670

00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,539
Not just the company, but you must inherit
all your dad's assets.

335
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:45,769
Mom.

336
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,880
You love him, don't you?

337
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,350
I do.

338
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,880
He's practically my first love.

339
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,019
Then...

340
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,989
my birth dad whom you met
before your first love.

341
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,719
What was he?

342
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,580
Why does that matter now?
The future is what matters.

343
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,009

stop acting like a wayward child...

and use your brain.

345
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,090
No one can know of this,
and don't get on your dad's bad side.

346
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,690
What about Chu Ah?

347
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,789
Is she dad's daughter?

348
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:40,229
Yes, so you can't tell her
about this either.

349
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:47,539
Weigh out Nam Jin and So Woo
more objectively and thoroughly.

350
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,769
And beware of Pi Seon Ju.

351
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:53,840
Keep that in mind.

352
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,610
- You're home, honey.
- Yes.

353
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,719
- I want to rest.
- I see.

354
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:07,360
I'll go to my room now.

355
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:13,700
Goodness.

356
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,959
Why did she stare at me like that?

357
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:32,749
Is it too spicy?

358
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:34,979
Tell me if it is
and I'll rinse it in water for you.

359
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:38,920
You look sweet and kind
just like your dad.

360
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,989
My Kyung Ae could raise
at least three kids like him.

361
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,660
What?

362
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:46,489
Drop it.

363
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:49,299
I only just brought it up.
Why must I drop it?

364
00:22:49,729 --> 00:22:51,269
Don't mention that.

365
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,900
Man Eun.

366
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:56,700
My Kyung Ae is ill in bed
because your homeowner...

367
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,509
won't take her calls.

368
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:00,039
I thought it was...

369
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:03,410
because he didn't like how she looked,

370
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:06,509
so she got her face redone
from top to bottom.

371
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:08,580
She looks like someone else now.

372
00:23:09,749 --> 00:23:11,719
Could you ask him to meet her...

373
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:15,090
just once more and pretend
he's meeting someone else?

374
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,219
Drop it!

375
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:20,160
Seon Ju was humiliated nationwide
because of that darn blind date.

376
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,330
If you bring that up once more,

377
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,100
I'll headbutt you and ruin your new perm.

378
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,170
Do you think
you're the Queen of Headbutts?

379
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:33,209
I am. That was my nickname growing up.

380
00:23:33,739 --> 00:23:37,279
Do you know how painful it is
to get headbutted with perm rods in?

381
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,150
To think we met then and there.

382
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:47,860
I taught him a lesson and chased him off.

383
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,360
Soon Ae will be...

384
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,059
- so pleased...
- A long time ago,

385
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:55,200
I headbutted a guy who was this big.

386
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,100
My gosh. You're lying and bragging again.

387
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:01,370
I am not lying.

388
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,840
After I headbutted him into space,

389
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,539
he vanished from my hometown.

390
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,779
My goodness. What a story.

391
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:13,850
(Hospital)

392
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,610
Sang Ah did as you said...

393
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,519
and didn't go to court
to get divorced today.

394
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:53,120
Why did you decide not to go?

395
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,160
You heard too...

396
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,259
that Pi Seon Ju and So Woo live together.

397
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,459
They act like
nothing is going on between them,

398
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,860
but that couldn't be true.

399
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,370
Things happen
if a man and woman live together.

400
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,569
After what he called Sang Ah
for having an affair, he's doing the same.

401
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,069
I wouldn't give in to him either.

402
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,680
What will you do with Nam Jin?

403
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:22,420
He scheduled a meeting
with Professor Albert.

404
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,090
The professor accepted
a project here in Korea,

405
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,549
and he wants to work with us.

406
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:29,289
The Hansung deal is nothing
compared to this.

407
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,059
So what?

408
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:33,289
We can't even start without Mr. Jeon.

409
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:35,529
Consider the situation.

410
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,269
Do you want to fire Mr. Jeon
and lose out on the project...

411
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:40,229
just to save face?

412
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,969
Didn't you say this was
an important time for our company?

413
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:50,309
Who exactly are you more interested in?

414
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,249
I plan to watch how So Woo and Mr. Jeon...

415
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,580
work together.

416
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,019
What does that mean?

417
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,259
As you said,
I'll try to see the good in So Woo,

418
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,989
and I'll see how competent Mr. Jeon is.

419
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,430
I'll compare both men...

420
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,330
and study how I feel about them.

421
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,299
What on earth is this logic?

422
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:14,870
Is this what you call "flabbergasted?"

423
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:17,610
I just don't understand...

424
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,110
the way you think.

425
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:22,739
That's enough.

426
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,680
Sang Ah wants to compare them.

427
00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:29,350
It looks like she has come around.

428
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:30,850
Let's wait and see.

429
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:34,519
Yes. Will you please trust me?

430
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:37,890
You know who I am. I'm your daughter.

431
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,330
Dad.

432
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,769
Have some of this. It's nicely cooked.

433
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,880
You did well. Keep it up.

434
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,249
This isn't deception.

435
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,420
You're my daughter
and I'm the lady of the house.

436
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:07,319
That makes you family.

437
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:11,959
We're just doing our best
to keep the family intact.

438
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:15,299
You don't have to feel guilty at all.

439
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,200
I don't feel guilty.

440
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,769
Good.

441
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:28,440
Hello, Mom's home.

442
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,910
I bought you some donuts.

443
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,749
- Yes!
- Auntie.

444
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:36,549
Oh, dear. What's this?

445
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,920
- Hey.
- What is it?

446
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:47,559
How is it?

447
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,569
Can you see?

448
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,110
I can.

449
00:28:00,739 --> 00:28:01,779
I can see.

450
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:03,610
- Here.
- I can see.

451
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,249
Follow with your eyes.

452
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,400
This must be your grandpa,

453
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:27,140
and this must be your great-grandpa.

454
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,670
Who's this?

455
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,370
Your grandma?

456
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,539
She looks like you.

457
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,580
She looks like me?

458
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:50,989
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

459
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:08,979
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

460
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,309
Isn't this you?

461
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:11,650
You have similar clothes.

462
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,809
She's a member of the crew.

463
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,319
She's into women.

464
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,080
You acted like you won the world...

465
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,920
because you won the Hansung contract.

466
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,019
Where should we go?

467
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,920
French? Chinese?

468
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,989
This place inspired me
and I drew lots of sketches here.

469
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,059
Oh, no.

470
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,900
It's dangerous. Get down from there.

471
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,430
