00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,790
(Episode 59)

2
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,360
How could she say that
when she saw the whole process?

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:17,330
It feels like my sacred divorce...

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,729
was insulted.

5
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:23,039
Why would you call your divorce "sacred?"

6
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:24,500
I went through so much...

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,739
to ensure...

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,779
there was no way we could turn back.

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,009
Could that seem insignificant
or pointless to others?

10
00:00:34,279 --> 00:00:35,309
I'm not saying...

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,419
your sister was in the right,

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,590
but I do understand her point.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,720
Are you being
the neutral politician again?

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,029
No.

15
00:00:47,389 --> 00:00:49,900
People like us
who felt utterly betrayed...

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,330
may have been hurt,
but we no longer feel love for the other.

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,870
We can think and believe...

18
00:00:57,169 --> 00:00:59,370
that in time we'll heal and forget.

19
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,010
But your sister...

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,109
lived with the pain,
and she probably will forever.

21
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,950
Still, I'm somewhat jealous of her.

22
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:15,519
She misses her husband.

23
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:17,790
She looks back on memories...

24
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,960
of him as a sweet spouse.

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,260
I envy that.

26
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:25,829
We can never know a path we never took.

27
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:27,930
Let's not feel jealous.

28
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:30,269
I shouldn't, right?

29
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,439
Why? What is it?

30
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,809
I was actually very ill.

31
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:42,880
You were?

32
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,519
Which part of you?

33
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,120
My heart.

34
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,320
I still need to watch out.

35
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,590
So...

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,700
If you were to know that,

37
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,329
you might not want to marry me.

38
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:04,370
That's why I can't do scenes...

39
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:07,070
that require lots of running
or hard stunts.

40
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,340
I see.

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,380
If I have a son,

42
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,350
I might not be able to
kick a ball with him.

43
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,260
I can...

44
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:27,760
kick the ball with him.

45
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,600
You don't mind?

46
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,329
I don't.

47
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:38,369
Why worry about that when there are
so many other things you can do?

48
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:48,810
You got through the hardest times...

49
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,649
and found your way to me.

50
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:54,489
Thank you.

51
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,790
What on earth...

52
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,700
When did you come in?

53
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:07,530
When you pleaded with the detective.

54
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,540
How did you know I was here?

55
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,669
Did you follow me?

56
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:15,769
No.

57
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,109
I was going to call you to join me.

58
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,380
Was that the part-time job
you wanted me to do?

59
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,950
You should've just told the truth.

60
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,220
It's not easy to ask for help
with something like that.

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,359
I'm already embarrassed
you saw me like this.

62
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:33,589
Why would you be embarrassed?

63
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,530
You look strong and proud.

64
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,459
It's a good look.

65
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,530
You said I changed drastically
and got ugly.

66
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,769
You must've taken that to heart.

67
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,669
Is that something to forget?

68
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:46,869
No.

69
00:03:47,869 --> 00:03:50,880
You used to be a proud...

70
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,810
picture-perfect beauty.

71
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,019
That'll hardly work as damage control.

72
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,380
I mean it.

73
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,220
But now...

74
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,290
You look homely.

75
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,760
It's a much nicer look.

76
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,630
I prefer this.

77
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,000
That doesn't mean I have a crush on you.
It's just a nicer image.

78
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,299
I get it!

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,130
You don't have to yell.

80
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,869
I must have a lot of pent-up anger.

81
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,979
I vented at my sister Seon Ju...

82
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,810
because I felt sorry for myself.

83
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,719
I guess I was annoyed.

84
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,079
That's understandable.

85
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:37,060
I do feel sorry for myself,

86
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,589
but I feel worse for my husband...

87
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:43,630
who died young.

88
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,969
Did he die because he and I...

89
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:50,170
had incompatible horoscopes?

90
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:52,370
I wondered that too.

91
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:55,839
Let's go.

92
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,579
How much is our bill?

93
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,550
It's on me.

94
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:08,320
I quite like your neighborhood.

95
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:12,320
I'm touched that you came this far.

96
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,700
Thank you.

97
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:22,940
For saying...

98
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:26,310
what we did wasn't a mistake or trouble.

99
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,310
I really...

100
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:31,440
liked that.

101
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,750
I only stated a fact.

102
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,019
I liked it too.

103
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,070
Go on inside, then.

104
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,240
- You too.
- Bye.

105
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,639
- Thanks.
- Sure.

106
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:08,750
You're with each other again.

107
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,050
Hi.

108
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:12,079
We met on the way back.

109
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,219
- Go on upstairs.
- Good night.

110
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,829
Did she say anything in particular?

111
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,860
Did she badmouth me?

112
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,700
What? No, she didn't.

113
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,930
But...

114
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,139
she was pretty upset.

115
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,639
You had a lot to drink.

116
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,539
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

117
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,740
- I'll go upstairs.
- Bye.

118
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,920
She's upset?

119
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,459
What about me?

120
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:55,060
Hey.

121
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:59,500
I found these on the way. It's for you.

122
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,700
My goodness.

123
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,180
I think...

124
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,349
I went a bit out of my mind earlier.

125
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,450
Forget it.

126
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,820
I'll let you off because this is tasty.

127
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,690
She's over it.

128
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,940
Where did you go to?

129
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,880
Mr. Jang said you got off work long ago.

130
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,339
Okay, so...

131
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,610
I was at...

132
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:47,750
Not again.

133
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,149
Don't worry.

134
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:53,920
We met in secret.

135
00:07:54,219 --> 00:07:55,289
Did you...

136
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,719
tell her about that?

137
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,260
About what?

138
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:02,459
About my illness?

139
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,370
Yes. That's something
you should explain before marriage.

140
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,229
I told her.

141
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,070
What did she say? Is she okay with it?

142
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,010
She thanked me
for getting through it well.

143
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,810
And that if we had a son,
she'd play soccer with him.

144
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:18,479
Yes.

145
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,450
Mi Ju is lacking in many ways
as wife material,

146
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,479
but if you think about it,
sometimes a girl who lacks...

147
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,089
can be easier to handle.

148
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,190
Mom.

149
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,820
Go to bed.

150
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:44,800
You'll announce
the personnel restructure today?

151
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,910
Yes.

152
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:49,810
Sang Ah will be promoted, right?

153
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Why do you want the extra headache?

154
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:55,150
Just slack off and make easy money.

155
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,780
Why do you want to get promoted?

156
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,249
Not everyone is like you.

157
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,249
Exactly. She's so different from me.

158
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,160
I look just like you, Dad.

159
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,420
She's only like Mom.

160
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:09,030
So what? What's your point?

161
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:10,560
Why are you so ticked off?

162
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,999
Read the room before you crack a joke.

163
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,070
Did that sound like a joke? It wasn't.

164
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,739
That's what everyone used to say.

165
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:18,940
They saw both Dad and Mom in me,

166
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,239
- but you...
- Chu Ah!

167
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,940
What?

168
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,709
Shut your mouth.

169
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:27,950
Will you talk like that to me forever
because I let you?

170
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:29,719
I'm your older sister.

171
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,249
Excuse me.

172
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,489
Yes, Chu Ah.
You shouldn't talk to her like that.

173
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,229
What got into her?

174
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,530
Do as she says
and use appropriate language.

175
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,900
Why is everyone so mean to me?

176
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:55,310
Okay. I'll talk to the tenant.

177
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:57,609
Sure. Goodbye.

178
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:02,749
It must be great to be a landlord.

179
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,520
They get paid for doing no work at all.

180
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:17,700
Yes. I got paid.

181
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,040
Then the new executive director is...

182
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,839
Let's make that final.

183
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:28,910
Okay. Anyone who saw
their ratings or performance...

184
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,739
would accept the decision.

185
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:33,479
Yes.

186
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:36,849
(Personnel Appointment)

187
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:44,989
(Jin Sang Ah, Executive Director

(Jeon Nam Jin,
Team Leader of Planning Team 2)

189
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:52,729
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

190
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:54,170
Thank you.

191
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:04,879
(Jeon Nam Jin,
Team Leader of Planning Team 2)

192
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,349
Sang Ah was made executive director?

193
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,089
Okay.

194
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,259
Sang Ah.

195
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,599
The secretary just called.

196
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,900
Congratulations.

197
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,670
How does it feel?

198
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,239
Great, of course.

199
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:38,640
Your dad may seem strict,
but he cares a lot about you.

200
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,310
So do your best on the next project...

201
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:44,780
and secure your position
as his successor, okay?

202
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,020
Okay.

203
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,390
Executive Director Jin Sang Ah.

204
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,129
Congratulations, Team Leader Jeon.

205
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,229
Congratulations. I'm happy for you.

206
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,099
I owe it to you.

207
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:02,369
We're reaping what you sowed in the US.

208
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:07,369
Shall we?

209
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:17,249
Sang Ah is securing her future now.

210
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:20,920
If only Pi Seon Ju
were to stay out of our lives,

211
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,719
everything would be perfect.

212
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:28,129
Come in.

213
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:33,729
I'll drop by somewhere
and go straight home from there.

214
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:35,170
- Okay.
- Close up for me.

215
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,670
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

216
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,040
I'll get this printed and bring it to you.

217
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
No. I'll do it.

218
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,979
Oh, dear.

219
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:55,020
Is something wrong?

220
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:58,859
I think it's the alcohol from last night.
I don't feel well.

221
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,900
I wondered who'd get promoted.

222
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,200
After all the talk and feuds,

223
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,300
blood is still thicker.

224
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,670
No. There was the K-culture Town project.

225
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,270
I think that was a huge decider.

226
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:18,879
Whatever it was,
now we know for sure who's in power.

227
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,150
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, director.

228
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,180
Thanks.

229
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:27,219
Congratulations, Mr...

230
00:13:27,219 --> 00:13:28,349
Team Leader Jeon.

231
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,749
Congratulations, sir.

232
00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:30,959
Thank you.

233
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,999
You two haven't seen the notice, have you?

234
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,800
These two got promoted.

235
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:42,629
Executive Director Jin Sang Ah...

236
00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:44,440
and Team Leader Jeon Nam Jin.

237
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:46,239
Oh, really?

238
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,339
Now that we're equals,
I hope we get along better, Mr. Kim.

239
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,640
And you, Ms. Pi.

240
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:55,050
Congratulations.

241
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,849
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

242
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,790
Thanks, though I don't know
if you mean it.

243
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,489
Shouldn't we celebrate with a team dinner?

244
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,530
Yes. Make the reservation.

245
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,759
I hope you both attend.

246
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,829
I really want you to celebrate with us.

247
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,030
Okay.

248
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,940
I'll be there.

249
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,780
- Hello?
- Mr. Jin wants to see Director Jin.

250
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,109
She's to bring Team Leader Jeon too.

251
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:29,280
- He wants to see you both.
- Okay.

252
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,920
- Let's go.
- Okay.

253
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:37,359
- Let's go.
- Okay.

254
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:40,890
(Jin Architecture)

255
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,530
Thank you for making me
executive director.

256
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:45,160
Thank you.

257
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,300
You're an executive director,

258
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,999
but you're not in charge of
everything yet.

259
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:51,200
Keep your previous office.

260
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:52,640
I'll have the signs replaced.

261
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:54,239
Okay.

262
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,209
The K-culture Town location
will be bigger than I thought,

263
00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:58,810
and the government is interested too.

264
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,310
Overseas parties are watching as well.

265
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:03,920
Work hard and create
a worldwide tourist destination.

266
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:05,979
Yes, sir. We'll do that.

267
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,570
(Han Hair Line)

268
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:32,310
Welcome.

269
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,089
What's a shabby person
doing in my lavish abode?

270
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,320
Is this your business?

271
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,390
You can't be here to get your hair done.

272
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,890
What do you want?

273
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:51,099
Your second daughter.

274
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:52,329
Seon Ju?

275
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:55,670
Tell her to resign from the company...

276
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:57,739
and move out of this place too.

277
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,469
What are you on about?

278
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:02,969
If you're here
because you have nowhere to go...

279
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:09,479
I'll lend you this free of interest.
Find another home.

280
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,020
It'll be enough for a long-term lease.

281
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,349
What?

282
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,119
My gosh.

283
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:18,790
Whose fault is it that we lost the house?

284
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:20,290
And now you say...

285
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:23,359
you'll lend us the money
when you should give it to us?

286
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,859
It's interest-free.

287
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,030
You really are...

288
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:31,869
the shallow, materialistic, petty Soon Ae.

289
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:37,040
You haven't changed one bit
from the Shim Soon Ae...

290
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,310
who washed perm rods
and elastic bands for me.

291
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:46,820
Yes, so why do you let your daughter
work at the company...

292
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,420
owned by shallow, petty Soon Ae's husband?

293
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:52,959
I'd have her quit if I were you.

294
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,030
Darn you.

295
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,229
We have an agreement with the homeowner
and you have no say.

296
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:02,599
And Seon Ju got the job
because she passed the interview.

297
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,400
Who are you to tell her to resign?

298
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:13,950
It's a darn mess
that our sons-in-law know each other.

299
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:19,049
Take this money
and call it the end of our rotten ties.

300
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,729
What?

301
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:34,569
Hey!

302
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,930
You!

303
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,969
You're doing this
because you don't like that...

304
00:17:42,969 --> 00:17:45,479
you came across people
who know your sad past.

305
00:17:45,739 --> 00:17:48,509
I won't tell anyone that I know you.

306
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:51,249
But guess what?

307
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:55,850
You can wear all these expensive coats...

308
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,590
and go by "Grace Shim,"

309
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,330
but however hard you try,

310
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,789
you're still Shim Soon Ae.

311
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,830
- What?
- Did you tell me...

312
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,130
my daughters would pay for how I lived?

313
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,499
Wait and see.

314
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:14,140
My daughters will be
way more successful and happy than yours!

315
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,620
Darn her.

316
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,920
Where's the salt?

317
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:30,289
What for?

318
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,660
Darn you!

319
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:42,200
Don't be so mean to others!

320
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,900
You'll reap what you sow!

321
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,110
Darn her.

322
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,580
Is that how badly
she wants to forget her past?

323
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,450
Enough to lend me money interest-free?

324
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,289
Did she want to act like a rich woman
on TV who gave someone money?

325
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,819
My gosh.

326
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:04,959
Grandma. I'm hungry.

327
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,120
You're hungry?

328
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,989
Oh, dear.

329
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,660
I should've seen
how much money was in that envelope.

330
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,299
I could've bought you snacks.

331
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,799
She told me to lease an apartment,

332
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,469
but I bet she put in 500 dollars.

333
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,370
- Right?
- Right.

334
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,509
Grandma. I want something tasty.

335
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:25,779
Okay.

336
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,479
What tasty snack shall I make you?

337
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,430
Ms. Pi?

338
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,559
Ms. Pi.

339
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:46,830
Will you help me move my things?

340
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,630
What? Me?

341
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:54,670
Is there a Ms. Pi here other than you?

342
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,809
Seon Ju?

343
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:58,709
- Seon Ju.
- Stop it.

344
00:20:00,749 --> 00:20:01,749
Help me.

345
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,910
Sure.

346
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,670
You commented how I ended up
right across from you.

347
00:20:25,969 --> 00:20:27,140
What do you say now?

348
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,269
My gosh.

349
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:32,110
I'm cringing so hard
my fingers and toes might shrivel.

350
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,610
Did you ask for my help...

351
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:37,380
so you could brag about your office?

352
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:38,650
Think whatever you want.

353
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,620
I'm glad.

354
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,090
I don't have to face you anymore.

355
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:45,489
Congratulations on the promotion.

356
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,940
(Head of Planning Team Two, Jeon Nam Jin)

357
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,880
Do you like your office?

358
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,479
Yes.

359
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:11,719
We're getting what we want one by one.

360
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:14,019
I told you we would.

361
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,219
That Dad would acknowledge you one day.

362
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,890
He changed a bit.

363
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,160
You got your own office,
but that's not enough.

364
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,430
We have a lot more to do.

365
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,229
Let's not suspect each other anymore.

366
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:28,269
Okay.

367
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,269
I trust you'll handle
your divorce with Mr. Kim.

368
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,239
I don't have any feelings for Seon Ju.

369
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:37,640
Same here.

370
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,840
I feel nothing for So Woo.

371
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,249
I was just annoyed
they were working together.

372
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:48,249
They said they'd attend
today's team dinner.

373
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,950
Let's show them.

374
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,519
- Show them what?
- Our united front.

375
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,200
They might have appeared before us
to try to cause a rift and bring us down,

376
00:21:57,229 --> 00:21:58,559
but they failed.

377
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,830
And they also lost to us professionally.
Let's rub it in their faces.

378
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:06,769
Sounds good.

379
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,549
I'm glad we met.

380
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,090
Mister.

381
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,920
Let's talk.

382
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,160
- Hello.
- We met, didn't we?

383
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:29,529
At the cafe. I'm Jeon Nam Jin's mom.

384
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,299
Oh, right. What brought you here?

385
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:34,529
I'll be direct.

386
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,039
Why won't you divorce Sang Ah?

387
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:39,469
- What?
- If it won't work out,

388
00:22:39,469 --> 00:22:42,670
it's better for everyone
to end it quickly.

389
00:22:42,969 --> 00:22:46,440
Do you think you'll get something
out of her by dragging your feet?

390
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:50,309
- Ma'am.
- You're not as handsome as my Nam Jin,

391
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,219
but you look pretty decent.

392
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:54,590
Leave Sang Ah
and start over sooner than later.

393
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,959
She and Nam Jin can't move on
because you won't let them!

394
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:02,090
Ma'am. I think you got your facts wrong.

395
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,860
I'm not the one dragging my feet.

396
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,700
What? Then who isn't cooperating?

397
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,930
Find out for yourself.

398
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,670
Goodbye.

399
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,539
Is it Sang Ah who won't get divorced?

400
00:23:20,209 --> 00:23:22,680
Yes. There will be about ten people.

401
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:25,620
It's a very private affair,
so keep things secret.

402
00:23:25,979 --> 00:23:27,090
Thanks. Bye.

403
00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:30,920
What's a secret?

404
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:34,930
Why were you so startled?

405
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,400
Is it a big secret?

406
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:41,130
No. I was surprised
because you appeared so suddenly.

407
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,630
What's so private that it's a secret?

408
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:46,069
What did you just book?

409
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,009
Is it for Woo Sang?

410
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:50,069
No. It's really not.

411
00:23:55,749 --> 00:23:56,809
That was suspicious.

412
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,660
Let's act like we're so much in love
and drive them both crazy.

413
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,559
- Shall we do that?
- Yes.

414
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:25,110
What's taking the guests of honor so long?

415
00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:26,509
I don't know.

416
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,350
Where's Mr. Jeon?

417
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:37,989
It's Team Leader Jeon now.

418
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,959
Sorry.

419
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:42,529
He's parking.

420
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:47,529
This is a special day for us both.

421
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:49,200
Drink all you want.

422
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:51,440
"For us both?" My gosh.

423
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,340
- Goodness.
- No way.

424
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:14,090
Congratulations.

425
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,190
They're beautiful.

426
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,799
Mr. Jeon. You seem gruff,
but you're sensitive.

427
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,870
A team leader...

428
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,799
should congratulate his director.

429
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,640
Was that jab meant for me?

430
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,370
If you think so, then it was.

431
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,910
- Put this to one side.
- Okay.

432
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,749
Shall we clink glasses?

433
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:40,650
Cheers.

434
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,749
- Cheers.
- Congratulations.

435
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:48,559
What? Do you like it?

436
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:51,499
Nam Jin got it for me.

437
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,539
Team Leader Jeon.

438
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,499
You have a lot of money.

439
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
That watch.

440
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:04,239
That ring.

441
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:07,479
Your gifts are on a whole other level.

442
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,249
I should've checked your finances
before we got divorced.

443
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,519
Why? Are you jealous?

444
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,690
Should we get a cake or something?

445
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,590
Yes. We were clueless enough
to come empty-handed.

446
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,660
Let's get something.

447
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,380
It's best to avoid such situations.

448
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:39,680
Yes.

449
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,049
It looks like we must
walk a tightrope between them.

450
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:44,920
When can we go back inside?

451
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,719
I'm hungry.

452
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,759
The atmosphere here isn't that great.
Shall we go elsewhere on our own?

453
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,430
Yes, let's do that.
We can say we were too drunk.

454
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,729
I know a nice place.
Shall we go there instead?

455
00:26:57,999 --> 00:26:58,999
Let's go.

456
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,880
You're so good at spending money...

457
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:14,549
and you got Ji Hyun
nothing but a teddy bear?

458
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:16,509
From a dollar store?

459
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,620
Or did you get it for free
at a fair you took her to?

460
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,950
Not that again.

461
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,819
Must you bring that up?

462
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,930
Yes. You talked about Boxing Day
and said you got...

463
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,759
some nice things at a bargain.

464
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,459
Did you ever get me something?

465
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,630
Forget a gift.

466
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,969
You never even mentioned my hard work.

467
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:41,209
Oh, yes. The silk nightdress
that turned out to be hers.

468
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:42,840
You got me that.

469
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,809
And for her...

470
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,880
You got a diamond ring?

471
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,549
Do you think diamonds suit you?

472
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:55,989
Is this pretty? Does it suit me?

473
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,150
Yes.

474
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,059
It's beautiful. You chose well.

475
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,900
- That suits you too.
- It makes you look cool.

476
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,930
Really?

477
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,309
- I'll get you another one.
- You will?

478
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,440
A bigger one.

479
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:25,479
Mr. Kim. They're overreacting
just to infuriate us.

480
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:27,489
Shall we put on an act too...

481
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:29,890
and see how upset they get?

482
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:42,430
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

483
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:00,380
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

484
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,650
I can't tell her to bring her ex-husband.

485
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,860
I need two brothers-in-law
to attend the wedding.

486
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,259
Could you come?

487
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:08,459
Don't you know me?

488
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,799
Aren't you that fool?

489
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,529
- Let go.
- Where's Shim Soon Ae?

490
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,069
You two don't look happy at all.

491
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,100
What's that?

492
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,539
Are you trying to make us jealous?

493
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,900
Do you still like Nam Jin that much?

494
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:23,709
