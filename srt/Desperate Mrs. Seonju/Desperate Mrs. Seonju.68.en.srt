00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,890
(Episode 68)

2
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,870
What are you doing?

3
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,670
Work is just an excuse.

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,540
You come here to seduce him, don't you?

5
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,510
You make up reasons to work late together!

6
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,210
What are you doing?

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,550
How can you sleep here?

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,720
- Jin Sang Ah.
- You disgusting things!

(Team Leader's Office, Planning Team 1)

10
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,120
Darn it.

11
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,700
We did pretty good, didn't we?

12
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,700
Yes. Let's polish it
a bit more tomorrow and send it off.

13
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,540
I fell asleep. Why didn't you wake me?

14
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,870
Then we'd have finished earlier.

15
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,440
How tired must you have been...

16
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,110
to fall asleep
while I went to make coffee?

17
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,450
I let you sleep out of pity.

18
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,650
I guess I hired a great teammate.

19
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,720
The office is a bit scary at night.

20
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,030
I noticed it gets a bit spooky
when I'm working late.

21
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,530
You know how empty classrooms...

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,140
in scary movies feel...

23
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,180
Did I get you?

24
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,050
What did you do that for?

25
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,350
You liked that too much.

26
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,700
I went everywhere looking for you.

27
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,270
Don't you think you're enjoying
a bit too classy a lifestyle?

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,500
Hey, this looks nice.

29
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,300
Is it expensive?

30
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,340
Will it break?

31
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,380
Why are you here?

32
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,380
Why did you come here?

33
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,750
Why am I here?

34
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,350
After what you did to me,

35
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,420
did you think
you'd get away with it forever?

36
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,890
I should just... Darn you.

37
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,430
Give me 500,000 dollars.

38
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,230
Five hundred thousand dollars?

39
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,040
That's not a large amount...

40
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,770
considering how I wasted my youth.

41
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,840
I want it by the weekend.

42
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,480
If the wife of Jin Architecture's CEO...

43
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,210
and the owner of this salon
can't get me that much?

44
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,750
Then...

45
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,020
I have no choice
but to visit your husband.

46
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,960
I must settle down and make a living too.

47
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,230
I already checked out
all the people around you.

48
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,660
Don't think of getting rid of me.

49
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,660
Here. Give me your number.

50
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,820
Ms. Pi.

51
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,660
Do I look human to you?

52
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,390
Yes. You look like an extremely...

53
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,660
silly person.

54
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,330
Goodness.

55
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,200
Be more careful.

56
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,940
It's dark. Shall I turn on my flashlight?

57
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes.

58
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,440
Do I look human to you?

59
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,610
Goodness. Are you still in school?

60
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,220
Was that scary? It was, wasn't it?

61
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,930
My gosh.

62
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,070
Wake up. Get a grip.

63
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,940
(Jin Architecture)

64
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,430
(Team Leader's Office, Planning Team 1)

65
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,740
- It's disgusting.
- What?

66
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,410
Do you clean Mr. Kim's office
first thing in the morning now?

67
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,640
What?

68
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,280
I'm cleaning up what we'd left
after working late last night.

69
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,880
I bet you clean his house for him too.

70
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,850
Yes. He looks after Tae Ri at home
and works hard at work.

71
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,920
He has it tough as a dad.
Shall I clean for him too?

72
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,990
You. Don't cross the line.

73
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,760
What line? Where is the line?

74
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,030
Did you draw one?

75
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,830
What's this about now?

76
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,900
We need to talk.

77
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,050
Mr. Kim has it tough as a dad? So what?

78
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,720
You love to help the unfortunate
and made me a much better man.

79
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,690
Did you turn your attention to him now?

80
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,760
What are you and Seon Ju up to?

81
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,060
What do you mean?

82
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,500
Look at this.

83
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,770
Is this what you're up to at work?

84
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,210
Do you come here to have an affair?

85
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,140
What does that make you and Mr. Jeon?

86
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,110
- We didn't get together at work.
- What does that mean?

87
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,380
We both started working here
after our affair had kicked off.

88
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,950
We didn't spend our time here
working on our romance.

89
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,390
We were plastered all over the Internet
and we got chewed out,

90
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,990
so I didn't use work as an excuse
to date in secret.

91
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,530
But you two sit together
using work as an excuse to flirt...

92
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,030
and ruin the atmosphere.

93
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,670
Where everyone can see.

94
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,270
I dozed off while working late.

95
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,070
She covered me with a blanket.
Is that dating?

96
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,140
Put a hand on your heart and ask yourself.

97
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,140
If that's not dating, what is it?

98
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,640
Why is that such a big deal?

99
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,080
Is it something worth taking a video of?
I just don't get it.

100
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,750
Do you know how stupid it is?

101
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,350
It's disgusting.

102
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,090
That's exactly how I felt when I saw
the dashcam footage of you and Nam Jin.

103
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,390
You filmed us illegally.

104
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,830
And the more I hear you talk,

105
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,060
the more I think I'll lose my mind too.

106
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,400
I've heard enough.

107
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,250
Are you working on it?

108
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,390
Here.

109
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,900
The whole world hates you,

110
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,460
so you can't work anywhere else.

111
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,770
Don't think of being a freeloader
and work here with me.

112
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay.

113
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,210
Isn't it a relief
that you have a hairdresser's license?

114
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,840
We'll have to stay closed for a while
because of the reporters outside.

115
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,180
You have time to practice.

116
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,610
Sit down, Dong Won.

117
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,320
- I don't want to.
- You can't say that.

118
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,980
Make yourself worthwhile.

119
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,520
Do elementary school kids
have to make themselves worthwhile?

120
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,830
I don't need a haircut.

121
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,490
Pick up the scissors.

122
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,840
Are you consoling me now?

123
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,070
I lost my job because of you.

124
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,740
Darn it.

125
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,380
- I feel so bothered.
- Yes, a variety show writer.

126
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,480
The team rookie.

127
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,250
Put up a post for me. Thank you.

128
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,450
- You're hiring a writer?
- Yes.

129
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,790
It'll take more than just us two
once the program gets on track.

130
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:14,060
We need a transfusion of some young blood.

131
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,890
"Young blood?"

132
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,760
How about some old blood?

133
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,530
Old people won't have fresh ideas.

134
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,500
There's no age limit though, right?

135
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,250
Hey, shall we meet up later?

136
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,360
Ms. Pi. I sent it off.

137
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,590
Did you really? Good job.

138
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,030
What did you send off?

139
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,500
The Dubai government is hosting a contest.

140
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,470
I sent a proposal
saying I'd like to enter.

141
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,370
Wasn't that only for a few chosen firms?

142
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,370
If you win the design rights,
will our firm go down in Dubai's history?

143
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,940
Will the royal family invite us
so we can...

144
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,340
tour the new palace?

145
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,380
I only sent a proposal
asking if we could participate.

146
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,420
I know, right?

147
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,320
They get way too excited way too soon.

148
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,920
Out of these two plans...

149
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,090
It'll be a great deal.

150
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,660
- What are you thinking about?
- It could be awesome.

151
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,060
There are separate dishes and sets too.

152
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,170
Will you let them
continue what they're doing?

153
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,470
What do you want to do?

154
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,270
You don't feel bothered at all by this?

155
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,780
They're having an emotional affair.

156
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,420
They're doing this all the time.

157
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,620
So what?

158
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,520
I don't like what they're doing,

159
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,660
but what do you want me to do
to my ex-wife?

160
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,430
Rein her back in.

161
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,290
Why are you so bothered by what they do?

162
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,500
If you have the time and energy for that,

163
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,300
how about we talk about us first?

164
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,370
You're still upset about the wedding,

165
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,640
and you ignored my text.

166
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,970
What more do you want to...

167
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,640
Talk, then.

168
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,010
Forget it.

169
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
Darn it.

170
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,890
Why did you want to see me?

171
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,890
I just...

172
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,060
You lost your manager job...

173
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,970
and I wanted to hear if you had any plans.

174
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,830
I don't.

175
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,870
I considered studying
to get a realtor license...

176
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,110
and I even bought a textbook.

177
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,410
I don't know if I can do it.

178
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,750
You're not exactly young.

179
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,480
Your brain is too old to study anything.

180
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,490
- What?
- A realtor license is tough to get.

181
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,760
Do you have to crush me like that
when I'm trying to do something?

182
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,660
I really can't stand you.

183
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,160
That's not what I mean.

184
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,830
Don't you want to...

185
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,900
stick to something you're good at?

186
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,800
Take a look at this.

187
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,270
- What is it?
- Take a look.

188
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,140
"Variety show writer?"

189
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,910
I've never done this before.

190
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,150
You just have to throw out ideas
like you did with me.

191
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,550
You studied Korean literature.

192
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,020
Apply at least.

193
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,890
Is this your ex-daughter-in-law's?

194
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,860
I don't know if it's hers
or someone else's.

195
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,130
I don't want to keep it,
but I can't go back to return it either.

196
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,900
What if the kids see me again?

197
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,630
They might actually call the police.

198
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,500
Exactly. What should I do?

199
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,410
Ask the fortune teller
about the swaddling clothes.

200
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
Should I?

201
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,530
Hello?

202
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,430
- Why did you call?
- What?

203
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,060
The nasty online comments...

204
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,800
are your punishment
for what you did to us.

205
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,700
You're reaping what you sowed.

206
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,710
Fortunately,
the public is kinder to Woo Sang,

207
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,310
so if you want to help him,
stay away from him.

208
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,210
Okay?

209
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,120
Mom.

210
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,490
You took my phone again, didn't you?

211
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,530
Don't call her.

212
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Don't, okay?

213
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,070
Why are you always taking my phone?

214
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,440
You fool.

215
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,810
Oh, gosh.

216
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,330
Hello.

217
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,630
It's Jeong Woo Sang.

218
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,060
Hey! Who did this to you?

219
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,200
Did you give them these stupid haircuts?

220
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,270
What do you mean?

221
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,540
Hey, what happened to your hair?
This isn't the haircut I gave you.

222
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,640
I didn't like what you'd done.

223
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,450
We tried to fix it ourselves.

224
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,450
Darn it.

225
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,380
What's the matter?

226
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,790
What's wrong with...

227
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,590
My gosh.

228
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,920
What the heck is this?

229
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,490
Don't you cut anyone's hair for a while.

230
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,330
What's going on?

231
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,230
What... My gosh.

232
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,740
Oh, dear.

233
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,670
Let's style it like this for a while.

234
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,610
It'll grow out soon. Don't worry.

235
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,510
Okay.

236
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,620
I bribed Dong Won
by promising to get him...

237
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,820
a partial wig and new trainers.

238
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,490
You troublemaker.

239
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,860
It looks better now.

240
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,230
Go and play.

241
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,270
I'm sorry, guys.

242
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,470
It's fine.
You'll get better at it with practice.

243
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,670
You'd better get better at it.

244
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,180
Thanks, guys.

245
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,350
Hey, Mi Ju.

246
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,780
Why would you cry over that?

247
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,720
It's just...

248
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,860
Why? Do you feel down?

249
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,390
I'm grateful that Mom took me in,

250
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,390
but you two helped raise me too.

251
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,200
The neighbors called Jin Ju "Ban Eun..."

252
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,070
because she was doing what Mom should.

253
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,370
You're not even my blood.

254
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,570
Why would you say that?

255
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,680
We ate together and that makes us sisters.

256
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,740
Even so...

257
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,350
Seon Ju, you beat up all the bullies
when they got on my case.

258
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,190
I'll make it up to you both
when I become successful.

259
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,160
I'm not used to you being like this.

260
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,290
That's how appreciative I am.

261
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,460
From now on,

262
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,670
I'll never fall in love
and do nothing but work.

263
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,570
Hasn't Jeong Woo Sang called?

264
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,810
What?

265
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,380
He called,

266
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,640
but I said we should break up.

267
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,610
You did? But why? You liked him so much.

268
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,450
What did he say? Was he up for it?

269
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,850
Well,

270
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,190
he must need time to think too.

271
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,920
Why is he...

272
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,920
still thinking about it?

273
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,660
He's just confusing you.

274
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,430
The worst thing a guy can do...

275
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,930
is be vague and string the girl along...

276
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,970
and give her hope.

277
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,370
He wouldn't do this to you
if he knew what he wanted.

278
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,210
How could he ignore you
when you're taking all the blame?

279
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,010
What a scumbag.

280
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,410
Don't badmouth him.

281
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,010
I think...

282
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,280
I was misled.

283
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,150
To be honest, deep inside,

284
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,720
I always told myself
I shouldn't fall for him.

285
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,830
But my heart leaped when I saw him,

286
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,830
and I felt butterflies
when he smiled sweetly at me.

287
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,070
That was how stupid I was.

288
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,170
That's how he seduced you and dumped you.

289
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,040
That's what jerks do.

290
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,810
The irresponsible fool.

291
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,770
Such punks are the worst.

292
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,610
Don't badmouth him.

293
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,080
Don't you be mistaken.

294
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,950
It's bad if a guy leads you on,

295
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,420
but you're more of a moron
to fall for it and get carried away.

296
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,620
Dragging things on
when things are so vague...

297
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,090
is most frustrating...

298
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,090
and most idiotic.

299
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,330
I know it is.

300
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,400
That's why we're breaking it off.

301
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,370
(Jin Architecture)

302
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,240
Oh, gosh.

303
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,920
To be honest, deep inside,

304
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,550
I always told myself
I shouldn't fall for him.

305
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,690
But my heart leaped when I saw him,

306
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,690
and I felt butterflies
when he smiled sweetly at me.

307
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,730
That was how stupid I was.

308
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,670
Don't you be mistaken.

309
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,270
It's bad if a guy leads you on,

310
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,770
but you're more of a moron
to fall for it and get carried away.

311
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,450
How about lunch?

312
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,550
Did they all go out without us?

313
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,220
How about blood sausage soup?

314
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,320
I think...

315
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,630
I'll eat something later.

316
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,730
Will you?

317
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Okay, then.

318
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,110
(I Lost My Memory but I Want Revenge)

319
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,280
The wedding actually...

320
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,380
wasn't a con.

321
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,650
The mysterious girl Pi Mi Ju and I...

322
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,050
Woo Sang. What are you doing?

323
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,890
The crazy things.

324
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,500
You didn't go out?

325
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,100
I bought a lunchbox too.

326
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,810
Yours looks good.

327
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,980
Shall we swap?

328
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,710
No.

329
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,780
I already started. I'll eat mine.

330
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,490
Are you still upset
because of your sister's wedding?

331
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,550
It'll be forgotten.

332
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,290
You said that...

333
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,590
it wouldn't bring the world down.

334
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,430
It didn't bring the world down,

335
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,860
but it did make life a bit worse.

336
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,900
The online comments
are getting out of hand.

337
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,400
I can say for sure...

338
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,470
that your family will band together
and get through it.

339
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:09,770
How do I know that?

340
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,440
I'm a member
of your blackmailing family now...

341
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,650
and I know you well.

342
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,080
Let's say the wedding happened.

343
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,950
What about the aftermath?

344
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,450
Your family.

345
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,220
I know their tendency to cause problems
trying to handle something.

346
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,660
Be relieved the wedding got called off.

347
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,270
Do you know what
an unidentified ghost says?

348
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,530
"Boo hoo."

349
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,270
Finish your lunch.

350
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,510
You laughed.

351
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,080
Have some tuna.

352
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,720
You can never say no to tuna.

353
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,190
Mr. Kim.

354
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,570
Why do you crack such jokes around me?

355
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,300
I guess I wanted to cheer you up.

356
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,670
Were they too lame?

357
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,280
Do you live according to your mood?

358
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,380
Take heed to advice when it's given.

359
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,350
Why do you care how I feel?

360
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,720
I just...

361
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,260
Did I do something wrong?

362
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,470
You said we shouldn't do stuff
that would give others the wrong idea.

363
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,070
We're parallel train tracks.

364
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,070
Not being able to walk by,
wanting to help,

365
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,780
and wanting to shield others.

366
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,480
Train tracks don't do that.

367
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,350
What?

368
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,950
Well...

369
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,560
I get it.

370
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,530
I know you're just being nice.

371
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,970
You're just a good... I mean...

372
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,500
You're a good person.

373
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,400
You're just being...

374
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,910
a nice colleague and homeowner
whom we live with.

375
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,450
But I'm not that good or nice a person.

376
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,850
I don't think
what you're doing is natural.

377
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,620
I get the wrong idea.

378
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,960
Whenever Sang Ah and Nam Jin ask
what's going on between us...

379
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,960
and if I like you and stuff,

380
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,960
I should think and say
they're being misled.

381
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,830
I should tell them off for going too far.

382
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,500
I know that.

383
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,800
But if you keep it up,

384
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:58,040
I of all people
will start getting the wrong idea.

385
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,480
Ms. Pi.

386
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,750
If that continues,

387
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,690
instead of being train tracks,

388
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,290
perhaps we should become
complete strangers.

389
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,090
Who did you eat with?

390
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,600
Don't talk to me.

391
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,970
You're right here. Should I ignore you?

392
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,000
You shouldn't have
joined the company, then.

393
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,270
I'm not the only worker here.

394
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,170
Go talk to your lover.

395
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,110
You married me
because I made you feel comfortable,

396
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,910
but you said
our married life was uncomfortable.

397
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,350
You didn't like how I talked
or how I dressed,

398
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,650
and you felt lonely
because we couldn't communicate.

399
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,050
Now you're happy
that you met someone on your level.

400
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,790
Focus on that happiness.

401
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:54,230
You were never nice to me
when we were married.

402
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,290
You have a lover now.

403
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,630
Why do you do this to me
whenever we meet as if you have regrets?

404
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,970
You really...

405
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,740
You're really such a jerk.

406
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,910
This is all your fault!

407
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,750
You mistreated me for so long.

408
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,190
Even though people
are just being nice and polite to me,

409
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,350
because you left me scarred,

410
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:27,420
I feel myself tearing up
over every small gesture.

411
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,490
Because of you,

412
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,760
I'm unable to have a normal
human relationship, you piece of dirt!

413
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,400
"I was never treated nicely."

414
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,800
"No one ever cared for me this much."

415
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,080
My standards are so darn low.

416
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,580
I get the wrong idea
when someone just smiles at me.

417
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,720
I can't think rationally,

418
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
and it's all your fault!

419
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,470
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

420
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,520
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

421
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
How are the company finances?

422
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,590
If it's okay,
can I borrow 200,000 dollars...

423
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,600
It's not right to take company money
for personal use.

424
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,330
What were you going to tell the reporter?

425
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,730
What I wanted to say.

426
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,240
What if I deny it?

427
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,500
Is there proof?

428
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,270
You like Mr. Kim, don't you?

429
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,870
Are you two in love or something?

430
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,010
What if we are?

431
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,580
What if we say we are?

432
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
