(Episode 10)

3
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,419
Goodness.

4
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:25,819
I do hope...

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,159
you'll excuse me for coming by.

6
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,159
I feel so bad
that I don't even know what to say.

7
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,830
It is you, Soon Ae.

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,970
You're Shim Soon Ae, aren't you?

9
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:47,409
Man Eun...

10
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,279
Yes, you brat. It's me, Han Man Eun.

11
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,620
How long has it been?

12
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,449
No. You mistook me for someone else.

13
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,820
I did not.

14
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,459
You said my name just now.

15
00:01:01,589 --> 00:01:03,489
You recognized me right away.

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,269
(Grace Shim Beauty Studio)

17
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,739
You lost the dialect completely.

18
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,369
So did I. You can't tell, can you?

19
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,110
If you want to work in this field,

20
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,810
you need to speak like a Seoulite
if you want to win people's trust.

21
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,849
- What's going on?
- Nothing's going on.

22
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:29,450
Are you the car owner's mother?

23
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:35,730
How did you know we'd be here?

24
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,330
I'm glad you made it. Come over here.

25
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,659
It turns out that...

26
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:43,000
this lady here is my hometown friend,

27
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:46,000
and we worked together years ago.

28
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:48,140
We were really close. Say hello.

29
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,840
And this is my youngest daughter.

30
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,170
She's your daughter's stylist.

31
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,480
We met once before.

32
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:56,110
Hello. My name is Pi Mi Ju.

33
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,750
This is my second daughter.

34
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,019
Hello. I'm Pi Seon Ju.

35
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,890
You look a lot like your mother.

36
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,459
I have another daughter,

37
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,989
but she couldn't be here.

38
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:11,429
If I'd known we'd meet,
I'd have brought Jin Ju too.

39
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,959
Doesn't this...

40
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,659
remind you of the old times?

41
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:18,170
I taught you how to cut and perm hair.

42
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:21,469
Is that true?

43
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:24,369
Did you teach Ms. Shim?

44
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:25,410
I did.

45
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,640
I'm older, and she followed me around
and picked things up.

46
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,619
Yes, that's it. Roll it up tight.

47
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:34,679
Like that.

48
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,850
- Welcome.
- Sit over here.

49
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,360
I want her to do my hair.

50
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,630
It's her turn to work, you see.

51
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,700
- What are you here for?
- A perm.

52
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,570
She's pretty good at perming hair.

53
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:53,600
I'll keep watch and help out.

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,670
How would you like it?

55
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,140
She will make sure
the curls don't come loose.

56
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,339
What are all these in your hair?

57
00:03:01,309 --> 00:03:03,480
- I'll make you look nice and pretty.
- Okay.

58
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:05,450
She always talked about...

59
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,719
moving to Seoul and becoming successful.

60
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,290
You actually made it.

61
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:14,619
You should've called me, then.

62
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,989
I was so worried when you disappeared
and never called me again.

63
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,029
Could you not find me because I moved?

64
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,100
I left Gyeong Ja's mom my new address.

65
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,269
Anyway, it's great to see you again.

66
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,410
Our girls must've caused the accident
to reunite us.

67
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,939
Are these your daughters?

68
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:37,510
They look like you. How old are they?

69
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,880
- Is Dong Soo...
- Be quiet!

70
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,249
My goodness. You scared me.

71
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,920
Why did you scream?

72
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,619
What exactly is going on?

73
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:49,860
I'll explain.

74
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:52,730
Your mom and I...

75
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,899
were really close back in the day,
like best friends ever.

76
00:03:55,929 --> 00:03:57,670
We were the best of friends.

77
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:01,800
Why did you let your daughter
drive such an expensive car?

78
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:05,309
How can it cost 55,000 dollars to fix?
That's enough to buy a car.

79
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:08,439
It's enough to buy a truckload
of the kind of car Seon Ju drives.

80
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,450
Mom.

81
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,420
You're bound to drive into things
and scrape it here and there...

82
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,749
when you're out and about.

83
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,719
Driving such an expensive car
is a public nuisance.

84
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:22,630
- What?
- So...

85
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,459
help us out here.

86
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,699
We'll pay you back over time.

87
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,730
How about an installment?

88
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:32,739
How are we to trust you?

89
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:35,340
I won't con you or disappear.

90
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:39,439
If you don't trust me...
Weren't you friends in high school?

91
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:41,579
How could we con you
when we all know each other?

92
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,480
She's an interior designer too.

93
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,749
She does interior design?

94
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:47,550
That's what you do.

95
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,290
Is that so?

96
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,689
Are you two in the same field?

97
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:53,259
My goodness.

98
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:57,530
The moms are in the same field,
and our daughters are in the same field.

99
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,329
This is such a coincidence.

100
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:01,429
So what?

101
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:04,600
My daughter will go to any length...

102
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:06,600
to keep a promise she makes.

103
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,270
So trust us,

104
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:10,840
and let us pay in installments.

105
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,889
They say money
changes your look completely.

106
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,660
She looks so rich and elegant now.

107
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:33,860
She used to have a dreadful taste.

108
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:36,129
She borrowed my clothes all the time.

109
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:37,970
I don't believe that.

110
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,129
It's the truth.

111
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,840
Were you actually close?

112
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,939
Yes. Did I ever lie to you?

113
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:46,780
She didn't seem pleased to see you.

114
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,579
It was like she wanted to
separate herself from you.

115
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,980
I bet she was startled to see me again.

116
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,220
I was.

117
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,590
We go way back, and we were tight.

118
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,220
She'll have to show some mercy.

119
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,220
Don't worry.

120
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,290
Yes, Seon Ju.
Don't say anything to jinx it.

121
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,460
That's right. Trust me.

122
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,929
Wait.

123
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,300
Does she have just two girls?

124
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,170
There's no eldest son?

125
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:13,999
I don't think so.

126
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,610
Let's go home.

127
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,249
Why did Mom talk so much about me?

128
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,420
Let me tell you what she does
just to keep her word.

129
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,550
One time, she went out to see a friend,

130
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,889
but that friend forgot about their plans
and went to see her grandma.

131
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:37,530
She spent the whole night
waiting for her friend...

132
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:40,429
in the school gymnasium
instead of coming home.

133
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,460
Everyone thought she'd gone missing.

134
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,739
She ended up meeting her friend
and coming home with her.

135
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,470
That's how stupidly stubborn she is
when it comes to keeping promises.

136
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,809
She never gives in.

137
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:55,239
She promised to support her husband
who went abroad to study.

138
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:58,650
She could've given up
if she couldn't earn enough money,

139
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,879
but she didn't to the very end.

140
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,050
Mom.

141
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,619
Do you know Choon Hyang
from the old folk tale?

142
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,590
She's not just any Choon Hyang.

143
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,790
She sent money to her man
while he studied to better their lives.

144
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:13,759
She's like Princess Pyeonggang...

145
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,470
who turned a village idiot
into a famous general.

146
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:20,300
- Mom.
- What?

147
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,470
Is that so?

148
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,309
Did you turn your village idiot husband
into a man?

149
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,569
She did.

150
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:30,480
My girls are like me
and love to help the unfortunate.

151
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,749
That's why I took you in then
and fed you and...

152
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:35,650
- Stop!
- My goodness.

153
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,889
Are you done?

154
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,090
What?

155
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,290
- Yes.
- I see the situation you're in.

156
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,460
Now leave.

157
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,290
Yes. We'll follow the legal protocol.
Go home and wait.

158
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,960
Okay, then.

159
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:52,129
Why did she say all that?

160
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,369
She talks too much
and doesn't know when to stop.

161
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:55,939
- I wish she'd get in already.
- Goodness.

162
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,879
Why do I feel the aura
of archenemies who met...

163
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:01,639
in a one-way street?

164
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:05,379
Mom wants us to trust her,
but can we really do that?

165
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,160
What nuisances.

166
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,629
Why did you get involved with such people?

167
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,569
Why are you so angry?

168
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:27,999
Right. How was I to know
what they were like?

169
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,009
Did you really eat and sleep
at that chatterbox woman's house...

170
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:32,910
and learn how to cut and perm hair?

171
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,610
What are you talking about?

172
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,150
Why did she say that, then?

173
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:40,050
When you're as successful as me,
people I can barely remember...

174
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,890
come and make up stories to earn favors.

175
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:44,520
That wasn't the first time.

176
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:46,189
You recognized her too.

177
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,059
I told you about the time...

178
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:52,059
my father's business struggled.

179
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:56,170
She was the local salon owner
I briefly lived with then.

180
00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:00,339
I might have asked a few questions
when I went there to get my hair done,

181
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,969
and she blew it out of proportion.

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,109
Really?

183
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,309
She changed the story that drastically?

184
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,609
The whole family's a gang of frauds.

185
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:09,849
Yes.

186
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:11,709
They showed zero remorse...

187
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,020
and acted like they were special guests.
They have no manners at all.

188
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,520
How could mom and daughters
all be so weird?

189
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:22,859
Mom, the rookie stylist.

190
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
She's a failed celebrity wannabe.

191
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,459
She was involved in some scandal.

192
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,630
Really?

193
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,569
I'd be too ashamed
to even call her my daughter.

194
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:33,670
I know, right?

195
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,640
She's not good enough to be a stylist.

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,010
She has zero fashion sense.

197
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:39,640
Did you see how she tried to...

198
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,439
make it look like her daughter
was Sang Ah's equal?

199
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,010
That's madness.
How dare she even try?

200
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:48,120
Why would you brag about staying out
all night to wait for a friend?

201
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,319
That's stupid, not smart.

202
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:53,390
If my mom insulted me
while trying to brag about me,

203
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,859
I'd try to stop her.

204
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:56,160
I felt second-hand embarrassment.

205
00:09:56,689 --> 00:09:59,459
Do you want me to handle
the legal issues for you?

206
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:00,900
You're a celebrity,

207
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,630
and you'll inherit Jin Architecture.

208
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,429
Dealing with people like that...

209
00:10:04,429 --> 00:10:05,699
You don't have to.

210
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:07,500
No. I'll take care of it.

211
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,740
We won't reduce the settlement
or show leniency. Okay?

212
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,979
Fire that rookie stylist right away.

213
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,579
Stay well away from that family.

214
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:17,849
Okay. I won't just fire her.
I'll make sure her future is ruined.

215
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:19,410
Don't you get involved in person.

216
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,479
Have your insurance company
or the police contact them.

217
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,719
You bet.

218
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
What?

219
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,329
No, not at all. That's not true.

220
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,969
We went to the police station to...

221
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,640
No mom will let me tutor their kids now.

222
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,349
How did it go? Did it go well?

223
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,979
Yes. The car owner's mom
was mom's best friend back in the day.

224
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:55,880
- Isn't that great?
- For real?

225
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,359
Mom let her stay with her, fed her,
and even taught her how to cut hair.

226
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:03,359
So this is her chance to return the favor.

227
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,929
My gosh. That's just great.

228
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,400
I'm glad Mom went there to meet her.

229
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,469
It looked like I'd lose my job...

230
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:14,240
and have to cough up a fortune.

231
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:16,740
They'll drop at least one thing, right?

232
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,010
Or both?

233
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,109
Hello.

234
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:28,719
Pi Mi Ju. What on earth did you do?

235
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
What do you mean?

236
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:35,620
Really?

237
00:11:37,859 --> 00:11:39,130
Okay.

238
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,599
What's wrong?

239
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:44,469
I just got fired.

240
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,770
Jin Chu Ah freaked out
because of what I did.

241
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:49,670
She doesn't want to see me again.

242
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,069
You said her mom
was mom's friend and they talked it out.

243
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:55,309
Yes.

244
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,579
Are you sure she got the message?

245
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,949
She might end up in prison
if she can't get the money.

246
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,020
If you get her another job,
you'll be to blame in the end.

247
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,990
Bye.

248
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,459
Did she get the message?

249
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:14,329
Yes. She'll make sure Mi Ju
can't work as a stylist again.

250
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,599
Good. Well done.

251
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,370
Hello.

252
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,939
- Mr. Jin.
- Hello.

253
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,949
Are you busy monitoring
the training institute project?

254
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,459
Yes. Construction is underway,

255
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:42,559
but there are many on-site variables.

256
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,059
I'm sure you'll do fine.

257
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:46,829
Let's forget about that.

258
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,300
Is something bothering you these days?

259
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:54,000
- Pardon?
- Well,

260
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,339
Sang Ah isn't exactly warm and welcoming,

261
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,910
and I'm wondering
if she's giving you a hard time.

262
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:04,780
What with Tae Ri too,

263
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:07,150
you must have a lot on your mind.

264
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,579
It's fine.

265
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,689
I'm sure we can talk it out.

266
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:12,849
Yes.

267
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,329
If there's anything to discuss,
come to me instead of bottling it up.

268
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,689
Okay?

269
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:19,490
Yes.

270
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay, then.

271
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,069
There's no end to this.

272
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,640
Woo Sang! Your manager's here!

273
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,380
Come downstairs!

274
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:37,209
Goodness. What a nuisance.

275
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:53,500
Why are you still in bed?

276
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,559
Your manager is here. Get up.

277
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,630
You said you had a shoot.

278
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:02,400
I'm dead tired.
I feel like I might actually die.

279
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:06,010
Waking you up is equally tiring for me.

280
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,309
Get up right away.

281
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,780
Can you not?

282
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,979
My fans will become your haters
if they know you beat your adult son.

283
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:16,520
If they were to know I must beat you
to get you to crawl out of bed,

284
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,689
they would hate you first.

285
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,760
Get ready and come downstairs.

286
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,890
Be quick!

287
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,530
- Hello.
- Hi.

288
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,630
He'll be out soon. Here.

289
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:29,870
Drink this as you wait.

290
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,270
Oh, dear.

291
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:34,400
You look exhausted.

292
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:37,609
I am. I haven't found help yet.

293
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,709
I ache all over...

294
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:41,839
because I must run the house
and garden on my own.

295
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:44,209
If I ask the helper to weed the garden,

296
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:46,719
mow the lawn, and prune the trees,

297
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,520
they quit on me.

298
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,089
Am I not allowed to even ask?

299
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,390
- You can ask.
- Right?

300
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,020
All they must do is help in the garden,
cook a simple meal,

301
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,689
clean the house, and do the laundry.
Is that too much to ask?

302
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,660
- It's not.
- I'm not...

303
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,500
that hard to put up with, am I?

304
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,199
- You're not.
- Right?

305
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,770
But everyone just quits.

306
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,740
I'm doing it all on my own,

307
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,439
and my back always hurts.

308
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,309
Hey.

309
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,209
My dear son.

310
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:19,650
You never listen to me,
but you're lovely to look at.

311
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,319
I'd rather you not hit me when I'm asleep.

312
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:24,490
I should film you and post it online.

313
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,620
What?

314
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,030
The denim jacket I wore last time.
Did you wash it?

315
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:32,660
That? I sent it to the dry cleaner's.

316
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,729
You did what?

317
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,199
Did you check the pockets?

318
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,900
Did you leave something in one?

319
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,400
I was keeping something for Chu Ah.
I hope it's okay.

320
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,800
What is it?

321
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,270
It's nothing.

322
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,679
Chu Ah likes you so much.

323
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,179
Why don't you marry her?

324
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:51,849
She's pretty enough,
and her family's successful enough.

325
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:53,719
Why would you say that?

326
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,550
You act like you don't care for her.

327
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,550
But seeing how you kept
something safe for her,

328
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,689
I think you care a little bit.

329
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:00,990
I don't at all.

330
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,959
I have less than
0.01 percent of feelings for her.

331
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,059
Okay, sure.

332
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,000
- Let's go.
- Okay.

333
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:10,969
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

334
00:16:11,969 --> 00:16:14,140
It would be so nice...

335
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,740
if my son were to start
a happy family of his own.

336
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,280
(Jeil Interior Design)

337
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,709
I got it, okay?

338
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,780
Darn it.

339
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,219
- I'm back.
- Hey.

340
00:16:27,849 --> 00:16:31,920
She doesn't care at all
what I do and if I eat or not.

341
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:35,520
I should just give up and let it all go.

342
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,459
Why are you so angry?

343
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,589
I sit here all day because I have no work,

344
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:42,959
but my wife does nothing
but go to famous restaurants.

345
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,370
Doesn't she know I like good food too
and would love to go to such places?

346
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:48,469
Look. Do you see this?

347
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:51,839
My sock has this huge hole
and she doesn't even care.

348
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,439
You should've chosen wisely.

349
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:55,439
I did. I'm wearing the sock
with the smallest hole.

350
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:58,709
My darn wife.
I hope she makes a fortune...

351
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,520
by saving up on buying new socks.

352
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:05,349
The breadwinner
should be respected as such.

353
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:08,089
If a married man has an affair,

354
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,990
it's the wife's fault.

355
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,059
No way. That's not true.

356
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:16,399
Married life is like the dance
where the couple holds hands.

357
00:17:16,629 --> 00:17:18,700
If one takes the lead and steps back,

358
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,899
the partner is bound to
step forward to keep up.

359
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,609
Darn it.

360
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,879
I need you to go to Jinsung...

361
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,809
and pick up a new urinal.

362
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,210
Okay.

363
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,889
Mr. Jeon's idea isn't bad.

364
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,619
Yes. So this time, I think...

365
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:42,119
I'll let the team brainstorm freely...

366
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,490
and develop their ideas.

367
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:47,829
Okay. Try to get along with Mr. Jeon.

368
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,800
Yes, sir.

369
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,010
Yes.

370
00:17:58,069 --> 00:17:59,809
I fired the rookie stylist.

371
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:02,579
Mom was really on edge.

372
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,909
You saw how she screamed
and told us to stay away from them.

373
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:08,349
She must really hate them.

374
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,450
You saw what they were like.

375
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,690
They're so beneath us.
I'm not surprised she hates them.

376
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,990
The only times Mom screamed like that...

377
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,430
was when my KSAT scores were dismal...

378
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,659
and when I got dragged home
after I ran away.

379
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:23,569
To think that someone like that
called her by her given name...

380
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,000
because of their distant past.

381
00:18:25,129 --> 00:18:28,369
Exactly. How could they ask us
to settle for less because of that?

382
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,809
Do they think this is like
haggling at a market?

383
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:32,809
I was so embarrassed.

384
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,139
She asked to pay in installments too.

385
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,339
They're psychos.

386
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,210
I have to get back to work. Bye.

387
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:40,450
Okay, bye.

388
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,430
If you look at the plan,
the size of the playing field...

389
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,399
How about that?

390
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,300
- Yes.
- The cheering section...

391
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,809
The exterior looks a bit exaggerated.

392
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,780
Koreans tend to stick to simple exteriors.

393
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,119
If you're used to that,
this could look exaggerated.

394
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,020
But since this gym is for kids,
rather than a boring facade...

395
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,190
No. I'm not saying
we should keep it boring.

396
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:28,129
It's surrounded by mountains.

397
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,129
Our design should take that into account.

398
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:34,099
Wouldn't this turn the building
into an eyesore?

399
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:37,010
Don't you think
this could get people to notice...

400
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:38,639
the facility even more?

401
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:41,139
It could.

402
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,950
Let's think about it and then regroup.

403
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,619
- Okay.
- Okay.

404
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:00,200
Come to the meeting room.

405
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,530
(Team Leader's Office, Jin Sang Ah)

406
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,710
(Team Leader's Office, Jin Sang Ah)

407
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,760
(Team Leader's Office, Kim So Woo)

408
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,119
Mr. Jeon. Let's...

409
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,859
Where did Mr. Jeon go?

410
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,990
I think he stepped out.

411
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,030
Did he?

412
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,599
I'll be in the reference library.

413
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,940
(Honey-sweet apples,
2 for 5 dollars, 4 for 8 dollars)

414
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:18,639
Okay. I'll take a step back and yield...

415
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:20,740
if that will make him step up.

416
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,450
(Jin Architecture)

417
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:39,190
(Jin Architecture)

418
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,430
Are you very angry...

419
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,399
Jeon Nam Jin will never give in first.

420
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,950
Did you want to scout me
because you enjoyed the thrill?

421
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,250
Yes.

422
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:38,950
I bet Mr. Kim
can never imagine what we're up to.

423
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:40,760
Because he trusts you.

424
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:42,220
He wants to trust you.

425
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,059
My wife would never suspect this.

426
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,829
How well do you think...

427
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:51,300
you know your wife?

428
00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:57,210
Let's read it.

429
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:00,680
What did she say?

430
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,079
(Ji Hyun's mom)

431
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:05,649
Honey. Please accept my apology.

432
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,079
I'm sorry.

433
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:08,649
He read it.

434
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,849
You chewed me out last time.

435
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:11,889
(Ji Hyun's mom)

436
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,990
Did you get my apology and accept it?

437
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,399
Work hard.

438
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:25,030
- Goodness.
- Have a nice day.

439
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:28,669
Your wife's quite a character.

440
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:36,950
Shall we take a look at...

441
00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:46,250
Mr. Kim.
I see Mr. Jeon's not back yet.

442
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,760
He's not.

443
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,059
Shouldn't we host a team dinner
to welcome him?

444
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,359
Yes, I guess?

445
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,430
Let's see when everyone is free.

446
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,530
- How about today?
- Today?

447
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,000
Yes. I'm free as well.

448
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,240
Okay, then.
Ask Mr. Jeon if he's free too.

449
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:07,740
Okay. Shall we invite Ms. Jin?

450
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,210
Yes, but I'll call her.

451
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:11,349
Okay.

452
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
Let's have some fun.

453
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,050
My wife...

454
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:20,790
She's rough around the edges,
but she's sweet.

455
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:23,930
It's true that she sacrificed a lot
to put me through my studies.

456
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,859
Lots of people sacrifice
to feel good about themselves.

457
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,159
Does that make you feel uncomfortable?

458
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:30,829
Even if that were the case,

459
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,639
I feel indebted, which is a strain.

460
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:40,540
Mr. Jeon.

461
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,609
We're planning a welcome dinner.
Are you free today?

462
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,750
A welcome dinner? Today?

463
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,319
You should go.

464
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,990
Sounds good.

465
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:55,619
Bye, then.

466
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,690
Mr. Jeon.

467
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:34,930
She's sweet.

468
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,099
It's true that she sacrificed a lot
to put me through my studies.

469
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,230
Even if that were the case,

470
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,770
I feel indebted, which is a strain.

471
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:51,680
Goodness.

472
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,649
He feels uncomfortable?

473
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,190
I should help him out, then.

474
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,290
(Pi Seon Ju)

475
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,300
- Hello?
- Pi Seon Ju?

476
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,270
It's Sang Ah.
What are you doing today?

477
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
Why?

478
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,210
The line is busy.
Transferring to voicemail.

479
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:31,550
It is a large sum.
We should work things out.

480
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:35,859
Shall we ask your garage
how much the repair will cost?

481
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:37,129
Really?

482
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:40,190
Okay. I'll meet you there.

483
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:43,430
Yes!

(Kim So Woo, Husband)

486
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:04,389
What?

487
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:29,540
There's always a way out.

488
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,720
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

489
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,669
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

490
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,470
I think we might be able to
settle for less.

491
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,440
Let's forget the adjustment.

492
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,069
You asked to see me.

493
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:00,309
I saw your wife.

494
00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:02,240
She was with some guy.

495
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,750
Mr. Kim. How did you meet Ms. Jin?

496
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:08,149
Call your husband. I'll call mine.

497
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:10,149
Where are you? Come over for a bit.

498
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,250
Honey!
