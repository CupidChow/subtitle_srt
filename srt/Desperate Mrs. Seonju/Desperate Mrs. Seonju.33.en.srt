1
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,159
We go to the law firm,

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,560
transfer the money, and sign the form.

3
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:16,560
I can do that on my own.

4
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:20,730
The stress got to me.

5
00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:23,370
I need to go to the toilet.

6
00:00:23,569 --> 00:00:24,569
Okay.

7
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:31,009
My gosh.

8
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:40,549
Darn it.

9
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,860
What are you staring at? Let's go.

10
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,559
Okay.

11
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,000
Jin Ju.

12
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,729
Why should we settle with them?

13
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:57,000
Because it's a matter
unrelated to the affair?

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,939
If we don't settle,
Mi Ju will get locked up,

15
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,509
and the house we almost sold
could get auctioned off...

16
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:08,379
That doesn't mean
we should comply obediently.

17
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,219
Let me make a quick call.

18
00:01:16,589 --> 00:01:18,719
My Nam Jin is a catch too,

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,859
but you're really pretty.

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Guess what?

21
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,630
My Nam Jin was popular with girls
since he was a kid.

22
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:28,669
My gosh.

23
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:30,369
- Was he?
- Yes.

24
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,369
So I thought he'd marry a great woman.

25
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,850
Excuse me.

26
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:46,589
- What?
- You. Let's meet up.

27
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,850
What for?

28
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:51,089
Come to your mom's salon right now.

29
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,960
What for?

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,460
Just do as I say.

31
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,699
Or I'll barge into the cafe you're in.

32
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,400
Seon Ju wants to see me.

33
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,669
- What for?
- Hey.

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,479
Don't go. Who knows what she might do?

35
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:11,410
She'll barge in here if I don't meet her.

36
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:13,680
She must've seen me come in.

37
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,650
Shall I come with you?

38
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,050
No. I'll call if something goes wrong.

39
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:19,819
Excuse me.

40
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,330
Let's go.

41
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,369
Hey. Seon Ju is sickeningly tenacious.

42
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:41,210
She's an expert at making a mess.

43
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,409
She's like a superhero
that appears out of the blue.

44
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:45,409
Goodness.

45
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:50,180
Nam Jin. I like her a great deal.

46
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:51,879
She's a pass.

47
00:02:58,059 --> 00:02:59,789
The person is unable to answer...

48
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:00,960
(I Lost My Memory but I Want Revenge)

49
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,730
The person is unable to answer...

50
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:08,029
Doesn't Woo Sang have to eat? Where is he?

51
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:11,439
I don't know where he is.
Maybe he has plans?

52
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,969
- What the heck?
- Ms. Jin.

53
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,279
Yes. Which way?

54
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:27,990
Turn right?

55
00:03:31,619 --> 00:03:33,529
Where is she going?

56
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,939
"This dreadful love.
This dreadful revenge."

57
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:52,279
"This dreadful love.
This dreadful revenge."

58
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,349
You're here.

59
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,020
Put that down here.

60
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,020
My goodness.

61
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,760
Why do this in a corner
when you have a private waiting room?

62
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,670
It's stir-fried pork.

63
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,900
I love stir-fried pork.

64
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:19,969
Are you that pleased to see this?

65
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,510
Yes. Did you have something to eat?

66
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,510
You should've gotten some.

67
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:33,250
Woo Sang!

68
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,589
Hey.

69
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:40,529
Woo Sang. Are you attracted to her?

70
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,500
What are you on about?

71
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,929
Why else would you do this with her?

72
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:47,130
What am I doing?

73
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,500
You were all I cared about
for over ten years.

74
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,339
You never shared your food with me,

75
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,570
but you're sharing it with her?

76
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:56,739
What?

77
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:59,210
You ignored my calls...

78
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,310
but called her to a quiet corner?

79
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:03,250
It's not what you're thinking.

80
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:07,349
Don't eat this.

81
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,820
- Eat what I got you.
- Hey. You eat that, okay?

82
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:12,690
Let go.

83
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,900
Here we go.

84
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,510
- Do you like it here?
- Yes.

85
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,339
You and I will camp out here for a while.

86
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:30,580
Quack, quack.

87
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:33,849
Shall we start our barbecue too?

88
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,419
Quack, quack!

89
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,049
Let's see.

90
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,089
This is an all-natural bio-organic...

91
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:45,760
face pack that we made ourselves.

92
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,029
The components are all from nature
and it's so good for you.

93
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:53,200
Who were the people I saw last time?

94
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,000
Woo Sang said it was the fraudster family
that caused Chu Ah's car accident.

95
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,810
Yes. It's just rotten luck that we
ended up crossing paths with them.

96
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,409
You seemed to know each other.

97
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:05,580
Well...

98
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:08,779
I briefly lived in
the same neighborhood as their mom.

99
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:11,520
We met again after the recent accident,

100
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,820
and they acted so rudely, as you saw.

101
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:18,390
I hope you weren't too startled that day.

102
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:22,289
The woman talked about
taking someone in and being betrayed.

103
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,000
I thought she'd done you a favor...

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,570
only for you to completely ignore her.

105
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:29,570
It's not that at all.

106
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:33,169
They made up a lot of stories.

107
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,640
You know how some people...

108
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,510
imagine something preposterous
only to mistake that for reality.

109
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,210
What's that called?

110
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,950
- "Delusional?"
- Yes.

111
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,120
That's what they are like.

112
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,020
Please don't get the wrong idea.

113
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,320
So, how about Woo Sang's dating life?

114
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,229
What kind of woman does he like?

115
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:56,429
He must love pretty girls.

116
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,099
That's a given. What about the background?

117
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,370
Her background? Anyone but a family
like the fraudster one I saw that day.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,609
They were all so violent.

119
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,609
Weren't they?

120
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,979
How do you like my Chu Ah?

121
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,580
They're pretty good friends,
and they seem to get along.

122
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:20,849
Woo Sang said he wanted to
focus on work for now.

123
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,219
He'll try dating much later.

124
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,830
But he's not getting any younger.

125
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,929
People these days
work just fine even after they marry.

126
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,669
It must be so reassuring and delightful...

127
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,799
to have a son like Woo Sang.

128
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:43,810
Well, I guess Chu Ah isn't a bad match.

129
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,039
Right?

130
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,820
Halt.

131
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:57,520
- You'll call the police?
- What? Yes.

132
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,460
I have an appointment today.

133
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:03,599
It's true.

134
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,029
I agreed to meet Jin Sang Ah here.

135
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,140
It's true, I said.

136
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,270
I made an appointment.

137
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,710
My gosh. What's going on?

138
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,779
I'm sure it's nothing at all.

139
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,479
Here is a pair of headphones.

140
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,320
Stay right here. Don't you move.

141
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:27,520
Wrinkles will form if you move
while you have a pack on.

142
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,719
Hey, wait.

143
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:32,489
Why are you back here?

144
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:34,789
(Grace Shim)

145
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,260
Why did you call me?

146
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,830
Hello, Jin Sang Ah. You're here.

147
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,929
- Go and call the police.
- Okay.

148
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,270
I came to pay you to settle.

149
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,770
- Why do you need the police?
- What?

150
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,010
Jin Ju. Let's pay up.

151
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:51,779
What?

152
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:52,809
What's this?

153
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,449
Here you go!

154
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:00,120
You lunatics.

155
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,760
- Here's your money!
- It's the settlement!

156
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,789
- What is all this?
- What are you doing?

157
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,900
It's not illegal
to pay the settlement in cash!

158
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,199
Call the police if you want.

159
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,230
Do you know your older daughter...

160
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,740
is having an affair with her husband?

161
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:18,240
What...

162
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:20,439
You're married to Mr. Jeon the manager?

163
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,010
Yes. Just you wait.
We'll serve you with a lawsuit too.

164
00:09:25,409 --> 00:09:28,949
What's wrong with you?
Why would you seduce a married man?

165
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:31,150
My goodness.

166
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,020
Sorry.

167
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:36,689
Hello?

168
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:39,120
- Oh, dear.
- We need help. Get over here!

169
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,630
Oh, no!

170
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:43,059
Hey, you!

171
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,470
Mom, walk yourself home.
And pay for the coffee.

172
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:49,939
Hey! Nam Jin!

173
00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:52,240
Darn that punk.

174
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,909
Let's not waste a drop.

175
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:59,110
You need to teach your daughter better.

176
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,980
Don't let her steal
other women's husbands!

177
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,650
- You!
- Me what?

178
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,850
It's not like she stole property!

179
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:08,049
No one has ownership over anyone else!

180
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:09,490
What did you say?

181
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,590
What the heck is going on?

182
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:15,529
Sang Ah... My gosh. She had an affair?

183
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,630
Oh, my goodness.

184
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,429
Can someone take this off?

185
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,400
Is anyone there?

186
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,840
A marriage license means...

187
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,079
a marriage is legally binding,
but it doesn't mean ownership.

188
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,720
Do you think that license
is the same as a house deed?

189
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,289
Oh, it's so good to see your true colors.

190
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,189
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

191
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:48,360
Do you know what it means to be ashamed?

192
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,630
Ladies. Let me explain
exactly what happened.

193
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,169
What are you doing?

194
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,699
Oh, you're here too?

195
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,679
Okay, so these two had an affair.

196
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,679
- Will you stop it?
- It's fine.

197
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,449
Let her say what she wants.

198
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,819
Have you heard of
"defamation based on facts?"

199
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,449
It looks like you scraped together
the money to settle.

200
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:15,750
Do what you want
if you want another lawsuit!

201
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,360
Fine. If there's going to be another suit,
let's get the facts straight.

202
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:23,730
Let me tell you their names.

203
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,760
- Stop it.
- Why should I?

204
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,500
You even introduced her to your mother.

205
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,740
Are you planning a wedding
when our divorce isn't yet final?

206
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,840
My gosh. I was going to
do this in your office,

207
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,409
but I didn't want Ji Hyun to
feel bad about her jobless, homeless dad.

208
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,250
Darn it.

209
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,520
I held back for our daughter's sake!

210
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,350
You uneducated...

211
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,850
Yes. I hope your well-educated
witch of a daughter...

212
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,459
and this well-educated fool
live happily with you forever.

213
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:57,230
Here's your 150,000 dollars.

214
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,400
It's the exact amount.
Gather and count the bills.

215
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:04,340
Your cameras will have caught us
delivering the cash.

216
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:07,409
Don't you dare say we didn't pay you.

217
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,240
You're all witnesses!

218
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,480
- Let's go, sister.
- Okay.

219
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,449
- Leave!
- We will.

220
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,720
You. Don't film us.

221
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,289
Why would you film this?

222
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,789
- I didn't film you.
- Do you think this is fun?

223
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,829
Why did you just stand there?

224
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,679
What kind of facial takes this long?

225
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:50,079
I need to be out there watching.

226
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,650
Goodness.

227
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:54,590
I'm so curious.

228
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,059
Nothing beats watching a fight.

229
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:59,319
I need to take this off first.

230
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,189
(Grace Shim Beauty Studio)

231
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,110
Did you...

232
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:22,049
Did you see her eyes
bulge out of her head?

233
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,449
I saw that. The evil bunch.

234
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,990
Jin Sang Ah looked pretty annoyed.

235
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,520
This is how good Mom feels
when she vents the way she does.

236
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,130
Should we have brought coins
and thrown them at their faces instead?

237
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,860
I need to go to the realtor
to find a house. Let's go.

238
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:42,730
You go to the real estate agent.

239
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,000
I'll go home to pack some stuff.

240
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,970
Okay. Let's go.

241
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,380
They're weirdos, so don't believe them.

242
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,949
Promise not to post about this.

243
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,689
- Please don't.
- Okay.

244
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,429
I called you to come and see
what your ex-wife was doing.

245
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,529
Mom. We have to get back to work.

246
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
Okay.

247
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,069
I apologize.

248
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:16,470
Let's go.

249
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:21,409
Oh, dear. Is it over?

250
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:24,439
My gosh. What's all this?

251
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:27,380
It would be nice...

252
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:31,380
if I could stay
and help you pick up the bills.

253
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:32,819
But I have plans.

254
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,490
It's fine. You can go.

255
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,659
Okay, then.

256
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,429
Oh, my gosh.

257
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,270
Come in and gather the bills!

258
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,370
- Okay.
- Okay.

259
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,549
Be sure to get every single one.

260
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:03,579
Okay.

261
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,449
Mom. I can't stand Pi Mi Ju.

262
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,020
She even got Woo Sang's number.

263
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
What's this?

264
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,990
The money for the settlement.

265
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:18,100
The settlement? They made this mess?

266
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,529
Stop talking and pick up the bills!

267
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,779
Come on.

268
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,659
Oh, dear.

269
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,760
I think it's time to bring up
the downstairs salon.

270
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:01,209
Hello. You just bought our house.

271
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
Could we...

272
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:07,809
The contract.

273
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,350
Let's see.

274
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,689
His number is...

275
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,829
Okay.

276
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,760
Message sent.

277
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:29,069
- Jin Ju.
- Yes?

278
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:31,870
Come and help me with the parcel.

279
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,270
- Hurry.
- Okay.

280
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,779
The charcoal might take a while to light.

281
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:49,949
Tae Ri. Shall I show you something fun?

282
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,360
Ta-da. Look carefully.

283
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,400
- My gosh.
- There.

284
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,829
Bang, bang. I am RoboCop.

285
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:05,340
- Squeak, clang.
- I'm a villain.

286
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,870
Squeak, clang.

287
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,510
Isn't it fun?

288
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:13,010
Squeak, clang.

289
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:17,380
- Squeak, clang.
- Squeak, clang.

290
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,290
Are you having fun?

291
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,519
(New message)

292
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,189
No, wait.

293
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,900
Seon Ju. It was a long, tiring walk up,

294
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,530
but I promise
we'll move into a high-rise...

295
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,969
with a fast elevator
and look down on everything.

296
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,209
I'm scared of heights.

297
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,340
I'm not a fan of high-rises.

298
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,140
Then let's build
a cozy and pretty house you'd like.

299
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,009
Like this?

300
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:46,759
(Darling husband)

301
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:49,530
(Jeon Nam)

302
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:57,280
(Ex-husband)

303
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:02,509
(Ex-husband)

304
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:04,519
There are...

305
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:08,189
no family photos at all.

306
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,019
Anyone would think he was single.

307
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:56,400
(Gwangseong)

308
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:09,650
It looks cooked. Shall we taste it?

309
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,679
Yes.

310
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,679
Open wide.

311
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:17,090
- How is it? Is it good?
- Yes.

312
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:18,590
I'll have a piece too.

313
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,530
It's really tasty.

314
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,429
Tae Ri.

315
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,739
When we move into that house,
shall we build a fireplace like this?

316
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,400
And camp out every night?

317
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:36,769
What color do you want your room to be?

318
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,780
A pretty color.

319
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,479
A pretty color? That sounds nice.

320
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,080
It's so tasty.

321
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:53,929
Hello. You just bought our house.

322
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:56,830
I'd like to ask for a favor.

323
00:21:56,959 --> 00:22:01,429
We'd like to keep the hair salon
and pay you a monthly rent.

324
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,130
Can we do that?

325
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,769
Think about it and get back to me.

326
00:22:09,509 --> 00:22:10,739
Just a moment, Tae Ri.

327
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,219
My gosh.

328
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,350
Oh, my gosh.

329
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,860
She left her phone here?

330
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:32,800
Hello?

331
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,229
I just read the text.

332
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:37,030
I don't think I can do that.

333
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,199
Can't do what?

334
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:40,540
Didn't you just sell a house?

335
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,080
Yes, we did.
What are you saying you can't do?

336
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,110
Oh, this is my older sister's phone,

337
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:49,179
and I don't know what's going on.

338
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:51,050
What can't you do?

339
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,350
Your sister texted me to say...

340
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:56,390
she wanted to keep the downstairs salon.

341
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:58,790
We can't do that? Why not?

342
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,860
What?

343
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,459
Didn't you agree to vacate the salon too?

344
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,659
I'm pretty sure
it says so on the contract.

345
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:07,060
- Does it?
- Yes.

346
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,699
- Bye, then.
- Wait.

347
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
What?

348
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:13,600
Did you really put that in the contract?

349
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:14,870
See for yourself.

350
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:17,540
You owned both the house and the salon.

351
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,310
I was told
you could vacate both no problem.

352
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:21,509
Really?

353
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,509
Don't do this now.

354
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:29,219
My mom had that hair salon for decades.

355
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,689
She loves the place.

356
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,659
Can't you let her keep the business?

357
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:37,130
I put down a large down payment.

358
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:40,400
I think I was considerate enough
on my part.

359
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,999
What will you do there?

360
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:45,169
Will you rent it out to someone?
For how much?

361
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:46,540
We'll pay the rent.

362
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:48,009
That's not the plan.

363
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,409
I bought the house
because I needed that space.

364
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:52,179
Sorry. Bye.

365
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,979
Hello? Sir.

366
00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:02,519
Jin Ju said she'd handle it.

367
00:24:03,219 --> 00:24:04,620
What is this mess?

368
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:07,530
What is it? Is something wrong?

369
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:09,590
No, it's nothing.

370
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,860
I told Jin Ju to find a place.
Why hasn't she said anything?

371
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:16,830
I need to live nearby
if I'm to walk to work here.

372
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:19,669
Give Jin Ju a call.

373
00:24:19,699 --> 00:24:22,469
This is her phone. She left it here.

374
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:24,810
The scatterbrain.

375
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,140
Darn it.

376
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,080
Goodness.

377
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,689
If they'd leased that apartment,
they should've taken down the post.

378
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,659
Should I report them
for false advertising?

379
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,030
He's taking a short break
for personal reasons.

380
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,300
He hasn't resigned.

381
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,300
Is that so? That's a relief.

382
00:25:04,749 --> 00:25:05,749
Let's go inside.

383
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:09,949
Here.

384
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,320
Shall we get to work?

385
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,459
(Head of Interior, Jin Sang Ah)

386
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:30,110
(Jin Sang Ah)

387
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,380
Tae Ri. I need to take this call.

388
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,519
Hi.

389
00:25:47,459 --> 00:25:49,390
- Where are you?
- Why?

390
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,459
Come and explain everything to my dad.

391
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:53,900
- Explain what?
- You asked for a divorce.

392
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,229
Tell my dad you called it quits.

393
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:57,699
You tell him that.

394
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:00,640
You're so irresponsible.

395
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:03,469
If you made up your mind,
convince the others.

396
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,009
Say we're splitting up because of Tae Ri.

397
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,380
Say raising him was too much.

398
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,380
What?

399
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,290
You resigned. It doesn't matter
what you say the reason is.

400
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:20,120
You can sort it out
without getting me in trouble.

401
00:26:20,689 --> 00:26:21,890
That's nonsense.

402
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,959
Why didn't you fill in the divorce papers?

403
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:26,959
You don't want to be with me anymore.

404
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:31,499
Don't call unless it's to say
you signed the papers.

405
00:26:33,769 --> 00:26:34,810
Hello?

406
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:38,310
Darn it.

407
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,219
What is this?

408
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,050
Jin Sang Ah.

409
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,189
I found this on an anonymous forum
for office workers.

410
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:53,759
Is this you?

411
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,060
(Lee Jin Woo)

412
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:10,340
So Woo.
This looks like your wife. Is it her?

413
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,909
Okay, so these two had an affair.

414
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:16,949
Will you stop it?

415
00:27:16,949 --> 00:27:19,519
It's fine. Let her say what she wants.

416
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:23,019
Have you heard of
"defamation based on facts?"

417
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,659
If there's going to be another suit,
let's get the facts straight.

418
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,659
Let me tell you their names.

419
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:36,669
You lunatics.

420
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:40,140
- Here's your money!
- It's the settlement!

421
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,709
- What is all this?
- What are you doing?

422
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:44,709
- What's this?
- It's not illegal...

423
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:46,340
- to pay the settlement in cash!
- It's me.

424
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:47,749
Hey, you!

425
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,880
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

426
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,870
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

427
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:10,300
I'm serious about Ms. Jin.

428
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,300
I don't like it.

429
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,640
I'm disgusted by the thought
of being involved with them.

430
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,939
The Manjang-dong residents got a windfall.

431
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,340
Are we done for?

432
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:20,310
Hey! All of you, get over here now!

433
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,810
Get them both on their knees.

434
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,550
Why are you so negative, Dad?

435
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,080
Are you Mr. Kim So Woo?

436
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,650
Can we meet for a chat?

437
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,360
