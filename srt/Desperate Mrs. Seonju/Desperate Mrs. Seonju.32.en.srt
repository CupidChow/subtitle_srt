00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:13,759
(Episode 32)

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,030
You can sleep here.

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,960
I'll sleep in Jin Ju's room.

4
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,490
Cheers.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,299
Do you like your company dorm?

6
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,570
- Yes.
- Why?

7
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,969
Because you can see that girl?

8
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,399
You seriously fell for her.

9
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,770
I guess I was...

10
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,710
under a lot of stress.

11
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,409
Hey, that goes for me too.

12
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,509
But...

13
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:06,509
I see the end now.

14
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,450
Do you know...

15
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,079
how I felt and thought
about my life so far?

16
00:01:12,849 --> 00:01:13,890
What do you mean?

17
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:16,989
After Father went bankrupt,

18
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,689
all my rich friends left me.

19
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,930
No. It wasn't them.

20
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,569
I left.

21
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:28,569
Right. All my well-off friends left me.

22
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:30,969
You should've stayed close
to the friends I made you.

23
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,870
I think...

24
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,439
that stayed in my subconscious.

25
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,950
The yearning to become successful
and prove myself.

26
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,180
But...

27
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:46,049
there's a limit to that.

28
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,959
Studying in the US was a harsh reminder.

29
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:54,129
This year,
your fortune improves massively.

30
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,030
A fortune teller I went to said so.

31
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:57,400
Really?

32
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,670
Actually,
things are going exactly how I want...

33
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,040
and I even feel afraid.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Are things going that well?

35
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,409
Then buy me a 10,000-dollar membership
at Grace Shim's salon.

36
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:10,609
Don't do that, Mom.

37
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:11,680
Darn it.

38
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,780
Then introduce me to the girl soon.

39
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,620
We're busy right now.
I'll introduce her when things are sorted.

40
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,949
I might die waiting
if my lifespan were any shorter.

41
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,060
Why don't you order another drink?

42
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,389
- Can I?
- Yes.

43
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,389
Excuse me.

44
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,289
You know where they are, don't you?

45
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,860
Tell me right now.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,860
I'll call Nam Jin if you don't.

47
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,080
(Mother-in-law)

48
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,180
(Mother-in-law)

49
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:56,860
(Seon Ju's mom)

50
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,099
How much is the bill?

51
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,439
They won't pick up?

52
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,280
Lead the way.

53
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,879
Get up.

54
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,780
Do you want me to wake Seon Ju
to take me there?

55
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,080
Come with me!

56
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:32,930
Yes. It's okay to pick a fight over this.

57
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:34,430
Get out here!

58
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,169
- Are you going somewhere, Mom?
- I'm going out for a bit.

59
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:42,969
I'll pull out all their darn hair.

60
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,919
You're still up, Dong Won?

61
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:01,319
Is your mom in bed?

62
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,560
Mom and Grandma went somewhere.

63
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:04,990
Together? Where did they go?

64
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,860
She said she'd pull out someone's hair.

65
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:07,889
What?

66
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:13,569
I need to go out too.

67
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,699
Okay.

68
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,279
Is this where they're staying?

69
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,290
Yes.

70
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,060
I'll rip that witch to shreds...

71
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,329
and break Nam Jin's legs
just to get him back.

72
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:41,290
Don't be too surprised
when you see who she is.

73
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,660
- Do you know who she is?
- No!

74
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:45,730
- Lead the way.
- It's this way.

75
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,069
Which unit is it?

76
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:52,339
It's this one.

77
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,180
Who is it?

78
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,480
Is this it?

79
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,720
Nam Jin, it's me. Open the door.

80
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,689
Nam Jin. Let's talk!

81
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,689
Will you open the door?

82
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,399
Nam Jin, let's talk! Let us in!

83
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,069
You can't make such a racket here
at this time of evening.

84
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:26,910
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,339
My son-in-law lives here,
and I think he's having an affair.

86
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,149
I'll teach them both a harsh lesson.

87
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,779
I swear he and that wench will...

88
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,319
Oh, goodness.

89
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:42,620
Who's the witch?

90
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:44,860
Where is she hiding?

91
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,529
Is she in here?

92
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,110
What's this?

93
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,009
What is this?

94
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,819
While you were abroad studying,

95
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,990
do you know what Seon Ju went through...

96
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,389
to support you and raise your kid?

97
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,199
I'm sick and tired of hearing that.

98
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,269
What?

99
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:29,069
You can't do this if you're human.

100
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,699
Don't you care about Ji Hyun?

101
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,709
Seon Ju and I talked everything out.

102
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:36,310
It's none of your business.

103
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,579
I have the right to butt in.

104
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:42,209
Back in the day, the mother-in-law decided
when the newlyweds slept together.

105
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:45,379
Parents had the right to get involved
in their children's sex life.

106
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:46,920
That was how things worked,

107
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:49,990
so why can't a mom
try to prevent her daughter's divorce?

108
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,060
What the...

109
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,089
What are you talking about?

110
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,389
Who is she?

111
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:58,529
Tell the witch you're seeing
that I want to meet her.

112
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,029
Who did you lose your mind over...

113
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,500
that you don't care about
your wife or child anymore?

114
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,470
Can you watch your language?

115
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,850
Are you upset with me about something?

116
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,490
If you are, talk to me about it.

117
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,819
Darn it.

118
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,600
What are you doing here, Mom?

119
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,300
I'm here to get my son-in-law back.

120
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,540
You might have given up, but I haven't.

121
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,509
You're doing this
because of me, aren't you?

122
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,009
You still have feelings for Seon Ju,
don't you?

123
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,750
Don't do this, Mom. Let's go home.

124
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,720
Yes. Take her home.

125
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:55,389
What did I tell you?

126
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,319
I told you to keep a tight rein on him.

127
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,329
You're partially responsible
for sending him money so he could cheat!

128
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,300
Nam Jin. Don't do this.

129
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,470
If you're angry or upset, say so.

130
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,769
I'll apologize if I must
and change what I can.

131
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,410
Stop it, Mom.

132
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:18,740
This won't change anything.
He won't come back.

133
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,980
I know a divorce isn't finalized
as soon as you submit the papers.

134
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,490
So say it was a one-off mistake and beg.

135
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:29,319
I'll convince Seon Ju to stay with you.

136
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,290
Take her home.

137
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:32,930
This is just sad and ugly.

138
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,259
What did you say?

139
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,330
You never liked me.

140
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,299
You compared me with other sons-in-law...

141
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,240
and said nasty things
that scarred me for life.

142
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,340
Then you laughed about it
saying you meant well.

143
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,909
You called them jokes.

144
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,750
Everything you said was offensive!

145
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:59,019
I'm sick of all the Pi women.
I want to cut ties with you!

146
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,730
Since you hit me, I'll say one more thing.

147
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:12,460
I just hate how tough and vulgar you are.

148
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,899
Your daughters are becoming like you.

149
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,139
I believe your personality
is affecting your daughters' lives!

150
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,470
Jeon Nam Jin!

151
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,580
Do you think I don't have a list of things
I want to say to your mom?

152
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,809
Shall I go down it?

153
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,409
Don't you say another word.

154
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,519
Seon Ju.

155
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,289
I'm glad you split up.

156
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:36,120
I thought he was a human being...

157
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,460
and came over hoping you'd reconcile.

158
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,590
So what if he got another degree?

159
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,960
I'm the strongest backer
of your divorce now.

160
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,230
- Mom.
- If you want to get back with him,

161
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,070
I'll jump in to keep you apart.

162
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Don't you dare think of
getting back together.

163
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,669
Okay?

164
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,149
Nam Jin.

165
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,950
You know,

166
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,519
if my husband cheated on me,

167
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:16,700
I'd feel too ashamed to put up a fight.

168
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,159
I'd just kill him.

169
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,169
Seon Ju is groveling and fighting.

170
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,740
That's how sweet she is.

171
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,049
I don't know if I'm sweet
or being an idiotic pushover.

172
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,820
I don't care what you say.

173
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,919
But you should learn to feel ashamed.

174
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,340
Darn it!

175
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:37,980
Do what Dad is doing.
Keep the marshmallows spinning.

176
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,779
- Okay.
- Yes. That's it.

177
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,080
- Tae Ri, it's done.
- Okay.

178
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,389
- Shall we taste it?
- Yes.

179
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:47,690
Open wide.

180
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,889
- How does it taste?
- It's good.

181
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:53,960
- Is it good?
- Yes.

182
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,230
Dad will have one too.

183
00:11:58,529 --> 00:11:59,600
- It's nice.
- Yes.

184
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:34,299
Pack your things
and move in with us tomorrow.

185
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,840
Jin Ju and Mi Ju can share a room.

186
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,210
You and Ji Hyun can take Mi Ju's room.

187
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,710
- Mom.
- Sell all the large furniture.

188
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,779
We need to move out soon too.

189
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,679
There's a lot of us, and it's better
if we have less luggage.

190
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,190
You must feel lost and alone.

191
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,049
It's better to be closer to family.

192
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,429
Keep your chin up.
You're not in the wrong.

193
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,190
You're not a fool.

194
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:05,730
Not anyone can be
as supportive and doting as you.

195
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:09,029
You did well.

196
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:13,370
You gave him everything you had.
Now it's time to fill yourself back up.

197
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,940
Don't feel bad or guilty toward me.

198
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:18,440
Calm down, try to relax,

199
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:20,450
and look after yourself.

200
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:24,850
Oh, dear.

201
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,750
Jin Ju. Take Seon Ju...

202
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,759
to hand over the settlement
and start looking for our new place.

203
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,889
Okay.

204
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,830
Did the deal go smoothly?

205
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,240
We took care of all that.

206
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,970
You don't have to worry.

207
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:50,179
Goodness.

208
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,210
- Mom.
- Yes?

209
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,950
Mom. I love you.

210
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,750
You can have this.

211
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,259
You don't have much money.

212
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:41,059
Mom. Thank you.

213
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,759
Eat this and cheer up.

214
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,340
You said moms cheered up
and became stronger...

215
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,940
when kids said
they loved you and were grateful.

216
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:58,679
I'll stay strong too.

217
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,309
- I hope you...
- Hey.

218
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:05,879
I should look after you.
Why are you worrying about me?

219
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,720
Mom. Don't cry.

220
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,620
Don't worry about me.
You know what I'm like.

221
00:15:12,889 --> 00:15:17,429
I'll jump right back up
and live and work hard.

222
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:19,929
Will you give me a hug?

223
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:26,809
I'm...

224
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,309
so sorry about everything.

225
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,710
Why would you apologize
when you did nothing wrong?

226
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,820
Aren't you sad at all
that Mom and Dad split up?

227
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,690
I'm not sad.

228
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,789
Are you sad?

229
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,289
I know how much you love Grandma...

230
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:50,860
and that you feel sad
because you let her down.

231
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:54,870
I love you lots too.

232
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,539
You said you were sorry that you were...

233
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:02,710
a loser of a daughter,

234
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,409
but to me, you're a great mom,
and I'm proud of you.

235
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,879
So don't be sad, Mom.

236
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:14,990
I'm not sad.

237
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,620
I'm fine as long as I have you.

238
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,659
I won't be sad at all if I have you.

239
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:29,669
Thanks so much for loving me.

240
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,240
I love you, Ji Hyun.

241
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,279
Thanks, darling.

242
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,460
If you can't get So Woo to come back,

243
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,889
not only will you not get promoted,
but I'll empty your office!

244
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,460
So Woo. Do you want to be
an architect when you grow up?

245
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:26,460
- Yes.
- What kind of house will you build?

246
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,859
I want to build a beautiful house.

247
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,500
(Jin Sang Ah)

248
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,250
The person is unable to answer...

249
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,680
He won't pick up?

250
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:54,190
Is this what you'll do?

251
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,059
(Jin Architecture)

252
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,089
My goodness.

253
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,559
It looks lovely.

254
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,799
Where are you headed?

255
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,470
The daughter of the CEO here...

256
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,470
No.

257
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:17,480
Is there a Jeon Nam Jin here?

258
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,079
Mom.

259
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,750
Nam Jin.

260
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,950
My word. This is some company.

261
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:31,089
I got so curious I thought
I'd get sick if I waited any longer.

262
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,730
Can't I take a slight peek...

263
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:36,430
when she comes to work?

264
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,460
You can't. Go home.

265
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,369
I'll keep coming by
if you don't introduce her to me.

266
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,539
Let me see her just once,
and I won't come back.

267
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:50,380
I'll ask Sang Ah.

268
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,480
My gosh. She even has a fancy name.

269
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,650
Mom, I'll say this again.

270
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,779
You can't thank her
for buying you the apartment.

271
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,859
And one more thing.
She thinks we're well-off.

272
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,890
Okay. I'll be careful. Don't worry.

273
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:11,529
Don't I look like a rich housewife today?

274
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:15,130
Sit back down, Mom.

275
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,869
- Okay, fine.
- Sit down.

276
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,970
Did Mr. Kim actually quit?

277
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:21,640
I wonder too.

278
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,480
What do you think is going on?

279
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:26,809
He wrapped everything up well,
so we can manage for now,

280
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:29,980
but I feel oddly emotional
knowing he's gone.

281
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,420
Good morning.

282
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,950
- Hello.
- Morning.

283
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,619
Why do you think Mr. Kim resigned?

284
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,059
I wouldn't know.

285
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,460
He wouldn't quit unless it was important.

286
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:46,599
There's talk it's because
he drifted apart with Ms. Jin.

287
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,630
Could that be true?

288
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,339
What are you talking about?

289
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:52,140
It's nothing.

290
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,140
Which company are we meeting today?

291
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,410
Oh, it's that place. You know.

292
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,940
Right. That place.

293
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,750
We need to talk.

294
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,069
Don't you think something is up with them?

295
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,769
- Who?
- Mr. Jeon and Ms. Jin.

296
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,839
They always leave one after the other.

297
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,539
I didn't care because I was told
they knew each other before he joined.

298
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,440
No one...

299
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,250
would be stupid enough
to cheat in the open.

300
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:36,819
No?

301
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,119
My mom came to the office.

302
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:47,230
Your mother? What for?

303
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,700
She's curious and wants to meet you.

304
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:55,200
She'll keep visiting until she meets you,
so I sent her to a nearby cafe.

305
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,769
Weren't you the careful type?

306
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:01,369
We need to be careful if this is to work.

307
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:04,539
Let's say hi briefly.

308
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,519
The schedule is too tight!
I don't get a break!

309
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,920
I could end up with gout.

310
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,690
You've managed just fine so far.

311
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,759
Hello. How are you?

312
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:20,190
Pi Mi Ju.
People liked what they saw yesterday.

313
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:22,859
See? I said it would work out.

314
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:24,529
Thank you.

315
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:26,559
Don't thank me. Think of me.

316
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:33,470
Since you're here,
can you put the ladder in the corner?

317
00:21:33,609 --> 00:21:34,640
Sure.

318
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:38,740
Thank me? Think of me? Darn it.

319
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,779
Here we go.

320
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,029
Oh, no.

321
00:21:58,759 --> 00:21:59,799
Darn it.

322
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,440
Gosh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

323
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:06,599
Shoot.

324
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:10,039
- Darn.
- Oh, dear.

325
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:11,809
Why are you so clumsy?

326
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:13,309
Darn it.

327
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:17,849
How was I to know
someone would be lying here?

328
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,289
What were you doing here?

329
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:22,750
I was here memorizing my lines.

330
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,089
Why would you do that out here
when you have your own waiting room?

331
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,460
I can't concentrate there
because Chu Ah always barges in.

332
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,700
Darn it.

333
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,670
Shoot.

334
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:39,000
Does it hurt a lot? Where? Here?

335
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:40,970
Shall we go to the doctor's office?

336
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,009
No.

337
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:45,210
You look worse. Right here.

338
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:52,180
It's fine. My skin recovers in no time.

339
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:53,490
It'll be gone tomorrow.

340
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,789
Do you know
what's most important to an actor?

341
00:22:57,819 --> 00:22:58,859
Passion?

342
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:01,029
Health. That's most important.

343
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:02,359
You need to be more careful.

344
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,460
You let her treat you like a punching bag.

345
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,900
It could end your career.

346
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,369
Is this you showing concern for me?

347
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,299
It sounds like teasing.

348
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,740
Is it a criticism?

349
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,809
It's advice, and it's great advice too.

350
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:19,109
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

351
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,279
That's it. I like the attitude.

352
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:23,779
Woo Sang. Where are you?

353
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:26,680
Did anyone see Woo Sang?

354
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,359
I swear I saw him arrive.

355
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,200
What's going on?

356
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:42,670
Be quiet.

357
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:45,670
What are you doing here?

358
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,240
Where's Woo Sang?
Why won't he come to his waiting room?

359
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,339
He wants to be left alone
so he can memorize his lines.

360
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:52,779
Shall we go?

361
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,250
He must be here somewhere.

362
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,049
Did you have something to eat?

363
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,950
Shall we get something?

364
00:23:58,049 --> 00:23:59,150
You and me?

365
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,759
Hey. Is she gone?

366
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:11,930
She's gone.

367
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,869
Will you get away from me, then?

368
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:21,440
You want me to move away
when you pushed me in with you?

369
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,210
- Darn it.
- Oh, no.

370
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,819
Can you get me another shirt
from Wardrobe?

371
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,480
Okay. I got it.

372
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:34,920
Wait.

373
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:38,990
- Give me your number.
- What for?

374
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,460
I'll call when I need something
when I'm hiding from Chu Ah.

375
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:43,630
Me?

376
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,559
Five dollars per errand?

377
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:51,269
Ten dollars. Deal?

378
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,000
Deal.

379
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,940
I'll get you a clean shirt.

380
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,319
We go to the law firm,

381
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:11,619
transfer the money, and sign the form.

382
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:13,259
I can do that on my own.

383
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:18,529
How can I trust you to handle that
when you handed your husband away?

384
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:22,299
The stress got to me.

385
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,039
I need to go to the toilet.

386
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Okay.

387
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,609
- My gosh.
- Mom.

388
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,150
Darn it.

389
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:53,200
Let's order first. What would you like?

390
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,470
- Coffee?
- Coffee?

391
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:56,630
Coffee?

392
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,200
Are you introducing Sang Ah
to your mother?

393
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,279
Mother. Are you here
to meet this witch officially?

394
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:09,109
My goodness.

395
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,920
You really are tailing me.

396
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,490
When will you stop doing this?

397
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:16,920
- Come with me.
- No!

398
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:19,490
What are you doing?

399
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,589
- My goodness.
- Have you lost your mind?

400
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,789
What?

401
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:26,230
How dare you?

402
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,210
What are you staring at? Let's go.

403
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:36,970
Okay.

404
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:39,339
Jin Ju.

405
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,250
Why should we settle with them?

406
00:26:43,579 --> 00:26:46,420
Because it's a matter
unrelated to the affair?

407
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,420
If we don't settle,
Mi Ju will get locked up,

408
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:53,789
and the house we almost sold
could get auctioned off...

409
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:57,730
That doesn't mean
we should comply obediently.

410
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,700
Hello?

411
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,039
Is this the lawyer?

412
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:12,779
Yes. Instead of meeting you at the office,

413
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,480
we'll settle the matter ourselves.

414
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,619
Yes. I'll do that right now. Don't worry.

415
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,829
I don't need free treatment.

416
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:32,599
You could put it on my account.

417
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,299
I feel so guilty.

418
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:37,700
I didn't get to greet you last time
because there was a huge ruckus.

419
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,200
I felt terrible.

420
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,640
Goodness.

421
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,309
Thank you.

422
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,089
Jin Ju. Don't get too carried away...

423
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:57,289
and break another law.

424
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,220
Be smart, okay?

425
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:01,430
Be careful, and you shouldn't kick anyone.

(Grace Shim Beauty Studio)

427
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,809
Why are you back here?

428
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:23,710
Why did you call me?

429
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:27,289
Hello, Jin Sang Ah. You're here.

430
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,319
- Go and call the police.
- Okay.

431
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:33,420
I came to pay you to settle.
Why do you need the police?

432
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,160
- What?
- Jin Ju. Let's pay up.

433
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,000
What?

434
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,029
What's this?

436

(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

437
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,660
Come and explain everything to my dad.

438
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,759
Say we're splitting up...

439
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,390
- because of Tae Ri.
- What?

440
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,799
We'd like to keep the hair salon
and pay you a monthly rent.

441
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,730
I don't think I can do that.

442
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,730
How so?

443
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,200
Jin Ju said she'd handle it.

444
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,240
Do you know your older daughter
is having an affair with her husband?

445
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:22,269
No one has ownership over anyone else!

446
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:23,539
What did you say?

447
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:27,779
