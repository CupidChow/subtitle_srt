00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,660
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,269
Hello?

3
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,330
Pi Seon Ju?

4
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:23,039
It's Sang Ah. What are you doing today?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,039
Why?

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,079
The line is busy.
Transferring to voicemail.

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,320
It is a large sum.
We should work things out.

8
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,620
Shall we ask your garage
how much the repair will cost?

9
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,920
Really?

10
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:45,020
Okay. I'll meet you there.

11
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:48,460
Yes!

12
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,109
(Kim So Woo, Husband)

13
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:09,149
What?

14
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,760
Mr. Kim.

15
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,590
Mr. Jin asked for you.

16
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,329
- Did he?
- Be quick.

17
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:22,359
Okay.

18
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:26,200
Hey. Are you free this evening?

19
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,200
- Mr. Jeon's...
- His welcome dinner?

20
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:30,040
Yes. Who told you?

21
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,670
I heard from Yoo Nan Hee.

22
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,310
Nan Hee?

23
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:35,439
I can't go. I have plans.

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,819
This is unexpected.

25
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:44,780
I thought she'd ignore us completely.

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,250
The brat can still be nice.

27
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:50,719
Jjang Gu.

28
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,159
Call Mom.

29
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,230
(Mom)

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,459
Mom.

31
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:02,069
I think we might be able to
settle for less.

32
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Really? What did I say?

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,400
I told you so.

34
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:08,840
I took in her mom and looked after her.

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,040
Yes. Thank her when you see her.

36
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,280
Bye.

37
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:16,379
They'll settle for less?

38
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,520
Yes. Soon Ae's older daughter called
and asked to meet Seon Ju.

39
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,360
I knew it.

40
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,490
What a relief.

41
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,930
Yes. What goes around comes around.
Do good and good will happen.

42
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,469
What do I do now?

43
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,879
Hey, it got sorted out.

44
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,310
Really? What did? How?

45
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:49,349
Did someone get a windfall?

46
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,520
Seon Ju just called Mom.

47
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,419
The car owner asked to meet.

48
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:54,919
- For real?
- Yes.

49
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,520
Mom said she might settle for less, even.

50
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
That's awesome.

51
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:03,000
Jin Chu Ah got me fired right away,

52
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,729
but her older sister must be more decent.

53
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,430
This is why they say
you need good friends.

54
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,539
That's so right.

55
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,909
I was wondering what I could sell...

56
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:15,069
and was even considering
selling an internal organ.

57
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,479
My gosh. Thank you so much.

58
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,650
Mom must be relieved too.

59
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,020
If she asked to see Seon Ju,

60
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,620
will she go down to half, maybe?

61
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,490
Maybe?

62
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,719
She must've made...

63
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,919
a huge decision if she asked to meet.

64
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:32,259
What a relief.

65
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:34,259
Yes!

66
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,210
What's for lunch today?

67
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,009
- Grilled eel over rice.
- What?

68
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:51,909
What is this?

69
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,479
Is this how people eat eel nowadays?

70
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,349
I followed a recipe. It's smoked.

71
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:58,419
Is it?

72
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:04,960
Why does it taste like this?

73
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,689
Just eat it. It's good for you.

74
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,659
Mom. Is this...

75
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:13,469
Why that of all things?

76
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,169
What's wrong?

77
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,740
Woo Sang, are you having lunch?

78
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,079
Chu Ah brought you something nice.

79
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:28,449
I haven't eaten yet. What did you bring?

80
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,220
I got you something
from a really famous place.

81
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,589
This man grilled eel for over 30 years.

82
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,290
Darn you both. I won't eat.

83
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:41,930
It's gross.

84
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,269
Sang Ah.

85
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,350
Did you have dinner?

86
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:02,680
Eat this if you feel hungry.

87
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,720
No, thanks. You have it.

88
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,560
I see you watch what you eat.

89
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,129
Goodness.

90
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,329
The thin girls
care what they eat even more.

91
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:24,300
Sang Ah. Thank you.

92
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,910
I almost got you wrong,
not knowing you were so nice.

93
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,050
I thought you were
just a little bit mean...

94
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,420
and that you didn't like me much.

95
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,649
But now I can't be more pleased
that we're friends.

96
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,519
Did you get an estimate from your garage?

97
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,459
Yes. It's right here.

98
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,000
Attention, everyone.

99
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,170
Let's welcome Jeon Nam Jin,

100
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,240
Jin Architecture's new talent
and rising star.

101
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,410
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

102
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,949
Thank you.

103
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,980
Are you married?

104
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,620
Yes, I am.

105
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,660
You look disappointed, Nan Hee.

106
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:19,660
I'm not.

107
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,930
You're staying at
the studio apartment, right?

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,329
Didn't your wife complain?

109
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,500
She told me to do my best
to settle in at my new job.

110
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,269
Your wife's so understanding.

111
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:33,610
How did you two meet?

112
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,009
We were introduced.

113
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,379
It's boring, isn't it?

114
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,680
Mr. Kim. How did you meet Ms. Jin?

115
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:47,120
Oh, us?

116
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,389
We met when Ms. Jin was an intern.

117
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,410
That really hurt.

118
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,910
Wait.

119
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,750
Excuse me.

120
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,149
Hey, what...

121
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,620
(Jin Architecture)

122
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,610
Our CEO values diligence.

123
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,180
No one is let off if they're late.

124
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,279
You should join the team
after the internship's done.

125
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,879
But that intern...

126
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,050
happened to be the CEO's daughter.

127
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,089
I really had no idea.
I didn't even imagine that.

128
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:00,389
I heard you fell for her at first sight.

129
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,560
Is that why you always helped her?

130
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,399
It's like something from a K-drama.

131
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,170
That's true destiny.

132
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,600
So, I heard that...

133
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,839
you and Ms. Jin have mutual friends.

134
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,509
Did you know each other in the US?

135
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,110
Even if our mutual friends
aren't that close, we're all Korean,

136
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:22,879
so we're not complete strangers.

137
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:33,660
Mr. Jeon.

138
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:40,329
(Jin Architecture)

139
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,919
How about another drink?

140
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,929
Sure.

141
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,000
- Let's drink.
- Sure.

142
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,070
My mom insisted I thank you.

143
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:24,710
Will you apologize to your sister for me?

144
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,549
You must've been upset too.

145
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,210
This won't work.

146
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,950
There's no way
they can fix my car for this price.

147
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,620
I don't trust them one bit.

148
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,059
- What?
- Let's forget the adjustment.

149
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:41,730
Jin Sang Ah.

150
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,529
What? When you thought
I'd settle with you for less,

151
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,600
you were pleased we were friends.

152
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,129
Now that I canceled the deal,
are you resentful?

153
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:52,470
Are you toying with me?
You asked to see me.

154
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,139
You told me to get an estimate.

155
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:57,139
You acted like we could settle for less.

156
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,679
My gosh.

157
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,149
My goodness.

158
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:07,549
- Wait.
- Forget it. I'm done.

159
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,289
Okay, wait.

160
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,830
Instead of arguing among ourselves,
let's hear opinions from others.

161
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,429
You and I already hate each other.

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,240
What other people?

163
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,639
The insurance people?

164
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,840
Call your husband. I'll call mine.

165
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,309
Let's talk about it objectively,
minus the emotions.

166
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,929
How long...

167
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:51,600
do you think we must work
in order to retire early?

168
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:55,470
Why would you mention retiring
at someone's welcome dinner?

169
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,370
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

170
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:00,509
Hi.

171
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:02,909
It's me. Is the dinner almost over?

172
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,009
Not yet. Why?

173
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:07,649
I'm discussing the car accident
at a cafe nearby...

174
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:10,049
with the owner of the other car.

175
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:11,820
We can't reach a conclusion.

176
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,649
I need you here.

177
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:15,690
See you.

178
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,830
Call your husband too.

179
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:24,600
Okay.

180
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:37,009
(Ji Hyun's mom)

181
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:39,549
(Ji Hyun's mom)

182
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:43,350
What's wrong? He won't pick up?

183
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,350
My husband's a bit busy these days.

184
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:50,820
I'll leave him a text.

185
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,330
Where are you?

186
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,500
I'm at a cafe in Hangang-dong.
Come over for a bit. You must.

187
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,549
Why? Is something wrong?

188
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:25,460
It looks like
my wife caused a car accident.

189
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,190
- Goodness.
- Oh, dear.

190
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:29,129
We wanted to welcome you.

191
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:32,929
I'm sorry, but I think I should go.

192
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:35,500
Sure. It can't be helped. Go ahead.

193
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,600
I will. Bye.

194
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,299
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

195
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:45,039
Did you see how he rushed off
to be with his wife?

196
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,149
He's so sweet.

197
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:49,509
Quit dreaming. He's taken.

198
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,519
Hey. Are you free this evening?

199
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:55,320
- Mr. Jeon's...
- His welcome dinner?

200
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,960
Yes. Who told you?

201
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,320
I heard from Yoo Nan Hee.

202
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:01,129
Nan Hee?

203
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:03,559
Nan Hee.

204
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,929
Did you tell Ms. Jin
about our dinner today?

205
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:08,029
No.

206
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:10,000
You said you'd tell her.

207
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,399
- Yes.
- Was I confused?

208
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,470
No.

209
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,940
Let's empty our glasses and go home.

210
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,210
- Okay.
- Cheers.

211
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,649
Oh, I'm so exhausted.

212
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,250
My poor legs.

213
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,419
Mount Gwanak...

214
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,919
is not at all like
the hills I used to climb.

215
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,129
Where did I put my credit card?

216
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:36,659
This darn bag...

217
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:41,070
Why does she keep trash in her bag?

218
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,620
I'm going to the toilet.

219
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,129
Hey, you're here.

220
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:11,730
Where's the other person?

221
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:12,970
In the toilet.

222
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,529
Honey!

223
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,240
You're here.

224
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,080
You got the text?

225
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,279
You got here so quick.

226
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,450
Sit down.

227
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:28,309
This is my husband.

228
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:31,580
The owner of the car you backed into...

229
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,519
Yes. It's her.

230
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,389
Jin Sang Ah.

231
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,620
He is your husband?

232
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,429
Yes.

233
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,059
Sit down.

234
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:48,799
Why isn't your husband here?
You called him first.

235
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,240
Mr. Jeon. This is quite a coincidence.

236
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:59,750
Wait. You know my husband?

237
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,009
I felt bad I missed your welcome dinner.

238
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,850
But we met anyway.

239
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,789
We did, Team Leader Jin.

240
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:11,490
What on earth...

241
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,360
She's Head of Interior at my company.

242
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:15,159
- What? This brat...
- Honey.

243
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,700
You mean that...

244
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,570
Jin Sang Ah, you mean?

245
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,720
You're home. What about Sang Ah?

246
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,120
She had other plans.

247
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:42,090
- What about dinner?
- I ate with my team.

248
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,460
He's too unsociable.

249
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,100
Goodness.

250
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:58,269
Are you really a team leader...

251
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,940
at the company my husband works for?

252
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:03,179
Yes.

253
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,080
It looks like I'm his superior.

254
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:11,980
That's great!

255
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,090
This is an awesome connection.

256
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,419
You must meet up every day.

257
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,399
Let's go back to square one
and discuss the settlement.

258
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,000
Honey, say something.

259
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:31,200
Your husband isn't coming?

260
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,940
Didn't you say
he was at a team dinner too?

261
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,840
He must be tied down. He can't make it.

262
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:44,019
Honey. We tried to talk it out
but couldn't reach an agreement.

263
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:46,950
I'd like you to hear the story
with a neutral mind.

264
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,190
- What happened was...
- Seon Ju's younger sister...

265
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,190
dozed off at the wheel
and reversed into my car.

266
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,659
Repairs will cost 55,000 dollars,

267
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,899
and her insurance covers 20,000 of that.

268
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,200
That means she must pay 35,000 dollars.

269
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,970
That's not even including medical costs.

270
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:03,870
She thought that was too much,

271
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,970
so she brought me this.

272
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,509
"Manjang-dong San-27,"

273
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,349
"Tenacity Car Center."

274
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,349
I bet they never even saw...

275
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,089
a luxury imported car let alone fix one,

276
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,119
and she wants them to fix mine,
one of a few that was imported.

277
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,490
What do you make of that, objectively?

278
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,730
Hey. You told me to get another estimate.

279
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,470
That estimate was your idea.

280
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,599
Honey. She called me first...

281
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,700
and told me to ask at the garage I go to.

282
00:17:39,069 --> 00:17:40,710
You shouldn't have gone there.

283
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,809
Then instead of that place,
let's ask another place...

284
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:46,309
No. We're done negotiating.

285
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:47,779
I'm leaving.

286
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:50,980
You're leaving just like that?

287
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,150
Goodbye.

288
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,920
Say something, darling.

289
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,859
Why didn't you say a word?

290
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:02,460
You made me look bad.

291
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:05,299
You deserved it.

292
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,730
How could you ask them
about an imported car?

293
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,069
And why did you call my superior a brat?

294
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,509
How am I to face her from now on?

295
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,509
Well, that was...

296
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:20,009
I said you blurt things out
without thinking.

297
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,680
I told you to stop.

298
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,980
Are you that afraid of her?
Is she that high up?

299
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,190
You're a manager and she's a team leader.

300
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,519
Why would you feel so intimidated?

301
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,589
- Pi Seon Ju.
- What, Jeon Nam Jin?

302
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:37,900
It felt like you were on her side.

303
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,430
Forget it.

304
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,730
I have to get back.

305
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,200
Honey!

306
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,980
Is Jin Sang Ah out of her mind?

307
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,339
Hey. Are you free this evening?

308
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,339
- Mr. Jeon's...
- His welcome dinner?

309
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:23,839
Yes. Who told you?

310
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:25,509
I heard from Yoo Nan Hee.

311
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,250
Nan Hee?

312
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:29,450
Nan Hee.

313
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,950
Did you tell Ms. Jin
about our dinner today?

314
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:34,089
No.

315
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:35,950
You said you'd tell her.

316
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,390
- Yes.
- Was I confused?

317
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,460
No.

318
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:55,109
What was all that about?

319
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,509
You must've been surprised,
but I was just as befuddled.

320
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:01,750
You mentioned your wife's car accident.

321
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,420
The owner of the other car.

322
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,950
The bratty girl she knew in school.
That was me.

323
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:07,650
Didn't you see her face here last time?

324
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,950
Would I have called you if I had?

325
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:11,119
I only heard her voice.

326
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:13,730
How was I to even guess
you were married to Pi Seon Ju?

327
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:16,900
How could you be her husband?

328
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:18,400
My gosh.

329
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:21,799
It's fortunate
I was calm enough to wrap it up.

330
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:24,269
What if someone
had blurted something out by mistake?

331
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,740
Are you sure you know your wife well?

332
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:33,109
Rough around the edges but sweet,
and she sacrificed for you.

333
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:38,619
This wasn't the first time I saw Seon Ju.

334
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:42,750
She came to my mom's salon
with her mom and sister.

335
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:43,960
What? Why?

336
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,420
To beg to settle for less.

337
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:47,829
Seon Ju said that day...

338
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,299
that she was like Princess Pyeonggang...

339
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:52,200
who turned a village idiot
into a famous general.

340
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,930
She loves to help the unfortunate,
so she took you in,

341
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:59,500
made you an architect,
and sent you abroad to study.

342
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:04,180
She'll stop at nothing
to keep a promise she made,

343
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,180
so she paid for your tuition in the US.

344
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:10,049
She said she didn't just wait for you
to come back.

345
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,720
She even sent you money every month,
like Choon Hyang...

346
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,750
Is that true?

347
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:16,789
Would I make that up?

348
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,359
Should I have taped the conversation?

349
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,930
That's what Seon Ju
goes around saying about you.

350
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:38,609
We're home.

351
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:52,720
Oh, my gosh.

352
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,869
Are you tired
because I picked you up so late?

353
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,069
It's okay.

354
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,740
Did you have fun at kindergarten?

355
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,910
Do you think kindergarten
is all about having fun?

356
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,509
Do you know how hard it is there?

357
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,109
Oh, is it?

358
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:17,619
What was so hard?

359
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:20,349
The teachers always want to sing.

360
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:25,019
And the other kids want to
build with blocks or play house.

361
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:26,259
And then they fight.

362
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,690
The cafeteria lady says...

363
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,900
we must eat a bit of everything.

364
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,960
That sounds exhausting.

365
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:37,240
Life is exhausting.

366
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:41,710
Since that's how we both feel,
for dinner today...

367
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:43,640
Yes. Let's eat something simple.

368
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,779
Deal.

369
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,549
Should I have added a can of tuna?

370
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,049
For protein.

371
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:58,259
No. Ramyeon tastes best
without too many toppings.

372
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,829
You seem to like
what middle-aged men like.

373
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:03,660
That's how your dad likes it.

374
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,470
Why doesn't Dad live with us?

375
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,640
Because of work.

376
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,769
He's staying at a dorm.

377
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:16,509
He's back in Korea,
but it doesn't feel like it.

378
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:20,109
I sometimes forget that he's even back.

379
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,650
Hey, honey.

380
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:25,619
Hello.

381
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,490
- Dad.
- Hi.

382
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,589
You stood up holding that?

383
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,440
Did you come back for more stuff?

384
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,140
What about dinner?

385
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:54,180
At least answer.
Did you eat at the team dinner?

386
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:57,119
Will you cook another ramyeon
if I haven't?

387
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,220
Is that what you feed our kid?

388
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,950
It's okay every now and then.

389
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,559
There was an old man...

390
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,359
who lived to be 90
and he ate nothing but ramyeon.

391
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,759
I saw the story online.

392
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,529
Goodness...

393
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,769
Honey. Try this on.

394
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,569
What's this?

395
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,339
You want me to wear this?

396
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
Don't you have to
work at construction sites?

397
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:25,240
Look. You can pull out...

398
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,349
or push in the safety goggles.

399
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,779
This looks like something
a biker would wear,

400
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,519
not an architect.

401
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,950
Does it?

402
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,490
What if you were to rub off the stickers?

403
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,890
Leave it.
There are lots of these lying around.

404
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,660
Okay, then.

405
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,329
Where are my books?

406
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,730
On Ji Hyun's bookshelf.

407
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,119
What's this?

408
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:08,549
Did you win something
at an international competition?

409
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,559
Give me that. It's nothing.

410
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,059
It looks like something.

411
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:15,190
Why didn't you tell me you won something?

412
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,430
What if I told you?

413
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,559
You'd have made a fuss with party poppers
and singing and dancing.

414
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,230
I hate the ruckus.

415
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:28,539
What are you doing? Have you left yet?

416
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:29,869
Will you be back tonight?

417
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:38,880
What are you doing?

418
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:42,619
Who is "Jin?"

419
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:44,359
Why would you snoop around?

420
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,789
Who is it?

421
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,089
Do you know everyone I know?

422
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:55,730
Are you seeing another woman?

423
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:57,900
Why would you say something like that?

424
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,900
What's wrong?

425
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,140
You sound like you're angry
because you got caught having an affair.

426
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,170
My gosh.

427
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,609
I'm drained enough with all the work
and trying to settle in.

428
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,150
Get out of the way.

429
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,819
I just asked out of curiosity,

430
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:15,289
but your reaction made me wonder.

431
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,220
It's a woman, isn't it?

432
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,529
- Let me see.
- No.

433
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,329
Let me see the text
if it's not from a woman.

434
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:27,329
- Let's see your phone.
- Darn it!

435
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,630
Screw you.

436
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:33,740
There. Look at it now.

437
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,140
My goodness.

438
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,049
Hey, what's up?

439
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:23,190
- I just called to see how you're doing.
- Oh, did you?

440
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,420
I'm still the same. How about you?

441
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,920
I'm the same too.

442
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,059
I saw your wife.

443
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,130
Did you? Where?

444
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,829
At a bar. She was with some guy.

445
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,569
They could've been friends.

446
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,480
Did you just smash your phone?

447
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,809
Why are you so angry?

448
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:52,079
You're acting even more suspiciously.

449
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,450
- Did you call me a village idiot?
- What?

450
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,759
Are you a Choon Hyang
who sent money every month?

451
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:59,559
What?

452
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,430
How do you... Did you meet Mi Ju?

453
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,529
You took me in because
you love to help the unfortunate?

454
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,839
You struggled to wire me money
because you made a promise?

455
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,009
Publish an autobiography
instead of telling everyone.

456
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:17,910
No... There's a slight misunderstanding.

457
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,079
Don't you care about my ego?

458
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:21,849
Am I allowed to be ridiculed
if you paid my tuition?

459
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:24,049
You...

460
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,079
crossed the line.

461
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,990
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

462
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:52,079
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

463
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,950
Let's think about our marriage.

464
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,380
I'm not sure we should stay together.

465
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,549
Did you meet up only as friends
of friends who studied together?

466
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:01,920
Do you suspect me too?

467
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:04,920
Mom. Did you and Dad fight?

468
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,259
Let's leave our spouses.

469
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,859
I'm dead serious. Think about it.

470
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:10,730
I suggested an affair, not a divorce.

471
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
