00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,540
(Episode 63)

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,809
You asked me...

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,780
what I wanted to do with you.

4
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:18,680
I thought about it.

5
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:21,479
I think...

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,850
I don't want to divorce you.

7
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:27,260
What? Why not?

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,289
I don't know what I feel or why,

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,629
but we don't act
because we know exactly how we feel.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,670
How do you feel about Seon Ju?

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,330
Do you know for sure?

12
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:41,370
I don't have to explain
my feelings to you,

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,510
but I told you before.

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,610
She's a good person I want to help.

15
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:49,349
You can go now.
I don't want to hear anything else.

16
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,949
Be sure to come to court on time.

17
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,029
Shall we go now?

18
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,529
- Yes.
- Quack, quack!

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,599
Let's go. Come along.

20
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,599
Let's go.

21
00:01:11,669 --> 00:01:14,399
(Han Hair Line)

22
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,980
Did you have fun?

23
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,780
I biked with Tae Ri around the stone pile.

24
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:25,379
You must be hungry, then.

25
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:26,920
Mom, where's the spaghetti?

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,250
It's almost done.

27
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:31,289
Let's give some to Tae Ri...

28
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,319
and his dad before we start eating.

29
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,789
Can't we all eat here together?

30
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,259
- Here?
- Yes.

31
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,629
I'll tell them to come downstairs.

32
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,830
- Tae Ri!
- But...

33
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,730
Oh, dear.

34
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:04,519
Mom, I brought them over.

35
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,420
Come and join us.

36
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,860
Tae Ri, sit down.

37
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,289
Well...

38
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:10,759
Take a seat.

39
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:12,530
Okay.

40
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,060
We'll eat quickly and get out of your way.

41
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,369
Tae Ri. Say thank you.

42
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,839
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

43
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,969
My mom's spaghetti is the best.

44
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,179
Is it even better than a restaurant's?

45
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:27,239
Yes.

46
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:30,179
Hey. You can't lie like that.

47
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:32,749
There are only three plates.

48
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,019
You're right. I'll go and...

49
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:36,589
No. I'll get it.

50
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,119
Then...

51
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:50,399
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

52
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,010
Is it good?

53
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,739
It's really tasty.

54
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,540
Yes.

55
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,050
It is good. It's nicer
than what we get at a restaurant.

56
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:05,480
- Is it?
- Yes.

57
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,089
Tae Ri. Eat as much as you want.

58
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:32,839
What are you doing?

59
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,480
What's wrong?

60
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,279
What is it? Tell me what's the matter.

61
00:03:41,249 --> 00:03:42,390
My goodness.

62
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,550
Mom.

63
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:46,219
What?

64
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:48,820
Woo Sang...

65
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:51,160
is getting married.

66
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,559
What? To whom?

67
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,899
I'd get it if it were to
a massive actress or heiress.

68
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:59,800
He's marrying the stupid stylist girl...

69
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:02,570
Pi Mi Ju.

70
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:05,040
That's who he's marrying!

71
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:09,110
Pi Mi Ju? Pi Seon Ju's sister?

72
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,050
I don't know how she seduced Woo Sang.

73
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,290
He got her pregnant.

74
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,820
My gosh. The sly...

75
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,559
Why must you both lose your men
to the girls in that family?

76
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,129
Sang Ah lost someone too?

77
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:26,999
She stole her husband.

78
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:28,800
Did she lose him again?

79
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,170
That family is full of troublemakers.

80
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,600
Mom.

81
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:38,610
Did Ms. Oh give permission
knowing what that family is like?

82
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,980
I don't know if she knows.

83
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,350
I should meet with her.

84
00:04:58,389 --> 00:04:59,400
What's going on?

85
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,329
Did you hear
Jeong Woo Sang was getting married?

86
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,770
He is? With whom?

87
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,429
Pi Seon Ju's younger sister.

88
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:06,699
What? Chu Ah's old stylist?

89
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:07,840
Yes.

90
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,369
Their youngest daughter is
about to marry a huge star.

91
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:14,639
- For real?
- Your husband fell for Seon Ju...

92
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:16,650
and Woo Sang fell for her sister.

93
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,350
I'm about to lose
both sons-in-law to that family.

94
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,850
I wanted Woo Sang
to marry Chu Ah for so long.

95
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,520
I didn't lose anyone. I stole Nam Jin.

96
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,790
So Woo is about to fall for Seon Ju.

97
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,230
Then you won't have stolen anyone.
You'll be even.

98
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:32,759
Get So Woo back!

99
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:36,300
What are you doing out here?

100
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,300
I'm about to come in.

101
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,210
Are your sisters asleep?

102
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:47,509
Yes.

103
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,179
Did you make an appointment at an OB-GYN?

104
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,980
Yes, but my appointment got pushed back...

105
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,850
to the day after the wedding.

106
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,590
- I'll come with you, then.
- No.

107
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,720
Word will spread if you do.

108
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:01,420
I'll take my sisters.

109
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,160
I can't even go to
your doctor's appointments.

110
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,300
I feel bad that we can't date...

111
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,900
and get married like an ordinary couple.

112
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,270
Not me.

113
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,100
I think...

114
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,170
this feels totally special.

115
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:18,869
Hey. Do you know...

116
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,439
we never said "I love you" to each other?

117
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,379
We didn't.

118
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:27,350
We can say that one day.

119
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,389
My gosh.

120
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:32,960
This is insane.

121
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,819
I have goosebumps all over.

122
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:36,889
Look.

123
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,030
I'll call you back.

124
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:48,069
Does she want to do that
around her single sisters?

125
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,840
Doesn't she feel bad for me?

126
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,239
Mom.

127
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:57,350
The scary woman was here.

128
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:59,079
Tae Ri's mom.

129
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,650
What? Where?

130
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:03,020
She came here,
right before we went out to play.

131
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,790
She and Mr. Kim talked.

132
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,660
Oh, did they?

133
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,360
Yes. She said she missed Tae Ri.

134
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:14,800
But she complained
that we looked like a family...

135
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,600
and glared at us.

136
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,369
Did she?

137
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,749
I see.

138
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,150
Let's go to bed.

139
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:36,720
Is something wrong with the girls?

140
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,689
Gosh, no.

141
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,960
I wonder what Sang Ah is thinking.

142
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,059
She's my daughter,
but I just don't get her.

143
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,030
Doesn't she care
that So Woo and Tae Ri left?

144
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,629
Don't say that.

145
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,540
She must be worried about something.

146
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:56,210
She went to see Tae Ri today.

147
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:00,579
Right, I got you something.

148
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,280
One of my clients recommended it.

149
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,379
If you take this regularly,
you'll feel more energized...

150
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,189
in the mornings.

151
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,449
I don't need supplements like this.

152
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,860
You should start taking a few.

153
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,230
You're not getting any younger.

154
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,829
That's true.

155
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,329
I had been feeling down in the mornings.

156
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:25,199
You're the best ever.

157
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,970
Who'd look out for your health
other than me?

158
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,040
Yes.

159
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:33,139
I promise to take it.

160
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,139
Good.

161
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,639
Let's go to sleep.

162
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,720
Why did Mom come here?

163
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,819
I don't know.

164
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:47,160
Does Mom miss me?

165
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,990
- Yes.
- Will she come back?

166
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:53,329
Yes.

167
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:54,729
Go to sleep.

168
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:56,599
- I'll turn out the light.
- Okay.

169
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,420
I think I don't want to divorce you.

170
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,969
Hello.

171
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,939
It's been a while.

172
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,510
I want to ask...

173
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,640
if you're free today.

174
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,949
(Director's Office, Jin Sang Ah)

175
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,449
Yesterday.

176
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,290
I saw you at home with Mr. Kim.

177
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,790
We live at the same address.

178
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,890
Naturally, we can be outside...

179
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,900
No.

180
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,099
The look on your face wasn't natural.

181
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,339
- What?
- "I'll make you spaghetti."

182
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,170
You said that before heading back inside.

183
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,040
You looked like a wife
about to cook for a husband.

184
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,640
- What?
- It was like you had an ulterior motive.

185
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,339
You even checked on Tae Ri.

186
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,120
It's weird.

187
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:27,020
She's acting even weirder.

188
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,089
I didn't smack her kid.

189
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:32,859
I wondered if he was under-dressed.
That's having an ulterior motive?

190
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:33,929
My gosh.

191
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,030
Come this way.

192
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,300
I don't require free treatment.

193
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,880
I heard the good news about Woo Sang.

194
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,410
He's getting married?

195
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,650
You heard?

196
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,219
I'm sorry.

197
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,319
Don't apologize.
It's something to celebrate.

198
00:10:57,349 --> 00:11:00,490
I'm not exactly proud of the match.

199
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,490
Don't tell anyone. Keep it to yourself.

200
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,630
Of course.

201
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:09,059
What does the young lady do?

202
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:12,099
Did you look into her family?

203
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,199
She's not from a prominent family,

204
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:17,209
but her parents are good folks,

205
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,079
and her married sisters
live ordinary lives.

206
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,309
I think they're a happy bunch.

207
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,479
I see.

208
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:28,479
What are her father's
and brothers-in-law's occupations?

209
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,589
Her father works abroad.

210
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,359
I think her brothers-in-law
have decent jobs.

211
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,890
Will they all be at the wedding?

212
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:42,099
Yes. We want it to be
a small affair for family only.

213
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:44,770
We'll meet everyone
for the first time then.

214
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,439
Okay.

215
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,270
The manager will be in soon.
You won't have to wait long.

216
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,609
Thank you.

217
00:11:59,179 --> 00:12:01,050
Oh, sounds good.

218
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,150
Ms. Pi.

219
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,150
Would you like some pasta?

220
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,490
In Ja and Nan Hee
suggested pasta for lunch.

221
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,059
Pasta?

222
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,760
I had that yesterday. You go without me.

223
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,099
Mr. Kim, we're going out for pasta.
Will you join us?

224
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,670
I had pasta yesterday.

225
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,699
You did?

226
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,109
Did you two eat together?

227
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,550
Sorry. It was a joke.

228
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,579
Enjoy something else for lunch, then.

229
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:38,719
I'm off to get pasta.

230
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:43,490
Shall we eat together?

231
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,829
Yes, sure.

232
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,370
Oh, here you are.

233
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:57,569
Hello.

234
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,780
Are you booked to see Ms. Kim?

235
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,179
Yes. You freaked out
and told me to get a refund,

236
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:06,420
but I refused and threatened
to report you to the authorities.

237
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,020
You told Ms. Kim to take me on
and extend my membership.

238
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,650
Right.

239
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,660
I was told to wait here
because all the rooms were taken.

240
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,089
Okay, then.

241
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,559
By the way.

242
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,599
What were Mr. Jeon's in-laws like?

243
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:26,370
Oh, gosh.
That family has a load of issues.

244
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,000
Did you hear something bad...

245
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,640
about them or the daughters?

246
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:33,839
Something bad?

247
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,040
There's nothing good to say about them.

248
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,880
I happened to find out that...

249
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,849
the third was adopted.

250
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,790
The third daughter?

251
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,219
Yes. That family
seems to have lots of secrets.

252
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,620
I see.

253
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,359
Ms. Wang. We're ready for you.

254
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,760
They're a suspicious bunch.

255
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:07,209
I heard Sang Ah came over yesterday.

256
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,650
Yes. She wanted to eat out with us
because she missed Tae Ri.

257
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,449
She must want to be a good mom.

258
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,189
I don't think she meant it.

259
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,120
Maybe she did miss Tae Ri.

260
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,929
Seeing how much Tae Ri likes his mom,

261
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,859
I guess Sang Ah was good to him.

262
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:28,800
She was at first,

263
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,170
for one or two years.

264
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,770
Does he remember those times
when he was still so young?

265
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,199
I see.

266
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,910
We adopted Tae Ri.

267
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,540
He knew that.

268
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,010
Maybe he got a bit clingy
because he felt...

269
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,819
we weren't a secure family.

270
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,120
He seems to want his mom more.

271
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,990
It's like looking at me
when I was that age.

272
00:14:55,219 --> 00:14:56,219
That's how it is.

273
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:59,089
I half-know that feeling.

274
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:02,359
I grew up without a dad.

275
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,500
I missed half a parent
that almost everyone else had.

276
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,439
That's why I half-know.

277
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,579
I end up telling you all sorts of things.

278
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,449
Because you feel comfortable around me?

279
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:22,150
I guess I really do
feel at ease around you.

280
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,420
You do.

281
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:27,290
Don't I feel like
an older brother sometimes?

282
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,130
Which army branch did you serve in?

283
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,059
- Let's eat.
- Sure.

284
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,209
"I guess Sang Ah was good to him?"

285
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,540
How dare she evaluate my role?

286
00:15:57,349 --> 00:16:00,719
What were you thinking about
that you didn't notice me coming in?

287
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,459
What do you want?

288
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,189
Professor Albert sent over
notes from his meeting.

289
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:06,429
Let's go through them and...

290
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:08,199
Seon Ju and So Woo.

291
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,870
They're always together.

292
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,770
I'd say they're together 24-7.

293
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,270
At work, they talk about the kids
and all sorts of private stuff.

294
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,839
At home, she said she'd cook spaghetti
while he took the kids out to play.

295
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,740
They're a total family unit.

296
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,579
Isn't that ridiculous?

297
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,449
- They do that?
- Not even a real family does that.

298
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:28,050
We weren't like that.

299
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:30,449
Why were you at their place?

300
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,319
What?

301
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,689
I didn't go there on purpose.

302
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,189
I was passing by.

303
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,959
You met a friend yesterday.
Were you in that neighborhood?

304
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,900
I said I was passing by.

305
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:45,599
You could've kept passing by.

306
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,099
Seon Ju.

307
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:53,880
Did you meet up with Mr. Kim
and cook him spaghetti?

308
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,880
Did Sang Ah run right to you
to tell you what she heard?

309
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:00,050
Why does she care
what we ate on the weekend?

310
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:03,819
Do you two have that little to talk about?

311
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,390
She showed up out of the blue at my place,

312
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,530
complained that I looked out for Tae Ri,
and said I had an ulterior motive.

313
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,089
- What?
- Even Sang Ah...

314
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,730
comes over because she misses Tae Ri.

315
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,770
You. Don't you think of Ji Hyun at all?

316
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,930
Ms. Jin...

317
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,339
showed up at your place?

318
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,909
Yes. Who else
did you hear this story from?

319
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:26,909
Your darling lover...

320
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:29,950
came to our place
and glared at our daughter.

321
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,950
My gosh.

322
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,389
Even now,
he doesn't care about Ji Hyun at all.

323
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,419
He's fixated on the fact
that Sang Ah came over.

324
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:47,700
Hey.

325
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,569
Here's the registration certificate.

326
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,540
The paper is still warm.

327
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:01,809
You're now a man with the deed to a house.

328
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,510
Oh, right.

329
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:06,550
When is your sister's wedding?

330
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,780
The last day of the month.

331
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,649
Be at Cloud Hotel by 1 p.m.

332
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:11,190
Let's meet in the lobby
and walk in together.

333
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:12,450
Okay.

334
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:14,460
Wait.

335
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,159
My younger brother is
getting married there that day too.

336
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,000
What? For real?

337
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,530
Who's your younger brother?

338
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Jeong Woo Sang.

339
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,099
Then...

340
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:31,710
is Mi Ju your sister?

341
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:32,839
Then...

342
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:36,440
your brother and my sister
are getting married?

343
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,760
Why were you at their place?

344
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,290
What?

345
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,629
I didn't go there on purpose.

346
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:54,099
I was passing by.

347
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,129
You met a friend yesterday.
Were you in that neighborhood?

348
00:18:57,129 --> 00:18:59,030
I said I was passing by.

349
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,569
I don't think...

350
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:02,740
it's time to cut So Woo loose.

351
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,849
My gosh.

352
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:16,250
Hey. Are you trying to con my family?

353
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:18,649
The con was your brother's idea...

354
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:20,089
and you were about to take part.

355
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,220
And what?
You think your brother is losing out?

356
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,190
What? You called my brother a dirtbag.

357
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:30,500
So why are you
planning a con to marry them?

358
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,369
Why don't you go around telling people
Jeong Woo Sang is your brother?

359
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:36,240
I don't want to, okay?

360
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,309
Why not?

361
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,079
Some don't believe me
because we don't look alike and I hate it!

362
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:42,079
Wait.

363
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:45,010
We shouldn't be doing this right now.

364
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,319
Will you and I become in-laws?

365
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,290
Yes.

366
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,750
You can't come to my sister's wedding?

367
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:55,589
I will be there
because it's my brother's wedding.

368
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,490
Right.

369
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,260
My mom will be
your sister's mother-in-law.

370
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:04,399
I can't sit there beside you and say...

371
00:20:04,399 --> 00:20:07,970
I married you in secret and had a son
and am part of your family.

372
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,740
Yes, you're right.

373
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:12,069
My head is ringing.

374
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,639
Mine aches.

375
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,510
Hey. Forget pretending to be my husband.

376
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,079
Will you tell your mom...

377
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:23,649
we're putting on a play?

378
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,030
You said it was my brother's idea.

379
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:33,629
I won't tell.

380
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,230
Thanks.

381
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:41,399
Darn it.

382
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,839
I thought he'd be of some help,
but it turned out they're brothers.

383
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,980
After all that bragging I did to Mi Ju.

384
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,210
What am I to tell her now?

385
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:04,359
Hey, check out this dress.

386
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,260
Do you think it'll suit me?

387
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,030
What will you and Seon Ju wear?
Hanbok? Will you rent them?

388
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,399
Hey. I have something to tell you.

389
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,069
Come with me.

390
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,379
Dong Won. Go outside.

391
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,639
Why? I'm doing homework.

392
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:24,879
It won't take long. Move.

393
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:32,419
Come here.

394
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,559
So...

395
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,589
You know...

396
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:41,960
At your wedding...

397
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,829
- The play...
- I know.

398
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,800
I thought you'd be the last
to agree to help out.

399
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,869
I'm so grateful.

400
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:53,879
It's not that.

401
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,450
I won't act like I'm better than you
because I married a huge star.

402
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,680
I'll remember I owe it to you
and will make it up to you.

403
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:03,520
Thank you.

404
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:23,369
Take this.

405
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,510
What?

406
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:27,079
Dong Won wore it just once.

407
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:29,240
Or was it twice? Whatever.

408
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,109
Why? Is this not good enough?

409
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:33,579
Will you help me out?

410
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:35,680
You know how grateful I am.

411
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,089
I didn't think you'd find someone
before Seon Ju did.

412
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:42,960
That's the thing.

413
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:45,589
The guy I found.

414
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,399
He's of no use.

415
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,329
What do you mean? Why not?

416
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,169
He's your brother-in-law.

417
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:54,069
Brother-in... What's that?

418
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,210
He's your future husband's older brother.

419
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:00,809
For real?

420
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:02,639
What happens, then?

421
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,550
What do you think?

422
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,480
The truth could've gotten out,
but he agreed to keep quiet.

423
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,919
But that means
he can't sit with us at the wedding.

424
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,790
So it looks like...

425
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:18,030
I'll be alone.

426
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,399
You can't. Seon Ju isn't helping,
so if you come on your own too...

427
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,930
That's a no.

428
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:24,970
What can we do, then?
Hire someone part-time?

429
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:25,970
No.

430
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:30,440
What if someone were to post
that Jeong Woo Sang's wife's family...

431
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,470
hired someone to pretend to be family?

432
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:36,280
We should ask someone whom we think...

433
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,079
will keep the secret.

434
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,919
Do you know anyone?

435
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,649
Everyone I know is a stylist
or works in the fashion industry.

436
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:46,220
They won't keep a secret.

437
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,859
How about my real estate agent boss?

438
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,730
What else can we do, then?

439
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,960
Hello.

440
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,859
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

441
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:58,700
Jin Ju.

442
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,740
Let's give it a go.

443
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:05,309
We can't be picky right now,
even if he's our homeowner.

444
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:07,980
Hold both ends in one hand and spin it.

445
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:09,639
Mr. Kim.

446
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:10,909
Yes?

447
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,809
Can we chat for a moment?

448
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:14,649
Isn't this a bit weird?

449
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,089
He's the most normal person
in the neighborhood.

450
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,490
He is but...

451
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:23,460
Tae Ri. Go inside
and play with Ji Hyun for a bit, okay?

452
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,059
- What?
- Go on and play.

453
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:27,099
We were going to...

454
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,300
Hi, Seon Ju.

455
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:31,069
You're home.

456
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,730
- Yes.
- Hi.

457
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:35,869
What are you all doing out here?

458
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,069
Well, we were... What?

459
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:40,109
Just a moment.

460
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:42,010
Seon Ju. Come with me.

461
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:43,180
What?

462
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,389
You don't have a thing
with our homeowner, do you?

463
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:55,559
What? Why is everyone...

464
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,690
We live upstairs and downstairs.

465
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,889
And he's my superior.

466
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:02,730
But there are times
when it looks like you're having a fling.

467
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,270
No way. What are you on about?

468
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:06,700
We're not.

469
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,639
Then can I ask for his help?

470
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:11,639
Help with what?

471
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:14,409
To be your husband?

472
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,480
- Yes.
- You said you found someone.

473
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,050
I had found someone,

474
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,010
but he was Jeong Woo Sang's older brother.

475
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,349
- What?
- My gosh.

476
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:26,050
I know it's weird and I'm not all for it,

477
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,490
but there's no one else.

478
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,589
Jin Ju. He's Jin Sang Ah's husband.

479
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:33,089
I know that.

480
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:35,700
But Sang Ah won't be there.

481
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,700
It's a secret family-only wedding.

482
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,500
It still feels weird.

483
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,069
What got into you?

484
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:45,510
I don't want to ask a favor
of your ex's lover's husband.

485
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:49,409
But if there's nothing
between you and him...

486
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:50,879
There isn't anything.

487
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,980
But still...

488
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:56,220
We forced him to let us stay,

489
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,550
and Mom forced him to go on a blind date.

490
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:01,490
I feel bad for that already,

491
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,730
and you want to ask this of him too?

492
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:07,059
Don't you think we're asking for too much?

493
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:11,970
Mi Ju is this desperate.

494
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:13,099
Darn it.

495
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh, I don't know.

496
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:22,540
Really?

497
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,409
Yes, it's confirmed.

498
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,609
Her third daughter
was born out of wedlock,

499
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:29,119
and her husband
went missing a long time ago.

500
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,690
There's a rumor he appeared in the area
shortly before he disappeared.

501
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:38,190
I think he was involved in a crime
or at least something fishy.

502
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:39,389
Thank you.

503
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:44,500
Her father works abroad.

504
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:47,899
I think her brothers-in-law
have decent jobs.

505
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:51,240
Will they all be at the wedding?

506
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:52,609
Yes.

507
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,579
They're trying to pull off a con.

508
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,280
What should I do with them?

509
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,990
Please.

510
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,990
Spare us just two hours of your time.

511
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,260
Still, I think it's a bit...

512

(Han Hair Line)

513
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,940
My gosh.

(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

515
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,200
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

516
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,300
Does Pi Seon Ju appeal to you as a woman?

517
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:28,970
Why would you ask me that?

518
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,669
You know that relationship is weird,
don't you?

519
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,740
You're her enemy
because you ruined her family.

520
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,440
Do you remember the accident I caused?

521
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,909
I'll ruin you
so you can never return to acting.

522
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,079
Are you insane?

523
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,280
You said you were sick of men.

524
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,079
I like Mr. Kim.

525
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:43,990
Should I say it's true?
