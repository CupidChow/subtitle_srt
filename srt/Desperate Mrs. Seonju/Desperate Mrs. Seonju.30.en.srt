1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,759
We'll move out tomorrow.

2
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:13,690
Wait.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,800
You said you'd help
with the Hansung project.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,970
You should keep your side of the deal.

5
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:22,099
We can get divorced...

6
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:23,769
after we get the project.

7
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:25,969
Why?

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,339
So you can get promoted?

9
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,879
The time I spent with you,

10
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,579
the memories we made...

11
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:36,679
They meant a lot to me,

12
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:39,949
and thinking I'd lose it broke my heart.

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,820
But...

14
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:44,289
you took away any sliver of regret
I could possibly have.

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,789
Thank you so much.

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,189
Why didn't I see...

17
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,530
what you were like until now?

18
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:07,479
(Episode 30)

19
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:28,170
Dad.

20
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,040
Tae Ri.

21
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:34,269
Let's pack your things.

22
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,010
We'll go on a trip tomorrow.

23
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,680
Get everything you want to take.

24
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:44,879
Dad.

25
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,489
- Yes?
- You...

26
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,859
and Mom.

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,890
Are you breaking up because of me?

28
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,959
What?

29
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,760
Because you brought me home,

30
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,200
but I turned out to be strange?

31
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:04,400
Is it because of me?

32
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:09,340
Why would you say that?

33
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,980
It feels like it.

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,750
Tae Ri.

35
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,620
Some parents stay together for their kids,

36
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,949
but no parent breaks up because of them.

37
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:20,349
It's not like that.

38
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,389
Mom and Dad...

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,659
must be together to be a happy family.

40
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,560
You can see Mom whenever you miss her.

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,330
The happy sounds...

42
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,330
fell into the water too.

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,599
I can buy you another one.

44
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,580
When I was in the water,

45
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,039
I was scared.

46
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,219
It's okay.

47
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,520
It will all be okay.

48
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,990
Do you know...

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,659
how you and I met?

50
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:01,560
The day we met,

51
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,129
I noticed the weakest, most docile,

52
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:09,270
but cutest baby.

53
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,340
I knew right away...

54
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:15,039
that you were my son.

55
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,780
The best thing...

56
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,219
I did in my whole life...

57
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,849
was to meet you.

58
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,330
I promise...

59
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,129
to be nothing but your dad, Tae Ri.

60
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,069
There are happy families of two as well.

61
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,310
You don't have to worry about anything.

62
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,150
If you miss Mom,

63
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,990
you can tell me at any time.

64
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,250
Let's live...

65
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,490
a pretty, lovely, and happy life.

66
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:08,090
And have fun too, okay?

67
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,900
Don't cry.

68
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,980
Your father-in-law went to play golf
and will go to the office from there.

69
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,079
What do you have to say?

70
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:29,350
Tae Ri and I...

71
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,480
will move out.

72
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,589
Just the two of you? Why?

73
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,050
I'm leaving Sang Ah.

74
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:38,319
What are you talking about?

75
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,459
Is it because of yesterday's accident?

76
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,629
- Just one mistake isn't...
- No.

77
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,699
I thought long and hard
before making this decision.

78
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,139
I believe I gave Sang Ah...

79
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,139
many chances.

80
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,139
I'm sorry, Mother.

81
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,810
So Woo.

82
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:14,990
Do you have to do this?

83
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,199
Say goodbye.

84
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,470
Let's go.

85
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:29,709
Let's go.

86
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,850
What's that?

87
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,560
It looks like the happy sounds.

88
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,689
Whose is it?

89
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:47,230
Grandma threw it in the trash.

90
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:49,899
Did she? Let's get going.

91
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,079
What happened? Why is So Woo acting up?

92
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,079
Why did he say he'd leave you?

93
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,980
Is it because Tae Ri
ended up in the river?

94
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,250
So Woo and Tae Ri
just left with their suitcases.

95
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,019
You said you'd split them up first
and take your time with So Woo.

96
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,689
What are you talking about?

97
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:18,689
- Well...
- You'll split up someone first...

98
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:20,259
and take your time with So Woo?

99
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,230
Are you seeing a married man?

100
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,329
- I'm married too.
- What?

101
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,199
Is that why So Woo is angry?

102
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,939
Who are you seeing? Since when?

103
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:33,610
They say the affair partner
is right under your nose, Mom.

104
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,410
Is it Mr. Jeon?

105
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:41,709
You said he'd make
nice son-in-law material too.

106
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,319
I don't believe this.

107
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,850
That was just a polite figure of speech...

108
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,120
because I thought it would never be.

109
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,920
Did I mean you should cheat with him?

110
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,160
You never liked So Woo.

111
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,689
I didn't think you'd be so upset.

112
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,029
I didn't like him,

113
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:58,199
but how would you look if people heard
he asked you for a divorce?

114
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,329
What if you lose
your dad's favor because of this?

115
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:02,699
I'll take care of that.

116
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:04,269
I have to get ready for work.

117
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,769
Sang Ah!

118
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,939
What should I do with her?

119
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,779
Mom.

120
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,689
Mom. Are you not well?

121
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,389
I think...

122
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:27,060
it's because I was in the rain yesterday.

123
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:32,360
Shall I call Grandma?

124
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,129
Should I call Auntie?

125
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:35,730
Should I call the paramedics?

126
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,139
Hey.

127
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:40,810
Your phone won't turn on.

128
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,879
Oh, dear. I guess my phone got wet too.

129
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,540
It'll turn on when it dries.

130
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,750
I'll be fine...

131
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,089
after a good nap,
so will you let me sleep?

132
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:54,790
I don't think...

133
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,759
I can walk you to kindergarten today.
That's not good at all.

134
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,860
It's okay.

135
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,829
I can miss a day. It's fine.

136
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,860
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,970
- It's okay. Go back to sleep.
- Okay.

138
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:29,720
Why the long face?

139
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,089
So Woo wants a divorce.

140
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,529
I guess Tae Ri told him he saw us kiss.

141
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,600
And that I got out of the car
because you called.

142
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,740
He looks stupid and clueless,
but he tells everything he sees.

143
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,139
Isn't it for the better?

144
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:47,509
You don't have to ask him to divorce you.

145
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:49,379
The situation isn't good at all.

146
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:52,179
There's the promotion
and the Hansung project.

147
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:54,179
I can help you with that.

148
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,850
It's darn annoying.

149
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:58,720
This wasn't how I wanted to get divorced.

150
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:12,870
(Head of Planning, Kim So Woo)

151
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,779
(Resume: Pi Seon Ju,
Letter of Resignation)

152
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:33,820
Mr. Seong.

153
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,860
Ms. Pi Seon Ju.
You interviewed her for an opening.

154
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,129
Yes.

155
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:42,629
I went through her portfolio,

156
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,960
and I think she's quite skilled.

157
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,070
Oh, really?

158
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,200
Then how about a Design Team assistant?

159
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,639
Aren't we always looking to hire one?

160
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:54,009
I think that would work.

161
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,240
I'll make some calls
and hire her if I get the okay.

162
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,139
Great. Thank you.

163
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,090
- Hello?
- Mr. Jin is here.

164
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:14,490
Okay.

165
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:35,379
I heard you asked for a divorce.

166
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,649
You said you and Ms. Jin
would work things out.

167
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,389
Did I win?

168
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,259
What's that?

169
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:48,889
I don't know.

170
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:51,399
It's a letter of resignation.

171
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:55,929
Thinking that you'll leave
is somewhat upsetting.

172
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,970
I have a lot on my mind...

173
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,740
Keep your mouth shut.

174
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,879
I know all about what you did,

175
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,980
but I'm holding back because
it's too disgusting to get involved in.

176
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,100
Hello, director.

177
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,370
Just a moment, Ms. Pi.

178
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
Yes?

179
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:37,879
Your crazy girl scene was pretty powerful.

180
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:41,649
Why? Did the rating board
tell you to cut it out?

181
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,820
No.

182
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,519
I noticed your energy
when I was editing the film.

183
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,220
I suggested we slip you in
whenever the story lags.

184
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,820
Did you really?

185
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,590
Thank you so much, director.

186
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,659
You can go.

187
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:56,899
Thank you, director.

188
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Why was she thanking you?

189
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,070
We're going to call her back
every now and then.

190
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,210
What? I have to work with her again?

191
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,240
Yes.

192
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,379
I plan to pit her against you
for some impactful scenes.

193
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,080
Director!

194
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,990
She's cheap to hire and is very worth it.

195
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:22,450
Darn it.

196
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,230
The blackmailer has some skill.

197
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,429
Woo Sang,
let's ask the director to fire her.

198
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:31,399
Leave her alone.

199
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,899
You're a better actress,
and you have a bigger role.

200
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,799
You have a huge advantage.

201
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,500
Why care so much about her?

202
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,269
You're right, but still.

203
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:46,080
Hi, Mom.

204
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:48,110
What is it now?

205
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,179
The hospital wants to
move the appointment.

206
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,590
Are you free on Monday two weeks from now?

207
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,320
Can't I just do it next month?

208
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,590
No.

209
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,659
You're already too busy.
What if you actually end up ill?

210
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,129
You're too eager.

211
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:03,529
Okay, fine.

212
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:06,059
Could you throw this out?

213
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,730
Why do you still have it?

214
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,399
Mom, are you going through my things?

215
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,440
The helper I hired does the cleaning,

216
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,840
but not well enough.

217
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,840
I have to check every detail.

218
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,279
Let's just learn to live with some dust.

219
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,710
Don't throw out anything that's mine.

220
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,750
No wonder the helpers never stay on.

221
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:25,220
They all quit for personal reasons.

222
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,490
You talk like they quit because of me.

223
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,659
Didn't you make them
want to have personal issues?

224
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:31,019
When did I...

225
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,759
Hello?

226
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:35,690
He hung up on me again.

227
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,529
Goodness.

228
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,340
He still has this old thing?

229
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:52,240
You'll leave Sang Ah and quit too?

230
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,909
Why on earth?

231
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:55,080
I don't think...

232
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,820
I mean that much to Sang Ah.

233
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,250
Why are you acting like a child?

234
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,460
Who would stay married
if they were to break up like that?

235
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,690
You should...

236
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,659
ask Sang Ah for the details.

237
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:11,799
I finished almost all my current projects.

238
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,929
I will...

239
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:16,539
hand over my tasks...

240
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,740
to whoever you hire to replace me.

241
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:23,480
I get how you feel.

242
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,279
I'll give you some time off.
Consider it a holiday to recuperate.

243
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,509
Think about it some more.

244
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:52,940
Honey.

245
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,850
Yes.

246
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,549
Do you have a house I'm looking for?

247
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,090
Is that so? Could I have a look today?

248
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,389
Great. Thank you.

249
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,399
Were you aware
they were going through this?

250
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,940
Not at all.

251
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,210
I heard about it this morning.

252
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,309
What's the reason?

253
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:31,879
So Woo told me to ask Sang Ah.

254
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,009
That means it's her fault.

255
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:37,379
Why would you conclude it was her fault?

256
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,149
All couples have issues
no one else knows about.

257
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:42,450
What on earth is this issue?

258
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,919
I think...

259
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,690
it was because of Tae Ri's accident.

260
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:54,669
Take a seat.

261
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,240
The breakup with So Woo.

262
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,539
Explain it yourself.

263
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,309
He's not the type to get up to no good.

264
00:16:04,409 --> 00:16:08,049
If he asked to leave you and resigned,
it means the problem is with you.

265
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,149
Our personalities clash.

266
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:14,090
They always do!
No one has the exact same personality!

267
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,850
That's just nonsense.

268
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,720
You.

269
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:21,490
Beg or plead.
Do whatever it takes to win him back.

270
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:23,429
I meant it when I said I wouldn't give...

271
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:25,600
an important job to someone
who couldn't manage a family.

272
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,370
I won't allow the divorce.

273
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:30,500
If you want to split up with him,
you'd better resign first!

274
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,509
(Jin Architecture)

275
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:49,190
I asked you
to put off the divorce for a while.

276
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,059
Are you pleased you got me in trouble?

277
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:54,059
I told you I wouldn't consider
your situation.

278
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,200
Must you really...
Is this what you are like?

279
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:59,000
How can you do this to me?

280
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:01,669
Why can't I?

281
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:03,970
Oh, right.

282
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,769
Fill this in and call me.

283
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:12,379
Fine. Let's get divorced!

284
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,380
Do you think I don't want to?

285
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:30,359
Darn you!

286
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,670
The phone is turned off.

287
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:40,410
Transferring to voicemail. Please leave...

288
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,740
Why is her phone still turned off?

289
00:17:50,849 --> 00:17:53,390
Here you are, Ms. Pi.

290
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,420
What are you doing?

291
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:58,619
We'll never sell the house
if we just trust you and wait.

292
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,059
I printed flyers to put up
and post all over the Internet.

293
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:03,799
(Asking for 400,000 dollars,
Open to negotiations)

294
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,759
What the heck?

295
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,500
Someone wants to see the house later.

296
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:10,569
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure of it this time.

297
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:12,769
- I feel the buzz.
- Do you really?

298
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:15,039
He looks like he knows nothing
about how the world works...

299
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,480
and knows nothing at all about houses,
but has a romantic view of them.

300
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,579
- You know the type!
- Easy prey.

301
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:21,779
Yes, that.

302
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:22,779
Get moving.

303
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,380
I'll clean the house a bit!

304
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,759
(Kindergarten)

305
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,430
Tae Ri. We're going to check out
a sweet home today.

306
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:44,240
On your phone?

307
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,039
This time, we'll see it in person.

308
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:49,009
Let's go.

309
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:54,950
Mom!

310
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,849
Mom, a buyer is coming.

311
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,450
What's the fuss about?

312
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:02,019
An easy prey... No, a buyer is coming.

313
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:03,559
Let's make the house sparkle.

314
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,589
I think the previous couple just left
because the house wasn't clean enough.

315
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:09,089
This time,
we must put everything on the line.

316
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,400
- Let's get to it.
- Okay.

317
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,099
The mold on the wall. Can we cover it up?

318
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,839
Hang on. Let me see.

319
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,740
The smudge is way too big.

320
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,740
- Oh, dear.
- Try hanging this up.

321
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,109
- Here goes.
- Be careful.

322
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:23,980
- It's perfect.
- That works.

323
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,210
This board is creaking.

324
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:28,750
Do we have something
we can put on this spot?

325
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:31,579
Get the footstool that's over there.

326
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:33,490
We don't have a footstool.

327
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,289
Find something else to put away.

328
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:38,119
Let's go inside.

329
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:45,130
They need to sell urgently.

330
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,730
I can get it down from the asking price.

331
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:49,200
- Can you?
- Yes.

332
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:50,869
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

333
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Come along.

334
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:56,509
- Hello. Come on in.
- We're here to look around.

335
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,309
- Come in.
- Goodness.

336
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,450
- Excuse us for intruding.
- Look around freely.

337
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,950
Take your time.

338
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,650
Our house has a lot of rooms.

339
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,349
There's an attic up the stairs.

340
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:09,250
It's my grandson's bedroom.

341
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:12,990
The kids love going
up and down the stairs.

342
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:14,559
Do you want to take a look?

343
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:17,059
Wait here, Tae Ri.

344
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,269
- Where are the stairs?
- Over there.

345
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:21,470
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

346
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:30,009
You can take a look around too.

347
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,079
The stairs creak a bit.

348
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,579
That's because
a few of the boards are warped.

349
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,720
Because the stairs creak,

350
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:44,420
the kid can never think of sneaking out.

351
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,460
Right.

352
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,259
Do you have just one son?

353
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:48,589
Yes.

354
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:52,559
Isn't this place
a bit too big for just one kid?

355
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,369
It's just perfect.

356
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:57,640
One room for Mom,
one room for Dad. No, wait.

357
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:01,670
A master bedroom. One room for your son.

358
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,339
A study, and a storage room. It's perfect.

359
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,450
Yes.

360
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,079
- Take your time and look around.
- I will.

361
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,960
Tae Ri.

362
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,829
What do you think?

363
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,329
You don't like it?

364
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,799
It's not that.
It's the first house we saw.

365
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,740
I'd like to check out
a few more places first.

366
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:34,240
You should do that.
You should check the neighborhood.

367
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,069
Thanks for your time.

368
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:37,380
- Sure.
- Bye.

369
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,940
- You can come by again.
- I'll be in touch.

370
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,309
- Okay.
- Let's go, Tae Ri.

371
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:42,180
- Bye, kid.
- Take care. Goodbye.

372
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,319
See you again.

373
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,150
Bye.

374
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,160
Well? Do you think he'll buy the house?

375
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,289
He looks like a simpleton,

376
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:58,160
but he commented on the stairs
and looked around thoroughly.

377
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,869
He doesn't seem like a complete pushover.

378
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:04,240
We did our best, Mom.

379
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:05,569
Yes.

380
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:19,319
I know all about what you did,

381
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:23,349
but I'm holding back because
it's too disgusting to get involved in.

382
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,700
He's the one to back off first.

383
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,069
Hey. Your car is nice and fancy.

384
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,509
We should've
driven around the neighborhood in it.

385
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:45,539
Mom. I can't stay for long.

386
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,079
I have to get back.

387
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,650
Oh, right. Did you two...

388
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,750
really sign the divorce papers?

389
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,789
Yes.

390
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:56,519
Should I block her number, then?

391
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,460
I have to get back.

392
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,390
Should I block her or not?

393
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:03,130
What should I do?

394
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:18,210
Mom. Eat this.

395
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:25,950
Oh, dear.

396
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:30,319
My goodness.

397
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,460
You're all grown up.

398
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,750
Here you go.

399
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,099
What did you think of the houses you saw?

400
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,769
I liked them.

401
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,670
Which did you like the most?

402
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,339
Let's see. This one.

403
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:21,839
- This house?
- Yes.

404
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,319
We worked so hard...

405
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,619
to clean the place.

406
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:37,059
He should say if he liked it or not.

407
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Hang on.

408
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,059
Hello?

409
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:48,069
For real?

410
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:50,700
Right now?

411
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,000
Okay.

412
00:24:56,769 --> 00:24:58,309
Mom!

413
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:00,809
You might bust my eardrums. What is it?

414
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,980
Mom. He wants to buy the house.

415
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,250
Right now.

416
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,549
What? Is that true?

417
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:09,549
Yes. The guy who was here
wants to sign the contract now.

418
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,789
He really must be easy prey.

419
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,490
Should we have asked for more money?

420
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,460
No, I don't think so.

421
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,660
Let's go before the pushover
changes his mind.

422
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,140
Do you think we should call Seon Ju too?

423
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,240
I haven't been able to reach her
all day today.

424
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,839
Try calling her again.

425
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:35,849
(Jin Ju)

426
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,359
Does it not taste good?

427
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,990
It's not that. It tastes good.

428
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:53,160
I just can't seem to eat fast.

429
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,940
The person is unable to answer...

430
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,940
She won't pick up.

431
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:10,450
It might not look nice
if we were to flock over...

432
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,319
just to sign some papers.

433
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:13,990
Lock the door, Jin Ju.

434
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,720
- Okay.
- I'll head over there first.

435
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:18,490
Mom, wait.

436
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:20,559
He asked if we could move out soon.

437
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,390
(Real Estate Purchase Contract)

438
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,299
- Read it through.
- Okay.

439
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,539
They will move out in a fortnight.

440
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,440
Since you're looking to sell urgently,

441
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,339
the down payment will be half...

442
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:38,940
of the full price,
which amounts to 187,500 dollars.

443
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,509
You won't find
another buyer this generous.

444
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,480
You found the perfect person to sell to.

445
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,849
Shall we sign and affix your seals, then?

446
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:50,920
- Yes.
- Great.

448
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:08,170
Why do I feel so strange?

449
00:27:09,009 --> 00:27:10,410
My heart is aching.

450
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,509
Stamp your seal already.

451
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:12,910
When a woman called Kim Bo Ram...

452
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:17,519
called numerous times
suggesting we pull down a few houses...

453
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,819
and build a small apartment complex,

454
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,519
I still refused to sell.

455
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:26,160
I get it.
I'll take good care of the house.

456
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,359
I'm not just saying this
because I'm the seller.

457
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,900
The house was like my other child.

458
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,529

Mom.

462
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,680
Stamp your seal already.

463
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:49,309
You're embarrassing your real daughter.

464
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:53,720
Will you really look after the place
and live happily?

465
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,890
And cherish it?

466
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,160
Yes. Don't worry.

You get your revenge today.

471
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:44,170
Can't I punch her?

472
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,170
That wasn't hard enough.
I'll do another take.

473
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,269
Nam Jin and I split up.

474
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:50,710
He's in love with someone else.

475
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,809
I'm okay, but I feel so bad for you, Mom.

If you can't get So Woo to come back,
I'll empty your office!

He and I are too different.
