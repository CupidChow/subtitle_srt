1
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:11,859
Watch out!

2
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,639
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

3
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:33,310
My word.

4
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:35,350
That was close.

5
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,589
I can't believe you saved my life...

6
00:00:39,819 --> 00:00:41,420
the very day we first met.

7
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,520
Isn't this a huge sign?

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,020
Yes.

9
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,789
Right. What we were talking about.

10
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:49,759
When will your divorce be finalized?

11
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,100
I'll be done for good
with the kid's dad soon.

12
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:58,300
But I'm not yet ready to...

13
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,440
Wait.

14
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,870
"The kid's dad?"

15
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,009
You have a kid?

16
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:05,779
Yes.

17
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,420
Oh, you have a kid...

18
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,850
I didn't know about that.

19
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,690
That's a huge deal.

20
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:17,860
I see.

21
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:20,160
My gosh.

22
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry,
but I don't think we're a good match.

23
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:28,300
I'm really sorry.

24
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:32,970
You can go back to the pagoda
and take the leftover pajeon.

25
00:01:33,309 --> 00:01:34,770
I'll take the makgeolli.

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,780
My gosh.

27
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,919
Did he just reject me?

28
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,649
Goodness.

29
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,089
I didn't even want to meet him.

30
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:49,690
This is unbelievable.

31
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,789
You can't do this ever again.

32
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:55,759
I get that you're trying to be caring,

33
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,500
but I'm in no position to remarry,
and I'm not interested.

34
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:01,069
Please don't do this.

35
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:03,839
I was as polite as I could be to Yu Ra...

36
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:07,910
Hey. Did you meet the guy?

37
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,440
- How did things go?
- You too?

38
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,580
You too?

39
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,050
How was it?

40
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:15,509
My gosh...

41
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,650
Do you even need to ask?

42
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,319
He's way better-looking than Jeon Nam Jin.

43
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,590
He had this air about him.

44
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,190
You want a guy who looks just like him...

45
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,660
or they act like
they're better than others, like Nam Jin.

46
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:32,370
Do you think selling fried chicken
is a worse job than an architect?

47
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,669
He could make a fortune if things go well.

48
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:37,000
I bet he makes way more than Nam Jin.

49
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,600
Stop it, Mom!

50
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,340
Don't just accentuate
the fried chicken place.

51
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,739
He's a police officer too.

52
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,680
Hey, he's in Violent Crimes.
Isn't that cool?

53
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,180
Stop it, Jin Ju.

54
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,880
I get why Mom is doing this,
but why are you playing along?

55
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,150
I'd be so embarrassed
if others were to find out.

56
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:55,389
Hey.

57
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,789
I'd love to go on a blind date,
but no one will set me up.

58
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,229
People are volunteering to help you
when you're not even divorced yet.

59
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:04,759
I've been widowed for so long,

60
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,769
but no one cares about me.

61
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,500
I asked Mom if I could
meet the policeman and she said no.

62
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,940
Mom. How could you?

63
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,009
That hurt.

64
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:19,509
Listen. Kyung Ae's mom...

65
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,680
showed him both your photos,

66
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,019
and he insisted on meeting Seon Ju.

67
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,190
I didn't tell you in case you got upset.

68
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:28,549
Is that true?

69
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:31,489
What's wrong with him?

70
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,460
Darn it.

71
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,329
Anyway, Mom.

72
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:40,430
Don't go and do something silly
like this again.

73
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:42,900
Oh, my gosh.

74
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,440
Why does my head ache all of a sudden?

75
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:48,310
Oh, dear. My head is splitting open.

76
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:51,079
Oh, gosh.

77
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,780
She's a nice person,

78
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,750
but I can't handle it when she does that.

79
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,780
Neither can I. She's such a troublemaker.

80
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,120
And she's getting worse with age.

81
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,590
I apologize instead.

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,930
- It's fine.
- Seon Ju!

83
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,759
Get over here!

84
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,970
Let's go.

85
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,639
Something happened
in a park in Manjang-dong today.

86
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,009
It became known
when two young content creators...

87
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,109
- submitted their footage.
- Mom.

88
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,749
- You're on TV.
- A small woman...

89
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:28,650
notices a boulder falling from above...

90
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,720
and throws herself onto a much bigger man.

91
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,850
A boulder fell from a mountain
in a park in Seoul today.

92
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:37,789
You just saw footage...

93
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:39,890
two YouTubers filmed of the incident.

94
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,160
We managed to secure an interview
with the young lady.

95
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,129
How did you feel at the time?

96
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:48,369
(Ms. Pi)

97
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,710
My mind went blank at the time.

98
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:55,070
I just thought I'd die.

99
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,910
I think that was why...

100
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,350
I jumped on him like this
to get him out of the way.

101
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:03,419
Did you know the man you saved?

102
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,320
No, we'd just met today.

103
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,890
Then for a complete stranger...

104
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:13,660
Well, no. He's not a complete stranger.

105
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:14,989
It was...

106
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,030
It was a blind date.

107
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,470
I see.

108
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,039
It's hard to find someone
who'd risk their life to save someone...

109
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,369
they'd just met in real life.

110
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,179
We're reminded
to break away from stereotypes...

111
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:32,239
that smaller people are weak...

112
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,150
You're so brave, Auntie.

113
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,879
You actually did an interview?

114
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,220
Only because she offered me these.

115
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,950
She begged me to make a few comments.

116
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,789
You said you didn't want others to know,

117
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:45,960
but you broadcasted it yourself.

118
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,929
I didn't know they'd play it all.

119
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:51,429
Why didn't they cut out
the part where I whispered?

120
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,869
And I swear I asked them
to blur out my face.

121
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,780
My goodness.

122
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,510
That's unbelievable. Nam Jin.

123
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:09,619
- My gosh.
- What is it?

124
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:12,619
Go online and watch a replay
of today's MBS news.

125
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,950
- The news?
- Yes.

126
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,160
This report here.

127
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,629
Play that part.

128
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,700
(Ms. Pi, "How did you feel at the time?")

129
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,869
My mind went blank at the time.

130
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:30,900
I just thought I'd die.

131
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:32,669
I think that was why...

132
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:35,669
I jumped on him like this
to get him out of the way.

133
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:38,840
Did you know the man you saved?

134
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,609
No, we'd just met today.

135
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,220
Then for a complete stranger...

136
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:46,820
Well, no. He's not a complete stranger.

137
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,989
It was...

138
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,289
It was a blind date.

139
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:53,460
I see.

140
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,059
It's hard to find someone...

141
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:58,999
- who'd risk their life to save someone...
- How humiliating is that?

142
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,330
- they'd just met in real life.
- I don't dare say that's your ex.

143
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,640
She went on a blind date.

144
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,939
She went on a blind date
and you had an affair.

145
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,739
There's not much of a difference.

146
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:10,739
You don't need to feel bad at all.

147
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:14,410
She went on a blind date?

148
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,020
What now?

149
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,030
Your blind date is now a part of history.

150
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,359
Are you teasing me?

151
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,530
It was a joke topped with concern,
but it didn't seem to work.

152
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,299
How could you?

153
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:35,669
Hang on.

154
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:38,169
I got a message.

155
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:43,179
You said you were not yet ready
to meet someone.

156
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:49,109
I know you said that
because you felt bad for me.

157
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:51,950
I think both love and marriage...

158
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,090
are a lot like plastic surgery.

159
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,929
If we only operated on those
who decided to get surgery and came to us,

160
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,359
not that many people out there
would become pretty.

161
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,400
But...

162
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,739
those who take just one brave step...

163
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:12,970
get to live a whole new life.

164
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:19,679
Would you like to take that step with me
and venture into a new world and life?

165
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,220
Will you tell your mother...

166
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,749
not to do this ever again?

167
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:29,919
I will.

168
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,600
Are you asleep?

169
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,570
- Hello?
- Seon Ju.

170
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,570
- Are you asleep?
- What?

171
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,479
I saw the news.

172
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,639
I'm grateful that you saved me
from the falling boulder,

173
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,050
and so I called because the news
reminded me of what happened.

174
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:57,519
But there's our reality to consider.

175
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:01,050
Shall we give it a go anyway?

176
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,190
What? Give what a go?

177
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,920
I think I can. What about you?

178
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:10,560
Mister. You sound very drunk.

179
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:14,899
If you record your calls,
play this back when you're sober tomorrow.

180
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,700
For now, you should go to bed.

181
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,899
Seon Ju!

182
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,440
I liked you a lot, Seon Ju!

183
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,580
Oh, my gosh. What the heck?

184
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,950
Your blind date.

185
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,019
He sounded a bit weird.

186
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:39,119
Is he really a police officer?

187
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,129
He doesn't look like one.

188
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,999
He said he was,
and he runs a fried chicken place too.

189
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,170
Maybe your blind date...

190
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,670
won the favor of the deities from above.

191
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,840
Let's go upstairs.

192
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,649
Why the heck did I do that interview?

193
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,690
I'm exhausted.

194
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,460
Why did it take so long?

195
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:20,930
You must be tired after all that driving.

196
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,800
I'm fine.

197
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:24,869
- Did you just get back?
- Yes.

198
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,279
I had some friends over,
so there's a stack of dirty dishes.

199
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,609
Wash them before bed.

200
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:32,850
Okay.

201
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,920
I think hiring her was a good idea.

202
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,220
Right?

203
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,090
Darn you.

204
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,399
Why make you do this now
when you could do it tomorrow?

205
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,470
It's not nice to keep
dirty dishes out too long.

206
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:58,499
I'll wash them real fast and go to bed.

207
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,109
We have an early start tomorrow.

208
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:06,139
What's this? Is it a love letter?

209
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,149
Don't read it.

210
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,220
It's to "Han Man Eun?"

211
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,149
What kind of name is that?

212
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,859
What's so funny about that name?

213
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,659
It sounds weird, like a silly nickname.

214
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,060
It's my mom's name.

215
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:23,129
If your mom is called "Han Man Eun,"

216
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:24,629
is your dad called "Dae Dong Gang?"

217
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,600
Who'd name someone that?

218
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:30,100
Her family is from Cheonju
and her name means "full blessings."

219
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,040
"Han Man Eun" is my mom's name.

220
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,040
- For real?
- Would I lie about that?

221
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,210
It's a name
that tugs at your heartstrings.

222
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,550
There's pathos.

223
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:46,019
Whatever.

224
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,550
I mean it.

225
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,359
It sounds like
there's a whole story behind it.

226
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,920
What a great name to have.

227
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,859
Forget it.

228
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:56,229
You're getting on my nerves. Go away.

229
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:58,999
You wrote a letter to your mom?

230
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,999
Only because...

231
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,300
I couldn't talk on the phone.

232
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:05,369
What did you say?

233
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,470
That I'd make lots of money...

234
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:09,979
and get our house back.

235
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,879
That she shouldn't grow old too fast.

236
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,779
Did you lose your house?

237
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,909
Will you...

238
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,879
Oh, no.

239
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,850
Hey.

240
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,550
Why did you use your bare hands?

241
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,320
You made me take off the rubber gloves.

242
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:35,369
Do you need help?

243
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,840
No.

244
00:12:45,609 --> 00:12:48,749
Hey, leave it. I'll do the rest.

245
00:12:48,979 --> 00:12:50,019
But...

246
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,119
I'll be fine with the gloves.

247
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,590
I'm not taking over
as a favor for an underling.

248
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,060
You're hurt.

249
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,889
Call this an employer looking out for
his employee's welfare.

250
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:04,399
Don't you fall for me.

251
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,129
I don't have any feelings for you.

252
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,330
Why do you keep worrying about that?

253
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:23,519
What is it?

254
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:26,820
Choon Hyang's sister Pi Mi Ju moved into
Woo Sang's as a live-in caregiver.

255
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,389
- So what?
- What if they end up...

256
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,519
discussing the accident
while they're living together?

257
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,129
The accident?
Why can't they talk about it?

258
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:36,759
She did cause the accident.

259
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,629
We settled with them,
so what's the problem?

260
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:40,330
Well...

261
00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:44,570
That's right.

262
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,639
She caused the accident.

263
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,409
I'm off. Bye.

264
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:03,420
Then for a complete stranger...

265
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,930
Well, no. He's not a complete stranger.

266
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,190
It was...

267
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,100
(Ms. Pi, "For a complete stranger?")

268
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:11,259
It was a blind date.

269
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,129
I see.

270
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,369
- It's hard to find someone...
- Pi Seon Ju.

271
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:17,970
- who'd risk their life...
- What a mess.

272
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,139
to save someone
they'd just met in real life.

273
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:27,279
(Jin Architecture)

274
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,229
Mr. Jeon. Why are you moving?

275
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,529
Well...

276
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:48,970
Mr. Jeon.
Work with me in my office from now on.

277
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,600
While we compete on the Hansung project,

278
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,369
Mr. Kim will share his office
with his designer.

279
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:55,570
We should do the same.

280
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,109
For security's sake.

281
00:14:58,479 --> 00:14:59,479
Right...

282
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,850
Will this do?

283
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,489
Yes, thank you.

284
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:19,700
Why didn't you tell me about the move?

285
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,869
I was flustered
because I couldn't explain.

286
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,369
Why would you be flustered?

287
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:26,070
Focus on coming up with
a perfect business proposal.

288
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,379
The width...

289
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:42,619
Goodness.

290
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,420
Well...

291
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,529
Once we beat them,
they'll have no excuse to stay on.

292
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:52,800
They'd be too ashamed to stay.

293
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,070
And my dad will see us in a new light.

294
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,499
But remember this.

295
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,109
You can serve her
and grovel at her feet all you want,

296
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:06,040
but you'll amount to nothing more
than her minion.

297
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,779
Wait.

298
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:01,029
My gosh.

299
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,840
You dislike the last place that much?

300
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,540
It looked too old.

301
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,879
How could that cost over 700,000 dollars?

302
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:12,939
The area will be redeveloped
because it's old,

303
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,709
and it's expensive
because it'll be redeveloped.

304
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,149
You got the cause and effect all wrong.

305
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:20,419
Don't you have a clean,
atmospheric place...

306
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,750
that looks cozy and fits my budget?

307
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,219
Are you looking for a place with a view...

308
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:27,530
that's also close to a subway station?

309
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,560
It's an investment,
so I want the best if possible.

310
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,669
Fine. Let's check out
the next place, then.

311
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,100
Hey.

312
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:37,969
Wait for me.

313
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:42,010
- What's this?
- What's what?

314
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,010
Look at this.

315
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,050
"A woman cheated on her husband
whom she works with,"

316
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:50,280
"and her lover's ex-wife
got a job with her."

317
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,449
"So all four are working together."

318
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,320
Read the comments.

319
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,959
"What? What are you saying?"

320
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,790
"How can a cheater work with her husband?"

321
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,689
"Don't you mean she works with her lover?"

322
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,359
"It says all four met up."

323
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,330
"The story checks out. Read it again."

324
00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:06,899
"It's the world's worst combination."

325
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,439
Isn't this about them?

326
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:13,909
It must be.
This kind of story can't be common.

327
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,109
What's going on?

328
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:18,080
Why are we so famous?

329
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:21,010
Do you think they'll become
online celebrities?

330
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:23,080
To think that we work with such people.

331
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,449
It's an honor.

332
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:27,449
What?

333
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,459
Someone posted about it
on an anonymous website?

334
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:33,290
Okay. I got it.

335
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:36,800
What's the matter?

336
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,040
This is humiliating.

337
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,139
- I must go to work.
- Okay.

338
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,490
She started
working for my family yesterday.

339
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,090
Hello. I'll see you every now and then.

340
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,109
(Arcade entrance)

341
00:19:34,949 --> 00:19:36,050
Darn it.

342
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,810
- My gosh.
- What's wrong?

343
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:55,139
Are you okay?

344
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:56,409
Oh, dear.

345
00:19:58,209 --> 00:19:59,240
Is she hurt?

346
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:08,949
Hello?

347
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:12,760
What? Chu Ah passed out?

348
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:19,429
She fainted in the middle of a street.

349
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,570
How come?

350
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,899
Nothing is wrong with her, though.

351
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:25,740
I think she was under a lot of stress.

352
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,469
Okay. So it's not serious?

353
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,179
She can go home
once she wakes from her nap.

354
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,080
See you at home later.

355
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,149
Okay.

356
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:37,520
She could be weak
because she tried to lose weight.

357
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:39,080
Tell her to eat well.

358
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,419
- I will.
- Bye, then.

359
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:43,990
Hello.

360
00:20:56,369 --> 00:20:57,500
You're awake.

361
00:20:57,699 --> 00:20:58,740
Mom.

362
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:02,639
Call Woo Sang and tell him I fainted.

363
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,139
You call him.

364
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:07,810
How can someone who fainted use a phone?

365
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:09,050
Call him for me.

366
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,449
Why do you need my help with that?

367
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:13,449
Be as foxy as you can be and seduce him.

368
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:15,419
Did you seduce Dad by being foxy?

369
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,959
How did you marry him?

370
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,619
Tell me.

371
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,290
I didn't seduce him.

372
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,459
How did you two meet?

373
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,699
You only said a friend introduced you.

374
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,699
What was Dad like when you first met him?

375
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:30,969
When we first met?

376
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:38,609
What's taking her so long
to buy a packet of noodles?

377
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:43,480
An old man from Seoul
about to board a train for the first time

378
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,949
Excuse me.

379
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,290
Gosh.

380
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:51,590
I couldn't believe
someone so elegant existed.

381
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,659
Do you want your hair done?

382
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:54,389
- He was so handsome.
- No.

383
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:56,389
- I don't know her name...
- He's handsome even now,

384
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:59,330
but he was
so much more of a looker back then.

385
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,030
Even young girls these days
would've fallen for him.

386
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,570
I wanted him to like me,

387
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,709
so I secretly spat out the chewing gum
I'd just put into my mouth...

388
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:11,179
and stuck it to a wheeled tray.

389
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:14,510
I think I fell for him that very moment.

390
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,550
You're a romantic
who goes for a guy's looks.

391
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Am I?

392
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,659
What did you do when you first met?

393
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,260
He took me out in his car.

394
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:02,159
He took you out back then?

395
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,359
How sweet.

396
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,000
So how did you get him to marry you?

397
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:11,139
I went to where he lived...

398
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,570
and asked for a cup of tea.

399
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:16,840
(38 Hangang-dong)

400
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:34,330
I said I'd come to the hospital.

401
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:37,500
You're busy with your wife's funeral.

402
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
Here.

403
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:48,070
- Thanks.
- She's so pretty.

404
00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:49,270
Just like your wife.

405
00:23:49,709 --> 00:23:52,980
How about you? Are you all right?

406
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:55,949
My back...

407
00:23:56,909 --> 00:23:59,320
still aches a bit, but I'm fine.

408
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,820
First, you saved my father's life,

409
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,889
and now my child's.

410
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,760
Thanks so much.

411
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:10,500
It's nothing, really.

412
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:16,100
I'm a bit thirsty.
Can I have a cup of tea?

413
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,300
Yes, sure. Come in.

414
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:34,290
My gosh. You went to Dad's home?

415
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,459
Back then,
it was the guys who did the courting.

416
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,159
But I took the initiative in a way.

417
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,230
I see...

418
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,550
The new hire.

419
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,050
The one who works with Mr. Kim.

420
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,659
Ms. Pi Seon Ju?

421
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,629
Yes. Tell her to come see me.

422
00:25:17,699 --> 00:25:19,030
Her portfolio...

423
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,899
was full of effort like a journal
that was kept for a long time.

424
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:25,000
I thought...

425
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,810
her interpretation of space
matched our vision.

426
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:32,609
What on earth is she like?

427
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,750
The CEO wants to see me?

428
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:40,020
- What for?
- I don't really know.

429
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:43,419
Okay. I'll come over.

430
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,730
Tell her to eat well.

431
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:54,199
Bye, then.

432
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:56,730
Hello.

433
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,750
Come in.

434
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,359
Take a seat.

435
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,010
Ms. Pi Seon Ju.

436
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,879
You were married to Mr. Jeon?

437
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:18,379
Yes. We're waiting
for our divorce to be finalized.

438
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,719
That means
you're the person in the video...

439
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:25,919
who was also mentioned
in the anonymous post.

440
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,760
I just don't get it.

441
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:33,159
Why did you accept a job
at a company where your ex...

442
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:34,530
and Sang Ah work?

443
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:42,139
- Well...
- Mr. Kim told me...

444
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:43,840
you were a promising talent.

445
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:46,540
But word is spreading like wildfire,

446
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,109
and I don't want...

447
00:27:49,449 --> 00:27:52,619
my company to be
reduced to a laughingstock.

448
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,949
I want you to leave.

449
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:10,869
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

450
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:28,919
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

451
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,490
Does Pi Mi Ju come into your bedroom?

452
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:31,659
My gosh.

453
00:28:34,889 --> 00:28:35,959
You went on a blind date.

454
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:38,859
You called me all sorts of things
for having an affair.

455
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,060
What?

456
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,030
That man is perfect for you.

457
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,540
I didn't join the company to get revenge.

458
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,169
I don't think it's right to stay on.

459
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,540
