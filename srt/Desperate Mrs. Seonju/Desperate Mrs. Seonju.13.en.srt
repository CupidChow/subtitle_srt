1
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,530
You said we could be serious about it
and then end up planning a future.

2
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:14,889
That must've meant something.

3
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,300
I meant that was a possibility.

4
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:19,969
My husband and I have no serious issues.

5
00:00:20,569 --> 00:00:23,600
Should I ask for a split
just because he can be annoying?

6
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:24,639
That means you're not compatible.

7
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:27,339
He was always boring and annoying.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,909
So don't be bothered.

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,740
Why would you go overboard
when I'm fine as things are?

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,280
You challenged me by asking
if I had the guts to leave Seon Ju.

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,249
You said I had to make you my priority.

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,019
That meant ending things with her.

13
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:39,519
How could I do that and still be with her?

14
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:41,720
I can't just leave my husband over that.

15
00:00:42,919 --> 00:00:43,919
You can't?

16
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,559
Let's quit the affair, then.
It's not fun anymore.

17
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:49,199
What?

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,370
It's not fun being a candy
you're weighing out in each hand.

19
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,839
Don't walk off like this.
It's over if you do.

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,010
Hey.

21
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:11,820
What an utter mess.

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,289
But why did I run away out of guilt?

23
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:15,390
Where were you at, Chu Ah?

24
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:18,220
So Woo. I came back from the park.

25
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:22,360
- This late at night?
- I was with Sang Ah.

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,929
We needed some air.

27
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:25,459
Oh, I see.

28
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:28,030
We were at the park together.

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,869
You walk way too slowly.

30
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,670
Why are you out here?

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,470
Something came up at work.

32
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:37,440
I won't be out for long. Go on inside.

33
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:38,810
Okay.

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,890
Sang Ah. We need to talk.

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,050
What's going on?

36
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,459
Sit down.

37
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,789
- I saw everything.
- Everything what?

38
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:56,330
You two talking about affairs...

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,730
I heard you mention affairs and divorce.

40
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,569
Did you?

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,140
Why ask if you saw everything?

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,140
Is that for real? I didn't mishear you?

43
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:07,739
He said "spouses."

44
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,539
Is he married too?

45
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:12,239
- Yes.
- No way. What does he do?

46
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:13,450
Is he rich?

47
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,310
Is he cuter than So Woo?

48
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,350
Not that much.

49
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,689
If he's not rich
or much cuter than So Woo,

50
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,390
why would you cheat with him?

51
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,589
Are you like your Choon Hyang friend
who likes to look after poor guys?

52
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:29,130
- What?
- So Woo left his family to be with us.

53
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,360
Men don't live with their in-laws
if they can afford not to.

54
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,969
Your Choon Hyang friend
sent her husband abroad to study,

55
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:36,670
and you married a guy
who lives with and works for us.

56
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,969
I'll tell Mom.

57
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,869
- Darn you. You brat.
- Hey.

58
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,510
Did I say I'd divorce So Woo
and live with that guy?

59
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,510
You said you heard everything.

60
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,149
What will you do, then? He seemed annoyed.

61
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,550
Let's quit the affair, then.
It's not fun anymore.

62
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:54,249
What?

63
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:58,459
It's not fun being a candy
you're weighing out in each hand.

64
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,929
Should I just get them divorced?

65
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,700
You said you wouldn't marry him.
Why would you get them divorced?

66
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:07,570
Just because.

67
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,269
- Because I want to steal him.
- What?

68
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,869
I want to steal him...

69
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:14,010
from someone.

70
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,779
What? Who is that someone?

71
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,510
Do you know who his wife is?

72
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,050
You're insane.

73
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,580
Who is he married to?

74
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:25,179
Some woman.

75
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,459
(Myungmoon University)

76
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:32,089
(Design Department Practical Exam Hall)

77
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:33,660
Run. Let's hurry.

78
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,559
- Seon Ju.
- Hey. Good luck, Sang Ah.

79
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,760
Here.

80
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:39,830
You were running. Drink this.

81
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,670
Hey, thanks a lot.

82
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,339
- Seon Ju.
- Shouldn't you go inside?

83
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:48,869
I'll open it for you. Here.

84
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,339
You're too kind.

85
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,380
- Let's go inside.
- Okay. Good luck.

86
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,420
Thanks.

87
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:13,369
Hey, Jin Sang Ah.

88
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,540
- Yes?
- Did you...

89
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,969
spike the drink you gave me?

90
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,269
Who, me?

91
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,140
I see you ruined the exam
with all the trips to the toilet,

92
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,580
but you're blaming me for it?

93
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,449
I didn't eat anything
that could've caused a stomachache.

94
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:31,550
The drink you gave me was the only thing.

95
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,319
I see why you suspect me.

96
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,119
But making sure...

97
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:39,160
you feel your best
on exam day is a skill too.

98
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,369
- My stomach hurts so bad.
- Are you all right?

99
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:50,900
Whoever that is, you must hate her a lot.

100
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,910
That was years ago.
I didn't know I still hated her so much.

101
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,139
I guess I do.

102
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:58,679
What's she like?

103
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:41,520
Just setting eyes on her ruins my mood.

104
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,360
But we met again.

105
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,259
Now that I know he is her husband,

106
00:05:46,989 --> 00:05:48,759
I don't ever want to let him go.

107
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,699
I want to torment her
until I'm sick and tired of it.

108
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,499
I want to get to him for real.

109
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,699
Why? Why would you do that?

110
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:02,470
Do you remember
our live-in helper's daughter?

111
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,079
I do. We bullied her so much.

112
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,749
We took her puppy and made it ours.

113
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,119
Having a pet was actually a hassle,

114
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,590
but we couldn't stand seeing her...

115
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:15,790
look so happy with the darn thing.

116
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:18,189
Oh, I get it right away.

117
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,929
You're great at explaining stuff.

118
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:23,860
We wanted to take or ruin
anything she enjoyed,

119
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,869
and we had to make her do
whatever she hated to do.

120
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,170
Taking from her filled us
with a strange euphoria.

121
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,840
Totally.

122
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,410
Watching him trying to go back to her...

123
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,809
made me want to split them up.

124
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,710
You're a formidable foe.

125
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:44,020
Don't you feel sorry for So Woo, though?

126
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,879
Even just now,

127
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:49,689
he looked like a farmhand
working day and night for his master.

128
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,829
Be quiet.
And watch your tongue for a while.

129
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:56,360
Nothing's for free. Do me a favor.

130
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,559
Goodness.

131
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,770
You should practice your lines
with such gusto.

132
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,129
Hey!

133
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,639
You can't walk off like that.

134
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,040
The person is unable to answer the phone.

135
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,079
What does she think a phone is for?
Does she think it's for soup broth?

136
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,550
It won't add anything to the flavor.

137
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,350
What happened to her?

138
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:20,590
She met with her friend yesterday
to talk things out.

139
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:22,960
She must have some news by now.

140
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,619
Do you think she's asleep?

141
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,889
Yes. Try again tomorrow.

142
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:47,150
I doubt she went to bed this early.

143
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,449
It's not her bedtime yet.

144
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:52,889
She usually goes to sleep at midnight,
but sometimes she stays up all night.

145
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:53,989
Right?

146
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:56,360
Should I try calling her?

147
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,220
Yes, you try.

148
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,369
The person is unable to answer the phone.

149
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:17,210
She's not answering. I don't like it.

150
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,009
Don't say that.
You're making me feel uneasy too.

151
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,249
Should I have gone too?

152
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:27,920
It might've helped
if I had been there to beg and plead.

153
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:29,350
I doubt that.

154
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,059
I didn't say anything to Mom,

155
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,230
but Seon Ju would've called overjoyed
if things had worked in our favor.

156
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,429
Yes. When she got the call
from her friend asking to meet,

157
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,099
she called us in excitement.

158
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,170
Did something else happen...

159
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,469
that was big enough
to make her forget all about that?

160
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,439
What could that possibly be?

161
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:51,380
Don't even say something that scary.

162
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,179
I don't like this feeling.

163
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,300
We should consider...

164
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,459
parting ways too.

165
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,929
How could he say that?

166
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,179
Who is it?

167
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,109
It's me. Open up.

168
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,449
Goodness.

169
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:32,750
- Mother.
- My goodness.

170
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,089
It's heavy.

171
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,530
Why didn't you answer your phone?

172
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,300
I put it on vibrate
while putting Ji Hyun to bed.

173
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,559
What's all this?

174
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,699
I have lots of washing to do,
but the washing machine broke down.

175
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,339
Wash them for me.

176
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:52,569
- Okay.
- Did Nam Jin mention...

177
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,209
if he needed anything
while staying at a dorm?

178
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:57,979
Make him side dishes often,
and take them to him.

179
00:09:58,079 --> 00:09:59,910
And try not to nag.

180
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,849
Mother.

181
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,319
What?

182
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,949
You're on my side, aren't you, Mother?

183
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:10,459
- What?
- If Nam Jin...

184
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:14,260
and I got into a fight,
who would you side with?

185
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:15,359
My goodness.

186
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:18,359
You're adults. Why would I take sides?

187
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:20,229
I was so good to you...

188
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,500
and to Nam Jin for years. Wasn't I?

189
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,599
What the heck?

190
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,780
Call the hotline and arrange a repair
for my washing machine tomorrow. Okay?

191
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,339
I'm leaving.

192
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,209
Okay.

193
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:57,199
Darn it.

194
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:17,459
Says who?

195
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:20,660
You changed the plans
while I was on a business trip.

196
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,829
Why would you want to learn ballet
at your age?

197
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:25,099
Do the washing instead.

198
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:27,429
On TV, even the men learn to dance.

199
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,429
I wanted to learn something too.

200
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,069
Are you paying for the new house?

201
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:34,540
Why isn't Mr. Kim here yet?

202
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:36,579
- Well...
- Hello, sir.

203
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,349
She hadn't told her husband
about the dance studio.

204
00:11:48,349 --> 00:11:51,790
Mr. Kim. I said I wanted
a home theater in that space.

205
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,559
How could you change the plan
without my permission?

206
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,189
Who's paying for the construction?

207
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:57,559
Change it back.

208
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:00,370
You wanted to live in a house
with a garden,

209
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,870
so I'm uprooting myself
to an area where I don't know anyone.

210
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,900
Can't I have just one room?

211
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,969
You can't.

212
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:08,010
Put the theater back in.

213
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,510
Or I won't settle the balance.

214
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,920
You said you'd discussed it
with your husband.

215
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,120
I would've tried if I could have.

216
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,219
Why are you still in there?

217
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:30,199
I apologize.

218
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,069
My husband and I have no serious issues.

219
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,910
I can't just leave my husband over that.

220
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,349
Who's that?

221
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,490
What on earth...

222
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,229
What's with the suitcase?

223
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:39,900
Did you leave home?
I thought you were staying at a dorm.

224
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:43,969
Were you fired?

225
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:46,000
No.

226
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,339
I want some peace and quiet
for a few days.

227
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:54,050
"For a few days?" Here?

228
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:16,939
Hey.

229
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,270
This is the bag she borrowed.

230
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,479
If she put this with the laundry...

231
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,750
I should wash this too.

232
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:41,229
- Hello?
- I need you to get some samples tomorrow.

233
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:42,859
Tomorrow's a public holiday.

234
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,800
We're on the verge of signing a new job.

235
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,130
Let's show the client some samples...

236
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,599
to sway them to our side.

237
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Our business' future depends on...

238
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,640
whether we get this job or not.

239
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:57,209
Okay, then.

240
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,329
What's going on?

241
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,229
Don't tell Seon Ju I'm staying here.

242
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,370
You two are fighting, aren't you?

243
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,969
She asked me today
if I'd side with her if you two fought.

244
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,410
If you left home,
I see she was in the wrong.

245
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:37,620
Hey.

246
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,020
Did she lose your savings?

247
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:43,420
I want to sleep. Get the light.

248
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,030
It's about money.

249
00:15:56,229 --> 00:15:57,270
Hey.

250
00:15:57,939 --> 00:15:59,569
- Are you going out?
- Yes.

251
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,309
I'm taking Tae Ri outdoors.

252
00:16:02,109 --> 00:16:05,679
Wait. I heard there was a fuss
at the office last night.

253
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,449
Yes. We need to adjust a few details...

254
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:10,120
with the Yongin mansion client.

255
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,449
I'll halt the construction
and talk things out first.

256
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,420
Okay. Take care of it on your end.

257
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,689
- I will. See you later.
- Bye.

258
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,790
Let's go.

259
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,439
This costs 60 dollars per 3.3m²?

260
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,410
Yes. I can give you a discount
if you order in bulk.

261
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,339
That means working on a few jobs
at the same time.

262
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,849
Okay, thank you.

263
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:42,910
Let's go.

264
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,120
(The Frog that Reads)

265
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,179
Hey.

266
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:49,089
- The kid?
- Yes.

267
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,660
Ji Hyun!

268
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,890
Jeon Ji Hyun!

269
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:54,660
- Where is she? Ji Hyun!
- Where did she go?

270
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,959
Where did she get to?

271
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,630
Ji Hyun! Jeon Ji Hyun!

272
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,969
- Oh, dear.
- Ji Hyun!

273
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:04,199
Jeon Ji Hyun! Ji Hyun!

274
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,270
Here.

275
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,809
Pick out what you want to buy.

276
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,209
Okay. Right here.

277
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,709
My gosh.

278
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,450
Let's see.

279
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,359
You're the stone pile kid.

280
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,629
I want to read with you.

281
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,470
Where are you?

282
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,470
You didn't pick up. Are you upset?

283
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,829
The sundae's good,

284
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:04,800
but they don't give enough salt.

285
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,260
I should've asked for more.

286
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,230
Mom.

287
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,599
Do some cleaning up.

288
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:12,270
I get Seon Ju to clean for me.

289
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,609
Isn't this disgusting?

290
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:16,339
It's not. If it bothers you,
you can clean the place.

291
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:19,809
Oh, my gosh.

292
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,950
Jeon Nam Jin.

293
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:26,450
You moved out?

294
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,599
What? Are you done?

295
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:42,169
Hey.

296
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,440
Who called that he had to take it outside?

297
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:48,940
You'd think it was a woman.

298
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:53,379
Wait. Is it a woman?

299
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:56,579
Then Seon Ju didn't lose their savings?

300
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:03,690
- What?
- You packed up and left?

301
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:06,760
Yes. I said it wasn't fun anymore.

302
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:10,059
So where are you at now?

303
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:12,129
- I'm at home.
- "Home?"

304
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,730
Are you with Seon Ju?

305
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,800
I have to get back indoors.
See you at work tomorrow.

306
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:19,540
Come over. Let's talk in person.

307
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,139
Ji Hyun!

308
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:26,710
Ji Hyun! Jeon Ji Hyun!

309
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,550
Ji Hyun!

310
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,280
Jeon Ji Hyun!

311
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:36,119
Ji Hyun!

312
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:39,290
(Secondhand books)

313
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,599
Are you here with your dad again?

314
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:47,829
Your dad is like a mom.

315
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:49,970
My mom is like a dad.

316
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,099
Your mom? How?

317
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,639
Well... She's strong.

318
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,109
Really strong.

319
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:57,980
She boxes too.

320
00:19:58,579 --> 00:19:59,879
I'll learn when I'm older.

321
00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:01,409
That's cool.

322
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,520
Darn it.

323
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,089
She has a loud voice too.

324
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:09,319
Jeon Ji Hyun!

325
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,359
Mom.

326
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:13,260
See? It's loud, isn't it?

327
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,960
Why did you leave without telling me?
What if something bad happened?

328
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,629
I was reading with him.

329
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,770
You should've told me first.

330
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,970
Mom. Buy me this book of ghost stories.

331
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:27,210
This is the only one in the store.

332
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,109
Then give it to me. I want it.

333
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,710
What got into you?

334
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,609
You don't like books.
They make you sleepy.

335
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,480
But this is a good change.

336
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,819
I hope you two can be friends.

337
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:42,290
Where do you live?

338
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,619
In Hwaran-dong.

339
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:45,159
Where's your mom?

340
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,659
He's here with his dad.

341
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,430
He's the stone pile kid from the park.

342
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:52,129
Hello.

343
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,930
Oh, I see.

344
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,339
- Hi.
- Dad.

345
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:58,770
What?

346
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,010
This lady asked where you were.

347
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,510
- Me?
- Yes.

348
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:05,680
Oh, well,

349
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,579
hello.

350
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:08,750
- Hello.
- Hi.

351
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,450
(I Lost My Memory but I Want Revenge)

352
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:17,990
Goodness.

353
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,119
What's up, Mom?

354
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,960
Aren't I allowed to visit?

355
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,899
How was the shoot?

356
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,970
I was perfect as always.

357
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:33,669
- Mom.
- What?

358
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,639
You need some work done.

359
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:37,710
Why?

360
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,510
Do I look old?

361
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:42,849
Where? My skin? My flabs?

362
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,490
Is it because I haven't been exercising?

363
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,960
So Won Hee debuted with you,
and she still looks so young.

364
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,960
You don't know how much fat
she injected into her face.

365
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,659
It could explode at any moment.

366
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,899
You can't tell the difference, can you?

367
00:22:02,569 --> 00:22:05,139
I love it when you're annoyed.

368
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,309
Did you just tease me?

369
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:09,869
That's for the grilled snake.

370
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:12,139
The grilled snake? You cheeky thing.

371
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,980
Oh, no. Wrinkles. I must smile.

372
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,579
Smiling is best.

373
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:18,220
It smooths out the wrinkles.

374
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,050
Oh, dear. The smile lines.

375
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:27,589
Are you going somewhere?

376
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,930
Yes. I'm going out.

377
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,139
(Secondhand books)

378
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:39,569
She asked where we lived
and said we should be friends.

379
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,069
Oh, no.

380
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,909
Goodbye, then.

381
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,040
Bye.

382
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:51,379
Oh, no.

383
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,589
Do you want some help?

384
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:56,020
No, it's fine.

385
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,520
Let me.

386
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,790
- Well...
- Wait.

387
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,800
- There.
- My goodness.

388
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:09,069
Let me help you get home.

389
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,369
- What?
- Could you carry the books?

390
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:13,440
- Okay.
- Let's go.

391
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:18,740
So what you're saying is,

392
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,349
we could just say "three times"...

393
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,680
instead of "thrice,"
which is just confusing?

394
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,720
Yes. "Three times"
and "thrice" sound similar.

395
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:31,490
Yes. If we get it wrong
because they sound similar,

396
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:33,960
we could say the wrong thing
and complicate stuff.

397
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,960
Is that so?

398
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,030
Teacher Mom.

399
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,399
What do you say
as a Korean Literature major?

400
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:47,069
Kids, do you think our precious language
will change,

401
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:50,210
or words will disappear
just because you won't use them?

402
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,510
Do you think "thrice"
will come to mean "four times?"

403
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,950
Stop complaining and memorize it.

404
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,050
Will you get it wrong if it's in the test?

405
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,520
It was in our test yesterday,
and Dong Won got it wrong.

406
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,690
- Is this your car?
- Yes.

407
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:09,760
- Open the trunk.
- Okay.

408
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,430
- What's that?
- A hard hat.

409
00:24:12,899 --> 00:24:14,270
- Do you want to see it?
- Yes.

410
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:17,470
No, wait.

411
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:19,800
- Let's switch sides.
- Okay.

412
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,309
Okay. One, two, three.

413
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,280
Why is it so heavy?

414
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,909
They're tile and wallpaper samples.

415
00:24:28,909 --> 00:24:30,480
Are you in construction?

416
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:31,849
Yes.

417
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,389
If you have any projects...

418
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,520
Jeil Interior Design.

419
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,089
I can make a 10 m² studio
look like a yard ten times its size.

420
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:44,359
That's fraudulent advertising.

421
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,760
If ten times that is too much,

422
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,599
then I'll make it look like
a 15 m² studio.

423
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,940
- Goodness.
- Ma'am.

424
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,440
- Yes?
- Is this for when you ride a bicycle?

425
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:58,240
It's cool.

426
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,379
No, it's not for when you ride a bicycle,

427
00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:02,950
but is it really cool? Do you want it?

428
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,250
No, thanks.

429
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,280
No. You can have it.

430
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,210
It was meant to be a gift,
but they didn't like it.

431
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:33,579
Because of all the stickers I put on it,
I can't return it either.

432
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,010
Do you really like it?

433
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,750
Then I'm pleased
because it has found its owner.

434
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,659
I'm grateful for your help with this,

435
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:47,059
and at the park last time,
I vented at you.

436
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:50,329
I feel bad about what I said.

437
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:53,970
Tae Ri. You should thank her.

438
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,829
Thank you.

439
00:25:57,069 --> 00:25:58,099
Did you...

440
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,770
check on the stone pile since then?

441
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:04,339
Why would I check on what fell down?

442
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:05,809
It was shoddy workmanship.

443
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:07,710
No. You should go back for a look.

444
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:11,020
You bought so many books.

445
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,220
I guess he must be looking for a job.

446
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:17,819
You have a lot to carry.

447
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,159
I'd like to give you a ride,
but there's very little space.

448
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,829
It's okay.

449
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,230
Dad. I'm hungry.

450
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,329
Let's get cup noodles and triangle gimbap.

451
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:32,740
- Shall we?
- Yes. I want to eat a lot.

452
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:34,470
Okay.

453
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:37,409
I hope you find a job soon.

454
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,109
Life isn't always doom and gloom.

455
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,510
Keep trying for your son's sake.

456
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,550
Yes, I should.

457
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,119
Good luck.

458
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,849
- Thank you.
- Sure.

459
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,990
Let's go, Ji Hyun.

460
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,700
What was the book you wanted called?

461
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,240
I'll scour the Internet
and get it for you.

462
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,839
Mom. Wasn't he cute?

463
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:11,780
You were interested in him
and not the book.

464
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,409
I wondered what was up with you.

465
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,450
No. It actually looked like fun.

466
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,280
- The book?
- No.

467
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,550
His dad must look after him
because he has no job.

468
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,690
Isn't that weird?

469
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,359
Some families do that.

470
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,430
Dad, I want to try this on.

471
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,230
Do you? Hang on.

472
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:32,659
This might be too big for you.

473
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,430
What's this?

474
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,839
His dad...

475
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,210
seems nice and sweet.

476
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,280
He teaches his son to ride a bicycle
and reads with him.

477
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:47,339
Would my dad do that...

478
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,710
if he had no job?

479
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,119
Were you envious?

480
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,260
To you who wear this hard hat,

481
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,559
peace and new horizons of safety
will come to your family.

482
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,030
Your safety means we'll be safe too.

483
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:08,470
I wish you luck and work hard.

484
00:28:08,569 --> 00:28:11,899
Be the person who is there
with me until the very end.

485
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,440
Be happy.

486
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:14,770
From Seon Ju.

487
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,319
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

488
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,300
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

489
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,669
You keep telling weird stories
about the past.

490
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,339
I don't remember that.

491
00:28:51,339 --> 00:28:53,339
Do you have amnesia?

492
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:54,909
I think she's crazy.

493
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,379
I don't want to let you go.

494
00:28:56,379 --> 00:28:58,379
Do you want me to be a fish in your tank?

495
00:28:58,379 --> 00:29:00,819
A fish in a tank doesn't stab others.

496
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:03,319
Ji Hyun's really sick. Come home.

497
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:05,389
So what if your kid's sick?
Are you a doctor?

498
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:06,819
I said my part.

499
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:08,089
Don't go.

500
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,659
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
