1
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,390
Mom, I'll wait for you downstairs.

2
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:13,860
Okay.

3
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:34,750
(I went to the park with Mom today...)

4
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,149
(and saw the stone pile was back up.)

5
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,049
(Jeon Ji Hyun,
The Fairy and the Woodcutter)

6
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:44,320
That was why I wished hard...

7
00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:48,359
for Dad to come back to us.

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
Tae Ri.

9
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:02,609
Here. Let's put this on.

10
00:01:07,649 --> 00:01:08,750
In the near future,

11
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,719
Mom wants to take Tae Ri somewhere.

12
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,290
Is there a place you'd like to go?

13
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,659
The seaside.

14
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,959
- The seaside?
- Yes.

15
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,530
Seong Min went to the seaside
with his mom...

16
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:23,430
and rode something
that went high up and spun around.

17
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:25,629
Did he? That must've been great fun.

18
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:28,799
The seaside? Let's go, then.

19
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,909
- Hello.
- Are you going somewhere?

20
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:37,079
(Jin Architecture)

21
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,219
Hey, you!

22
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,290
You can't come in.

23
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:57,829
My gosh.

24
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,900
What are you doing?

25
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,769
Why you...

26
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,379
Darn you!

27
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,870
Please spare me.

28
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,969
Hello, Mr. Kim.

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,039
Good morning.

30
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,800
What are you looking at?

31
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,909
Me?

32
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,979
I looked up Ferris wheels by the sea
and got Wolmi Island and Sokcho.

33
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,110
A shorter trip
would be better for a kid, right?

34
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,009
Are you planning a family trip?

35
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,520
I'm envious.

36
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:28,990
It smells incredible.

37
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:33,129
- Hello, Mr. Jeon.
- Hi.

38
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,229
Ms. Jin was so unfriendly and frigid,

39
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:39,629
so I thought she had problems at home.

40
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:42,539
Things must be fine
if they're planning a family trip.

41
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,340
Why would you make up such stories?

42
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,240
Things freeze and thaw repeatedly
in a marriage.

43
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,509
Right, Mr. Jeon?

44
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:52,580
- Is that coffee?
- Yes.

45
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,310
Give me a cold one and quit annoying me.

46
00:03:54,949 --> 00:03:55,979
What?

47
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,620
Something is freezing.

48
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:15,599
(Mother)

49
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:19,439
Why did she hang up?

50
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,509
The person is unable to answer the phone.

51
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,509
Oh, dear.

52
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,449
Hey. You got here early.

53
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,220
The temporary walls must go up today.

54
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,519
Chief, I need to go somewhere right now.

55
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,759
Sorry. I'll put up
all the boards tomorrow.

56
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:39,959
- I'm sorry.
- But...

57
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,100
We must finish the walls
before the electrician comes tomorrow!

58
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,699
"What do the likes of you know?"

59
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,129
(I Lost My Memory but I Want Revenge)

60
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,730
"What does?"

61
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:51,000
"What do?"

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,370
Pi Mi Ju, come over when you're ready.

63
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:55,779
What? Pi Mi Ju?

64
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:56,779
I'm coming!

65
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:07,220
What are you doing here?

66
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:10,490
Why else? In the very next scene,

67
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,990
the crazy girl
who'll pull out all your hair...

68
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:16,829
is me.

69
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,199
What?

70
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,670
When that scene is wrapped up...

71
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,699
Come along.

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,310
Director, is she the crazy girl?

73
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,439
- Yes. Why?
- It can't be her.

74
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,279
- Cast someone else.
- What?

75
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,209
She's really evil. She stalks Woo Sang.

76
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,180
- Jin Chu Ah.
- Woo Sang.

77
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,220
Do you know who they cast
as the crazy girl?

78
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,120
Hey, can I have a word?

79
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:42,089
What about? You can't cast her!

80
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:43,420
Darn you!

81
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,959
You know why it can't be her!

82
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,189
- I'll prepare for the shoot.
- Hey, you!

83
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:50,459
Woo Sang.

84
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,269
Woo Sang. She's a blackmailer.

85
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:00,470
Yes, but I made sure
she wouldn't blackmail me again.

86
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,069
How?

87
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:07,250
"I won't bring up that incident..."

88
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,720
"to Jeong Woo Sang or Jin Chu Ah..."

89
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,290
You're incredible.
Where did you get the idea?

90
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,620
- Are you happy now?
- But still,

91
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,889
it's best to stay far away from her.

92
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:20,230
She came to you
to blackmail you for money.

93
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,459
It's fine. I told her to keep quiet,
so she won't bother you either.

94
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,730
Her role is tiny too.
She can do it for all I care.

95
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:40,680
It's time to get into a serious fight.

96
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,709
Okay.

97
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:44,819
You're out of your mind
because you think...

98
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,250
she's bullying the guy you like.

99
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,990
Ready.

100
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,860
Action!

101
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,029
You!

102
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,300
I'll crush you!

103
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,000
Why?

104
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:08,870
- Come here.
- No!

105
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,810
How dare you bully my Sang Woo?

106
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,279
I'll crush you!

107
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,790
I'll crush you.

108
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,350
I'll crush you.

109
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,360
I'm the psycho, and you're on my turf!

110
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,370
The name is Jeong Kkot Ja!

111
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,139
- Did you get that? Jeong, Kkot,
- She really does seem crazy.

112
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:40,170
Ja!

113
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,139
I'll crush you.

114
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,250
- I'll crush you.
- Okay!

115
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:57,189
(I Lost My Memory but I Want Revenge)

116
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,829
I can't take it anymore.

117
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,389
You took it out on me, didn't you?

118
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:05,899
I did not.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,129
How dare you?

120
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,240
Why? Do you want to hit me?

121
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:13,139
Go ahead.

122
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,740
There's a CCTV camera up there.

123
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,110
Hit me so we can settle at a reduced fee.

124
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:22,449
- To be honest, that accident...
- What about the accident?

125
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:26,050
I dozed off because I'd been up all day
getting your clothes.

126
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,350
Did you have to overreact?

127
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,420
We had to put up our house for sale.

128
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,089
Didn't you sign a contract with Woo Sang
saying you'd never mention the accident?

129
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:35,089
I'll tell him about this.

130
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,560
What?

131
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,600
Do you have a recording or something?

132
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,100
How dare you?

133
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,240
Darn you!

134
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,679
Can you return that wig
to the costume department for me?

135
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,850
Goodbye, then.

136
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,279
I can't stand that witch.

137
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:58,950
You'd better pay up on time!

138
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,759
Are you done with the cleaning?

139
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,889
No, I'm still at it.

140
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:11,500
Is there anything you're good at cooking?

141
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:15,100
Well, I can cook this and that.

142
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:16,240
You can cook anything?

143
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,039
What would be best?

144
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,940
Can you make yaksik?

145
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,710
- Yes.
- Make some, then.

146
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,210
If you make it today,
will it keep until tomorrow?

147
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:28,309
- It would, but...
- Good.

148
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:30,320
- Okay.
- Finish cleaning first.

149
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,019
Okay.

150
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:35,549
She wants me
to make yaksik out of the blue?

151
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,019
My goodness.

152
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:41,889
My son Nam Jin is pretty successful.

153
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:44,529
How did he make so much money?
Is he into bitcoins?

154
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,299
Bitcoins? Are those bits of coins?

155
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:50,100
You can't make money with that nowadays.

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,710
Goodness. Mother.

157
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:54,909
What are you doing here?

158
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:56,679
You wouldn't take my calls.

159
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,649
I remembered you had a class
at the community center.

160
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,610
You must be her daughter-in-law.

161
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:05,049
- Your mother-in-law has been...
- Not a word.

162
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:08,320
- You go ahead. I'll join you soon.
- Okay.

163
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Bye.

164
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,159
Take a seat.

165
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,029
Mother.

166
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,480
What is this about?
Don't keep my friends waiting.

167
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,179
You're staying with a friend.
Does it feel uncomfortable at all?

168
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,889
I'm doing okay.

169
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:45,389
But you didn't come here to ask me that.

170
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:47,490
Get to the point.

171
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,330
It's Nam Jin.

172
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:53,629
He's having an affair.

173
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,700
- He's what?
- I didn't believe it,

174
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,669
but he was having an affair.

175
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:02,509
He's out of his mind.

176
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:06,210
You shouldn't talk like that
about your husband.

177
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,309
You said you'd talk to him.

178
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,980
Did you?

179
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,220
Fine.

180
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,620
Since you're being straightforward,
I might as well do the same.

181
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,759
He's not interested in you anymore.
You should give up.

182
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:25,730
- What?
- Nam Jin has suffered...

183
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,129
ever since he married you.

184
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:28,169
Mother.

185
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:31,470
He wanted to be a businessman,
and he had a good mind for it too.

186
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,809
But what can you do for him?
Can you help him start a business?

187
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:37,840
The other woman
stands to inherit her dad's company.

188
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,350
In other words,
it will become Nam Jin's too.

189
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,779
Mother.

190
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:45,350
You even know who he is seeing?

191
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:49,960
She and I went to high school together.

192
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,460
How could you do this
when you knew everything?

193
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,230
Some people are meant to be
even if he married the wrong friend.

194
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,139
That handbag looks pretty expensive.

195
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:07,940
Did she buy it for you?

196
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,840
Well...

197
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,879
You know what I did for you two,

198
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,549
and you fell for something like that?

199
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,789
Are you defending your son
who is ignoring his wife and child?

200
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,860
You're not doing what's good for him.

201
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,690
Do you know how badly I wanted this...

202
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,330
How dare you talk to
your mother-in-law like that?

203
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:34,769
Are you lecturing me?

204
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,809
I'd known you never approved of me,

205
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:44,210
but I thought you'd side with me
on matters like this.

206
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,409
Shouldn't you?

207
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,179
We're both moms. Don't you see how I feel?

208
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,750
You care about your kid, don't you?

209
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,590
I care about my son's future too.

210
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,389
What on earth are you wearing anyway?

211
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,929
Don't call me "Mother" if we meet
in public again. It's humiliating.

212
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:02,960
Mother.

213
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,070
I had no idea this was what you were like.

214
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,399
You'll pay for this...

215
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,600
in spades one day.

216
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,509
Hey! You can't talk to
your mother-in-law like that!

217
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,620
My goodness...

218
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,820
Hey, did anyone come to see the house?

219
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,620
No.

220
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,590
Is not even one person interested?

221
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,259
What's that?

222
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,429
The guy who sells fried chicken...

223
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:42,129
paid me with this for dying his hair.

224
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:44,399
It's not the Joseon era
where we barter with things.

225
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:46,639
Why did you accept that as payment?

226
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,210
He didn't have any cash.

227
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,139
He said this was a fat one.

228
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,250
Should I boil it for Nam Jin?

229
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,610
Don't you dare.

230
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:56,580
Why are you so against it?

231
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,649
Well...

232
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:01,120
He's just a son-in-law.

233
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,419
You don't need to mind him.

234
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,389
Why are you so stingy these days?

235
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,529
You complained that I wasn't nice
to your husband when he was alive.

236
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:10,529
You shouldn't be like that.

237
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:13,330
We invited him to dinner
and ended up embarrassing ourselves...

238
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,799
without even feeding him properly.

239
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,740
I feel bad.

240
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,269
That wasn't so long ago.

241
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:24,879
He'd feel uncomfortable
if you were to invite him again.

242
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,950
- You give it to them, then.
- What?

243
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:29,309
Our family is an utter mess,

244
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:33,389
but at least he has a good job
and is going strong.

245
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,450
We need him and Seon Ju to be happy,

246
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:38,960
so instead of complaining about
how cold and mean he is,

247
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,090
we should value his strengths.

248
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,259
Go give it to them.
It's a native Korean chicken.

249
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,259
Be sure to tell him it was from me.

250
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,970
Even if we upset him in the past,
he'll come around in time.

251
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:52,470
Get going, you slowpoke.

252
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:54,940
- Okay.
- You're such a nuisance.

253
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:57,879
I wish you'd move a little faster.

254
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,029
The other woman
stands to inherit her dad's company.

255
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:14,230
In other words,

256
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:16,330
it will become Nam Jin's too.

257
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,259
- Mother.
- You care about your kid, don't you?

258
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,370
I care about my son's future too.

259
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:29,779
Who's there?

260
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,740
It's me.

261
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,190
What's that?

262
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:44,919
This?

263
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:49,529
I broke a sweat bringing this over.

264
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:55,299
What's wrong with your face?

265
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,970
What about it?

266
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,600
It looks like...

267
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,009
you want to beat up someone.

268
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,940
I don't.

269
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,580
How did the interview go?
Did you hear back from them?

270
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,710
The interview.

271
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,019
Oh, dear.

272
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,690
You didn't get the job.

273
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:19,620
What about Nam Jin?

274
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:25,600
Mom wants you to cook that for him.

275
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,899
She's glad he's still married to you.

276
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,139
"It looks like he's having an affair."

277
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:34,870
"He doesn't deserve a whole chicken."

278
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:38,409
I wanted to tell her that but couldn't.

279
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,149
We don't have proof.

280
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,149
If you do boil this,
don't give him the wings.

281
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,289
He might really cheat on you.

282
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,490
Yes. He is cheating on me.

283
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:54,460
Are you sure?

284
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,830
Did you find out who he was seeing?

285
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,600
- It's someone you know.
- Who is it?

286
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:02,669
Jin Sang Ah.

287
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,399
What?

288
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:08,210
My high school friend.

289
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:10,879
The owner of the car Mi Ju drove into.

290
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,480
The daughter of the CEO
whose company I interviewed at.

291
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,019
No way.

292
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,890
And she treated us like that
for scraping her car a bit?

293
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,990
My gosh. Mi Ju did a good job then.

294
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,829
Mi Ju should've
crashed into the car harder.

295
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,559
Hey. We should tell Mom.

296
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,559
She's best at hounding people.

297
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,640
We should humiliate them
outside their office and bury them.

298
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,039
We were charged for the accident
and assault, and you want to add to that?

299
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:43,980
Don't tell Mom.

300
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,509
She'll only get upset.

301
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,880
Talk to your mother-in-law, then.

302
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,819
I met and talked to her just now.

303
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,690
She sided with her son?

304
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:04,599
This won't do.

305
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,069
Let's demand a three-way talk.

306
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,170
Let's drag Nam Jin over...

307
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,440
or kill them both if we don't get our way.

308
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,970
Call him now.

309
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:20,549
Goodness.

310
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,759
- What?
- It's me.

311
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:35,990
Let's meet up. Bring Sang Ah.

312
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:38,359
- What for?
- Will you bring her over...

313
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,970
or shall I come to your office?

314
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:41,529
Why would you come here?

315
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:43,269
Don't. I'll come to you.

316
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,440
Leave Ms. Jin alone.

317
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,440
No. I want to see you both.

318
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,910
Let's have a three-way conversation.

319
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:52,180
If I don't see the both of you,

320
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:54,849
I'll come to your company
and make a scene.

321
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,349
Hey. Hello?

322
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:00,650
Darn it.

323
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,720
What is it?

324
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:05,690
Does Seon Ju want to see you?

325
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,690
And me too?

326
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,529
It's fine.

327
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,359
I'll talk some sense into her.

328
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,500
She's not the reasonable type.

329
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,970
She could cause a scene
if she doesn't get her way.

330
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:20,910
Tell her to come over.

331
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:24,509
Let's have a chat.

332
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,049
I'd like to hear what she has to say.

333
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:44,099
They called us to their secret hideout?

334
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,930
Don't get emotional no matter
what they say and don't use force.

335
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,839
Let's grill them verbally
within the constraints of the law.

336
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:53,970
To think we could be punished
for assaulting the affair partner.

337
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,069
The law is messed up.

338
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:58,079
Let's go.

339
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,410
Come in.

340
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,220
Have a seat.

341
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:59,400
I'll speak freely since you're
Seon Ju's classmate and my brother-in-law.

342
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:03,880
I heard a bit about what happened,

343
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:08,410
and I asked to see you
because I just couldn't take it anymore.

344
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,519
Okay. Go ahead.

345
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,650
My gosh.

346
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:17,359
Look at you. You're so thick-faced.

347
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,130
How can you talk like that
when you're breaking up a family?

348
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,259
We should be demanding alimony from you,

349
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:24,099
but you sued us
over a few scratches on a car?

350
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,799
Are you hiding behind your big sister
because you can't handle this yourself?

351
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:30,740
Act your age.

352
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,940
What are you talking about? Darn you!

353
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,470
You failed to keep your husband
under control,

354
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:38,480
and you failed to keep your car
out of your sister's grasp.

355
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:42,009
And the assault charges were because
you failed to control your temper.

356
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:45,880
I won't settle for a cent less,

357
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:48,890
so if you want to sue me
for stealing your husband, go ahead.

358
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:52,490
When the judge decides on the amount,
I'll pay it in no time.

359
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:55,789
If you're relying on that payout
to cover our settlement,

360
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:58,660
you might end up having to
auction off your house.

361
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,730
Honey.

362
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:04,200
You heard what she said,
and you won't say a word?

363
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:09,069
How could you...

364
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,549
How could you treat me like this
in her presence?

365
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,710
Why can't he?

366
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:19,579
Because you paid for him to study abroad?

367
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,819
Is that all you have to show for?

368
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,960
Is all you have to hide behind...

369
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,589
the fact that you seduced a married man?

370
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,759
What?

371
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,730
Honey. I know her pretty well.

372
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:37,670
She's the type
to take the one last thing...

373
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:40,240
someone else has when she already has 99.

374
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:42,609
You're just one item she craves.

375
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,640
Yes.

376
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:45,480
Think however you like.

377
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:50,549
Hey. Does your mom know?

378
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,420
Does she know you're dating a married man?

379
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,450
What about your husband?

380
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,259
Does he know about this?

381
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,980
I wonder...

382
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,450
when they met and how,

383
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:22,579
and how far...

384
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,319
they went and felt.

385
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,750
Do they really love each other?

386
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,329
My head is full of questions, but...

387
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,430
I hate him...

388
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:43,369
I feel wronged, and it's so unfair.

389
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,809
But...

390
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:50,809
I really loved him so much.

391
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,910
We have Ji Hyun too, so...

392
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,250
I can't just give up on us.

393
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,089
Mr. Jeon...

394
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,690
keeps me on my toes.

395
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,109
Darn it.

396
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:35,019
I don't know who he is,

397
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,619
but I feel really sorry for your husband.

398
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,529
You don't have to worry about him.

399
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:42,829
But I do.

400
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:45,559
How did he end up with you?

401
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,599
Let's not talk about
someone who isn't here.

402
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,609
Nam Jin.
You look so haughty and arrogant...

403
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:57,039
because you think
you have something over us.

404
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,779
You're not that great a catch
that two women would fight over you.

405
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,480
Seon Ju is fighting for
the time you spent together,

406
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,690
what she put into the marriage,
and your kid.

407
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:10,819
That's right. You two won't last.

408
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,430
The moment you become hers,
she'll lose her interest.

409
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,759
Yes.

410
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,259
That's what you might wish,

411
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,630
but we'll live...

412
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,299
happily ever after.

413
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,069
What?

414
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,170
"We?"

415
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,680
Where's your sense of loyalty?

416
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:33,680
Don't you feel bad for me?

417
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:37,750
A couple shouldn't stay married
out of loyalty.

418
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:39,880
Loyalty is for thugs.

419
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,789
- What?
- I do feel bad for you.

420
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,319
That was all that I felt for you.

421
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,859
I felt bad and in your debt.

422
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:52,460
I was weighed down with a sense of debt.

423
00:25:52,829 --> 00:25:54,700
That's not how a man
should feel about his wife.

424
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,799
What about Ji Hyun?

425
00:25:57,369 --> 00:25:59,039
She has bouts of depression.

426
00:26:00,339 --> 00:26:02,839
Even her kindergarten teacher is worried.

427
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,380
How could you do this...

428
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:06,940
to your daughter?

429
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,420
Heroes rise up during hard times.

430
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,619
What are you saying?

431
00:26:11,619 --> 00:26:13,450
Our complicated family issues...

432
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:15,819
could make her strong and smart.

433
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:17,859
Are you out of your mind?

434
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,390
I'm not your goal or purpose.

435
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,029
Let's say I was a stopover point.

436
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,630
You'll feel better then.

437
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:30,029
Let's make it...

438
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,039
a clean break.

439
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,710
Nam Jin.

440
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,980
Get a grip.

441
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,480
You can't go with her. You shouldn't.

442
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:44,519
As a senior who was married and widowed...

443
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,650
This is...

444
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,250
our issue, not yours.

445
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:54,589
When will you stop
bringing alternating members...

446
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:56,490
of your family to harass us?

447
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,730
I don't believe this.

448
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,329
What is wrong with you? You...

449
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,099
Sit down, Jin Ju.

450
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,000
Let's hear...

451
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,940
what else he has to say.

452
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,309
Over 40 percent of couples
in Korea get divorced.

453
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,980
It's not that big a deal anymore,
and it's not considered a flaw.

454
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,519
It's like a cold that everyone catches.

455
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:22,549
Yes.

456
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:25,519
Divorced people have fewer regrets
than those who were never married.

457
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:28,190
You were married before,
so you'll regret less.

458
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:32,500
Yes. You're right.

459
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:34,130
Over 30 percent
of our population lives alone.

460
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,200
You can forget about me and live alone.

461
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,410
If you think about it,
we all go through life alone.

462
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:44,579
Yes.

463
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,980
I see.

464
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,990
You spew nonsense...

465
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:58,490
like it's philosophy.

466
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,730
I got duped.

467
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,990
I thought you were smart.

468
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:06,230
This must be gaslighting.

469
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,799
My eyes are slowly being opened.

470
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,339
You really...

471
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:13,809
are so stupid.

472
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,710
Let him go, then.

473
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,009
No. I can't do you a favor.

474
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:20,279
I won't let him go.

475
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,950
Stupid as he may be, I'll keep him.

476
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,849
You two can do whatever you want!

477
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:26,819
I'll do whatever I want!

478
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:27,890
Pi Seon Ju.

479
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:31,119
Are you challenging me to a fight?

480
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,789
Yes, Jin Sang Ah. Let's fight.

481
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:36,259
Let's go all the way and see...

482
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,460
who gives in first.

483
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,369
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

484
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,289
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

485
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,029
Should I just get a divorce?

486
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:09,529
Why should you get divorced?

487
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,059
What will you tell Mom?

488
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:14,299
I feel so shabby and humiliated.

489
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:16,130
Why should you feel humiliated?

490
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,369
They're in the wrong.

491
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:21,869
Still, let's never break up
and give them what they want.

492
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,940
Are you meeting Seon Ju
for dinner or something?

493
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,380
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
