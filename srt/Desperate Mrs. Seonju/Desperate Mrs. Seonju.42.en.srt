00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,459
(Episode 42)

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,969
Hey!

3
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:21,670
Sit in there quietly
until it's time to go home.

4
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,769
Jin Sang Ah! Open the door!

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,240
If you don't get the message,
you must suffer physically.

6
00:00:27,909 --> 00:00:31,839
Stay there and think about
whether you should keep your job here.

7
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:33,179
Hey!

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,080
Pi Seon Ju. I hope we don't meet tomorrow.

9
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,650
Hey!

10
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:40,119
You're not leaving, are you?

11
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,359
Hey!

12
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:45,420
She's gone?

13
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:46,829
Shoot.

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,700
Don't be flustered.

15
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,800
When in trouble, think carefully.

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,270
Yes.

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,740
Right. My phone.

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,209
Where's my phone?

19
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,480
Let's do this, then.

20
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,420
Without telling Hansung
we'll switch the person in charge,

21
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,020
you and I can submit
our own proposals for the project.

22
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:20,130
Wouldn't it be fair
to ask the client to choose blindly?

23
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:21,390
We can put together our own team too.

24
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:40,780
What do you want?

25
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,050
Hey.

26
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:45,649
Let's do the blind proposal thing
you suggested.

27
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,319
You want to? I'm glad you said yes.

28
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:51,259
I'll set up a meeting
to discuss how to proceed.

29
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,690
Okay.

30
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,569
(Head of Interior, Jin Sang Ah)

31
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,500
(Team Leader Kim So Woo)

32
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:41,370
(Pi Seon Ju)

33
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,710
(Team Leader Kim So Woo)

34
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,019
Mr. Kim. I found you at last.

35
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:57,460
Hello. Do you know where Ms. Pi is?

36
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,690
No.

37
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:01,630
There seems to be a problem
with the shopping center property.

38
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:03,799
You should talk to the site manager.

39
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,530
Okay.

40
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:06,699
Let's go.

41
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,419
Darn it.

42
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,359
She took my phone too?

43
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,699
Nan Hee. Are you done with the magazine
featuring the German architects?

44
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,210
I put it back in the reference library.

45
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,470
The reference library?

46
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,069
Thanks.

47
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:59,590
Hey. Where are you headed?

48
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:01,319
I'm off to get something.

49
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,530
Seon Ju will admit defeat and leave soon.

50
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,660
You didn't aggravate her, did you?

51
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,370
She won't react
to a half-hearted approach.

52
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,299
I had to be forceful.

53
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,600
So Woo and I...

54
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,269
are going head-to-head
to win the Hansung project.

55
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,210
While I take care of Seon Ju,

56
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,810
you can get started on the project.

57
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,590
I found the door.

58
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,289
The door handle...

59
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,429
My gosh. Where is it?

60
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,799
Hey, Jin Sang Ah!

61
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,739
Open the door!

62
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
Hey!

63
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,820
Jin Sang Ah! Open the door!

64
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,689
(Jin Architecture)

65
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,419
Jin Sang Ah, I'll kill you for this!

66
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:13,260
Let me out!

67
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,859
This is illegal confinement, you psycho!

68
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:17,830
(Authorized Personnel Only)

69
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,030
Don't you fear the law?

70
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,270
I'll make you pay when I get out!

71
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,010
Darn you!

72
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,910
She won't react
to a half-hearted approach.

73
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:30,840
I had to be forceful.

74
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:34,410
Seon Ju will admit defeat and leave soon.

75
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,479
(Authorized Personnel Only)

76
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,919
Is someone there?

77
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,789
Hello? I'm locked up in here.

78
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:46,629
Can you let me out?

79
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:08,450
What's that?

80
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,689
There's a light?

81
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,470
Oh, dear.

82
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,660
Ms. Pi.

83
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,570
How come
you haven't gotten us a single deal?

84
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:37,200
There's a client I'm sitting on...

85
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,739
that I'm pretty sure will sign with us.

86
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,679
Sit on it for too long
and it'll go sideways.

87
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,890
Jeong Tae Sang!

88
00:07:56,489 --> 00:07:58,720
The viewer ratings
were even worse yesterday.

89
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:00,660
What is this percentage?

90
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,429
The number is so small
I can barely see it.

91
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:05,859
Will you just...

92
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:11,539
Don't make a program you want.
Make a program others want to watch!

93
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,640
You talked about merging
cultural refinement with variety.

94
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,379
Why are you still a variety show director?

95
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,179
Don't even breathe!

96
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,249
Don't just stand there.

97
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,220
Get out.

98
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,720
Stand still.

99
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,489
Stay there and take the hit.

100
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,530
Stand still.

101
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,059
Darn it.

102
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:39,900
Go.

103
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:55,149
Did you get chewed out?

104
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,820
Don't ask.

105
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,450
You got chewed out.

106
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,019
I'd love to quit.

107
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,889
I can't put up with this much longer.

108
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,489
You work just so
you have a title to show for it,

109
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:11,229
and you make money by investing wisely.

110
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:13,499
What kind of conclusion is that?

111
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,570
That way, your ego doesn't take a hit.

112
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:17,470
That's why I'm trying to invest...

113
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,239
Hey.

114
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:20,909
(Three missed calls: Pi Jin Ju)

115
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:26,149
Hey. I was busy with a meeting.

116
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,149
You said you'd think about
the house I showed you.

117
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:32,149
- Oh, that?
- That house.

118
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:34,149
I let another client see it today,

119
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,090
and they seem to like it.

120
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,090
You need to snatch it now if you want it.

121
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:41,729
Okay. I'll drop by again soon.

122
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,729
Bye.

123
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:48,570
Who was that?

124
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:50,940
A real estate agent lady.

125
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,210
You speak informally
to an estate agent lady?

126
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:59,909
- Why?
- You're way too curious.

127
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:34,050
(I Lost My Memory but I Want Revenge)

128
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
Hey.

129
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:38,119
It must be nice to be successful.

130
00:10:38,979 --> 00:10:40,389
I bet your chief doesn't yell at you.

131
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:54,570
Since we decided to live here together,

132
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,269
you're not to tell anyone outside
what you saw or heard here.

133
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,170
I'll keep my mouth shut
as if I can't speak.

134
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:05,009
You should respond when spoken to.

135
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:07,879
Then I'll answer only.

136
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,379
Okay.

137
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:11,779
People who can cook can't clean,

138
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:14,019
and people who can clean can't cook.

139
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,420
I couldn't find a helper
who was good at everything.

140
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,889
You say you can do anything?

141
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,859
Cleaning, washing,
doing the dishes, and gardening?

142
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,729
On top of that,
I can drive and put outfits together.

143
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,129
I'm slightly less confident
about my cooking,

144
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,999
but if you teach me, I'll learn as I go.

145
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,810
There's not much I can teach you
when it comes to that.

146
00:11:35,369 --> 00:11:37,779
That's set. You can start today.

147
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,409
You can take the small room
next to the entrance.

148
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:42,810
Okay.

149
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,749
What I did...

150
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,960
was charity out of noblesse oblige
on my part.

151
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:54,659
You can't fall for me.

152
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:57,899
Okay. That will never happen.

153
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
"Never?"

154
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,940
I don't like that either.

155
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,379
(Grace Shim Beauty Studio)

156
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,259
I was too rude to you last time.

157
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,769
I'm meeting a client soon, so I'm busy.

158
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,369
That client is me.

159
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,609
Take a seat.

160
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,180
I offended you when we last met.

161
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,619
My Nam Jin lost out in his first marriage,

162
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:54,920
and I'd thought
he'd landed a catch this time.

163
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,989
Seon Ju that lunatic...

164
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:00,629
got that video of you online,

165
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:03,460
and now she's working
at Nam Jin's company.

166
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:05,330
I see why you were so angry.

167
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,670
I had no idea and I blurted out
whatever crap I wanted.

168
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,239
You requested scalp care too?

169
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,540
Yes.

170
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,619
Oh, gosh. That hurts.

171
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,879
- Be gentle.
- There's a lot of dandruff.

172
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,690
Be more gentle. Oh, dear.

173
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,290
My gosh.

174
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,560
By the way. That box over there.

175
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,399
I bought some abalone
because I heard it helps reduce fevers.

176
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:38,060
Wait. Is this me upsetting you...

177
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:40,200
than trying to make amends?

178
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,369
Still, I'm trying to be
a caring future in-law.

179
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,550
It's me.

180
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:56,210
This client of mine. Give her a refund.

181
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,090
What? Why?

182
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,889
Get a refund and go to another salon.

183
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:04,590
Do you choose who to serve?

184
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:06,090
I won't accept the refund.

185
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,560
Then...

186
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:10,529
Get out!

187
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:19,170
It's so nice.

188
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,180
This is my new workplace.

189
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,509
Mom. Jin Ju and Seon Ju.

190
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:31,979
I think this is another stepping stone.

191
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,019
I'll do well here
and take another step forward.

192
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,899
I heard about the blind competition
for the Hansung project.

193
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,729
I'd wondered how good you were.

194
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:51,970
Show us what you can do.

195
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,810
Didn't you see my previous works?

196
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,509
You'd won a great many businesses
and were highly praised.

197
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,009
Wasn't that because
you were the CEO's son-in-law?

198
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:03,979
Let's drop everything and compete fairly.

199
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,190
- Are you about to leave?
- Yes.

200
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:13,889
Did you find a designer to work with?

201
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,560
I'm making calls,

202
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:18,899
but they're busy and hard to reach.

203
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,570
Is that so? Go ahead.

204
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:34,950
- Jin Ju.
- What?

205
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:38,779
I decided to set up
our homeowner with Kyung Ae.

206
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,119
What for?

207
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,050
She has a house in her own name.

208
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,889
If it works out,

209
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:45,960
they'll have our homeowner
move in with Kyung Ae.

210
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,960
Then we get this house to ourselves.

211
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:50,200
- For real?
- Yes.

212
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:52,899
On top of that,
Kyung Ae's mom will set up Seon Ju too.

213
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,300
Kyung Ae's cousin is a catch, apparently.

214
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,769
Set him up with me, then.

215
00:15:57,769 --> 00:15:58,940
I can't.

216
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,479
Kyung Ae's mom said if Kyung Ae
and our homeowner got married,

217
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,279
she'd give us the money she'd put aside
to hire a matchmaking company.

218
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,779
Let's share that instead.

219
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,450
Can we really? Then 50-50.

220
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,749
Why is it 50-50 when I got us the deal?

221
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,220
- I'm home.
- Hello.

222
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,820
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes?

223
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,729
Would you like to go on a blind date?

224
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,830
What?

225
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,729
Gosh, no.

226
00:16:23,729 --> 00:16:26,399
Why not? You should get over that witch...

227
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,769
and start over.

228
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,300
What witch?

229
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,239
Do you know his ex-wife?

230
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,739
No. I mean she must've been a witch.

231
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,340
I'm not interested. Good night.

232
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:40,279
Wait. You have to say yes.

233
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:43,320
I'll be in a pickle if you say no.

234
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:45,080
How so?

235
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,850
I promised a regular of mine
that I'd arrange a date.

236
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,659
Could you please do this for me?

237
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,220
I'd like to help you out,

238
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:54,759
but my divorce isn't official yet.

239
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,859
It will become official one day.

240
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,800
Get things lined up in advance.

241
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,629
I'm grateful that you mean well,

242
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,340
but I'm really not interested. Sorry.

243
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,609
You won't find someone
if you wait until you're interested.

244
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,379
- Darn it.
- Shoot.

245
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:11,409
Excuse me.

246
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,580
I haven't seen Ms. Pi.

247
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,250
She must be working late.

248
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,719
I heard she joined a nice company,
but they must treat her like a slave.

249
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,290
Can't she even answer her phone?

250
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,260
She didn't pick up.

251
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,119
I don't get it.

252
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,230
Think about it...

253
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,899
and tell me by tomorrow evening.

254
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,129
Okay?

255
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:38,439
Okay.

256
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,010
Hello.

257
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,240
- Hello.
- Dad.

258
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,179
Hi. Tae Ri.

259
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,280
Tae Ri. Can you stay here
and play with Dong Won and Ji Hyun?

260
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,320
I have to go back to the office.

261
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:52,480
Okay.

262
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:54,820
Dong Won, Ji Hyun. Is that okay?

263
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,119
- Yes.
- Okay.

264
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,060
Let's go inside.

265
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:04,459
Why the deep sigh?

266
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,169
Honey. Sang Ah found out.

267
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:09,469
Found out what?

268
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,439
That I'm not her birth mom.

269
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,810
How come?

270
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:20,379
She overheard
you and me talk in the hospital.

271
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,010
She resents me.

272
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,679
She should be grateful.
Why would she resent you?

273
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,550
Doesn't she know you gave her
more love than you did Chu Ah?

274
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,820
She must feel conflicted and confused.

275
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,560
Right now, maybe,
but she'll come around in time.

276
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:39,230
No one could raise an ex-wife's child
with as much care as you.

277
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,469
I'm home.

278
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:42,530
- Hi.
- I'm home.

279
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,899
- You got home together?
- We met outside.

280
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,240
Let's talk, Sang Ah. Follow me.

281
00:18:58,719 --> 00:18:59,719
I heard...

282
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,850
you heard about your birth mom.

283
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:05,219
Mom says you resent her.

284
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,459
Don't.

285
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,399
Even I think
she raised you with so much care.

286
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:14,129
What was my birth mom like?

287
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,300
Do you have a photo of her?

288
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,949
- Honey.
- Yes?

289
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:37,290
Did you see the locket that was here?

290
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:39,560
No.

291
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:42,429
Look carefully. Maybe you misplaced it.

292
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,199
I'm sure I put it in here.

293
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:46,899
You'd burned all my old photos
saying they were useless,

294
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:48,369
and that was the only thing left.

295
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,340
I know. What a shame.

296
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,010
I don't know about a locket.

297
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,609
Don't ask about her.

298
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,609
She gave you life,

299
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:02,679
but this mom is your real mom.

300
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,629
I'd love to move out,

301
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:23,600
but I'm staying so as not to upset Dad.

302
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,740
Try not to get on my nerves.

303
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:31,240
Why did you hide it from me?

304
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:33,679
Shouldn't you have told me at least?

305
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,320
I was going to,
but the timing was never right.

306
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,949
And part of me thought
you were better off not knowing.

307
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,389
I want to be alone.

308
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:47,590
Okay.

309
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:56,270
Darn it.

310
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,109
Hey!

311
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,879
Sit in there quietly
until it's time to go home.

312
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:13,020
Jin Sang Ah! Open the door!

313
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,490
Oh, right.

314
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:20,119
Whatever. One night there won't kill her.

315
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,899
I'll let her out tomorrow. I don't care.

316
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,510
You're still here, Mr. Kim?

317
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,250
Yes. I had some stuff to handle.

318
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,449
What about you?

319
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:23,619
I must be getting old. I'm so forgetful.

320
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:26,090
- I left my phone behind.
- I see.

321
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:29,830
Did you see Ms. Pi today?

322
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:34,199
Ms. Jin took her
to the Ventilation Room to clean it up.

323
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,699
The Ventilation Room?

324
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:38,270
- What for?
- I don't know.

325
00:22:38,699 --> 00:22:41,510
But I'm sure
I heard her say "Ventilation Room."

326
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,439
Okay. Thanks.

327
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,540
Choon Hyang, you wench.

328
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:14,869
Do you know what crimes you committed?

329
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:16,609
I do not.

330
00:23:17,379 --> 00:23:19,209
What crimes did I commit?

331
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:20,679
You really do not know?

332
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,350
I do not know. Pray tell me.

333
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:28,649
I may have taken
your husband Lee Mong Ryong,

334
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,389
but how dare you
use my husband to come here?

335
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,389
Will you walk out yourself...

336
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:36,760
or get dragged out as a corpse?

337
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,899
I will not and cannot leave,
dead or alive.

338
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:44,770
You will not give in?

339
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:48,969
I will do whatever it takes
to kick you out!

340
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:51,740
Darn you! This is a crime!

341
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,340
It is illegal confinement!

342
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,109
Keep that mouth shut.

343
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,850
The King's undercover emissary is here!

344
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:03,020
The King's undercover emissary is here!

345
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,060
Wait.

346
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,290
Here they are!

347
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,030
Darn you!

348
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:09,730
Take her away!

349
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,129
You fools! How dare you touch me?

350
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Let me go!

351
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,899
Let go of me!

352
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,199
(Authorized Personnel Only)

353
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,080
Pi Seon Ju. Wake up.

354
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:30,310
Pi Seon Ju.

355
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,320
Wake up.

356
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,550
Is it you,

357
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:38,859
my darling husband?

358
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:42,260
Wake up.

359
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,530
Husband...

360
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:47,169
You made it.

361
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:48,899
What are you saying?

362
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:51,840
Are you okay, Ms. Pi? Get a grip.

363
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,570
What on earth... Who did this to you?

364
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,439
Was it Ms. Jin?

365
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:57,709
Yes.

366
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:59,709
Stand up. Let's get out of here.

367
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:00,780
Can you get up?

368
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,280
Here we go.

369
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:05,649
Oh, no.

370
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,350
Mr. Kim.

371
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,889
You asked if I'd work with you.

372
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,560
Let's give it a go.

373
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,429
I was hesitant...

374
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:23,600
to work with Sang Ah's husband.

375
00:25:25,939 --> 00:25:27,669
But she did this to me.

376
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,010
What's wrong with us working as a team?

377
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:35,250
I want to...

378
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
give it a shot.

379
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,149
Okay.

380
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:42,290
Let's get out of here.

381
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,419
Be careful.

382
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,189
Why does my head hurt so much?

383
00:25:46,189 --> 00:25:48,560
- Your head?
- Did someone hit me?

384
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,399
- Let's go.
- It hurts badly.

385
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,830
- This isn't good.
- Poor me.

386
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,869
Let's go.

387
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,820
(Authorized Personnel Only)

388
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:16,790
What happened? How did she get out?

389
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:29,230
Did you let Seon Ju out?

390
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:32,469
What do you mean?
Did you lock her up somewhere?

391
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,969
And you left her there until now?

392
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,310
Isn't that a bit...

393
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,209
too much?

394
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:42,810
I forgot about her.

395
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,520
But she's not there,
so she got out somehow.

396
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,520
I don't know how she managed,

397
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,119
but she should know better
than to stay around after that.

398
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:06,740
Shall we begin
the Hansung project meeting?

399
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,780
I told the Hansung team
we'd submit two proposals for them...

400
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,879
to choose from blindly.

401
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:15,580
Why are you alone?
Couldn't you find a designer?

402
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:17,980
I found someone.

403
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:21,419
It's her first day here,

404
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,090
so I told her to take her time
and come in time for the meeting.

405
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,429
Who is it?

406
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,869
Here she is.

407
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,080
Hello. The name is Pi Seon Ju.

408
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,790
But you know that.

409
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,790
Let's see how things go.

410
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,969
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

411
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,020
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

412
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,320
Do you know how ugly you're being?

413
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:35,030
Move. Why do you keep appearing
wherever I am and getting in my way?

414
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,189
What's she doing here?

415
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,899
She started
working for my family yesterday.

416
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,730
You mean she lives with you?

417
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,330
See you every now and then.

418
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:43,270
Seon Ju. I got you a blind date.

419
00:28:43,469 --> 00:28:44,770
Is he in his right mind?

420
00:28:44,939 --> 00:28:46,800
He's not Seon Ju's type.

421
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:47,969
Ms. Pi Seon Ju.

422
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:52,409
