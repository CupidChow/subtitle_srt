1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,510
It's beautiful.

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,379
- Thank you.
- It suits you.

3
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,879
Mr. Kim.

4
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,149
They're overreacting just to infuriate us.

5
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:26,160
Shall we put on an act too...

6
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,590
and see how upset they get?

7
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,300
But...

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,430
how...

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,430
Shall we have a drink?

10
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:43,040
Ms. Pi.

11
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,879
You said you didn't feel well
because you drank last night.

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,349
I'll drink this instead.

13
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:52,679
Don't, Mr. Kim. It's fine.

14
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,980
No, it's really okay.

15
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,050
What?

16
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,859
Then I'll drink yours for you.

17
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:04,929
Don't.

18
00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:08,400
Don't force yourself
when you don't feel well.

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,700
What's that?

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,740
Are you trying to make us jealous?

21
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,939
That's only for people
who still have lingering feelings.

22
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,109
Is this your timid way of getting revenge?

23
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,480
We don't do that.

24
00:01:22,809 --> 00:01:24,450
It's not worth it.

25
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:26,620
A nice car and a fancy watch.

26
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:29,290
You try to show off your material wealth.

27
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,290
You two don't look happy at all.

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,389
Are you saying Mr. Jeon
needs to be with you to be happy?

29
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,559
Do you still like Nam Jin that much?

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,930
No.

31
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,730
My feelings for him.

32
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:56,749
They were bubbles.

33
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,519
They've vanished
and I've come to my senses.

34
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,059
You drank each other's beers.

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,090
You two got pretty close.

36
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:11,760
Yes. We're pretty close.

37
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,430
Right. Mr. Jeon's mother
came to the office...

38
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,970
and asked why I wasn't letting you go.

39
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,329
That's not the truth.

40
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:20,540
Tell her the facts.

41
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,880
I think we celebrated enough.

42
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,950
Let's go home.

43
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,510
Shall we, Ms. Pi?

44
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,649
Yes, sir.

45
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:48,700
Gosh, what's the occasion, Mom?

46
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,799
I just felt like
eating something nice with my son.

47
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:55,769
Didn't you order too much?

48
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,609
My incentive came through today.
Don't worry.

49
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:01,480
Shouldn't you treat
the whole family, then?

50
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,780
It's not enough to do that.

51
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,119
Dong Won.

52
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:09,850
When you grow up and get married,

53
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,389
if I were to sit alone at the ceremony,

54
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,660
would you be embarrassed?

55
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:17,489
I don't think so.

56
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,329
I'd be really hurt if you said yes...

57
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,399
after all I did to raise you.

58
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,230
Okay. If I think I'll feel embarrassed,

59
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:26,700
I won't get married.

60
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,869
What?

61
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,709
Eat up.

62
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:44,089
They looked annoyed, didn't they?

63
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:45,220
They did.

64
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:47,790
Do you feel a bit better now?

65
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,030
Yes.

66
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,130
I'm sorry for asking you
to do something so childish.

67
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,260
Don't be.

68
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,329
I took part at first
only because you asked me to,

69
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,970
but toward the end, I felt good too.

70
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:01,700
- Did you?
- Yes.

71
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,839
Do you think hanging out with you
made me a bit more like you?

72
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,510
But they were being childish first.

73
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:14,919
Earlier today,
Nam Jin asked me to help him...

74
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,049
move his stuff to show off his office.

75
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:20,220
He has the mental age of a child.

76
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,260
We should go way down...

77
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,089
to their level
if we want to deal with them.

78
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:28,529
Okay, but not too often.
Let's do it every now and then.

79
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:33,240
Do you feel all right?

80
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,310
You downed my drink in one go.

81
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,969
That's nothing at all to me.

82
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,380
- Good night.
- Bye.

83
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,659
I'm home.

84
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,690
Seon Ju.

85
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:59,959
Soon Ae came to my salon today.

86
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,500
- Who?
- The car accident family.

87
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,930
Grace Shim.

88
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,700
What for?

89
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:09,070
She suddenly showed up
and told me to move away.

90
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:10,969
She even offered to lend me money.

91
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,440
She came to ask me if I needed money.
I don't believe her.

92
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,209
She didn't even care
when we asked her to show mercy.

93
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,680
Why does she want to help us now?

94
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,889
Exactly.

95
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,349
The more we asked for help or time,
the more they cornered us.

96
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,529
She said something about
her sons-in-law knowing each other.

97
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:31,860
What does that mean?

98
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,029
What? I guess...

99
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:35,659
Nam Jin works there too.

100
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:38,529
That must be what she meant.

101
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,639
Then it should be "son-in-law."
Why did she go with the plural?

102
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:45,839
You're not involved with Nam Jin...

103
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,209
or someone else at work, are you?

104
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,349
I'm not.

105
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:52,349
Did you take the money she lent you?

106
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,649
No. It wasn't a gift.
She said it was a loan.

107
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,589
Why would I take the money
when it would only cause more trouble?

108
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,320
Good. You did the right thing.

109
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,229
The money would be a curse.

110
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,630
Still,

111
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,370
it was a shame.

112
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,940
Should I have taken the money...

113
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,139
so Mi Ju could have a nicer wedding?

114
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,610
Oh, gosh, no. My tongue slipped.

115
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,209
Pretend you didn't hear that. Goodness.

116
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:24,010
- I didn't mean that at all.
- Okay.

117
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,849
Hey. Where were you two?

118
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:32,719
We were nearby.

119
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,820
Go to your room, Dong Won.

120
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:38,459
Goodness.

121
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:40,760
Oh, gosh.

122
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,170
Have you two found a husband?

123
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,399
Yes, I did.

124
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,740
You did? Who is it?

125
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
A guy friend.

126
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
What? You have one?

127
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,880
What about you? Did you find someone?

128
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:02,789
You can say that one of them went abroad.

129
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,389
Mom told you to do as I asked.

130
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:08,060
Unlike Jin Ju, I have no guy friends,

131
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,789
and the only guy I know
is the ex-husband...

132
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:12,599
I want out of my life.

133
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,829
Don't expect anything from me.

134
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,099
What about the homeowner?

135
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:20,269
Darn you.

136
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:23,240
We only just got him to forget
the blind date we forced on him.

137
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:26,209
Mom caused enough trouble for us.

138
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:28,380
Do you want to get kicked out?

139
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,279
You're so self-centered.

140
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,990
Aren't I better than the gimbap
she brought you in lockup?

141
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,399
Even Jin Ju managed to find a guy.

142
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,440
How can Seon Ju have zero friends to ask?

143
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,139
Oh, my gosh.

144
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,670
Oh, dear.

145
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,440
This darn sofa looks expensive,

146
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,610
but it's impossible
to lie down to watch TV.

147
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,990
Nam Jin. Let's talk.

148
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Mom.

149
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:22,769
Did you come to my office to see Mr. Kim?

150
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,969
Yes. That's what I wanted to talk about.

151
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:27,300
Why did you go to him?

152
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,469
What choice did I have
when he was dragging the divorce on...

153
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:31,570
like a taffy melting on a midsummer day?

154
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,539
What did you solve by getting involved?

155
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,110
Should I just watch and wait
when I'm alive and well?

156
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,349
She's only getting older.

157
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:40,680
You're aging too.

158
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,390
You should remarry soon
and have a son too.

159
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,160
- What on earth...
- I'm the only one who's anxious.

160
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,859
I went there thinking
I should be the one to wrap things up,

161
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,160
but I only heard something odd.

162
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,089
He's not the one dragging his feet.

163
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,430
Is it Sang Ah, then? That's nonsense.

164
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:58,969
Why do you keep getting involved
in our business?

165
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:00,099
You're not doing anything.

166
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,499
If you won't tell me, I'll ask Sang Ah.

167
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:03,540
Don't you dare.

168
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,410
If you talk to anyone again,
I'll put this apartment in my name.

169
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:10,009
What? You can't take back a gift.

170
00:09:11,109 --> 00:09:13,320
Will you just keep quiet?

171
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,979
Why did you get divorced
if this were the results?

172
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:18,719
Sang Ah is clinging to her husband
for leverage. You should've too.

173
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:21,190
- Mom.
- Fine.

174
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,290
You're not the type to keep
all options open to choose what's best.

175
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,530
I didn't raise you to be like that.

176
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:29,629
This is so frustrating.

177
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:31,869
Mom.

178
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,070
I got promoted.

179
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,140
You did? What to?

180
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:40,140
- To team leader.
- You were a manager.

181
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,440
What's higher up?

182
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:44,050
A team leader is.

183
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,550
I'm going to bed.

184
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,920
My gosh.

185
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,859
I guess Sang Ah's family
cares about you a lot.

186
00:09:53,619 --> 00:09:55,719
Did you get a pay raise too?

187
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,259
I'm so proud of Sang Ah.

188
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:02,829
It must've been hard to promote her
because everyone knows who she is,

189
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,339
but she managed to
win the promotion at last.

190
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:08,770
I hope she justifies my decision.

191
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:11,910
- I'm home.
- Hey.

192
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,680
Congratulations, Executive Director.

193
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,410
Thanks.

194
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,320
Don't act rashly and do your best.

195
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:21,719
She'll do just that.

196
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,089
It would've been nice
if we went somewhere to celebrate.

197
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,089
Some other time, Mom.

198
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,009
A nice car and a fancy watch.

199
00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:51,749
You try to show off your material wealth.

200
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,749
You two don't look happy at all.

201
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,020
Sang Ah is clinging to her husband
for leverage. You should've too.

202
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:18,339
Ms. Pi. You said you didn't feel well
because you drank last night.

203
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,839
I'll drink this instead.

204
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:30,119
He was like that?

205
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,640
Then I'll drink yours for you.

206
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,709
Don't.

207
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:54,979
Don't force yourself
when you don't feel well.

208
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,430
(Jin Architecture)

209
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:29,239
Hey, you.

210
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,709
Can I have a word?

211
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,420
I'm busy.

212
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:34,650
It won't take long.

213
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,780
Fine. Let go of me.

214
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:50,599
What's this about? Be quick.

215
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,599
You and Mr. Kim.

216
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,969
You said you were
just homeowner and tenant.

217
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,540
What I saw yesterday
was nothing like that.

218
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:02,040
I don't believe this.

219
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,479
What right do you have to ask about that?

220
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:06,349
I'm Ji Hyun's dad.
Why don't I have a right?

221
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:10,249
You two shouldn't be acting like that!

222
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,690
You and Mr. Kim
work together and live together.

223
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,489
Do you want to do that?

224
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,670
I got promoted,
so I think I can get a bigger loan.

225
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,369
I'll lend you the money.
Move out immediately.

226
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,910
So many people...

227
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,040
are suddenly offering to lend us money.

228
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,410
If you want me to move out,
give me the money, don't lend it.

229
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,050
You didn't even give me alimony.

230
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,479
- What?
- Yes.

231
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,749
I'll take your money.

232
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,290
Can't I pretend it's alimony?

233
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:50,729
But whether I move out
of that house or not...

234
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,160
is up to me.

235
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,700
Quit playing with words.

236
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:56,599
You're a mom.

237
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,640
Don't you care about Ji Hyun?
Get a hold of yourself!

238
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,570
My gosh. What am I hearing?

239
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,440
That's rich coming from a dad
who left in his lover's car...

240
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,009
when his daughter was watching.

241
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:12,979
What a rotten start to my day.

242
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,790
He's so cool.

243
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,160
I hope the baby is as cool as him.

244
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:29,969
Hello, Ms. Oh.

245
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,040
What did your family say when you
told them you'd marry Woo Sang?

246
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:35,300
Well...

247
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,109
They were really pleased.

248
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,670
They would be.

249
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,239
Are your brothers-in-law handsome?

250
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,810
I guess...

251
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:45,979
I'd have to say yes?

252
00:14:45,979 --> 00:14:48,180
They can't be as handsome as Woo Sang.

253
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,520
No one can deny that.

254
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,219
What do your brothers-in-law do?

255
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,489
Well...

256
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,890
One of them is into architecture.

257
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,560
Oh, that's a decent job.

258
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:05,930
We're rushing things
and the wedding is not far off,

259
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:08,670
but can everyone on your side make it?

260
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,440
Yes, of course. You don't have to worry.

261
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:13,839
Bye.

262
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:21,420
Seriously.

263
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,690
Is Seon Ju not going to find someone?

264
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:31,030
What am I to do if the only guy
she knows is her ex-husband?

265
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,430
I can't tell her to bring her ex-husband.

266
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,499
Why can't I?

267
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,390
Hello?

268
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,589
Hello, Nam Jin.

269
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,959
Are you doing okay?

270
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,020
Yes. What's up?

271
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,390
I'm getting married
on the last day of the month.

272
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,729
Are you? Congratulations.

273
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,859
Thanks.

274
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,270
I called to ask what your plans are then.

275
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:14,200
Could you come?

276
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,910
- What?
- I told my future in-laws...

277
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:21,680
that both my older sisters were married.

278
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,680
I didn't mean to lie,

279
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,050
but stuff happened.

280
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,320
One thing happened after another,
and it got out of hand.

281
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,020
Is your fiance some great guy...

282
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,619
for you to have to do this?

283
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:33,859
Is he heir to a fortune?

284
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,320
Don't tell anyone what I'm about to say.

285
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,030
I'm marrying the actor Jeong Woo Sang.

286
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,530
- Jeong Woo Sang?
- Yes, so...

287
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,570
I need two brothers-in-law
to attend the wedding.

288
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,200
- My gosh.
- Jin Ju found someone,

289
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,310
but Seon Ju hasn't yet.

290
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,440
Could you come over...

291
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:58,709
and sit with Seon Ju and pretend
to be her husband for a short while?

292
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,920
What?

293
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,619
Some divorced couples...

294
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,989
reunite just for the wedding
when their children get married.

295
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,859
Pretend I'm your child and...

296
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,690
My life hangs in the balance, you see.

297
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,160
Does Seon Ju know?

298
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,900
Did she ask you to ask me?

299
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,830
No, she didn't.

300
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:19,940
It won't take long. I promise.

301
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Please...

302
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,910
Hey. What are you doing in here?

303
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,170
I wasn't doing anything.

304
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,410
Bye, then.

305
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:32,749
What?

306
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,920
Who was it that you hung up like that?

307
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,819
It was a wedding planner.

308
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,890
There's a lot to prepare.

309
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,729
Your fiance said he'd visit today.

310
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,330
Help me clean the house.

311
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,459
Okay.

312
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:02,239
What the heck is wrong with her family?

313
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:07,719
"Exchange Divorce."

314
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,989
Should we entice the couples to divorce...

315
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:13,360
or urge them to stay together?

316
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:16,529
First, we set the atmosphere
to make them consider switching partners,

317
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:19,190
then we get them to consider reconciling.

318
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:22,259
We basically need them
to get their wires crossed...

319
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:24,229
so things get complicated.

320
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:27,069
The more love triangles there are,
the better, right?

321
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,610
Should I ask her to join our meetings?

322
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,479
Do you know another writer?

323
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,749
No.

324
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,789
Hey. What are you doing today?

325
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,860
Shall we meet up later?

326
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:50,989
What for?

327
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:52,959
To discuss the new program.

328
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,930
The one-day husband gig.

329
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:58,299
If we're to do that,
shouldn't we get our story straight?

330
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,969
Get what straight?

331
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,910
Where and how we met and got married.

332
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,610
We should come up with a story.

333
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,580
That story?

334
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:11,950
Our cover could get blown
if I showed up knowing nothing.

335
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:15,920
Of course. Do you think
I didn't get what you meant?

336
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,289
I'm not free today, though.

337
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,819
My sister's fiance is visiting.

338
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:24,059
The protagonist of this charade?

339
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,469
This looks nice.

340
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:32,100
Ms. Oh!

341
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,769
What is she doing here again?

342
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,170
Was the door open again?

343
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,809
Yes. Didn't you leave it unlocked for me?

344
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,180
Why is Mr. Jang so clumsy?

345
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,309
Why are you here?

346
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,319
I thought you'd be feeling lonely.

347
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,989
Woo Sang said you were okay,
but I was worried about you.

348
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,549
Were you?

349
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,430
You feel betrayed
because of what Mi Ju did, don't you?

350
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:03,100
You took her in as a favor
and she only caused a scandal.

351
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,200
Still, you fired her and kicked her out.

352
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
She reaped what she sowed
and justice prevailed.

353
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,009
Everything worked out.

354
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,069
Well, yes. That happens, doesn't it?

355
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:14,979
Where's Woo Sang?

356
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,809
He must have a work appointment.

357
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:21,450
Are you planning a private gathering?

358
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,219
What do you mean?

359
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:26,660
I heard Mr. Jang booking a place
for a private get-together.

360
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,390
What is it?

361
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,719
Oh, that?

362
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,259
It must be Mr. Jang's family gathering.

363
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:34,229
Why would we have to book a place?

364
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:35,259
Right?

365
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,029
Let's eat some of this.

366
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,529
- I'll cut it for us.
- Okay.

367
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,219
Hello?

368
00:20:56,219 --> 00:20:58,249
Did you make the booking?

369
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:04,489
Where did she go?

370
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:08,229
Mr. Jang's cousin works at that hotel.

371
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,469
Be sure everything is kept a secret.

372
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,469
Yes. It's a nice place.

373
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,499
A spacious place would only make it harder
to keep it quiet.

374
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,509
Keep what quiet?

375
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:20,709
Chu Ah is here, so I can't talk for long.

376
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,080
Anyway, so that no one hears
you're getting married,

377
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:26,209
be sure to tell Mi Ju
to watch what she says.

378
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,489
You're not meeting up in public, are you?

379
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:33,090
We're not. You told me to be careful.

380
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:40,759
We're being really careful.

381
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:42,830
Okay, bye.

382
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,499
- My gosh.
- Is Woo Sang getting married?

383
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,069
- What?
- With Pi Mi Ju?

384
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:54,279
- Well...
- No way.

385
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:57,479
Chu Ah. The thing is...

386
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:01,880
There's a reason I just can't fight.

387
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,850
Oh, no.

388
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:08,819
What should I do?

389
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,759
Oh, dear.

390
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,200
Pi Mi Ju. You'll pay for this.

391
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,749
I see just fine now.

392
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:43,019
I was unable to see
this lovely sight for so long.

394
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,739
When I was younger,
this was the best snack ever.

395
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,080
Here.

396
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,880
- Is it good?
- Yes.

397
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,680
Good. You must eat all sorts of things...

398
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,150
if you want to grow up to be like me...

399
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,319
and headbutt anyone and fight well.

400
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:16,420
Grandma. You could get into trouble
for teaching kids that.

401
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,090
School bullying is a huge problem.

402
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,190
Is it?

403
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,799
Don't eat too much.
You'll ruin your appetite for dinner.

404
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,799
- You've had enough.
- Okay.

405
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,140
Oh, dear. What's this?

406
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:29,269
What is this?

407
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:32,670
Inside is a photo of Tae Ri's grandpa.

408
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:34,739
Is there? Let's have a look.

409
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:36,880
Let me see what he looks like.

410
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,150
Is this your grandpa, Tae Ri?

411
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:44,620
No, this is.

412
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,489
He's pretty handsome.

413
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:50,860
But this isn't Soon Ae.

414
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:54,360
It really is someone else.

415
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:59,569
This man looks really familiar.

416
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,370
- Does he?
- Yes.

417
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,999
Where did I see him?

418
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,910
Don't, it's hot.
Go home if you're done snacking.

419
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:09,410
- I'll clean up.
- Okay.

420
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:15,920
I swear he looks familiar.

421
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:18,450
Where did I see him before?

422
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,590
Welcome.

423
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,630
Hey.

424
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,299
Don't you know me?

425
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:34,370
I'm at the right place.

426
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,469
Aren't you that fool?

427
00:24:39,569 --> 00:24:40,910
I am.

428
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:45,080
I'm the fool you headbutted,
leaving a scar.

429
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,319
My gosh. Who are these?

430
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,420
Your daughters?

431
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:53,860
Let go.

432
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,420
Where's Shim Soon Ae?

433
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,289
Don't ask me about that witch.

434
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:02,259
I haven't heard from her in decades.

435
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,330
How did you find me anyway?

436
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,200
You left your address
with people back in your hometown.

437
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,269
I didn't leave it
for the likes of you. Get lost.

438
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,140
And if you find Soon Ae,

439
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,809
tell her never to show herself before me.

440
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,350
- That I'll kill her if I see her.
- My gosh.

441
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:22,549
Leave!

442
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:28,019
My gosh.

443
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,469
That evil Shim Soon Ae.

444
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:38,999
I was going to tell...

445
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:40,840
but didn't out of pity for her.

446
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:45,309
Does she even know what I did for her?

447
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:49,140
- What did you do?
- Oh, nothing.

448
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,880
Who's the guy that just left?

449
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:54,180
What guy?

450
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,090
The guy who just left
that looked nasty and mean.

451
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,319
He looked really angry.
He kicked a can in the street.

452
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,489
Was he a customer? Did you two fight?

453
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,330
No.

454
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,660
He tried to sell chewing gum
and I told him to leave, that's all.

455
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:10,469
- Hey.
- What?

456
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:13,940

I'm scared of meeting your family.

460
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,499
I've heard of their tempers.

461
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:47,039
They can be fierce.

462
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,039
No one can handle them
when they're fired up.

463
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,039
- He's here.
- Yes.

464
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,209
- Hello.
- Hello.

465
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,610
- Hello.
- Hello.

466
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:01,749
- You're here.
- What's that, Mom?

467
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:03,989
- Welcome.
- We all met out here.

468
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,620
We're here.

469
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,959
- Hello.
- Hello.

470
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,130
You're wearing a disguise.

471
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,759
This is my eldest sister.

- My middle sister.

you found for the wedding?

No.

476
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:28,940
I'm just a guy who lives upstairs.

477
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,450
I see. You looked so nice together.

478
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,120
I thought you'd found someone perfect.

479
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,549
You look like an actual married couple.

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,799
- Okay.
- Come in.

- Come on.
- Bye.

484
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,969
