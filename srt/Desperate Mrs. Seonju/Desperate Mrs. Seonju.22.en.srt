00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:12,590
(Episode 22)

2
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,259
If we get 380,000 dollars for the house
and pay 150,000 to settle,

3
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,100
how much will be left?

4
00:00:17,499 --> 00:00:18,530
We'll have 230,000 dollars.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,940
We can get a long-term lease
in the area for 150,000.

6
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:27,240
You can offer the buyer a 10,000
or 20,000 dollar down payment...

7
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,409
for a monthly lease on the hair salon.

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,109
Then you can stay open here.

9
00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:33,379
Jin Ju.

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,850
That's genius.

11
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:37,379
We'll still have some money left.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,889
We can use the extra cash as seed money...

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,720
They say you should invest in bitcoins.

14
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,860
You're so knowledgeable.

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,400
Your fancy degree counts for something.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,830
Does it?

17
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,769
If we sell the house this time,
I'm sure it'll teach Mi Ju a lesson.

18
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,540
She could've befriended worse criminals
in prison and ended up worse off.

19
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,550
Let's consider this
a blessing in disguise.

20
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:08,580
Don't some people
make a complete turnaround?

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,750
I wonder.

22
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,090
No. This would be our first offense,

23
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,550
but you have two charges,

24
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,259
so if we can't settle, you will go away.

25
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,390
Are we...

26
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:22,129
making the right call?

27
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,300
It's a fact that house prices here
never went up.

28
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:30,500
I think it would be best to sell.

29
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,409
Mom. I promise
to work myself to the bone...

30
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,379
and buy back this house for you.

31
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:41,310
Until then, let's pretend
we're paying monthly rent...

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,580
and pay Mom
a certain amount each month, okay?

33
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,920
- Okay.
- Okay.

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,989
Do you mean that?

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,590
I want that on paper. Go get some.

36
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,190
Okay.

37
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,289
Don't you dare get in more trouble.

38
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,730
I'll disown all three of you then.

39
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,330
- Okay.
- But...

40
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,840
selling the house is a bit extreme.

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,899
Be quiet.

42
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,940
Your sisters are smarter than you.

43
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,409
This is what they both think.

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,480
It's a fact that house prices here
stayed the same.

45
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,780
We can do as your sisters say
and buy it back later.

46
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,950
Until we have enough money,
pay me on time each month.

47
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:22,450
Write down how much you'll each send.

48
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,360
Okay.

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,869
Seon Ju. Is this really the best option?

50
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,300
Could it be the best...

51
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:38,540
when you caused the worst disaster?

52
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:42,779
Since we decided to sell the house,

53
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,309
the best thing to do
is to sell it fast and settle soon.

54
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,880
Is there a place for us to rent long-term?

55
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:54,420
I looked up some available places nearby.

56
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,790
This is the kind of place
we can rent for that amount.

57
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,230
Take a look.

58
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:02,330
It's cleaner than this place now.

59
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,969
This house is too old, to be honest.

60
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,899
No one has 110-volt outlets
in the wall these days.

61
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:12,269
It would be a miracle
to even get what we ask for.

62
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,309
I feel so bad for Mom.

63
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,279
Me too.

64
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,380
She has three grown daughters,
and this is the best we can do.

65
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,050
I'm sorry...

66
00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:29,820
I'm a disappointment.

67
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,459
I'm not much better.

68
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,429
I spent everything on my husband,

69
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,300
and I have no money to offer now.

70
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,170
I'll become successful
and buy the place back in one go.

71
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:47,769
I'll make up for all the stress I caused
and make Mom happy and proud.

72
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,110
Wait and see.

73
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,110
No. I'd rather you not do anything.

74
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,779
Don't even try, please.

75
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,950
Yes.

76
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,589
The harder you try,
the more trouble you cause.

77
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,219
Let's just take things easy.

78
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,830
Let's get through this rough patch...

79
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,999
and make it up to Mom, okay?

80
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,239
I'll keep an eye on you.

81
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,709
Mr. Jeon the manager...

82
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,050
got me this to celebrate
his start at the company.

83
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,550
What? The cheat...

84
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:29,749
He got you that?

85
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:31,650
- He's a what?
- Never mind.

86
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:34,050
Look at this.

87
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,819
He insisted on getting you something too.

88
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,319
I chose this. What do you think?

89
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,989
Why did he get me something?

90
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,860
He said you were his role model.

91
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,499
He must be pleased to work for you.

92
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:48,800
Yes. It's rude to reject
someone's show of gratitude.

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,270
Where's mine? I'm an important person
in the relationship.

94
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,869
- Where's my gift?
- Why are you important?

95
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,939
There's a certain reason.

96
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,980
What?

97
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,280
I'm home.

98
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,579
So Woo.

99
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,949
Look at this. It's a gift from Mr. Jeon.

100
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,389
He got this for me and this for Sang Ah.

101
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:16,730
You have no idea
how thoughtful and caring he is.

102
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,199
I said he was better than
my own husband and son-in-law.

103
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:24,139
- Mom.
- I was kidding.

104
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:26,069
You can go on upstairs.

105
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,040
Okay.

106
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,509
What kind of reaction is that?

107
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,220
Couldn't he have at least said,
"It suits you?"

108
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,090
Leave him alone. He's sulking
because you compared someone to him.

109
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,110
Are you asleep?

110
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,739
Why?

111
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,780
Well,

112
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:14,150
I was wondering if I shouldn't have
suggested we sell the house.

113
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,090
Your suggestion...

114
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,290
will get us out of a mess.

115
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,429
Still,

116
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:28,129
I know what this house means to you.

117
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,999
Even the most important house...

118
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:33,340
means nothing if the family is scattered.

119
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,879
I can't let my daughters
become convicts...

120
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,239
just so I can keep the house.

121
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,290
You did your job...

122
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,489
as the eldest.

123
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,860
You found a solution...

124
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,759
to save your sister.

125
00:06:58,499 --> 00:06:59,530
Mom.

126
00:07:03,869 --> 00:07:04,970
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:07,970
Don't be sorry.

128
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,809
Come here.

129
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,389
(Jin Architecture)

130
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,360
(Head of Planning, Kim So Woo)

131
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,699
Hello, sir.

132
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,170
Mr. Kim.

133
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:38,139
- Well, you see...
- Please take a seat.

134
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:53,119
- My wife won't move in there with me.
- What?

135
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:55,319
She's ill in bed with frustration.

136
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,389
So now the kids are upset too.

137
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:01,329
They told me...

138
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,860
to live in that house alone.

139
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,970
Where is your wife right now?

140
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,300
Well...

141
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,809
We'll keep what we built above ground,

142
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:20,150
but we'll dig a bit deeper underground
to the west to create the home theater.

143
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:21,509
A basement room?

144
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,150
Can we dig deeper into that section?

145
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,720
That extension...

146
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:29,290
is doable even with
the current license and clearance.

147
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:33,489
How much extra will it cost me?

148
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:37,960
We must dig, insulate,
and prevent condensation,

149
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,670
so it will cost you a little extra.

150
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,800
But I'll see if we can
save you money elsewhere,

151
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,240
and I won't charge you
for changing the drawing plans.

152
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:54,179
That means without spending too much more,

153
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:55,910
you both will get what you want.

154
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,179
Well, thank you.

155
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,890
I wondered
if I didn't even deserve that much...

156
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,819
after I supported my family for decades.

157
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:06,059
Hey.

158
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:08,929
You're the best, Mr. Kim.

159
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:11,900
I called Mr. Jeon the best last time,
and I take it back.

160
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:14,130
- Good job.
- Not at all.

161
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,740
Our happiness comes from
satisfying a client.

162
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,339
Can we go home now?

163
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:21,939
- Well...
- Your hair is a mess.

164
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,040
You can dance all you want.
Now let's go home.

165
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:28,809
I barely got Mom
to agree to sell the house.

166
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:31,679
Do all you can
to sell it as soon as possible.

167
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:33,250
Don't worry.

168
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,020
I'll recommend your house
to anyone who comes asking.

169
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,390
Good.

172
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:58,439
My gosh.

173
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,650
No way.

(Lottery Tickets)

175
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:09,719
- Seon Ju.
- Hey.

176
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,959
Where are you headed?

177
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,059
My part-time job fell through.

178
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,229
Is that why you look so down?

179
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,839
Have you and Nam Jin
not patched things up yet?

180
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,140
Forget it.

181
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:30,979
What is it?

182
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:36,309
I'm moving in tomorrow,
so make sure it's nice and clean.

183
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:38,179
Yes, madam. Don't worry.

184
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,420
"Madam?"

185
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:46,829
It's just right for a single woman.

186
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,359
It would be even nicer if I had a man.

187
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:53,500
What?

188
00:10:54,099 --> 00:10:55,729
He asked for a divorce?

189
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,540
There was an extra toothbrush
at the apartment?

190
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:02,010
Then he's definitely cheating.

191
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:07,179
Nam Jin has lost his mind.
How could he do this to you?

192
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,280
Let's see who he's seeing.
Where does he work?

193
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,449
He won't tell me.

194
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:17,290
Then he's seeing someone from work.

195
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,160
Can't you find out where he works?

196
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,300
He said he worked at
the same place as her.

197
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,640
The witchy car owner?

198
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,209
"Head of Interior at Jin Architecture."

199
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,609
He works at Jin Architecture.

200
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:40,510
She does interviews like this?

201
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,420
What will you do?

202
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:47,250
About what?

203
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,420
Will you divorce Nam Jin or not?
Make up your mind first.

204
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,630
I can't divorce him like this.
It's just not fair.

205
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,729
It's not.

206
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,829
Then you must split those two up.

207
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,699
Call Nam Jin and ask if he's at work.

208
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,410
Where are you right now?

209
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:13,910
At work?

210
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:16,079
No. Never mind.

211
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,250
- He's at work.
- Get up. We're going.

212
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,459
Hey, Mr. Kim.

213
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,500
I heard about the garden mansion.
You handled it nicely.

214
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,069
Mr. Hwang is very grateful.

215
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:40,069
Sure.

216
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:45,679
All sorts of things happen at work,
so don't take it too personally.

217
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,309
I won't.

218
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:50,179
I'm learning a lot from Mr. Kim.

219
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,189
Thanks for the gift yesterday.

220
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:56,189
Don't buy me anything again.

221
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,920
Yes, sir.

222
00:12:58,089 --> 00:12:59,290
- Let's go.
- Okay.

223
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:06,500
Gosh, you look nice today.

224
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:11,000
Goodbye.

225
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:19,339
He thanked us for the job.
We met by chance at the department store.

226
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,880
We're trying to get along,
and I don't want you to misunderstand.

227
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:27,390
Okay.

228
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,839
- Where are you?
- To check the options on my new car.

229
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,140
I'll come with you.

230
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,449
I'll protect you from now on.

231
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,550
I won't lose you again.

232
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:02,349
Good. Don't lose me again.

233
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,719
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,319
I'm so sorry for not recognizing you.

235
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,900
Okay, and cut.

236
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,900
Let's take a short break.

237
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,099
She's not even pretty,
and she's the darn lead.

238
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,439
Woo Sang.

239
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,540
What do you want now?

240
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,280
Do we have anything with caffeine?
I'm dead tired.

241
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,449
Okay.

242
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:30,880
Director.

243
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,550
How have you been doing?

244
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,189
I'm Pi Mi Ju.

245
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:38,589
I used to act when I was a teen
before I quit.

246
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,559
You must be exhausted.

247
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:43,300
Drink this and get your energy back.

248
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,500
Right.

249
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,069
Yes. Thank you.

250
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:56,640
How have you been doing since then?

251
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,349
Well... I can't say I was well.
I've been doing whatever I could.

252
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:05,179
The assistant director
asked me to give this to you.

253
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,949
Why would he ask you to do that?

254
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,959
Does it matter as long as you get it?

255
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,160
Can I do anything else for you?

256
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:21,199
Shall I throw it away for you
on my way out?

257
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:24,300
Will you do that?

258
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,339
Sure.

259
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:31,679
Yoon Gi. Assistant Director.

260
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,709
Why does he disappear for so long?

261
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,750
The dust...

262
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:41,520
has piled up.

263
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,990
(Jin Architecture)

264
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,530
She's the CEO's daughter?

265
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:25,059
I knew she was rich,
but Jin Architecture's CEO's daughter?

266
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:26,770
How impressive.

267
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:29,469
Let's go inside.
We'll find her and crush her.

268
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,800
- How do we get in?
- What?

269
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,939
- Wasn't that crazy?
- It was.

270
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,949
(Jin Architecture)

271
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,780
- Thanks for the treat.
- It was just lunch.

272
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,949
- Even so.
- Yes, right?

273
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:48,290
It was still nice.

274
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,790
So...

275
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:57,859
you do have an employee
called Jeon Nam Jin, right?

276
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,559
What is this about?

277
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:01,670
Can you please leave?

278
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:04,670
Jin Sang Ah is here.

279
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:12,240
What are you doing here?

280
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,579
I'm not here to see you.

281
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,119
But since we met,
I'd like to ask you something.

282
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,190
- About what?
- Do you know...

283
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,520
if there's a female employee here...

284
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,430
or at one of your business partners...

285
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,359
who seems extra close to my husband?

286
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,159
A female employee?

287
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,869
Why ask?

288
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:38,069
I just want to get some facts.

289
00:17:38,569 --> 00:17:39,639
Is your husband...

290
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:41,669
having an affair or something?

291
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:44,740
Whatever. You can go on your way.

292
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:47,109
- Darn it.
- Wait.

293
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,720
Do you have the money to settle?

294
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,589
Don't worry. We'll get it somehow.

295
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:56,290
Hey. Let's stand guard outside.

296
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,690
You caused a fuss at my mother's salon.

297
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,430
Barging in and causing a scene
whenever something is wrong...

298
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:07,669
Is that all you can do?

299
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
What?

300
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,139
It looks like you're here to check
if your husband is cheating on you.

301
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:15,040
Grill him at home.

302
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,740
Do you want to cause trouble
at his workplace over a hunch?

303
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,579
- Listen, lady.
- You're about to ruin his career.

304
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,220
This would disgust any man.

305
00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:28,619
Hey. What do you know about us?

306
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:30,790
- Get them out of here.
- Sure.

307
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,089
- Please leave.
- No, wait.

308
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:35,589
Hey, when did I say
I came here to cause trouble?

309
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:38,129
- I just... That really hurt.
- Let's go.

310
00:18:38,129 --> 00:18:40,930
- Are you okay?
- Goodness.

311
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:42,700
(Jin Architecture)

312
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,270
(Jin Architecture)

313
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,980
We didn't do anything wrong in there.

314
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,849
The witch did have a point.

315
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,079
Let's not cause trouble for him at work
unless you're going to leave him.

316
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,119
You were the one who wanted to come here.

317
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,050
It's upsetting,
but let's back down for now.

318
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:05,220
Why don't you stake out
his studio apartment later?

319
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:07,990
Darn it. This place...

320
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,329
(Jin Architecture)

321
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,059
Whatever.

322
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,369
I hide or you hide.
I'm sick of this situation.

323
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,609
I'll leave my husband once I get promoted.

324
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:30,520
You sort it out as soon as possible.

325
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:38,490
(Head of Interior, Jin Sang Ah)

326
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:40,460
What's up?

327
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,659
I'm thinking of inviting
Mr. Jeon to dinner today.

328
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:45,530
Ask if he's free.

329
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,899
A dinner invitation?

330
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:49,000
What for?

331
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,270
We need him to work hard for the company.

332
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:55,639
I should thank him for the gifts.

333
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,309
Are you free this evening?

334
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,109
My mom wants to invite you to dinner.

335
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,050
I don't have plans. Are you okay with it?

336
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,819
Hey. He said yes.

337
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,319
Okay, good. Tell him I won't prepare much,
so he shouldn't feel any pressure.

338
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,230
- Ma'am, work a little faster.
- Okay.

339
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,500
Do we have any fruit?

340
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:21,970
We're out of fruit.

341
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,569
Go and get some fruits to serve later.

342
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:26,669
Yes, ma'am.

343
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:35,010
Why am I getting butterflies
when I'm just inviting an employee?

344
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,980
It feels like I'm getting ready
for a pre-wedding family gathering.

345
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,720
I should ask if the others are free too.

346
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:46,490
(Head of Planning, Kim So Woo)

347
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,990
Hello, Mother.

348
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,000
Are you free this evening?

349
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:53,599
I don't have other plans.

350
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,270
Okay. I invited Mr. Jeon to dinner.
You should join us.

351
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,569
You invited Mr. Jeon?

352
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:00,710
Yes.

353
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:03,069
See you later.

354
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,119
Here's the interior blueprint.

355
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,559
Did you invite Mr. Jeon to dinner?

356
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,559
Yes.

357
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:22,359
I heard about it just now.

358
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:23,629
Are you sure...

359
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:27,470
we're pretending to have no problems?

360
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:31,270
Mom invited him to thank him
for the gifts he got us.

361
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:35,109
I was going to say no,
but I thought it would look weird.

362
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:41,180
I feel uncomfortable
that things keep happening,

363
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,450
but doing our best
while pretending we have no problems...

364
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,990
You have to try just as much.

365
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:50,520
Treat him like an ordinary guest.

366
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,290
Okay?

367
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,180
You want me to take this to the site?

368
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,020
Why do you look so gloomy?

369
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,990
Is your well-educated husband
not coming home at all?

370
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,990
No.

371
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,460
- He wants a divorce.
- What?

372
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,230
My goodness.

373
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,159
You shouldn't get divorced, though.

374
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:37,139
All sorts of useless fools cling to you
when you become single.

375
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:40,940
You'll never find someone better
even if you try.

376
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,069
But...

377
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:45,809
I don't think I can win him back easily.

378
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:48,349
Make him come back
even if you go the hard route.

379
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:50,819
Cling to his pants or flop down
on the ground in front of him.

380
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:52,280
Get him to stay.

381
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:57,559
Kids are left with lasting trauma
when their parents split up.

382
00:22:57,889 --> 00:22:59,619
What wouldn't you do for your kid?

383
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,139
Hey.

384
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:16,609
- Hello.
- Welcome. Take a seat.

385
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:18,839
We meet often today.

386
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,550
My wife gets strange ideas sometimes.

387
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:25,520
I had to thank him for the gifts.

388
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:28,450
Thank you for having me over.

389
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,720
You didn't have to bring something.

390
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,290
Hello.

391
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,760
Hello.

392
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,770
Where are So Woo and Tae Ri?

393
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,899
Tae Ri had dinner already,

394
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:47,069
and So Woo will join us soon.

395
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:49,369
- Hey.
- Hello, everyone.

396
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:51,909
Hi. Come and sit down.

397
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,980
Shall we all dig in?

398
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,720
I hope the food is to your taste.

399
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:01,750
I used whatever was in the fridge.

400
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,020
I happen to like everything here.

401
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,119
Do you? That's good to know.

402
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,389
- Enjoy yourself.
- Thanks.

403
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:11,230
How is work, Sang Ah?

404
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,500
You spent a fortune on your degree,
so I expect some output.

405
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,270
Will you stop it?
Save that topic for work.

406
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:23,639
Sang Ah said you helped her a great deal
when she studied abroad.

407
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,180
Thank you.

408
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:29,109
Didn't you say
you only had mutual friends?

409
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,619
Yes. Even if you don't have
direct contact with each other,

410
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:36,290
you end up helping each other if you
study the same thing at the same place.

411
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,329
Have one of these, honey. You like this.

412
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,300
I don't feel well.

413
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,169
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

414
00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:57,740
- Oh, dear.
- I'm so sorry.

415
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,250
Sang Ah, I think you should lend him
some of So Woo's clothes.

416
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,919
- I guess so.
- Oh, no.

417
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,750
- Come with me.
- Okay.

418
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,089
- Chu Ah.
- You should've been careful.

419
00:25:19,629 --> 00:25:22,169
Do you not have an appetite?
Do you not like the food?

420
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:23,970
I do.

421
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,079
Goodness.

422
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,879
Try this on.

423
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,990
Okay.

424
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:46,020
Is this the room you share with Mr. Kim?

425
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:51,159
Does it feel strange?

426
00:25:57,069 --> 00:25:58,169
Don't.

427
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,079
Are you crazy?

428
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,839
You started it.

429
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,550
Is it Mom and Dad?

430
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,020
No, wait.

431
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,700
Hey.

432
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:35,710
What's up with him?

433
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,339
- I'm done, so I'll go to him.
- Okay.

434
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:39,780
- Go check on him.
- I will.

435
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,079
Tae Ri.

436
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,180
Did you see something just now?

437
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,589
That was nothing, so don't tell Dad.

438
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,659
If you tell him, I won't be your mom.

439
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,800
Do you want to be alone again?

440
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,000
Tae Ri.

441
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,770
What is it?

442
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,409
What's wrong, Tae Ri?

443
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:10,040
Why are you crying? What is it?

444
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,780
He must've seen an insect go by.

445
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,780
Right, Tae Ri?

446
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:39,339
Why are you crying?

447
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:57,889
(Jeil Residence Hotel)

448
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,050
Cling to his pants or flop down
on the ground in front of him.

449
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,889
Get him to stay.

450
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:30,149
What wouldn't you do for your kid?

451
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,490
She's right.

452
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:37,230
What wouldn't I do for Ji Hyun?

453
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,270
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

454
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,220
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

455
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,319
So Woo knows, doesn't he?

456
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,319
- Why do you like him?
- He has a taste of the wild.

457
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,559
Jin Architecture?

458
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,530
I called my friend's company,
so give them a call.

459
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:10,530
Pass the interview and get the job.

460
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,159
I'll find out who you are
and end you today.

461
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,669
Jin Sang Ah?

462
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:15,869
Is it Seon Ju or me?

463
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:17,470
It's me, you witch!

464
00:29:20,669 --> 00:29:22,669
