1
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,289
That's enough!

2
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:12,859
That's not enough!

3
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:15,159
You go back to your job!

4
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:16,830
- Let's take this all the way!
- My goodness.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,330
Let's go to court!

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,100
Get up right now!

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,100
No!

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,409
- Oh, my gosh.
- My arm!

9
00:00:33,279 --> 00:00:34,450
Stop it!

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,520
What do you think you're doing?

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,380
You've done more than enough!

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,060
- Oh, my goodness.
- I think I hurt my back.

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,289
- My back...
- My gosh.

14
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:49,429
Step back.

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,700
(Episode 18)

16
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,539
Tae Ri. I'm almost done packing.

17
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:07,579
Shall we pack your things now?

18
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:08,679
Dad.

19
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,980
Leaving with you...

20
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,990
to find our sweet home first...

21
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:16,059
Does that mean breaking up with Mom?

22
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:19,890
No.

23
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:23,559
We'll live separately...

24
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:25,559
to take some time apart.

25
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,069
They're a bunch of psychos.

26
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:37,610
They really are.

27
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,410
Hey.

28
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:44,750
- Sang Ah. You answer my phone.
- Okay.

29
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,449
Hi, Dad.

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,530
- We're at a hospital.
- Oh, my gosh.

31
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,959
Mom is hurt.

32
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,390
What?

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,929
How did she get hurt?

34
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,330
Okay. I'll come over now.

35
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,000
It's true.

36
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,009
If we live apart for a while,

37
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,709
we'll realize
how much we mean to each other...

38
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,179
and will become even closer.

39
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,319
So Woo, we must go to the hospital.

40
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,949
- The hospital?
- My wife and Chu Ah...

41
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:20,120
are both hurt.

42
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:22,289
- Get ready and come downstairs.
- Okay.

43
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,220
Oh, dear.

44
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,660
I won't be long.
Stay home with the helper.

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,840
That means breaking up.

46
00:02:56,359 --> 00:03:00,389
You're the person in the proverb
that says we shouldn't...

47
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,699
take anyone in because they'll betray you!

48
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:04,259
What's your problem?

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,169
What do you think you did for me
that you keep saying you took me in?

50
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,699
Enough with the nuisance. Get out.

51
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:11,840
This is my business.

52
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,910
- I'm glad this is your business!
- Oh, my gosh.

53
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,680
I'll tell all your customers...

54
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,850
just how rude you are
and how little you think...

55
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,680
of people who did you a favor.

56
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,419
Listen, everyone! Shim Soon Ae here...

57
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:25,650
Be quiet!

58
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,750
My goodness.

59
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,160
I thought Ms. Shim was so elegant.

60
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,590
You can never judge a book by its cover.

61
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,889
She's not elegant at all.

62
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,799
I should think again about whether Chu Ah
could be my future daughter-in-law.

63
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,569
People scare me so much.

64
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:46,669
(Paran Hospital)

65
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:49,009
I pulled a muscle. For real this time.

66
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,079
You told me many times already.
That's enough.

67
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,810
- Did you get the doctor's note?
- Yes.

68
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,880
- My leg hurts too.
- Goodness...

69
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,419
Honey.

70
00:03:58,419 --> 00:03:59,919
How did this happen?

71
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,160
The car accident freaks barged in
and caused a fuss.

72
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:06,289
Mom got admitted,
and I got treated in the ER.

73
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:08,130
What's wrong with those people?

74
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:10,799
What about you? Were you hurt?

75
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,100
No, I'm fine.

76
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,430
Why won't you say anything?

77
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,239
Aren't you worried at all?

78
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:18,799
Get well soon.
I hope for a speedy recovery.

79
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:21,039
You too, Chu Ah.

80
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,210
We can't really work well
if the family is suffering at home.

81
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,479
This is a mess.

82
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,379
It could've been much worse.

83
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,320
- Be more careful.
- Okay.

84
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,590
So Woo, take Sang Ah home.

85
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:34,950
She must be in shock
because she had to deal with...

86
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,820
a bunch of thugs.

87
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,359
Take her to a nice restaurant
on the way home and cheer her up.

88
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,030
We must go to the police station.

89
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:43,200
What?

90
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:45,129
Go with them, So Woo.

91
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,299
No. We must give statements,
and that will take a while.

92
00:04:48,299 --> 00:04:49,669
I'd rather go alone with Chu Ah.

93
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:51,970
Yes, we'll go on our own.
That would be easier.

94
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:53,640
Be thorough and decisive.

95
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:55,470
You don't have to let them off lightly.

96
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,039
Will you stay here for a while
and drive me home?

97
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:00,249
Okay.

98
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,280
Can I have a word?

99
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,049
Honey, this corset thing gives me an itch.

100
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:09,590
- Where?
- A little lower down.

101
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:17,799
You won't tell Dad about us, will you?

102
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,369
- We have to one day.
- I'll be the one to tell.

103
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:22,539
Don't you bring it up.

104
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,570
Do you care what Father thinks?

105
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,010
My mom just got admitted.

106
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,840
Must you shock her even further?

107
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,109
Will it be less shocking...

108
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:35,580
if we wait a few days?

109
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,350
See you later, Mom.

110
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,780
Sang Ah.

111
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,220
Where did she go?

112
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,890
Darn it. Jin Sang Ah.

113
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,429
I didn't mean to assault her.
It happened while I tried to help her.

114
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,299
Why do you make me repeat myself?

115
00:05:58,299 --> 00:05:59,570
We all saw what happened.

116
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,140
Mister. Did you see the CCTV footage?

117
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,439
Did you watch it carefully?

118
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,609
Yes. I watched it carefully.

119
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,879
You grabbed her forcefully
and got tangled up in a brawl.

120
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,450
I saw you kick a lamp and a person.

121
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,189
The lamp swayed
as if it was going to fall.

122
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:17,789
I kicked it away from everyone
in case someone got hurt.

123
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:19,429
That's not what it looks like.

124
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:22,530
Anyway, it's a fact
your victims hurt their back and arm.

125
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,999
Detective, sir.

126
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,929
My girls aren't that rude or aggressive.

127
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,340
My husband deserted us
when I was a young mom.

128
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,280
Ma'am. Your sob story won't work today.

129
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,580
You threatened them by saying
you'd worked in construction for years,

130
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,910
so you were stronger than you looked.

131
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,820
- Is that a threat?
- It is.

132
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,850
I'm stronger than most women.

133
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,220
I box a bit...

134
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,059
You shouldn't assault others
if you're a trained boxer.

135
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,460
That comment
could get you aggravated assault.

136
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,559
No, then don't you dare mention that.

137
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:56,760
Don't mention what?

138
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,929
What trick will you pull this time?

139
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,330
- Hello.
- Here's the doctor's note.

140
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:04,799
My mom was admitted,

141
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,970
and as you can see,
her arm will take five weeks to heal.

142
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:12,039
I'm here to submit the doctor's note
and make sure we're heard.

143
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:15,309
We won't settle.

144
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,879
These people are the worst of the worst.

145
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:23,020
Assault, obstruction of business,
vandalism, and blackmail.

146
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,789
They also tried to flee
during the initial questioning.

147
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,789
Charge them with the maximum penalty...

148
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:30,760
you can get them.

149
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:32,260
Darn you!

150
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,270
- Seon Ju!
- I'll kill you.

151
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,369
- Hold back.
- Sit down.

152
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:38,739
Do you want to add another assault charge?

153
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,109
We should be careful at our age.
One small sprain can be drastic.

154
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:45,710
Don't say that.

155
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:49,309
I wouldn't die first
and leave you all alone.

156
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,020
How could you?

157
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,090
Don't say that, even as a joke.

158
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,489
I won't be here for long. Don't worry.

159
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,229
- Darn it.
- Goodness.

160
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:04,229
Aren't you taking this too far?

161
00:08:04,299 --> 00:08:06,129
You're the ones who went too far.

162
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:08,999
She's an actor.
How do you expect her to work now?

163
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,439
She wasn't that good anyway.

164
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,470
What?

165
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,770
Mom got admitted,
and that's a detriment to her business.

166
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,239
But Seon Ju's friend and Actress Jin.

167
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,239
Please let us off.

168
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,210
No. Let's follow the law.

169
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,320
You mentioned employment and labor law
when you demanded I pay you.

170
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,650
You love to follow the law,
so let's do that.

171
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,720
It would be so unforgiving
to always follow the law to a T.

172
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:34,929
Yes. I don't know
if you're married or not, but...

173
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,100
Let's do what's best for everyone
and drop this whole thing.

174
00:08:40,869 --> 00:08:44,040
Okay, then.
We really don't want to settle,

175
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,040
but if you pay up 55,000 dollars
for the initial car accident...

176
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:52,109
as well as 50,000 more
for the second assault today, we will.

177
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,409
Hey! What kind of math formula is that?

178
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,450
Are you thieves?

179
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,690
- Mom...
- Be quiet. Don't cry.

180
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,220
I'd charge you more,

181
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,659
but I won't
since you don't seem that well-off.

182
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:06,259
We won't settle for anything less.

183
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:07,659
Let's go.

184
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,960
Oh, my gosh. That witch...

185
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,729
- Hey!
- Hey!

186
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,570
(Criminal Affairs Investigations)

187
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,170
My goodness.

188
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:19,040
They're an evil duo.

189
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,609
(Trustworthy police, a safe nation)

190
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:23,080
Did they have to do this
the day I brought Ms. Oh over?

191
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,739
What would she think of us?

192
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:26,609
You get home on your own.

193
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:27,749
Why?

194
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:30,080
Are you off to see your lover?

195
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,249
You're off to see him
after fighting his wife?

196
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,659
You're insane.

197
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,960
What's wrong with that?

198
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,529
His wife doesn't seem to know yet.

199
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,499
She'll cause such a huge fuss
when she does.

200
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,269
Drop me off on the way!

201
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:49,999
I can't drive!

202
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:53,440
Detective. What should we do now?

203
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,009
Assault cases aren't automatically dropped
even if you settle.

204
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:59,649
You should've tried to settle
before they lodged the complaint.

205
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:03,050
What are we to do, then?

206
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,420
Mister.

207
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,820
Don't you have anyone to call?

208
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,590
Do you have family other than you, ma'am?

209
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,590
You can call Nam Jin.

210
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,359
If he can't help now,
he's an ornament, not a husband.

211
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:18,129
Call him right now.

212
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:19,229
Well...

213
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:21,830
My phone got smashed.

214
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:24,100
- Mi Ju, you call him.
- Okay.

215
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,889
(Mi Ju, youngest sister-in-law)

216
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,029
The person is unable to answer the phone.

217
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,529
He won't pick up.

218
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,830
Darn it.

219
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:58,499
Our husbands are no good, dead or alive.

220
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,909
No. This is all on me.

221
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,979
I was the one who said we should barge in.

222
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:07,050
Look at what I got you into.

223
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,350
I should've died long ago.
Why did I live so long?

224
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,489
You're at it again.

225
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:15,320
It won't work this time.

226
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,389
No, Mom.

227
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,859
It's all my fault.

228
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,560
If I hadn't kicked that lamp...

229
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,600
No, before that,

230
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,300
if I hadn't grabbed that brat
by the arm...

231
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,840
If I'd driven a nicer car...

232
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,570
and the trunk didn't fly open
in the accident...

233
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,779
If only it had a camera in the back...

234
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:41,379
Seon Ju.

235
00:11:41,379 --> 00:11:44,350
Why is that your fault?

236
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:46,050
Darn it.

237
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,450
I once went to get my fortune told.

238
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,519
The shaman took one look
at my date of birth...

239
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:54,930
and tut-tutted in surprise and pity.

240
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,359
She said my life would be rough.

241
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,600
I said my life was bearable,

242
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,570
that it wasn't that much worse.

243
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,369
That was what I told myself so far.

244
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,769
I guess the shaman was right.

245
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:09,369
When Jin Ju was widowed...

246
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:11,040
- and you fainted...
- Darn it.

247
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:17,379
Mom. I swear.

248
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,019
I wanted to create a happy family
and not disappoint you.

249
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:25,159
I honestly...

250
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:29,159
tried as best as I could.

251
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:32,460
I can't even reach the husband...

252
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,499
I worked so hard
to put through his studies.

253
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:40,869
I'm too ashamed to face you, Mom.

254
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,440
No, Seon Ju.

255
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,479
I'm losing confidence
that I can make you proud.

256
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,649
No, Seon Ju.

257
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,889
After Nam Jin went abroad to study,

258
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:55,749
I was left with so much pent-up energy.

259
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:58,220
If only I hadn't taken up boxing,

260
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,690
none of this would've happened!

261
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,859
- Darn me!
- Oh, dear.

262
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:05,300
Calm down.

263
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,670
I'm so sorry, Mom.

264
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,269
Why is this your fault?

265
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:14,040
- I'm really sorry.
- My gosh...

266
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,710
Those poor women...

267
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,080
- Who is it?
- It's me.

268
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,820
You were home?

269
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,259
Hello.

270
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,330
Hey.

271
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,190
My gosh.

272
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,129
I've been washing that
in my old washing machine,

273
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,930
and it keeps breaking down.

274
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,940
I'll get Seon Ju to wash my bedding now.

275
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,239
Is she not home?

276
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,869
I can't reach her.

277
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:49,639
(Mi Ju, youngest sister-in-law)

278
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,810
(Jean)

279
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:53,950
I'll go to the studio apartment.
Let's meet up.

280
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,279
Can you watch Ji Hyun
until Seon Ju comes home?

281
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,519
A sleeping kid doesn't need watching.

282
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,489
You be honest.

283
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:05,190
- About what?
- Are you seeing someone?

284
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:10,930
I have a better hunch than tomboy Seon Ju.

285
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:14,700
- I'm not seeing anyone.
- As if you're not.

286
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,029
You are.

287
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,210
You look smarter and dress better
since you got back from the US,

288
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,840
so some girl thought you were rich.

289
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,409
Girls like that can be scary.

290
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:25,509
Seon Ju is rough around the edges,

291
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,509
but she's not the scheming type.

292
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,420
The affair partner is
rarely as good as the wife.

293
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,080
Ditch her if you can.

294
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:35,450
I'll introduce her to you one day.

295
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,560
You'll what?

296
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:39,590
Who is she? What does she do?

297
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,889
I'll tell you later. Stay with Ji Hyun.

298
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,330
I can't stay for long.

299
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:50,499
He'll introduce her to me?

300
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,269
Is he going to get divorced
and marry her instead?

301
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,940
What got into him?

302
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:57,840
Who is this other woman?

303
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,249
Go home for now.

304
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,279
And try to settle as soon as possible.

305
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,920
Thank you so much, sir.

306
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,359
Thank you, sir.

307
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,590
- Girls. Thank him before you go.
- Thank you.

308
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,259
Come along.

309
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:16,560
- Bye. Let's go.
- Bye.

310
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:20,369
Hurry up.

311
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:26,040
(Human rights, Impartiality, Kindness)

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,940
(Trustworthy police, a safe nation)

313
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,040
It's cold.

314
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,879
Did you learn from Mom?

315
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,710
That was awesome.
You're a better actor than Chu Ah.

316
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,249
I almost cried.

317
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,450
Be quiet.

318
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,950
Mom. Should we do
an exorcism or something?

319
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,489
I think our family is cursed.

320
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:43,820
Do you want to...

321
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,290
go to a shaman
and ask them to do an exorcism...

322
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,690
to keep the whole family out of prison?

323
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:51,899
How about we buy some tofu
and eat that on the way?

324
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,029
You be quiet.

325
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:56,300
Are you that naive
to joke about in this situation?

326
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,840
Mom, I need to get back to Ji Hyun.

327
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,869
Okay. You go ahead.

328
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,340
Bye.

329
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,279
Darn you.

330
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,109
You two can walk home.

331
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,680
- I didn't bring my public transport card.
- I have no cash.

332
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,290
My goodness.

333
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,920
Were you eating cup noodles?

334
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Yes. What was the important business?

335
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,560
What took you so long?

336
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,100
Well, it's such an important issue,
you see.

337
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,100
Don't pour water in that.
I'll set you the table.

338
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,670
Don't bother. Cup noodles taste better.

339
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,369
Shall we just eat ramyeon too?

340
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,909
Shall we, then?
I can't be bothered to set the table.

341
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,710
With lots of tofu?

342
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:43,920
Yes.

343
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:47,090
Why? Why do you want lots of tofu?

344
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,420
I just feel like it.

345
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:53,590
Put that away.
I'll cook enough ramyeon for three.

346
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:54,729
Okay.

347
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,600
Goodness.

348
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:06,869
I have a better hunch than tomboy Seon Ju.

349
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,580
- I'm not seeing anyone.
- As if you're not.

350
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:11,979
You are.

351
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,480
I'll introduce her to you one day.

352
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,750
I knew it.

353
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,050
I don't even live with him,
and I can tell.

354
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,820
How can his own wife not know?

355
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:27,990
Come here, Ji Hyun.

356
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,600
How do your mom and dad
get on these days?

357
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:37,500
Mom and Dad?

358
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:40,810
Dad gets angry sometimes.

359
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:42,770
He gets angry? About what?

360
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,409
For no reason, I think.

361
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,750
How can there be no reason?

362
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,149
They say what a man does
depends on the woman.

363
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,750
He must get angry
because your mom upsets him.

364
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,760
Does your mom cry?

365
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,719
Does she throw things
for no good reason...

366
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,389
or rip your dad's things or something?

367
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:04,260
No, she doesn't.

368
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:06,770
She doesn't?

369
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,230
It's late. Go to bed.

370
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,570
Okay.

371
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,369
Goodness.

372
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,639
What should I do?

373
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,679
Should I do the loyal thing
and give her a hint?

374
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,649
No, that might just make things worse.

375
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:28,649
I should turn a blind eye
and leave it to them.

376
00:18:28,949 --> 00:18:29,990
Darn it.

377
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,600
I'm sorry about earlier.

378
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:43,570
My kid was alone at kindergarten...

379
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,040
What's wrong with your wife?

380
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:47,639
- What do you mean?
- Do you know what she did today?

381
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:50,980
She showed up at my mom's salon
with her whole family.

382
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,550
She assaulted us and vandalized the place
demanding we settle for less.

383
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:57,080
She turned the place upside down.

384
00:18:57,379 --> 00:18:59,050
Is she some kind of thug?

385
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,689
Chu Ah has a cast
because she pulled a ligament,

386
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,719
and my mom was admitted
with a sprained back.

387
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:07,359
I was at the hospital
and then the police station.

388
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:10,859
How many times must I go
to the police station because of her?

389
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,270
There was no end to her list of charges.

390
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:17,800
Her kick was just...

391
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:21,369
Did she ever beat you up?

392
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,969
Why would I get beaten up?

393
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:23,980
My goodness.

394
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:27,510
She's like a Neanderthal
that needs socializing.

395
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,119
How did you manage
to stay married to her for seven years?

396
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,320
How...

397
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:35,820
will she pay you back?

398
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,290
I don't know.

399
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:40,359
I'll have her locked up
if she can't get the money.

400
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,500
Talk to her
and tell her to leave us alone.

401
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,770
Okay.

402
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,520
Where were you at?
Why couldn't I reach you?

403
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,060
I was at the police station...

404
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:13,990
taking care of an incident.

405
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,590
What incident?

406
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:19,300
There was a car accident
and some other stuff.

407
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,770
Is Nam Jin home?

408
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:27,310
Your life is pretty eventful.

409
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,340
I'm your mother-in-law, and even I...

410
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,080
feel sorry for you.

411
00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:33,850
You're so frustrating.

412
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:35,679
Goodness.

413
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:37,649
Why?

414
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:41,649
You look smart, so why are you so slow?

415
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:43,050
You're too thick.

416
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,919
You say what my mom used to say.

417
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,159
My gosh.

418
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,090
I left some washing on the balcony.
Wash it and bring it over.

419
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:53,500
I called someone
to come and fix your washing machine.

420
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,730
Whatever.

421
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:16,219
Take a photo.

422
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,030
Take a photo.

423
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:33,840
What are you doing?

424
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:35,240
I'm doing my job.

425
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:38,109
"It's a light but tormenting injury."

426
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,250
"Still, I'll work hard for you,
my dear fans."

427
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,149
- There.
- Goodness.

428
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,560
(Posts)

429
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,270
(Please don't hurt yourself.)

430
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,070
(How do you look so good
in hospital garb?)

431
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:13,679
Hello.

432
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:32,300
Woo Sang. I got hurt.

433
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:34,000
Her arm is in a cast.

434
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,040
Did she get drunk and trip up?

435
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:41,209
The insurance fraud family assaulted me.

436
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,740
No way.

437
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,679
Are you waiting to shoot your next scene?

438
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,750
Yes.

439
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:52,280
Something crazy happened
at Ms. Shim's salon today.

440
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,750
- What happened?
- Ms. Shim looks so elegant, right?

441
00:22:55,219 --> 00:22:56,719
She's actually not.

442
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,560
"You're the person in the proverb
that says you shouldn't take anyone in!"

443
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,030
She fought someone like a wild animal.

444
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,699
My goodness...

445
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:09,270
Didn't Chu Ah tell you?

446
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,070
She texted to say she got hurt.

447
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,800
She got hurt?

448
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,010
Yes. It looked like
someone would get carted off.

449
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:19,209
Who on earth are those people?

450
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,310
They caused Chu Ah's car accident.

451
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,580
I guess it's true that they'd
hurt themselves to threaten others.

452
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,250
Don't even mention it. I was so scared...

453
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,490
that my legs almost gave out.

454
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,760
I should've taken a better look at them.

455
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:37,300
They could be the death of you
if you were to get involved with them.

456
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:39,159
Oh, my gosh.

457
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:41,530
Why would I get involved with that family?

458
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,429
I guess not.

459
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,040
How did they get involved
with such people?

460
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,520
You wouldn't know,

461
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:01,189
but your mother-in-law
had been through a lot.

462
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,419
I owe her a lot,

463
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:04,520
and I'm eternally grateful.

464
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:09,090
Don't worry too much. She'll be fine.

465
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,899
Father.

466
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,429
- I have...
- You'll get it when you're my age.

467
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,899
However much you love your kids,
your spouse is the one who counts.

468
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,609
Try to get along with Sang Ah.

469
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,469
As much as you care about Tae Ri,

470
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,510
I want Sang Ah to be happy too.

471
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:32,020
Tae Ri! What's wrong?

472
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,320
Stop it!

473
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,090
Please, Tae Ri!

474
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,820
Isn't that coming from upstairs?

475
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:38,990
I'll go and check.

476
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,699
I don't know why he's doing this.

477
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:51,699
Tae Ri.

478
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,540
Tae Ri.

479
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,770
Tae Ri.

480
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:04,719
What is it, Tae Ri?

481
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:09,350
Why are you doing this?

482
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:14,189
What is it, Tae Ri?

483
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,689
Look at me. What's the matter?

484
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,600
Mom.

485
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:21,469
Your mom? What about her?

486
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:25,469
Mom. Don't leave her.

487
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:29,439
Do you like her that much?

488
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:34,449
Why do you like her?

489
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,510
She doesn't play with you at all.

490
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,020
Mom is busy.

491
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:43,520
Still, she can't abandon me.

492
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,219
What are you saying?
Why would she abandon you?

493
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,330
You got me...

494
00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:50,760
from somewhere else.

495
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,030
What?

496
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:06,709
Goodness.

497
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,149
The total is 150,000 dollars.

498
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:12,149
We won't settle for anything less.

499
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:44,419
You wanted Tae Ri.

500
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:48,649
I asked many times
if you'd thought it through.

501
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:51,490
You said you'd make him
the happiest kid ever.

502
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:02,500
I can't help it that he's not the kid
I expected him to be.

503
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,500
- Is that my fault?
- What?

504
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:07,209
I was flustered too.

505
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,679
I tried, but I couldn't love him.
What was I to do?

506
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,639
Is love something you can force?

507
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:18,619
Jin Sang Ah.

508
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,719
What do Tae Ri and I mean to you?

509
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:40,669
Let's...

510
00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:43,469
get divorced.

511
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:48,949
How could you say that?

512
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,510
I told you to think about us.

513
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,080
Did you?

514
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,189
My conclusion...

515
00:27:56,719 --> 00:27:57,719
is that we should split up.

517
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:48,040
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

518
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,139
For a while, let's pretend
we don't have any problems.

519
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:53,949
Aren't I still Ms. Jin's husband?

520
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:55,510
Didn't you two decide to split up?

521
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,449
It's Jeong Woo Sang.

522
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:58,480
Who are you?

523
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,590
When our cars made contact,
you were sitting next to her.

524
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:03,550
I don't want to stay married
out of a sense of duty.

525
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,260
You're really out of your mind.

526
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,490
Don't you care about Ji Hyun?
