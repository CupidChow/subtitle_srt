00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,530
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,339
(Passenger Terminal 2)

3
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:50,099
- There it is.
- Wait up!

4
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,430
Hi, Mom.

5
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,470
So what?

6
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,500
Did you meet Nam Jin?

7
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,040
Not yet.

8
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:00,940
No.

9
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,309
He missed his flight.

10
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:04,379
He what?

11
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,050
How could a man who completed...

12
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,080
a hard master's degree miss a flight?

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,180
He missed his flight?

14
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:13,319
What should we do with all the food, then?

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,319
He'll be on the next flight soon.

16
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,560
He'll be here in a few hours.

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,860
Let's wait and eat together.

18
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,830
Okay.

19
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,330
Let's take that.

20
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,830
Was got Nam Jin so distracted?

21
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,069
How could he
miss his flight of all things?

22
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:31,200
He should be on high alert
if he cares for...

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,640
his family that's waiting...

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,539
Why are you eating so much?

25
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:36,709
You might eat it all
in the name of taste-testing it.

26
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:46,950
Hang on.

27
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:51,489
Mother.

28
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:53,429
Hey. Did he land?

29
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,129
What?

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,000
What's wrong with him?

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,670
I don't know.

32
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,300
You won't come over, then?

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,239
What am I to eat for dinner?

34
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,470
- What?
- You said...

35
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,840
you'd eat at your mom's,

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,709
so I assumed you'd bring me food.

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,209
My fridge is bare...

38
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:12,050
because I emptied it before my trip.

39
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,409
I don't know.

40
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,519
Get some groceries...

41
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,179
and cook me something.

42
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,189
Goodness.

43
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,119
We need to drop by your grandma's.

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,390
- It was somewhere here, wasn't it?
- It was.

45
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,230
Isn't it that over there?

46
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:37,540
It's just as it is.

47
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:42,580
Mom said she'd be late
and we have nothing to do.

48
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,779
Shall we stack it up fast?

49
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,080
Okay.

50
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,779
It's not something
that can be slapped together?

51
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,489
What if we do it in a day?

52
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:55,820
Does that make us experts?

53
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,390
Let's do it. Let's get to work.

54
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,600
It's so fresh.

55
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,200
It's nice and firm. Have some.

56
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,339
It's like it's still alive.

57
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:13,439
You have no idea how much
I missed Korean-style raw fish.

58
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,839
Right? Have some too, darling.

59
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,309
- It's so good.
- It's really fresh.

60
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,119
I thought I'd get to eat some raw fish...

61
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,350
or some nice grilled meat with my son.

62
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:28,790
I'm not a great cook,

63
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,519
but I make
great fried bean curd rice balls.

64
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:33,989
You do. It's not bad.

65
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,300
Wouldn't it have been nice
if you'd met a man...

66
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,630
more in your league
and stuck to what you were good at...

67
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,140
and opened a fried bean curd
rice ball diner?

68
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:43,999
What?

69
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:47,939
It's hard keeping up with a husband
that's out of your league.

70
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:49,880
If we hadn't lost everything,

71
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,110
my Nam Jin would never have married
the likes of you.

72
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,679
I know that.

73
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:58,119
He was so popular ever since he was a kid.

74
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:01,019
Look at that photo. He was a handsome boy.

75
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:03,260
But because he had to
earn his own tuition...

76
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,059
and support the family,
he practically gave up...

77
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:08,390
the idea of marrying a woman
from a good family.

78
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,230
The only reason he married you...

79
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,999
was because he felt at ease
and free around you.

80
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,070
Yes, Mother.

81
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,110
I saved my nation a few times
in my previous lives,

82
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,480
and I'm reaping the benefits
of that in this lifetime.

83
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,350
Do you want me to get you some soup?

84
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,150
No. I'm full.

85
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,020
Clean up after yourself...

86
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,689
and clean the house while you're at it.

87
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,759
You're good at that.

88
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,160
Sure.

89
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:46,230
Let's see. It is cone-shaped.

90
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:49,600
- Is it similar to the one before?
- Yes.

91
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,340
Great.

92
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,110
Will the loud-voiced lady be pleased?

93
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,350
If we see her again.

94
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,619
- let's brag about making it in a day.
- Okay.

95
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,850
Now for the sign.

96
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,790
There we go.

97
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:12,790
Making a wish to a pile of stones.

98
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,699
Why do people still do that
in the 21st century?

99
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:19,530
Shall we give it a go?

100
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,179
Mother. I told you to shut
the bathroom door when you poop.

101
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:08,150
- It doesn't smell.
- My goodness.

102
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,819
- My poor eyes saw it again.
- My poop doesn't smell.

103
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,920
I'll put your manicure stuff
in your dresser drawer.

104
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,360
Okay.

105
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,559
Hey.

106
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,770
It was right here?

107
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,009
You're so much like a child yourself.
How will you raise a kid?

108
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,949
Is this...

109
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,020
a marriage proposal?

110
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:46,520
What? Well...

111
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,220
I guess?

112
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:51,819
Is that it? Just a few words?

113
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,559
Of course not.

114
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:56,400
Do you want this?

115
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,110
I'd like you to marry me, Seon Ju.

116
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:13,780
So that you'll be happy
for the rest of your life,

117
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,650
I'll do my best.

118
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,650
I too...

119
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:22,460
will give you my all and love you more.

120
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:35,699
Let's take a photo of this moment.

121
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,739
Okay. Where should we stand?

122
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,340
- Oh, no.
- Hurry.

123
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,720
Is that how you dance?

124
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:54,920
Come on.

125
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:02,559
- It's so pretty here.
- It is.

126
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,929
Was the sea you saw
with your wife prettier...

127
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:07,970
or is this prettier?

128
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,139
You're the prettiest.

129
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,550
Although the end is in sight

130
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,980
- There's a busker.
- There is.

131
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,020
Let's check it out.

132
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,850
Lighting up the dark streets

133
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,220
Are the lights of our hope

134
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:39,400
Although there are heavy thoughts

135
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:42,170
That we can't easily let go

136
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,500
- Let's clap.
- My body is frozen

137
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,939
And I can't take any steps

138
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:51,640
- Shall we dance next to them?
- Your voice melts my soul

139
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,809
I'm always dreaming

140
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
Oh, my gosh.

141
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,510
- Watch out.
- Okay.

142
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,449
Be careful.

143
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,449
I said be careful.

144
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:11,260
- Pi Seon Ju!
- I'm over here!

145
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,130
- There's no street down there.
- There is!

146
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,300
My gosh. It's a dead end.

147
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:20,270
I'm over here.

148
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,069
Hey. Stay right where you are.

149
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:25,339
- No way.
- Darn you.

150
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,240
Will you stay still?

151
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,780
That road is steep.
You need to be careful!

152
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,349
Hey.

153
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,520
Wait for me.

154
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,020
Stop with the teasing and let me catch up.

155
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,630
Pi Seon Ju. Get back here.

156
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,699
You're so fast.

157
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,030
Goodness. Pi Seon Ju.

158
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,599
Stop doing this and come on out.

159
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,400
Seon Ju.

160
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,439
My gosh.

161
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:04,010
You're so cute.

162
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:27,000
What did you like about me?

163
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,040
You're straightforward and tough.

164
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,540
And?

165
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,339
You're frank and down to earth.

166
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:38,839
And you're unpredictable.

167
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,880
Hey, that's an endless list.

168
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:45,250
- And?
- Do you want to stay up all night?

169
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,359
Hey, look at that cloud.

170
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,160
It's something Sun Wu Kong would ride.

171
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,929
I'm envious of Sun Wu Kong.

172
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,229
He can take a cloud
and fly to wherever he wants.

173
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,069
Do you want to fly too?

174
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:04,839
How?

175
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,880
You can fly like this.

176
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,359
Honey, did you catch a flight?

177
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,400
When do you land?

178
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,170
She's walking toward me

179
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:45,880
She smiles so beautifully

180
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:52,620
She sweeps her hair back carefully

181
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:59,260
The pale-skinned woman comes toward me

182
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:06,829
A bell tolls above my head

183
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,839
The distance between us narrows

184
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,040
My breathing speeds up

185
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,819
Why did I recognize you only now?

186
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:26,750
Now when you think of the sea,
your only memory...

187
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,219
is of me.

188
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:29,689
Yes.

189
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,490
I waited for you for so long

190
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,359
My dear love

191
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:40,530
I didn't know it was you

192
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,500
Forgive me

193
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,370
Darn it.

194
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:49,679
Did he board the plane or not?

195
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,880
When will you all get here?

196
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,679
Will he come today or not?

197
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,689
I don't think we can make it today, Mom.
I'll see you tomorrow.

198
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:04,920
Food tastes best when it was just cooked.

199
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,030
It's just one day. It's fine.

200
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,189
It might taste deeper when it's reheated.

201
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:10,630
It could be even better.

202
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,660
Okay. Bye.

203
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,880
Here you go.

204
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,219
Let's shower together,

205
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:32,679
brush our teeth, then go to bed.

206
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,650
- Dad.
- Yes?

207
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:37,859
Mom will come home, won't she?

208
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,089
She will.

209
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:45,260
She'll be in the sky flying to be with us.

210
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:07,219
Hey.

211
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:08,890
You're back.

212
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:12,520
- Was it a long trip?
- Yes.

213
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,929
I'm glad you got a seat on another flight.

214
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,059
- Did you have dinner?
- Yes.

215
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:19,160
On the plane.

216
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,839
It must've been rough living abroad.

217
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,670
You look even more handsome.

218
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,679
Do I?

219
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,280
All that time abroad...

220
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,650
must've done you some good.

221
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:37,079
This shirt looks really nice.

222
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:39,179
I got it at a clean-out sale.

223
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:41,250
Don't you care...

224
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:43,920
what others may think?

225
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:46,429
(Overseas master's Jeon Nam Jin.
Welcome home, hubby.)

226
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,630
You mean this?

227
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,500
(Overseas master's Jeon Nam Jin.
Welcome home, hubby.)

228
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:52,929
Dad.

229
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:53,929
Ji Hyun.

230
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,130
Hello, darling.

231
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,740
Surprise.

232
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,109
It's an enthusiastic welcome.

233
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:02,309
Don't complain.

234
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:04,079
Ji Hyun made it.

235
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:06,449
You've grown.

236
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:08,209
When did you come home?

237
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:09,979
I just walked in.

238
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,020
Did you bring me a present?

239
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:15,449
Hang on. Wait.

240
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:19,219
Let's see.

241
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,890
Ji Hyun's present.

242
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:26,670
Ta-da. Here it is.

243
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,199
Where are the presents for Mom
and Grandma and my aunts?

244
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:31,439
Oh, dear.

245
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,510
I was so busy.

246
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,609
What's this?

247
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:43,620
What a cute shampoo bottle.

248
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,050
Is this for me too?

249
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,089
Yes, sure.

250
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:51,819
Ji Hyun. You can see Dad all you want now.

251
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:53,229
Go back to bed.

252
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:54,290
- Okay.
- Sleep well.

253
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,699
Why didn't you get anything for my family?

254
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,040
I wasn't abroad on a sightseeing trip.

255
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,699
I couldn't get anything.

256
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,709
You could've gotten
a box of chocolates on the plane.

257
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,649
My mom told me
to bring you over for dinner.

258
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,419
She complained that we'd waste...

259
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:24,119
all the food she'd cooked.

260
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,190
Did you call your mother?

261
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:32,260
Is this dirty laundry?

262
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,129
Yes.

263
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:39,069
When do you start work?

264
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:42,210
It's not final yet.
I still have the interview.

265
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,809
Which company is it?
Tell me that at least.

266
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,319
Honey.

267
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,159
That's...

268
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,859
Hey.

269
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:07,599
This is obviously silk.

270
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:12,040
It looks really expensive.

271
00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:19,980
I don't wear things like this.

272
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,609
What were you thinking?

273
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,550
Goodness.

274
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:26,849
Did all that studying...

275
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:28,550
make you a bit crazy?

276
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,559
I don't believe it.

277
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,730
It's almost embarrassing.

278
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,629
Does it suit me?

279
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:39,399
Does this mean that we will...

280
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,000
do it tonight?

281
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,339
Hey.

282
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,470
You reek of sweat.

283
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,079
It must be because I worked all night.

284
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,079
Do you want me to...

285
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,579
- shower?
- What for?

286
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:57,050
- Shall I?
- No.

287
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,990
I just got off a really long flight.

288
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,889
And that's what you say?

289
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:05,960
Yes, because it's what I want.

290
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:09,030
I'm tired.

291
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:16,099
Hi, Mom.

292
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,240
Yes. He just came in.

293
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,839
We can't come over right now.

294
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,240
He's tired and needs to sleep.

295
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,109
Food tastes best
before it's put in the fridge.

296
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:30,180
We can't come over to eat now.

297
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,849
We'll come by
as early as possible tomorrow.

298
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:36,460
No, I'll take the day off
and be there for lunch, okay?

299
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,190
Shall I put him on?

300
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,059
Honey.

301
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:41,290
Say hi to my mom.

302
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,500
Hello.

303
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:48,069
Yes, I just got back.

304
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,200
I see. Did you have a safe flight?

305
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:54,010
Good for you.

306
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,780
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

307
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,879
Bye.

308
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:02,450
I'm going to sleep. Get the light.

309
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,619
- Okay.
- Thanks.

310
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,200
They can't come, can they?

311
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,839
He's tired and wants to sleep.

312
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,599
What did I tell you?

313
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,139
They'll come by tomorrow...

314
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,270
and you insisted on cooking tonight.

315
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:32,210
You don't know when to stop, do you?

316
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,180
Why can't he come over
when he must've slept on the plane?

317
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:37,020
He'll be awake with jet lag too.

318
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,250
How can he sleep
when he just met his wife...

319
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,250
and kid after a few years?

320
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:42,119
It might not be
the kind of sleep you think.

321
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,589
The cheeky things.

322
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,930
What do you mean?

323
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,059
Is that it?

324
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,230
That's it.

325
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm envious.

326
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,040
You can go to bed too.

327
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:06,550
Okay.

328
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,250
Darn it.

329
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:21,530
What a waste of salt.

330
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,530
I wasted it for no good reason.

331
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:39,579
My gosh.

332
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,960
Did you get back from a jog?

333
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,359
Aren't you tired?

334
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:27,790
I guess I'm still jet-lagged.

335
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,930
I got up early.

336
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,930
Tae Ri, you're up too?

337
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,800
You didn't see Mom last night.

338
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,169
Come and say hi.

339
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:41,569
Honey. He's a big boy now,
don't you think?

340
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:45,109
He's learning to ride a bicycle
without his training wheels.

341
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,480
He almost nailed it.

342
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:49,109
He's good at sports just like me.

343
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:50,419
Quack, quack.

344
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,119
Can you not make that noise?

345
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,550
You're not a duck.

346
00:22:55,819 --> 00:22:56,819
Honey.

347
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,690
He's that pleased to see you again.

348
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,059
His kindergarten recital tomorrow...

349
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:03,300
I have work to do.

350
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,599
You start right away?
Without even a day off?

351
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,030
Staying at home drains me more than work.

352
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,530
I should get my bearings fast.

353
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,240
That's a shame.

354
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,200
Tae Ri practiced so much for his part.

355
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,010
His role is...

356
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,180
Do you enjoy raising a child?

357
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,750
It can be hard, but it's not boring.

358
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:25,379
What kind of man has so little ambition?

359
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:28,849
What more could I want
when I have everything?

360
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,889
I have Tae Ri, you, and a job.

361
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:33,990
I have it all.

362
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,530
Isn't there a girl group with that name?

363
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,000
Was it ITZY?

364
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,470
Can you not tell stupid jokes?

365
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,800
Playing with a kid
must've made you more immature.

366
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,809
Goodness.

367
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,879
Mom would have a lot to do
once she got back.

368
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:58,319
Dad didn't think of that.

369
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,720
Let's do the recital without her.

370
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,460
Shall we go and eat too?

371
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,730
Let's go.

372
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:09,089
Some and sit, Sang Ah.

373
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:11,300
There's yukgaejang, your favorite.

374
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:15,030
I missed your yukgaejang, ma'am.

375
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,899
Eat all you want.

376
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:19,470
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes. Take a seat.

377
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,349
The person you scouted.
When does he start?

378
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:29,280
We don't have an exact date.

379
00:24:29,649 --> 00:24:31,220
Shall I tell him to come over today?

380
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:34,290
You only saw him on video.
You should meet him in person.

381
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,849
Today?

382
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,319
If we scouted talent,

383
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:40,290
it's best to make them
a loyal worker as soon as possible.

384
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:43,159
I'll call him now
and schedule an appointment.

385
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,730
- Sang...
- Breakfast...

386
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,629
She's so impatient.

387
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,300
Why don't you meet him too?

388
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,940
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

389
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,290
Hello?

390
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,760
Come to the office right now.
Dad wants to meet you.

391
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,190
Right now?

392
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,500
Okay.

393
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,629
I'll be right there.

394
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,300
Give me just today off.

395
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,510
My husband got back
really last last night.

396
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,240
We have to visit my family and his today.

397
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:08,010
Did I ever
ask for a favor like this before?

398
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,720
I don't know if you did or not.

399
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,419
I'll call if I need something urgent.

400
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,559
Oh, right. The young radish kimchi.

401
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,300
Honey, you're up?

402
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,300
- Come and have breakfast.
- I have to go out.

403
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,030
Where? Without any breakfast?

404
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,129
Have some food.

405
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,099
- What about my mom?
- I can't see her today.

406
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:33,540
What about your mother?

407
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:36,169
- Where are you going?
- To the job interview.

408
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:38,139
I don't know how it'll go,
so cancel plans with both moms.

409
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,809
Who schedules an interview
the day after an international flight?

410
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,079
Isn't that company a bit too crappy?

411
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:45,980
Why do you say something like that?

412
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,349
Can't you not use such vulgar words?

413
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,050
What's wrong with that word?

414
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,589
I said it's crappy because it is.

415
00:26:51,589 --> 00:26:54,389
If I can't call something what it is,
what am I to call it?

416
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:55,859
You're helpless.

417
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,500
- Good luck.
- Bye.

418
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:04,540
Mom will have another fit.

419
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,510
And what am I to tell his mother?

420
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:12,309
(Jin Architecture)

421
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:35,430
How do you know the new employee?

422
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,829
We had mutual acquaintances.

423
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,899
Oh, there he is.

424
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,210
Meet Kim So Woo, Team Leader of Planning.

425
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,609
This is Jeon Nam Jin whom we just scouted.

426
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,750
Nice to meet you.

427
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:49,780
- Hello.
- Hello.

428
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,750
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Shall we?

429
00:27:57,819 --> 00:27:59,559
(Gwangseong)

430
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:03,800
- What's that?
- Dad's present.

431
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:07,030
I want to show Grandma and my aunties.

432
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,470
Don't do that.

433
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:12,300
Why not? I want to share.

434
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,609
Get in.

435
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,950
Okay. You can show them and brag.
That's fine.

436
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,559
Dad's back and with us
and that's what's important.

437
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,260
Who cares about anything else?

438
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,790
Brag about it all you want.

439
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:40,569
Yes. He's my darling husband.

440
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,680
The doors are closing.

441
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,859
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

442
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,940
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

443
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,040
- What's your wife like?
- She's ordinary.

444
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,349
The dock is fraught with farewells

445
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:34,119
Sorry. I think I should vanish quietly.

446
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:36,819
Who's at fault? Is it you or them?

447
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:38,190
A million dollars?

448
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,220
Hey!

449
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,159
Just you wait.

450
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,000
