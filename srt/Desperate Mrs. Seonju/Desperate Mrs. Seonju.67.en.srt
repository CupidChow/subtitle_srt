1
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,460
Mom, I'm so pleased.

2
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,930
Now that we broke them up,

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,530
I'll be able to
get back with Woo Sang, right?

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,700
That all depends on you.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,640
We practically saved his family.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,500
Shouldn't he be grateful to us?

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,240
That would be common sense, but...

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,540
- Dad.
- Hi.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,340
You're home.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,380
Yes.

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,480
Did you enjoy the mother-daughter date?

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,520
You got back earlier than I thought.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,450
The art gallery was so noisy.

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,890
The art gallery was noisy?

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,560
Oh, the concert, I mean.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,130
My head was ringing, so we left early.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,230
Did you?

18
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,970
Were you at Cloud On Hotel today?

19
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,470
Cloud On Hotel?

20
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,610
I think I saw you and the girls there.

21
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,940
You didn't.

22
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,880
Go and take a shower.

23
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,650
I'm pretty sure, though.

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,050
You saw him, didn't you?

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,620
Nam Jin sitting next to Seon Ju
pretending to be her husband.

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,000
Nam Jin and Seon Ju were married.

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,300
They could always get back together.

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,310
(Jeon Nam Jin)

29
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,020
You'd be offended
that I was at the wedding.

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,220
Let me explain.

31
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,980
Whatever.

32
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,820
Hey.

33
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,430
Are you making progress with Sang Ah?

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,430
I'm still waiting for her date
in family court.

35
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,400
What progress could I make until then?

36
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,800
When is her court date?

37
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,940
Goodness. You don't even know?

38
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,510
Here.

39
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,210
I have a bad feeling about it.

40
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,480
Your feeling is never right.

41
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,020
My feeling is pretty accurate.

42
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,520
What's that thing?

43
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,990
That IMF test says I'm an F.

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,030
The MBTI?

45
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,430
Yes, that.

46
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,130
F people follow their feelings.

47
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,600
What does that even mean?

48
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,770
It means you shouldn't ignore my hunch.

49
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,770
I have a bad feeling
that you got divorced...

50
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,370
but Sang Ah is dragging her feet.

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,740
In a case like yours
where two married people are cheating,

52
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,110
you should've gotten divorced
at the same time.

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,610
What if you end up all alone?

54
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,120
It's so annoying.

55
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,830
I can't believe what happened.

56
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,530
How could she lie about being pregnant?

57
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,670
You got us the pregnancy tests.

58
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,930
Even so,

59
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,600
she could've
rigged the results in the toilet.

60
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,470
What wouldn't a girl
with that kind of background do?

61
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,040
It won't be that.

62
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,050
The truth is, Mi Ju wasn't up for it,

63
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,350
but I suggested we lie at the wedding.

64
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,350
- And the car accident...
- Be quiet!

65
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,120
You're still defending her
like the fool you are.

66
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,360
How did you both
end up knowing women like that?

67
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,290
They're even worse
than Tae Sang's ex's family.

68
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,530
Why would you drag me into it?

69
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,400
Get over it.

70
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,430
How can I get over
something this shocking?

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,340
How could such a family...

72
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,470
The mom freaked out,

73
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,140
and the middle sister that yelled
right into the mic isn't normal either.

74
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,840
The eldest had the worst manners.

75
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,010
I can't stand what happened to us.

76
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,380
- Mom, I really...
- Get yourself under control!

77
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,090
Don't mention that family ever again.

78
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,060
They lied about every single thing.

79
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,290
Oh, my gosh.

80
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,730
Hey. Do as she says for a while.

81
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,900
Let's not talk about it.

84
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,890
Did you manage to sleep
after what you did?

85
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,260
Yes, thanks.

86
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,770
I had a good night's sleep
because you ruined the wedding for us.

87
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,100
I thought you'd be too embarrassed
to come in, but here you are.

88
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,470
I wouldn't dare expect to be paid
for not working.

89
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,240
You should thank us.

90
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,980
You tried to con
Jeong Woo Sang's family of all families.

91
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,780
The police would've called you again
if it had come out after the wedding.

92
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,350
You could've lost the money
for your long-term lease too.

93
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,990
You show so much concern for me.

94
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,660
You seem to care more about me
than your lover.

95
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,800
Do you have feelings for me?

96
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,830
You should learn to accept it when someone
points out what you did wrong.

97
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,240
I'm pretty good at discerning
when someone is...

98
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,810
pointing out my flaws
compared to picking a fight.

99
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,210
Okay. It must be great
to have been in a ruined marriage.

100
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,990
- We need to talk.
- What...

101
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120

106
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,400
What about the aftermath?

107
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,570
Why would you care about that?
That's for my family to handle.

108
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,240
Your family.

109
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,470

trying to handle something.

to argue with you.

and she managed to sleep well?

118
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,650
She's so shameless.

sit next to Seon Ju...

121
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,890
and not her older sister yesterday?

and you had to move over?

I have feelings for Ms. Pi?

127

Is that a good enough answer?

128

- What?
- Your motives...

129
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,740
are way too clear.

"My motives are too clear?"

You talk like I'm bad.

133
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,260
I see why you might feel that way,

Okay, fine.

Do you think Seon Ju is the type
to just be a poor victim?

138
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,240
She's not. Didn't you see her
shout into the mic?

139
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,010
She does have a temper,

140
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,410
- but she's not childish like you.
- What did you say?

Did you find that out that morning?

You didn't.

If you wanted to inform Ms. Oh
with pure intentions,

144

instead of barging in during the wedding,

145
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,630
you could've found many other ways.

146
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,360
You think you're smart and level-headed,

147
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,570
but you're immature.

148
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,000

Don't you love manners?

152
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,510
How about you show me some?

153
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,150
Or I might be terribly disappointed.

154

If you were to apologize to Ms. Pi,

155
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,720
I might be
a bit less disappointed with you.

156
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,920
I should apologize? What for?

157
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,820
Because you came to the wedding
with the mean intent...

158
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,060
to drop a bomb.

159
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,700

from happening.

I went to the wedding
not only because Mi Ju asked,

175
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,570
but because I'd heard So Woo
would be there and I wanted to check.

00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,230
What if she were to stall
and then get back with her husband?

182
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,500
You'll end up with nothing and nobody.

183
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,330
You shouldn't trust Sang Ah.

184
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,820
- What's up?
- Hey.

185
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,320
- I'm glad you're here.
- Why?

186
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,250
How's your mother?

187
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,960
Do you need to ask? She freaked out.

188
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,230
How is your sister?

189
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,890
Did she see a doctor?

190
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,430
It looks like she wasn't pregnant.

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,570
The pregnancy test was defective.

192
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,870
What? How could that...

193
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,200
Shouldn't we sue the manufacturer?

194
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,270
I don't know.

195
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,110
Didn't your mother buy them?

196
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,380
My gosh...

197
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,680
Hey.

198
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,850
Is it possible for someone not to know
that they are pregnant?

199
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,950
Didn't she have morning sickness too?

200
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,890
I think she'd eaten a lot and gotten sick.

201
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,760
She's a bit dull like that.

202
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,620
Goodness...

203
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,990
How was it like for you?

204
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,460
What did your mother say?

205
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,400
My mom...

206
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,500
She hated you the most.

207
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,570
She said you had the worst manners.

208
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,600
What?

209
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,340
I don't believe...

210
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,110
What else did she say?

211
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,880
We're banned
from talking about your family.

212
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,250
Then our families becoming in-laws.
Is that out of the question now?

213
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,750
Totally. That will never happen.

214
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,320
Your family is like an onion
with an endless number of layers.

215
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,860
There are so many secrets.

216
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,060
Why do you all
hate Ms. Shim's family so much?

217
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,530
And what's the brother-in-law
and lover thing about?

218
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,460
It was so complicated.

219
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,900
I'm reeling from shock.

220
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,500
Hey. Why did you even come here?

221
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,070
Don't come here
unless it's to buy a house.

222
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,310
No. Even if you want to buy a house,
go to another real estate agent.

223
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,140
Get out of here!

224
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,340
- Ms. Pi!
- My gosh.

225
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,840
You can't treat a client like that.

226
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,680
Wait. He's not a client. He's...

227
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,650
He is. He bought a house through us.

228
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,790
How can you tell him to go somewhere else?

229
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,150
Are you trying to ruin my business?

230
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,020
If so, you can quit.

231
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,660
Get packing!

232
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,190
- Hello?
- It's not like that, sir.

233
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,930
Sir!

234
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,570

(Jungang Real Estate Agency)

236
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,080
What do we do?

237
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,110
Your boss wouldn't even listen.

238
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,320
Shall we go out to eat?

239
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,090
Are you consoling me now?

240
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,420
I lost my job because of you.

241
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,330
You lost it because of your temper.

242
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,030
I don't have a temper,

243
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,070
but you got me so riled up
that I lost my job.

244
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,900
Find work someplace else.

245
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,200
There are many other estate agents.

246
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,240
You can go out and about
whenever you want...

247
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,570
and still get paid
at the end of the month.

248
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,310
What would you know about life?

249
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,240
Hey.

250
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,480
There's something
I didn't tell you so far.

251
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:28,250
You're actually really sleazy.

252
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,890
- What?
- You have a sleazy voice...

253
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,120
and a sleazy face,

254
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,990
and you're nothing like your brother.

255
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,660
I see why you never tell anyone
you're Jeong Woo Sang's brother.

256
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,040
Sleazy?

257
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,800
I'm sleazy?

258
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,420
I'll come to your place. Shall we meet?

259
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,420
(I'll come to your place. Shall we meet?)

260
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,010
Woo Sang, this is bad. Check this out.

00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,720
I know who that girl is.

265
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,820
The girl with disheveled hair
photographed in the hotel hallway.

266
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,320
I asked an AI program...

267
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,020
and she's the girl who portrayed
a mad girl in Jeong's drama.

268
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,060
Wasn't that Pi Mi Ju
whose career flopped due to a scandal?

269
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,100
She lied about being pregnant
and tried to pull off a con?

270
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,330
She hit rock bottom.

271
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,030
Hey.

272
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,370
- I have to go.
- Go where?

273
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,770
To Mi Ju?

274
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,910
Do you still want to go after all this?

275
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,080
Woo Sang, it looks bad.
There's a crowd of reporters outside.

276
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,750
We can't go anywhere.

277
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,280
The advertisers
called an emergency meeting.

The director is ill with shock
and wants to postpone the shoot for a day.

And you want to go out right now?

leaving the kids with me?

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,840
I don't know how
you managed to keep them quiet.

283
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,670
They wouldn't tell me a thing.

284
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,640
- Oh, gosh.
- Why can't you say?

285

What's going on, Man Eun?

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,480
Something happened, right?

287

What happened?

288
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,720
You don't need to know!

Fine, then.

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,200
Isn't it about your youngest?

294
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,140
- What?
- Look.

295
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,750
Let's all...

296
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,750
go to our respective homes...

297
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,020
and calm down.

298
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,890

What's going on?

312
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,930
- Auntie, it got crazy.
- What?

313
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,160
They figured out
that you were the mysterious woman.

314
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,430
- Oh, no.
- What'll happen to you?

315

- I don't know.
- Go to your rooms.

What on earth...

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,510
Now that you're back,

318
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,380
everyone will say
our Widow Plaza is complete.

319
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,620
Why did that woman show that to me
when she should've gotten lost?

360
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,430
to enter the contest.

361
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,790
How about we enter as well?

362
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,260
Even though we weren't invited to?

363
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,500
Let's create a layout
that introduces our company...

364
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,570
and send a proposal showing our interest.

365
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,740
Can we do that?

366
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,110
Don't you think a palace...

367
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,610
is a bit too big a project for us...

368
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,210
to manage? Can we handle it?

369
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,920
It's a shame if we can't
and a jackpot if we can.

370
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,490
We can try with zero pressure.

371
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,550
- With zero pressure?
- Yes.

372
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,790
A palace for a princess.

373
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,630
Did you have any such fantasies?

374
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,600
I think you'd be great at this.

375
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,100
Me?

(Director's Office, Jin Sang Ah)

377
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,150
You said you wanted to be born a princess.

378
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,180
You remember that comment?

379
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,220
I do.

380
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,080
Let's put your dream into it...

381
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,650
and apply to take part.

382
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,160
Hey. About what I wanted to
discuss with you earlier.

383
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,300
Let's do that tomorrow. I'm tired.

384
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,930
But earlier, you said later.

385
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,770
We have time. There's always tomorrow.

386
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,880
Shall we come up with...

387
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,580
a concept or theme
to send with the proposal?

388
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,980
Sounds good.

389
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,690
We'll have to work darn hard, then.

390
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,720
Are you up for it?

391
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,820
You know how to use words like that?

392
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,660
Does it not suit me?

393
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,860
It does suit you.

394
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,950
Goodness.

395
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,920
Even in this situation,

396
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,080
we get hungry at mealtimes...

397
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,550
and we need to eat.

398
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,790
- My gosh.
- Come here.

399
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,760
- Let's fight.
- Fight me.

400
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,230
I'm Admiral Yi Sun Sin.

401
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,160
I'm here for you!

402
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,400
- Let's fight.
- You can't beat me.

403
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,930
- Fight me.
- Come on.

404

Kids!

405
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,600
You're getting on my nerves.

406
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,840
Aren't you too old to play with them?

407
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,540
- Play outside.
- It's cold out.

408
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,840
Don't you have homework? You don't study?

409
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,010
I don't have to study hard.

410
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,510
Don't we go anywhere to have fun?

411
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,050
All my friends went somewhere
during the holidays.

412
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,750
We didn't go anywhere.

413
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,350
Yes. We're always stuck at home.

414
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,390
Hey. Life is way tough away from home.

415
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,220
Do you want to spend money and suffer...

416
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,690
or stay home in comfort?

417
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,430
I want to spend and suffer.

418
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,530
Darn you.

419
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,300
I have to cook. Get out.

420
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,470
Play outdoors.

421
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,840
Come and get your swords!

422
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,370
Let's fight!

423
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,780
I'll beat you all.

424

We can't travel.

425
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,210
Each week, we select the best letters...

426
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,220
and send you a box of cosmetics,

427
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,150
Korean beef, or a camping coupon.

428
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,590
Do send your stories.

429
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,290
See you after the commercial break.

430
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,630

I want to see your boss!

- Who's that?
- I have business with her, that's why.

- Okay.

Right. We don't have much time, then.

What is it?

The funny comments
on the articles about Mi Ju.

463
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,080
I sent them to Woo Sang and he blocked me.

464

The nasty foxes.

It was like your friend Choon Hyang
had two men on either side.

468
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,320
Her ex on one side
and your husband on the other.

469
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,130
Is she seducing So Woo to get back at you?

470
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,930
Would he fall for her if she did?

471
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,600
I never imagined
Woo Sang would fall for Mi Ju.

472

Do you think So Woo is like him?

his live-in helper and manager.

480
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,180
they're looking for a chance
to get together.

481
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,180
Get out.

Are they together right now
getting up to no good?

483
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,550
Stop yapping and get out.

484
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,190
What if Choon Hyang
actually gets pregnant?

485
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,160
Get lost.

486
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,360

Okay.

Projects like these used to feel absurd,

492
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,890
but with you, it feels like we can do it.

- Really?
- Yes.

but now I don't have to.

496

that I bought that house.

- Did you?
- Yes.
