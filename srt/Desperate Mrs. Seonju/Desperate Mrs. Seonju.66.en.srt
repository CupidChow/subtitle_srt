1
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,420
Cheers, everyone.

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,390
To the bride and groom!

3
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,630
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,630
Wait!

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,600
What are you doing here?

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,670
Why are you here?

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,770
Ms. Shim.

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,880
We have something to tell you, Ms. Oh.

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,550
Mr. Jeon. You came here?

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,950
Darling.

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,120
"Darling?"

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,430
What are you both doing here?

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,160
You said you'd be meeting a friend,

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,160
and you're sitting next to Seon Ju
as her husband?

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,430
You two are divorced!

16
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,200
I don't believe it myself, okay?

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,010
What happened was,

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,040
her sister Mi Ju begged me to come.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,380
I did not.

20
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,980
You said the secret
had to be kept within the family,

21
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,050
and that I'd just have to join
for a couple of hours.

22
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,650
I called to ask
if you'd be willing and you...

23
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,020
I mean...

24
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,220
You called me back a few days later
to say you'd help out.

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,260
Hey. Did you know he'd come?

26
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,300
You just had to join
for a couple of hours?

27
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,530
Does that excuse make any sense?

28
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,230
I don't believe this.

29
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,970
This is unbelievable.

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,370
What are you doing here, So Woo?

31
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,070
You're my husband.

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,110
Did you marry
Seon Ju's older sister behind my back?

33
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,410
Wait. I can explain that.

34
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,110
My goodness.

35
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,950
If I hadn't come here today,

36
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,220
I'd have had no clue...

37
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,590
what So Woo or Mr. Jeon...

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,560
were getting up to in secret.

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,460
What on earth...

40
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,800
What on earth is going on?

41
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,830
What is happening?

42
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,410
Ms. Oh. We can explain what happened.

43
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,710
I'll get them out of here first.

44
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,980
Ms. Oh.

45
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,550
You don't seem to know
what your future in-laws are like.

46
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,350
Chu Ah told us yesterday
and we realized we knew the family.

47
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,720
You do?

48
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,650
We thought long and hard
about what we should do...

49
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,120
and concluded that you should know.

50
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,360
It's not nice to get involved in
other people's personal affairs,

51
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,960
but this wedding should be called off.

52
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,100
It must never happen.

53
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,600
Her older sisters are happily married?

54
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,970
Both brothers-in-law are fakes.

55
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,370
Ask Mi Ju yourself.

56
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,580
Is that true? Talk to me!

57
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,440
One is my brother-in-law...

58
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,110
and one is my sister's lover.

59
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,750
Why would you mention her lover?

60
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,250
- What?
- What?

61
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,890
What does that mean?

62
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,020
You're her son-in-law...

63
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,920
and that woman is the person
you cheated on Seon Ju with, Nam Jin?

64
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,790
You didn't know?

65
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,760
Then you're the witch
who stole Seon Ju's husband?

66
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,500
That's not the issue of the day.

67
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,670
What? Then what's the issue?

68
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,940
What's more important than this?

69
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,410
Almost everyone knows about my affair.

70
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,740
You're slow to catch up.

71
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,080
Yes. I might be slow to catch up,

72
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,780
- but my fist moves faster than...
- Mother.

73
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,480
- Come here.
- Stop it, Ms. Han!

74
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,720
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

75
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,820
How could you?

76
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,950
Don't resort to violence!

77
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,420
You planned a con.

78
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,120
Why are you so upset about a silly affair?

79
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,890
I can complain all I want to you!

80
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,760
After all you did,
you made a fuss about a fender-bender.

81
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,960
You're the ones
who should ask for forgiveness.

82
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,630
We should've driven into you guys!

83
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,110
We should've broken your necks
so you couldn't hold your heads high!

84
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,510
Because of your daughter,

85
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,580
the whole world knows I cheated.

86
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,680
That's nothing compared to the con
your whole family planned.

87
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,950
You evil witch.

88
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,280
It's not half as bad as what you did!

89
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,920
Shall we compare who did worse, then?

90
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,790
Is this the family
behind your car accident?

91
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,830
Yes. The blackmailing family that caused
a scene at my mom's business.

92
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,700
- Oh, my gosh.
- Where are you going?

93
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,300
"Blackmailing?"

94
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,730
We didn't blackmail anyone. You did.

95
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,200
You said you'd ruin us
if we didn't settle out of court.

96
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,260
Then...

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,800
the father who's working abroad?

98
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,870
He left home and hasn't been in touch
for over 30 years.

99
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,370
Our hometown people think...

100
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,210
he's on the run
because he was involved in a crime.

101
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
My gosh.

102
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,140
Is that true?

103
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,780
That's nonsense.

104
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,380
Did you see proof, Ms. Shim?

105
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,950
Right. I think that's speculation.

106
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,480
Yes. If you bring up groundless gossip,

107
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,190
we'll sue you for defamation.

108
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,350
Do you have proof?

109
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,490
What if we do?

110
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,830
Hey, you. Where are your manners?
I'm older than you.

111
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,900
You're just about to make me
hit the ceiling!

112
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,160
Don't jump that high.

113
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,700
Did you hear that?

114
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,100
What is it?

115
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,010
Seon Ju. I'm bleeding.

116
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,310
What do you mean?

117
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,410
It's like a bomb exploded here.
We might as well all be bleeding.

118
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,210
My period.

119
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,780
What?

120
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,520
My period started.

121
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,780
I need you to get me some pads.

122
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,020
Why would you have your period
when you're pregnant?

123
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,120
My gosh.

124
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,290
What do you mean by that?

125
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,330
Did you lose the baby, then?

126
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,960
I don't know.

127
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,700
Wait right there.

128
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,940
What is it?

129
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,170
Do you have a sanitary pad?

130
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,340
No, why? Did you get your period?

131
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,010
No, forget it. I have to go.

132
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,020
Where are you, Mi Ju?

133
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,920
I'm in here.

134
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,230
Here.

135
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,330
Take this too.

136
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,430
Take the pregnancy test too, just in case.

137
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,180
Are you done? Did you take the test?

138
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,110
Seon Ju. The test was negative.

139
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,280
How can that happen?

140
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,290
What's going on?

141
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,820
I don't know.

142
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,560
Get changed
and I'll take you to see a doctor.

143
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,800
How could you do this?

144
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,170
Tell them yourself.

145
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,870
Say you caused the accident...

146
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,240
and put the blame on her!

147
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,810
I'm giving you a chance.

148
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,280
If you don't tell, I will.

149
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,980
That's not what's important.

150
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,280
You're being duped by the vixen.

151
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,850
Come with me.

152
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,600
Are you sure the pregnancy tests
you took before were positive?

153
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,870
I used two test kits
that Ms. Oh had bought me.

154
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,640
Let's go.

155
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,910
Don't mind them, Mom.

156
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,340
Why shouldn't I?

157
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,340
They should be taught a lesson.

158
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,110
I thought you cared a little
about our past friendship.

159
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,880
Do you call yourself human?

160
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,820
Do you think what we did was that bad?

161
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,390
I lent you money
which you never paid back,

162
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,290
and I never did anything
that would harm you.

163
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,790
Why are you doing this to me?

164
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,690
What do you mean I never paid you back?

165
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,000
You can't prove I even owed you anything.

166
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,800
Why did you settle with them?

167
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,870
You should've sent them to prison.

168
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,870
Exactly!

169
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,040
Your daughter should be in prison.

170
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,010
Why isn't cheating on a spouse
illegal anymore?

171
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,540
Considering the lengths
you went to to marry...

172
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,710
the daughter of a criminal
into a good family,

173
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,020
you have a lot to say
when anyone else would be ashamed.

174
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,490
What? Who...

175
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,450
Who's the daughter of a criminal?

176
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,790
Did you adopt someone else's kid, then?

177
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,960
Oh, right.
I heard something along those lines.

178
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,200
You took her in when she was three,

179
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,100
and both her parents had died.

180
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,940
Did you tell Ms. Oh
about her parents' medical history?

181
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,740
- What?
- Hey, you. Jin Sang Ah!

182
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,810
What's wrong? Deny it if it's not true.

183
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,810
Fine.

184
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,010
So what if I took her in?

185
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,080
She grew into
a much better person than your girls!

186
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,320
Didn't you lie about way too many things?

187
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,350
You keep quiet.

188
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,890
What's going on here?

189
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,650
Do you two know each other?

190
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,230
There's nothing you didn't lie about.

191
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,860
You lot are a darn mess.

192
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,230
Calm down, Mom.

193
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,530
- The car accident...
- Listen up!

194
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,000
This isn't the only fraud
this family planned.

195
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,770
The pregnancy was faked too.

196
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,910
She pretended to be pregnant.

197
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,410
- Is that true?
- She just took...

198
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,680
a pregnancy test, and it was negative.

199
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,210
Ask her yourself.

200
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,650
What?

201
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,320
You lied about the pregnancy too?

202
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,430
You people are really...

203
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,360
Watch your blood pressure.

204
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,400
You're not pregnant?

205
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,430
I guess something was wrong.

206
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,670
I don't want to see your face again.

207
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,240
I could sue you
and take you to criminal court,

208
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,110
but I won't only because
it's too humiliating!

209
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,450
- We're leaving!
- Okay.

210
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,650
Oh, my gosh.

211
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,720
- Oh, dear.
- Careful, Mom.

212
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,490
Wait!

213
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,130
I refuse to end it
with us looking like the bad guys.

214
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,170
I'm so very sorry for what
we put you through, Ms. Oh,

215
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,730
but to be honest, this play...

216
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,640
It came to be because we wanted to be
the happy family you asked for.

217
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,610
That's right.
You don't have a husband either.

218
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,540
Why are you so demanding?
Widows should understand each other.

219
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,610
What?

220
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,350
What on earth are you saying?

221
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,620
- Calm down, Mom.
- Oh, my gosh.

222
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,520
What scoop does Chu Ah think
she can give me today?

223
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,360
If it's another of her staged kisses,
it means she thinks I'm stupid.

224
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,030
Is this the right place?

225
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,100
Yes. We're a family of single women.

226
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,000
We're widowed and divorced. That's true.

227
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,840
But so what? Is that a crime?

228
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,240
Your only condition
was that our family be happy.

229
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,780
Who says a family of single women
isn't happy?

230
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,080
Our mom worked so hard to raise us all.

231
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,410
We really are happy.

232
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,890
We might have to apologize profusely
to Ms. Oh and her family,

233
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,120
but Jin Sang Ah. Whatever con we pull,

234
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,990
we don't deserve to be told off by you!

235
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,230
Your younger sister is either the daughter
of a criminal or a complete stranger.

236
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,130
Shouldn't you be condemned
for faking a pregnancy...

237
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,300
to try to marry her off to Jeong Woo Sang?

238
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,910
What fake pregnancy?
We won't know until we see a doctor.

239
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,180
Plus, Ms. Oh bought the pregnancy tests.

240
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,910
Does that justify
what you were trying to do?

241
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,580
Do you want to do this when you were
caught during a con red-handed?

242
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,120
Shut your mouth!

243
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,550
Shouldn't your family shut up...

244
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,460
since you were exposed
for trying to con another family?

245
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,230
- That's enough. Go home.
- Let go of me!

246
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,600
You need to calm down.
You're in no position to be so upset.

247
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Let go.

248
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,900
Stay out of it, Mr. Jeon.
Legally, we're complete strangers.

249
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,570
Legally speaking,
what are you to Kim So Woo, then?

250
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,170
I'm his tenant. We have a contract.

251
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,740
"A contract?"

252
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,240
You transformed your landlord
into your sister's husband...

253
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,850
and brought your ex as yours
when you said you didn't care for him?

254
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,220
I really don't care for him,
so take him and keep him!

255
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,320
We need to talk.

256
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,660
Let go of me.

257
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,370
Do you know Dong Soo's dad
came to me not long ago?

258
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,980
What?

259
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,650
For your sake, I didn't say
where you were and what you did.

260
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:52,020
What you did made me regret
having your back.

261
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,290
How dare you?

262
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,520
If he comes to me again,
I'll tell him the truth.

263
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,460
Keep that in mind.

264
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,730
What was all that about?

265
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,100
Who is Dong Soo's dad?

266
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,800
It's nothing.

267
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,140
Why care about what a fraud says?

268
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
She's just spinning more stories.

269
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,810
Let's go.

270
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,610
I don't get what your family is doing.

271
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,320
Why are you doing this to us?

272
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,020
Did I steal your husband?

273
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,790
You stole mine.

274
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,190
I should be the one to hate your guts.

275
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,490
But it looks like the complete opposite.

276
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,360
Whatever the case, you're the worst!

277
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,390
What?

278
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,000
What did you say?

279
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,170
What are you doing?

280
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,840
Darn you!

281
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,570
- Hey.
- Ms. Pi.

282
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,180
My gosh.

283
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,450
Did you throw cake on my sister?

284
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,020
Yes. You need to learn
how to speak to your elders.

285
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,920
- Darn you!
- Don't!

286
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,360
Oh, dear.

287
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,660
What have you done?

288
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,500
- Goodness.
- Oh, my gosh.

289
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,660
- Oh, no.
- Are you her bodyguard?

290
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,670
- It's fine.
- My word.

291
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,370
Let's all...

292
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,770
go to our respective homes...

293
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,110
and calm down.

294
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,410
My gosh.

295
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,650
Yes.

296
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,350
The party is over. Let's go.

297
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,580
My head aches.

298
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,450
What should we do now?

299
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
You fool.

300
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,780
Going down.

301
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,220
- Oh, no. Mom.
- Mi Ju.

302
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,420
- What's wrong?
- Mi Ju.

303
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,920
- Stand up.
- Let's sit down.

304
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,150
- Sit down.
- Take a break.

305
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,090
Sit over here.

306
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,130
You poor thing.

307
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,230
Mom.

308
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,930
Was I adopted?

309
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,740
Am I not your daughter?

310
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,240
If you weren't my daughter,

311
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,040
I'd have kicked you out long ago.

312
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,110
If I wasn't your daughter...

313
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,450
How did you manage to scold me...

314
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,590
like I was your own?

315
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,260
Are you saying you're upset or what?

316
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,220
You said I ate blood sausage
when I was seven months old.

317
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,730
You said I ate braised pig feet
when I was one.

318
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,630
You said I sucked and gnawed on
an apple core all day long.

319
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,870
What was all that about?

320
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,140
We said what we believed
you'd have been like...

321
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,040
because you loved food so much.

322
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,210
You'd be too upset to know...

323
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,880
we didn't know anything about you
as a baby.

324
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,080
So we made up a few anecdotes.

325
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,920
Did you both know too?

326
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,420
And you still played along
to help me get married?

327
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,520
I had no idea.

328
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,890
I'm sorry for turning you into frauds.

329
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,800
Don't cry about it.

330
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,170
It's okay.

331
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,240
Why did you go this far?

332
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,510
Why else? I wanted to prevent
a fraudulent marriage.

333
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,320
I couldn't turn a blind eye
when I knew they were duping...

334
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,050
a perfectly decent family.

335
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,390
Isn't that just wrong?

336
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,220
You really did this out of concern...

337
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,620
for Ms. Oh and her family?

338
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,360
You didn't.

339
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,660
You came here right on time
to ruin Seon Ju's sister's wedding!

340
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,730
So Woo.

341
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,030
You lectured me about right and wrong...

342
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,470
and what to do and not to do,

343
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,300
and you took part in the con?

344
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,670
What right do you have to complain?

345
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,210
You're right. It was a con.

346
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,350
But I think it was better than
the mess your family created.

347
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,010
- What?
- No.

348
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,120
Even if it wasn't any better,

349
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,220
I found myself...

350
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,720
wanting to take part.

351
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,120
Isn't that too shameless of an excuse?

352
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,720
Ms. Pi's mother said...

353
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,260
that to marry her daughter
to the man she loved,

354
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,430
she'd be as selfish as a mom could be...

355
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,630
and would be fully responsible.

356
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,570
So you took part...

357
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,200
because no one would hold you responsible?

358
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,510
That's so convenient.

359
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,340
No. I won't shun my responsibility.

360
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,140
I'll pay the price for what I did.

361
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,850
But I found myself comparing
the hearts of two mothers.

362
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,680
Not that again.

363
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,750
You're nothing but a scumbag
for what you did today.

364
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,220
You can call me whatever you want.

365
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,330
It doesn't hurt me.

366
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,070
Sang Ah.

367
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,870
Are you all right?

368
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,370
You must've gotten the wrong idea.

369
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,580
I can explain.

370
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,050
Mi Ju begged me to come
and fill in the empty seat.

371
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,410
She pleaded, so...

372
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,650
Even if she begged and pleaded,

373
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,090
you came here and sat next to Seon Ju.

374
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,120
Wasn't that voluntary?

375
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,600
Darn it.

376
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,930
What the heck?

377
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,570
We all tell lies...

378
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,040
every now and then.

379
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,010
Don't feel guilty
and don't be intimidated.

380
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,080
We didn't just tell a lie.

381
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,750
Some families get together to con others.

382
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,390
That doesn't make it okay.

383
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,890
You're right.

384
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,260
You came around
and can tell right from wrong.

385
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:11,160
You've learned something from today.
Now let's go home.

386
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,230
Let's go.

387
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,240
Mom...

388
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,780
Stop crying.

389
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,950
Here. Take some tissues.

390
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,830
Don't cry.

391
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,330
Oh, dear.

392
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,000
Hey.

393
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,770
Come this way, sir. Everyone is here.

394
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,470
Okay.

395
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,510
Today...

396
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,820
I lost my baby...

397
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,950
and my fiance...

398
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,090
and even my birth mom.

399
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,460
- Let's go.
- Darn it.

400
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,000
You still have us.

401
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,370
This won't bring your world down.

402
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,140
I got divorced.

403
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,210
Calling it off
on the wedding day is nothing.

404
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,540
My husband...

405
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,680
is dead.

406
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,980
You brats.

407
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,580
That's nothing compared to
being abandoned by your husband.

408
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,720
I spent years
wondering if he was dead or alive.

409
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,360
You don't know how that feels
unless you've lived through it.

410
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,990
Okay, Mom.

411
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,900
Mi Ju.

412
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,130
It was least painful for you,
so don't worry.

413
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,570
- She's right.
- Seon Ju.

414
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,470
You can start over.

415
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,540
We can handle...

416
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,010
the fraud of a sister
who got dumped at the altar.

417
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,250
The abandoned wife, widow, and divorcee...

418
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,980
will stick together.

419
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,850
Let's go on...

420
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,190
living our silly lives as best we can.

421
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,960
Okay.

422
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,160
Yes.

423
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,070
Life is a comedy from a distance,

424
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,340
but a tragedy from up close.

425
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,510
But people will say
our lives are a tragedy...

426
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,850
whether you're at a distance or close up.

427
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,350
But that's what they think.

428
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,320
Our lives are more of a comedy
than you think.

429
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,530
Goodness.

430
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,330
I feel great.

431
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,170
Good job, girls.

432
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:05,700
Mi Ju and Woo Sang
broke up for good, right?

433
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,740
You bet.

434
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,440
Everything was a lie, even the pregnancy.

435
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,040
Woo Sang's family
could sue them if they wanted to.

436
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,780
You saw him, didn't you?

437
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,080
Nam Jin sitting next to Seon Ju
pretending to be her husband.

438
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,620
Mr. Jeon. You came here?

439
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,090
Darling.

440
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,290
What are you both doing here?

441
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,660
- Darn you!
- Don't!

442
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,170
So Woo is just as bad.

443
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,510
Didn't you see him
sitting next to Seon Ju's sister?

444
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,710
So Woo is so kind-hearted
that he is unable to say no to them.

445
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,480
Nam Jin and Seon Ju were married.

446
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,780
They could always get back together.

447
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,620
They're both weird, to be honest.

448
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,650
Why did Nam Jin
go to his ex's sister's wedding...

449
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,390
just because she asked?

450
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,530
And So Woo.

451
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,730
He tagged along just because they asked?

452
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,160
Everyone is out of their minds.

453
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,170
All the women in that family
must be possessed by vixens.

454
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,470
They cause trouble for everyone.

455
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,940
My gosh.

456
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,180
What a nice house.

457
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,760
Did Auntie's wedding go well?

458
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,360
No. Your auntie didn't get married.

459
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,170
- What?
- Why not?

460
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:43,700
I can't tell. Don't ask.

461
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,570
Hey, Mi Ju.

462
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,710
Did you see a doctor?

463
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,210
What did they say?

464
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,310
She wasn't pregnant.

465
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,480
The pregnancy test could've been faulty.

466
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,780
What?

467
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,780
You said you took two.

468
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,720
They came from the same box.

469
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,790
I guess the whole batch was faulty.

470
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,920
What about the nausea?

471
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,620
You had morning sickness.

472
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,790
Irregular premenstrual syndrome...

473
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,800
combined with excessive stress...

474
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,470
can cause the gastrointestinal tract
to become sensitive.

475
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,970
- Oh, I don't know.
- My gosh.

476
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,370
Then we did lie about the pregnancy.

477
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,880
We can't deny that.

478
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,240
It's not fair.

479
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,150
I didn't lie about that on purpose.

480
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,790
Mom. Ji Hyun's grandma was here today.

481
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,290
She had brought a friend.

482
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,490
What?

483
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,730
- What for?
- I don't know.

484
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,500
What did her friend look like?

485
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,530
Her hair looked like a lion's mane.

486
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,670
Darn it.

487
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,870
She brought Ms. Park
who owns a beer joint.

488
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,770
She was here once before on her own.

489
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,170
Tae Ri saw her.

490
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,540
What does that mother-and-son duo
have against us?

491
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,580
Sorry.

492
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,850
Isn't that more like stalking?

493
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,120
Are their spirits
chained here or something?

494
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,690
Why do they keep coming?

495
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,760
Keep the doors locked
when you're alone at home, okay?

496
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,260
- Okay.
- Okay.

497
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,200
Mom.

498
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,800
What were my birth parents like?

499
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,240
They were good people.

500
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,580
They were worried about leaving you alone,

501
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,080
so they gave me
all the things you used as a baby...

502
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,910
and pleaded with me
with all their heart...

503
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,820
that I raise you well.

504
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,190
Is that why you had my swaddling clothes?

505
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,990
Ever since I brought you home in that,

506
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,130
you were my daughter.

507
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,190
You never weren't mine.

508
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,970
So there's nothing to be upset about.

509
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,930
Don't feel belittled.

510
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,110
Good girl.

511
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,010
Oh, dear.

512
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,640
My sweet youngest baby.

513
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,420
I'm home.

514
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,990
Hey. You don't know, do you?

515
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,790
Jeong Woo Sang is marrying
your jobless youngest sister-in-law.

516
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,260
Why aren't you surprised? Did you know?

517
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,630
How did you know?

518
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,500
- How do you know that?
- What?

519
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,540
Oh, well...

520
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,970
I should check if the washing is done.

521
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,440
- Mom.
- Yes, it's me.

522
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,580
Let's go to sleep.

523
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,280
It was such a long day, wasn't it?

524
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,980
Yes.

525
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,370
Yes. We're a family of single women.

526
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:40,040
We're widowed and divorced.

527
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,170
That's true.

528
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,240
But so what? Is that a crime?

529
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,710
Your only condition
was that our family be happy.

530
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,310
Who says a family of single women
isn't happy?

531
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,550
Our mom worked so hard to raise us all.

532
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,020
We really are happy.

533
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,490
Life is a comedy from a distance,

534
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,960
but a tragedy from up close.

535
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:09,600
But some families are a comedy
both from a distance...

536
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,170
and from up close.

537
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,440
They were abandoned and had things taken,

538
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,740
and they lost out on love
after pulling a con.

539
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,480
But that doesn't mean they're unhappy.

540
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,240
If you look more closely,

541
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,350
you can see they're doing...

542
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,420
pretty well for themselves.

544
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,610
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

545
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,980
Woo Sang, this is bad.

546
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,580
- I have to go.
- Go where?

547
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,840
To Mi Ju?

548
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,380
Do you still want to go after all this?

549
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,680
Did you want to sit next to Seon Ju?

550
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,950
"The more you ask, the more I wonder."

551
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,590
Is that a good enough answer?

552
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,290
I think it was a stroke of luck
that I bought that house.

553
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,060
Is she seducing So Woo to get back at you?

554
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,890
(Team Leader's Office, Planning Team 1)
