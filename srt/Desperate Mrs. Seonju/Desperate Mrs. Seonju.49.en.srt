1
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,609
What? You're not up for it?

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,080
I'm not.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,109
I'm not saying we'll get them hurt.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,209
Let's keep them until the deadline...

5
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:20,420
so So Woo and Seon Ju get distracted.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,779
Do we have to go that far?

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,220
They're laughing and cheering
that they're making progress.

8
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:29,260
They'd lose their minds
if something were to happen to the kids.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,389
Let's upset them just for a few hours.

10
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:34,200
That will hurt them enough.
They won't be able to submit the proposal.

11
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,499
Still, it's not right.

12
00:00:38,529 --> 00:00:39,900
Don't you miss Ji Hyun?

13
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:44,039
Let's take her out to eat
since the occasion suits us.

14
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:46,139
Darn it.

15
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:48,039
I'd love to do the same with Tae Ri,

16
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,950
but I don't know where he is.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,420
The deadline is around the corner.

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,920
We'll win, but who knows?

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,789
They could win too.

20
00:00:57,819 --> 00:00:59,090
Can you handle that?

21
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,529
(Episode 49)

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,870
Mr. Kim. Here's Park Hotel's revised plan.

23
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:17,770
Hey. Is this your Hansung design?

24
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,209
When did you come in?

25
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:22,280
Outsiders aren't allowed for a while.

26
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,410
What? Does that include me?

27
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,780
- Yes.
- I'm not your competitor.

28
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:29,080
There are no exceptions.

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,619
Didn't you see the note on the door?

30
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:32,759
I wouldn't tell anyone what I saw.

31
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,589
It's not that we don't trust you.

32
00:01:34,589 --> 00:01:36,490
We just want to be careful.

33
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,660
You can't waltz in
until we submit our proposal.

34
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,660
Okay. Good luck.

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,770
It's a nice design.

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,039
It's top secret.

37
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:54,910
He thinks it's nice.

38
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,449
He would and should.

39
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,419
But we don't want it to be just nice.

40
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:02,520
It must be much better
than the other team's.

41
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,619
Right.

42
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:07,319
- Here.
- Thanks.

43
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,059
This part here. It should open up.

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,830
What about this?

45
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:17,229
- This is right.
- Let's at least say hi.

46
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,949
I want to compete with skill alone.

47
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,880
So do I. I like to play fair
more than anything.

48
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,720
But when winning is important,
we must take the risk.

49
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:40,789
I told you this competition was important.

50
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,660
We must win, whatever it takes.

51
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,060
If we lose to them, I'll be...

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,970
I'm my dad's daughter.

53
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,630
I'll be fine.

54
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,870
But not you.

55
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,609
You saw the view from the rooftop.

56
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,380
Don't you want Jin Architecture?

57
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:03,979
I want to run this company with you
and expand it as well.

58
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,579
We're not putting anyone in danger.

59
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,019
Do Seon Ju and Ji Hyun have
so much power over you...

60
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,519
that you can't do that?

61
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,519
Will you be that kind of man forever?

62
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,630
Don't slack off only to regret it later.

63
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,060
Did you two fight?

64
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,160
- No.
- No.

65
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,900
What's with the awkwardness, then?

66
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,799
You fought.

67
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,410
Don't fight. Try to get along.

68
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:05,269
- Okay?
- Okay.

69
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,780
Hey. Once you're done eating,

70
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,819
can you bring in the cauldron lid?

71
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,590
What? Oh, sure.

72
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,289
It's too cold to barbecue outdoors.

73
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,530
Wipe it clean and bring it inside.

74
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,200
Does she have to do that tonight?

75
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,330
It's fine. I'll do it before bed.

76
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,780
Hey.

77
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,150
Why are you drinking
so much ice-cold water before bed?

78
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,249
I feel like there's a fire
burning my insides.

79
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,660
It's horrible.

80
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,020
Woo Sang doesn't know you feel like that.

81
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,429
What should I do, then?

82
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,260
Talk to him and make him understand.

83
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,729
How?

84
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:05,470
He doesn't want anything to do with me.
There's nothing to talk about.

85
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,270
Then why are you so frustrated?

86
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,809
Because I don't know what went on.

87
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,640
I'm dead curious.

88
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:13,710
What about?

89
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,939
You don't need to know.

90
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,280
My goodness.

91
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,479
What's up with everyone?

92
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,160
(Woo Sang)

93
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,739
Woo Sang.

94
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:44,570
Yes, what?

95
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,770
Last night.

96
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:49,879
Did you sleep?

97
00:05:50,549 --> 00:05:52,979
I mean, how far did you go?

98
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,950
Will you please say no?

99
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,689
You didn't do it, did you?

100
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:02,890
Don't be silly.

101
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:05,160
Where do you think I went?

102
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:06,229
Right?

103
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,760
Your standards wouldn't be that low.

104
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:10,970
You wouldn't give in...

105
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,939
even if there were
a hundred girls like Mi Ju, right?

106
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,799
I'm busy. I have to go.

107
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,609
Darn it.

108
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,950
What a relief.

109
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,520
He wouldn't do it.

110
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:36,760
But still, I can't let them be.

111
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,200
Yes. That's it.

112
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:49,439
Hello? Ms. Scriptwriter?

113
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,510
Hey.

114
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:01,720
Do you need some help?

115
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,989
What?

116
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:05,189
Well... No.

117
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:07,760
I'm almost done wiping it.

118
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:11,729
Will you help me move it later?

119
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,530
It's much heavier than it looks.

120
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:18,400
You could never carry that on your own.

121
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,499
What would you have done without me?

122
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,710
You can go away for now.
Come back when I need to move it.

123
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,239
You're in the way.

124
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,789
I don't think...

125
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,320
I'm okay with what happened.

126
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,660
What?

127
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:44,330
Not okay with what?

128
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,660
Us, at the hotel...

129
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,999
No, wait.

130
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,429
That was just a mistake.

131
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,239
It's not that.

132
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,869
I guess I just can't be that indifferent.

133
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:00,179
Are you all right with it?

134
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:04,780
I've been thinking.

135
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,679
Since stuff happened,

136
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:09,320
Shall we take our time...

137
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:13,020
and get to know each other?

138
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:14,320
What?

139
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:18,689
Do you mean that?

140
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,030
Yes.

141
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:26,369
I'd like that.

142
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:35,979
What should we get to know first?

143
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:38,080
Well...

144
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,149
Shall we come up with a list?

145
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:45,489
What do you have on your face?

146
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,229
Let's not tell anyone about it for now.

147
00:08:58,529 --> 00:08:59,899
It could become tiresome.

148
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,409
Shall we eat something?

149
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:07,239
How about chicken skewers?

150
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:09,239
Chicken skewers?

151
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,149
The writer said
the viewers' reactions were important.

152
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,690
What else do you like to eat?

153
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,830
Well...

154
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,629
I like everything.

155
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:32,499
Jajangmyeon or jjamppong. One, two, three.

156
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:33,570
- Jjamppong.
- Jajangmyeon.

157
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:39,909
Mountains or the sea. One, two, three.

158
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:40,940
- Mountains.
- The sea.

159
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,909
How come there's nothing we both like?

160
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:47,149
Still, we're putting in a lot of effort
to get to know each other.

161
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:51,550
Here.

162
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,790
You take a bite first.

163
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:29,859
My gosh.

164
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:32,290
Oh, right.

165
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,399
I saw Seon Ju's mom and Ji Hyun today.

166
00:10:36,229 --> 00:10:38,170
Did you? Where?

167
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,570
We met on my way to the activity center.

168
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,540
Why do you still go to the one there?

169
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,670
There must be one nearby.

170
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
The instructor there has more energy.

171
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,440
Her classes are much more fun.

172
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,080
Is Ji Hyun doing well?

173
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:56,149
Yes. She's smart and bright
whenever I see her.

174
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,259
The joy of raising her
will keep Seon Ju going.

175
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:01,960
So...

176
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:03,859
About Ji Hyun.

177
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,029
What is it?

178
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:09,399
Never mind.

179
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,330
Forget it.

180
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:14,300
My goodness.

181
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:19,029
We're almost done.

182
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,999
I think we can add the finishing touches.

183
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,609
You really are...

184
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,080
a stubborn hard worker.

185
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:31,409
You created a 3D model
of every one of Hansung's light fixtures.

186
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:36,690
I loved being able to
get away from doing tedious labor...

187
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,619
and doing actual design work.

188
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,989
It's like...

189
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:43,090
bouncing about in a boxing ring
after a warm-up.

190
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,489
I don't feel tired at all.

191
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
I think I could stay up...

192
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,600
and work for another full week.

193
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,369
Shall we do that, then?

194
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,489
The deadline is today, isn't it?

195
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,389
Be sure to submit the proposal on time.

196
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,290
You must always meet a deadline.

197
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,100
Right.

198
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,159
You sounded confident.
I look forward to the result.

199
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,540
She came around and worked hard,
so she'll get the result we all want.

200
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,800
What happens to the losers?
Do they get kicked out?

201
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,470
They'd be too ashamed to stay
even if we didn't fire them.

202
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:33,639
What if you lose?

203
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,340
Will you quit out of embarrassment?

204
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:38,609
Chu Ah. Why would you even say that?

205
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,119
I was just curious.

206
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,779
I'm off to work.

207
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:45,389
Right.

208
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:48,220
Mom, Dad. Go online
and comment on my drama.

209
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,090
Write something about
how good Woo Sang and I look together.

210
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:53,499
Do that, okay?

211
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:54,960
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

212
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:13,519
Darn you.

213
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,100
Woo Sang, you need to see this.

214
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,869
- What is it?
- The red part here...

215
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:11,210
is the newly revised script,
and you and Chu Ah...

216
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,080
- Shoot.
- What does it say?

217
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:20,680
Woo Sang.

218
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:23,119
Woo Sang. Did you see it?

219
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:25,420
Did you see our kiss scene?

220
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,389
Do you know we have to kiss?

221
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:31,359
What kind of stupid storyline is that?

222
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:33,560
How is it stupid?
Our characters met a few times on screen.

223
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,629
They could fall in love.

224
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:36,060
I need to hurry.

225
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:38,570
What could he have done
with someone like you?

226
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,570
What?

227
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,200
I get to kiss Woo Sang on screen.

228
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,170
So what?

229
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,170
I feel sorry for you.
You must've gotten hopeful that night.

230
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:49,810
You moved in and became his manager
to try to seduce him,

231
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,249
but you can't force love, you know.

232
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:55,820
Try all you want. You can never have him.

233
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:59,019
I asked Woo Sang
what you got up to that night.

234
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:01,359
He got all frustrated and angry.

235
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,529
He couldn't believe I'd even asked.

236
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,759
However hard I look,

237
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,729
you just don't look appealing.

238
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,970
- Hello.
- Hi.

239
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:20,879
Director.
Why the heck is there a kiss scene?

240
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,080
The writer lost her mind.

241
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,109
The female lead loves you,
and so does the female villain.

242
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,550
And now she wants the villain's sister
to love you too?

243
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:29,420
That's why it makes no sense.

244
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,720
Darn it. Should I film this scene or not?

245
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,989
I don't feel like it,

246
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:37,190
but the writer must've written it in
because she has a plan.

247
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,290
Well, she might not have a plan...

248
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:41,729
Whatever!

249
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:55,540
Lots of comments say we're a nicer couple
than you and the female lead...

250
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,180
and that we should be together.

251
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,210
Let me see them.

252
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:03,489
"The male lead and the villain's sister
have great chemistry."

253
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:05,790
"Yes, right.
I think they look good together."

254
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,119
"They look similar."

255
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,420
"They both have cat-like faces."

256
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,790
"Director, can you let them kiss?"

257
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,359
Hey, do you see this comment?

258
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,070
"Jin Chu Ah hired people
to mess up the forum."

259
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,830
"This is nonsense.
I say Jin Chu Ah posted all that."

260
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:21,699
"Are you her family?"

261
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,399
"Even the IDs are so transparent."

262
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,740
"It takes brains
to get away with faking comments."

263
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,709
Didn't you post all that?

264
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:30,310
Everyone thinks you did.

265
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,609
I did not.

266
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,750
Shouldn't we meet up to practice the kiss?

267
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:37,320
Forget it.

268
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,800
You work here
and your sister works at Jin Architecture.

269
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,629
What? My sister works there?

270
00:17:52,629 --> 00:17:54,699
Do you know who else works there?

271
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,169
Why are you all obsessive stalkers?

272
00:17:58,969 --> 00:18:00,879
You want what you can never have.

273
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,480
It's a disgrace.

274
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:05,179
Aren't you the one
who wants what you can't have?

275
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,980
We'll take care of our business.

276
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:10,790
You take care of yours.

277
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,820
My business?

278
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,219
You mean the kiss scene?
Yes, I should ace that.

279
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:19,629
I should go and prepare
to kiss Woo Sang on camera.

280
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,129
My gosh.

281
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,530
You little...

282
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,899
Here's the contract.

283
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,139
You got a great deal.

284
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Good job.

285
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:36,909
Hello?

286
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:43,219
You got a great deal on the house.

287
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:46,219
The owner sold it below market price
because they were in a rush.

288
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,330
Why are you so downcast?

289
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,100
You're a homeowner now. You can smile.

290
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,260
I made the investment out of fury.

291
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,699
If this doesn't work out,
I'll jump off something.

292
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:02,869
Why would you say that?

293
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,439
What's going on?

294
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,189
What's the matter?

295
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,689
Is your kid being a pain?

296
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:22,219
I wish I had a kid to be a pain.

297
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,490
You're single?

298
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,260
I'm divorced.

299
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:28,260
You're married, aren't you?

300
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm kind of single.

301
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,740
I don't have a husband, just a son.

302
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,369
I see.

303
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:40,070
I thought you'd live a graceful life...

304
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:42,080
like a princess.

305
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,980
You used to be so pretty.

306
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,750
Not that again.

307
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,820
You said I'd changed for the worse.

308
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,719
Yes. Time hit me head-on,
and my face took the worst hit.

309
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:54,859
It really did.

310
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,730
You were so famous
back when we were in school.

311
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,959
Some guys went to our academy
just to see you.

312
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:04,800
Such were the days.

313
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,240
But so what?

314
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,840
Now I'm a manager running errands
because I don't have a realtor license,

315
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,639
and I live with my mom
because I don't have a home of my own.

316
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:15,609
It's not even my mom's home now.

317
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:17,480
We're tenants.

318
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,810
Are you?

319
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:22,820
Right before the government announced
they'd redevelop this district,

320
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,350
I talked Mom into selling our house.

321
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,020
Everyone's excited about the prospects,

322
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,760
and I must work at the office...

323
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:34,060
and watch others make money
on top of more money.

324
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,060
It really hurts.

325
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,330
Hey.

326
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,740
The house you made me buy.
Is that a solid deal?

327
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:44,669
Hey. I'm sharing a story you can't hear...

328
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:48,109
without shedding a tear or two,
and that's your response?

329
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:50,310
Is that even right?

330
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:52,050
And you direct TV shows?

331
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:54,280
What does it have to do with that?

332
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,949
You don't see or care
how one would feel...

333
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:59,050
in a certain situation.

334
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,520
How could you
ever entertain or move someone?

335
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:04,730
What?

336
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,600
I'm leaving.

337
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:09,929
This is on me.

338
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,500
What's wrong?

339
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:13,699
I'll pay.

340
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:17,969
Hey.

341
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:21,709
What's up with him?

342
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,179
Is it something I said?

343
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,750
This should do it, right?

344
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,790
Yes.

345
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,490
- Let's wrap it up.
- Okay.

346
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,689
Rather than just sending a file,
we should give them the prints too.

347
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:41,929
Yes. That's how So Woo always does it.

348
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:45,270
I'll print these, then.

349
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,040
Mr. Kim's design was really different.

350
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,580
You saw it?

351
00:21:54,639 --> 00:21:56,510
I got a peek
when I went in to give him something.

352
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,010
It was much better than I'd expected.

353
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:00,879
I think that was why...

354
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:03,919
they made a huge fuss about me
coming in without permission.

355
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:05,250
See?

356
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,689
You know I bet ten dollars on them, right?

357
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:08,859
I bet 50 dollars.

358
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:10,629
Did you? I don't remember.

359
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:12,790
- What?
- Come on.

360
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,570
This is the section.

361
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,050
Mr. Kim's design was really different.

362
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,649
It was much better than I'd expected.

363
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:39,919
They're laughing and cheering
that they're making progress.

364
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,760
They'd lose their minds
if something were to happen to the kids.

365
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,990
Let's upset them just for a few hours.

366
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,699
That will hurt them enough.
They won't be able to submit the proposal.

367
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,379
Mom.

368
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,219
I need to ask you a favor.

369
00:23:12,949 --> 00:23:15,859
He must miss his kid a lot.

370
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,389
He turned gloomy
whenever I mentioned Ji Hyun,

371
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:20,800
and now he asked me for this.

372
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,800
I don't want to meet anyone
from Seon Ju's family.

373
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:26,230
How can I get her in secret?

374
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,399
Oh, dear.

375
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:31,840
- I'm coming for you.
- Oh, no.

376
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,939
We're safe.

377
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,580
We're safe.

378
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,750
- I'll count to five again.
- Okay.

379
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,119
One, two...

380
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,619
Hang on.

381
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,449
I need to go to the toilet.

382
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:48,119
You can't go
when it's your turn to chase us.

383
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,219
I'll be back soon.

384
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,959
You two wait right here, okay?

385
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,260
Let's go on the slide.

386
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,899
Okay.

387
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Let's go.

388
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:06,439
Hey.

389
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,609
Hello, Ji Hyun.

390
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,050
Grandma.

391
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,409
My sweet pumpkin.

392
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,320
- You're playing on the slide?
- Yes.

393
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,179
Let's go and eat something nice.

394
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,649
"Something nice?"

395
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,520
I told your dad
that I'd met you yesterday,

396
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,119
and he said he missed you.

397
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,830
He said he'd buy us dinner
if you'd come with me.

398
00:24:24,889 --> 00:24:27,600
Did Dad really say he missed me?

399
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,929
Yes. That was why he asked me to get you.

400
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,240
Let's get him to buy us something tasty.

401
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:37,469
I'll go and tell Dong Won first.

402
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:40,469
Your dad said
he'd tell your mom. Let's go.

403
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,310
What about Tae Ri?

404
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,709
What's that?

405
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,980
Him?

406
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,449
Tell him to go home.

407
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,919
He lives with us.

408
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,020
Does he?

409
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,689
You go on home, then.

410
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,230
Let's go.

411
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,969
I'll go and get the printouts.

412
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,379
- Okay. Good job.
- You too.

413
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:16,409
Thanks.

414
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:19,949
Why is Mom calling me?

415
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:22,280
Hi, Mom.

416
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,780
What?

417
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,389
The kids are missing? How come?

418
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,790
Dong Won left them in the playground
to come home to use the toilet,

419
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,330
and they disappeared.

420
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,730
He looked everywhere
but couldn't find them.

421
00:25:45,709 --> 00:25:47,070
(Team members only for a while!)

422
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
What should we do?

423
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,310
- Let's hurry.
- Okay.

424
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,550
They left.

425
00:25:57,719 --> 00:25:59,320
Let's hand in our work.

426
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:00,959
Okay.

427
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:12,129
Did you call the police?

428
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:14,169
Yes. They said they'd patrol the area.

429
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Good.

430
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:18,669
(Jin Architecture)

431
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,350
Ji Hyun! Tae Ri!

432
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,850
Ji Hyun!

433
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,919
Ji Hyun! Tae Ri!

434
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,179
Tae Ri!

435
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,590
Ji Hyun!

436

437

439

Ji Hyun!

440

Jeon Ji Hyun! Kim Tae Ri!

441
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:45,469

446

Tae Ri!

447
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,080
Hey.

448
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:00,750
Did you see them?

449
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,750
No.

450
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:06,290
How about you ask Nam Jin?

451
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,889
- I'll call Sang Ah.
- Okay.

452
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:17,770
(Hansung Company)

453
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:24,169
(Ji Hyun's mom)

454
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,580
(Kim So Woo)

455
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,350
The person is unable to answer...

456
00:27:34,949 --> 00:27:36,619
- No answer, right?
- Right.

457
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,750
Let's split up and search the alleys.

458
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,459
- Okay. I'll go this way.
- Okay.

459
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:43,689
Let's go.

460
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,760
- Tae Ri! Ji Hyun!
- Ji Hyun!

461
00:27:58,139 --> 00:27:59,169
Ji Hyun!

462

464

467

472
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,980
Jeon Ji Hyun!

Kim Tae Ri!

474
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:38,980
They won't have submitted their work yet.

475
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,919
He wants something provocative,

476
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,550
sensational, and crazy.

477
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,020
At my sister's company.

478
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:47,219
His mistress and her husband too.
They all work there.

479
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,459
Mother!

480
00:28:48,689 --> 00:28:51,090
What do you think you're doing?

481
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:53,889
The people right here are kidnappers.

482
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:55,500
I want to report them.
