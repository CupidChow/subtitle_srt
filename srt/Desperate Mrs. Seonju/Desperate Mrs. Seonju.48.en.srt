00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,260
(Episode 48)

2
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:21,940
Darn it.

3
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,180
Chu Ah.

4
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,509
Jeong Woo Sang was really here.

5
00:00:32,849 --> 00:00:35,779
I took photos of him
going into a suite with a woman.

6
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:36,779
You look like a panda.

7
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,120
What?

8
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:40,349
You didn't publish the article, did you?

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,190
- I was just about to...
- No! You can't ever write about it!

10
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:47,559
I'll give you a bigger story later.
Hold back until then.

11
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,660
Send me your account details.

12
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:54,800
Why do you want my account details?

13
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,440
Do you really have something bigger?

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,999
You bet I do!

15
00:00:58,669 --> 00:01:00,770
Don't you dare write about this
without my permission.

16
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,980
Okay.

17
00:01:02,779 --> 00:01:03,879
Were you at a fashion show?

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,879
Shoot.

19
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,179
Ms. Jin.

20
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,320
Jeong Woo Sang was here
with a woman as you said.

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,159
He was drunk, so I escorted him politely.

22
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:19,490
You have a master key, right?
Give it to me.

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,359
What? I can't do that.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,100
There are other guests,
so I can't give you the key.

25
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,600
Suite 614, right?

26
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,900
Wait.

27
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:33,040
No, wait.

28
00:01:33,309 --> 00:01:35,579
That tickles. Stop it.

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,980
Come on.

30
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:43,120
Hold still.

31
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,249
- Hang on.
- What for?

32
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:51,260
What's this?

33
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,689
What are you doing?

34
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,230
Stop it. What are you doing?

35
00:01:57,529 --> 00:01:58,559
The doors are opening.

36
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:00,600
Going down.

37
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:16,579
Woo Sang.

38
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,750
Woo Sang!

39
00:02:20,089 --> 00:02:21,619
Get out here!

40
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,820
Woo Sang!

41
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,889
You're not cheating on me with her,
are you?

42
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,899
Woo Sang!

43
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,700
Woo Sang!

44
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:37,369
Woo Sang!

45
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:39,369
Come outside!

46
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:41,239
Woo Sang!

47
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:11,269
- Hey. Let's get out of here first.
- Oh, no.

48
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,820
Pass me my clothes.

49
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,169
Darn it.

50
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Shoot.

51
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:55,419
What's going on? There's a fire?

52
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:56,450
Where?

53
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,149
The alarm malfunctioned! There's no fire!

54
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:00,190
I apologize!

55
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,820
The alarm malfunctioned.

56
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,619
There's no fire. I apologize.

57
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,429
This is huge.

58
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,959
Good on me for catching the scent.

59
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,169
Let's go back inside.

60
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,369
This is bad.

61
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,040
Something bad happened.

62
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,409
Jin Chu Ah!

63
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:36,490
You can't do that again.

64
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,029
Fifty dollars.

65
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,769
- What?
- Lend it to me.

66
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:47,570
Fifty dollars?

67
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,260
So...

68
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:13,089
What we did was...

69
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:16,899
A mistake. It was a mistake.

70
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,599
- A mistake.
- Yes. It was a mistake.

71
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,200
Right. So...

72
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:26,769
Let's be cool about it.

73
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:29,940
We'll act like it never happened.

74
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,639
Yes, good.

75
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,409
Shall we head home, then?

76
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,670
What if your dad
were to realize the truth?

77
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,279
He'll bury us both
in private and in public...

78
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,279
for deceiving him
for as long as you lived.

79
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,490
Who can say that day won't come?

80
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,789
I've had enough of you...

81
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:16,719
acting out.

82
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:18,389
We might lose everything.

83
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,260
Do you think I lived a life-long lie
just to let it crumble like this?

84
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,899
Your dad...

85
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,130
trusts So Woo more than he does you.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,310
And now Pi Seon Ju
works at the company too.

87
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:35,639
Stop acting like a spoiled brat...

88
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,709
and fight to keep your position.

89
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,149
Why worry about Seon Ju?

90
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:44,420
Do you think
the likes of her could threaten me?

91
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,149
She's an unpredictable scatterbrain.

92
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:49,820
You two are already at odds.

93
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,630
Who's to say there won't be any trouble
while you're in close proximity?

94
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,529
Do you think
that won't hurt your reputation?

95
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,240
Think carefully and decide
what you must do.

96
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:04,839
Keep your wits about you...

97
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:07,870
and do whatever it takes
to be acknowledged.

98
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:10,779
That's what you must do for now.

99
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,889
My gosh.

100
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:32,130
What are you doing out here?

101
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,500
Where did you put my medicine?

102
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,000
Your medicine?

103
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:51,380
What did you and Sang Ah talk about?

104
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,050
We didn't talk about much.

105
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,560
You seemed to talk about
something important.

106
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,860
There's no such thing.

107
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,060
You jumped when you saw me.

108
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,099
I thought you were keeping a secret.

109
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,729
I was startled
because I didn't hear you walk up.

110
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,099
You seemed to be stressed out
because of Sang Ah,

111
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,070
so I scolded her a bit
and told her to grow up.

112
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,279
Good. Thanks.

113
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:51,239
Goodness.

114
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
What happened to you?

115
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:54,550
Why are you such a mess?

116
00:08:54,979 --> 00:08:56,150
Is something wrong?

117
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,320
I don't know. Don't ask.

118
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,739
Did I arrange...

119
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,609
their first night together myself?

120
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,749
Die. I should just die.

121
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,489
Darn it.

122
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:42,430
My goodness.

123
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:47,329
You got back just now?

124
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,369
- Yes.
- Yes.

125
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:52,300
I was too worried to go to bed.

126
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,810
I went to and fro all night long.

127
00:09:55,369 --> 00:09:56,780
You didn't have to worry.

128
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,680
You two look as if...

129
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,719
How much did you have to drink?

130
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,849
How did you get home?

131
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,060
We hired a driver.

132
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,219
Good night.

133
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:15,390
Good night.

134
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,930
What's up with them?

135
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:23,940
I'm so tired.

136
00:10:26,609 --> 00:10:29,579
(Jin Architecture)

137
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,619
Oh, dear. I'm so sorry.

138
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:39,589
I'm in a rush.

139
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,099
What if your dad
were to realize the truth?

140
00:10:57,369 --> 00:11:00,810
He'll bury us both
in private and in public...

141
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,879
for deceiving him
for as long as you lived.

142
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:06,849
Keep your wits about you...

143
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,780
and do whatever it takes
to be acknowledged.

144
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,759
- Hello. Good morning.
- Hello.

145
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:17,859
Hello.

146
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:19,729
You're in a good mood.

147
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,160
The deadline is coming up.
Are things coming along?

148
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:24,930
A bit too well.

149
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,499
You're speaking like we're equals?

150
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:31,869
Yes. I'm no longer your intern.

151
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
I'm on Mr. Kim's team.

152
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,410
I believe he asked you
to treat me appropriately.

153
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:39,579
Treat me with respect
and I'll do the same.

154
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:43,749
It'll be so humiliating to lose
after being on that high horse.

155
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:48,320
Wouldn't it be better to quit
before you lose to save face?

156
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
No.

157
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,089
You seem determined to get me fired,

158
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,129
but the CEO of this company,

159
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,499
your own father, allowed me to stay.

160
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,629
So what you're doing right now...

161
00:11:58,629 --> 00:12:00,999
is disobeying your father's order.

162
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,239
Don't mind me
and concentrate on your own project.

163
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,209
Shoot.

164
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,209
Darn you!

165
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:16,780
Sorry. I didn't see you.

166
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,879
My gosh.

167
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Aren't you being too childish?

168
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,520
Watch where you're going
in case there's an obstacle.

169
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,229
You tripped up because you were
too arrogant to check your surroundings.

170
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,629
Oh, dear. Did you sprain your wrist?

171
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,829
A designer needs to treasure their wrists.

172
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:37,540
Will you blame me again like you did
when you ruined your art exam?

173
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,379
This is how you use a foot.

174
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:52,219
Don't use yours to trip up others. Okay?

175
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,930
Darn it.

176
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:05,759
(Team Leader's Office, Jin Sang Ah)

177
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:09,369
- That was insane.
- Did you see that?

178
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,270
It was as if we were invisible.

179
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:14,209
Wasn't that like
two martial arts masters...

180
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:15,640
fighting in a whirlwind?

181
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,310
It was. They didn't use blades,
but I could smell the blood.

182
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,680
Don't you think Pi Seon Ju is impressive?

183
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:23,180
She doesn't let Ms. Jin intimidate her.

184
00:13:23,349 --> 00:13:26,420
I think Seon Ju's team
will win this competition.

185
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,790
That project is all about the design.

186
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,459
Ms. Jin will win.

187
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:34,629
No. Don't you know
design is about tenacity?

188
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,160
Seon Ju looks like she's the underdog,

189
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,629
but I'm betting on her tenacity.

190
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:40,670
Are you?

191
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,770
I wager 50 cents that Ms. Jin will win.

192
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,440
I wager 10 dollars on Seon Ju.

193
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:51,079
I bet on Seon Ju too. Fifty dollars.

194
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,079
My gosh.

195
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,920
She's nothing.

196
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:00,249
Coffee.

197
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,089
Shall we get started?

198
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,589
Yes.

199
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,959
Shall we go into detail
about what we discussed yesterday?

200
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,430
Okay.

201
00:14:13,869 --> 00:14:15,599
Here's your coffee.

202
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:16,999
- Thank you.
- Sure.

203
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,780
So, you had some time to think.
Did you watch...

204
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,790
some of the other shows on TV?

205
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,489
You told me to take a break.

206
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:43,030
You did as you were told for once?

207
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,599
So you didn't do anything at all?

208
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:49,570
I told you to think of something
during your break!

209
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,109
Do you think MBS
is that easy a place to stay at?

210
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:56,780
How did you even get your job
in the first place?

211
00:14:57,609 --> 00:15:00,009
I submitted a resume
and passed the interview.

212
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,119
You.

213
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,089
My gosh. I don't believe this.

214
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:12,290
To think that I gave you
a passing grade...

215
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,890
in the interview
because you looked normal.

216
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,200
That didn't just shackle me,
it came back to strangle me.

217
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:21,329
Get out!

218
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:25,599
Director Bae.

219
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,839
Your trot music show isn't doing as well.

220
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:32,109
- Do better!
- Why did you talk back to him?

221
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:33,680
Should I have kept quiet?

222
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,119
He'd have chewed me out for that too.

223
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:38,379
No. I think it's best when you...

224
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,450
don't speak at all.

225
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,420
I must find an out.
I can't do this anymore.

226
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,930
Wait. What about me?

227
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,759
What about me?

228
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,070
Thanks.

229
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:05,339
I'm not very hungry.

230
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:07,810
You should still eat.

231
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:10,619
If you don't eat now,
you'll snack at night.

232
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Take a seat.

233
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,329
From now on, I need you
to follow Woo Sang around...

234
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:29,770
so he doesn't drink too much.

235
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,940
Okay.

236
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,969
You can't even drink that much.

237
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:36,239
I worry you'll get drunk
and get into trouble with someone.

238
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:43,650
The soup is lovely.

239
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,420
Welcome!

240
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,190
Not you again.

241
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,060
Is that how you greet a client?

242
00:16:58,229 --> 00:16:59,530
I'll tell your boss.

243
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,030
You know, if you were an actor,

244
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,339
you'd have played a sly snake.

245
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:06,369
How so?

246
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,810
I have the looks of a romantic lead.

247
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,079
Don't I get yogurt today?

248
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,279
Give me one.

249
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:27,930
You lied about...

250
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,200
buying a house, didn't you?

251
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,330
You just come over
to get a free yogurt drink.

252
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,630
As if you direct TV shows.

253
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:36,999
That's a lie too, isn't it?

254
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:41,239
Instead of looking around
other people's houses,

255
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,640
come back when you have the money.

256
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,739
The property you recommended last time.

257
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,749
Is it sold?

258
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,979
You'll buy it?

259
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,380
It was the best option.

260
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,420
You have a good eye.

261
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,719
- Will the price go up?
- You bet it will.

262
00:17:57,719 --> 00:18:02,130
House prices will keep going up
until the human race goes extinct.

263
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,360
Our possessive nature
and social structure will see to that.

264
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,299
You can be so persuasive.

265
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,830
I'm right.

266
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:10,370
I learned a painful lesson.

267
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:12,640
You must earn
through investments, not labor.

268
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,069
- That's it, right?
- Right.

269
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:21,880
Let's do it.

270
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,350
Are you sure? Can I call the homeowner?

271
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,660
Hello, ma'am.

272
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,789
I found you a buyer.

273
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:36,600
When are you free to sign the contract?

274
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,930
Yes.

275
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,370
Okay. I understand.

276
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,120
What are you doing over there?

277
00:18:59,219 --> 00:19:00,219
What?

278
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:05,890
Go back to your room.

279
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,059
Okay.

280
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:35,319
Let's just memorize some lines.

281
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:43,299
(I Lost My Memory but I Want Revenge)

282
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:44,360
"It's not fair."

283
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,870
"Why do I feel this way?"

284
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,069
"You have it all. What's unfair?"

285
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:50,940
"It's that phrase."

286
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:52,539
"That's what's unfair."

287
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,739
"I have it all, but I don't have you."

288
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:43,519
Darn it.

289
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,059
This is crazy.

290
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:50,860
(Manjang Kindergarten)

291
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,559
What did you learn today?

292
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:54,529
Did you learn a lot?

293
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:55,999
Lots and lots.

294
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:58,239
Quack, quack.

295
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,370
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

296
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,910
We have the best activity center,
don't we?

297
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,080
We do.

298
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,410
That's the one thing I miss
since I moved away.

299
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,019
My goodness.

300
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:14,789
Grandma.

301
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,860
Ji Hyun. You just got out of kindergarten?

302
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:18,090
Yes.

303
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,130
You look pretty well-dressed.

304
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:26,999
Hello.

305
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:29,200
Dong Won, I'm glad we met.

306
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,999
Take the kids home.

307
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,670
- I'm on my way to soccer...
- Go now!

308
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,039
Drop them off at home first!

309
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,709
Let's go.

310
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,779
Where are you going?

311
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,499
Are you enjoying life
thanks to your son...

312
00:22:01,969 --> 00:22:03,700
who's having an affair with a rich girl?

313
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:07,739
I was once married to a rich businessman.

314
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:09,769
I only got back on track
to being who I was.

315
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:13,279
Are you happy that you can do that
at your son's expense?

316
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,380
Yes.

317
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:18,749
I'm pleased to see
he's climbing up the social ladder.

318
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,789
My heart races with excitement.

319
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:24,789
Aren't you ashamed of
what your grandchild might think?

320
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:27,860
She's not here, is she?

321
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,259
Are you saying that
when it comes to Ji Hyun,

322
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:33,299
you don't care one tiny bit
what she thinks?

323
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:34,799
You don't miss her?

324
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,969
If I do, I can see her
every now and then like today.

325
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:39,739
We're still related.

326
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,170
Raise her well.

327
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,680
She'll come looking for
her successful dad later on.

328
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,209
My goodness.

329
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,809
Good for you.

330
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:50,819
Thanks for the compliment.

331
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:53,850
Nam Jin finally found
the right woman for him.

332
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,989
What?

333
00:22:55,819 --> 00:22:58,120
You don't seem to know who he's seeing.

334
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:01,459
She's not at all like
your daughter Seon Ju.

335
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:03,959
Seon Ju doesn't stand a chance.

336
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:07,529
More like she married
the wrong fool in the first place.

337
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,239
Isn't it great
they broke up when they did?

338
00:23:12,969 --> 00:23:14,910
I wasn't going to tell you this,

339
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,580
but Nam Jin's new girlfriend
bought me an apartment.

340
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,709
- What?
- Neither you...

341
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:23,920
nor Seon Ju ever bought me anything.

342
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,950
This proves the difference in class.

343
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,219
You freeloader.

344
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,789
Fine! Enjoy the handouts!

345
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:37,330
My gosh. If you're jealous, say so!

346
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,029
You lot are freeloaders.

347
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Don't even dream of
asking Nam Jin for money!

348
00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:46,569
Darn her.

349
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,910
This isn't it.

350
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,390
Are you working on a way
to change the building structure?

351
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,959
Well,

352
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,590
it's not impossible,

353
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,630
but compared to the whole budget,
the cost...

354
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,200
So what? You haven't found a way yet?

355
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,370
No, but do we have to
do something that drastic?

356
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,269
Can't we think of a reasonable...

357
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,670
Do it. Get it done somehow.

358
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,840
This competition is the starting point
where everything can change.

359
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,940
Make it work.

360
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,719
Is it really nice?

361
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,090
It's great.

362
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,660
Is it really?

363
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,160
This might be a rash comment,
but I have a great feeling about it.

364
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,539
Don't you think
your design is right on point?

365
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,340
Do you think so?

366
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:55,969
Do you think we'll win?

367
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:59,709
What should we do if we actually win?

368
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,680
Why would you say that?

369
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,580
Do you want to lose, then?

370
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:04,950
No.

371
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,249
I mean, what should we do to celebrate?

372
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,719
Shall we keep going after another coffee?

373
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:13,390
That sounds good. This round is on me.

374
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,729
Okay.

375
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,930
(Team Leader's Office, Kim So Woo)

376
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,229
What are you doing out here?

377
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,269
I was just walking by.

378
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:28,769
You mean you took this route to walk by?

379
00:25:29,469 --> 00:25:30,709
Were you spying on us?

380
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,549
Do you think I'm on your level?

381
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,049
I'll put up a note
that says you're to stay away.

382
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:41,950
Don't you do anything weird!

383
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,489
Darn her.

384
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,440
(Head of Interior, Jin Sang Ah)

385
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,709
Your dad...

386
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:05,940
trusts So Woo more than he does you.

387
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,120
And now Pi Seon Ju
works at the company too.

388
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:13,519
Stop acting like a spoiled brat...

389
00:26:14,249 --> 00:26:15,650
and fight to keep your position.

390
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:20,789
Darn it.

391
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,930
What is it? Is something wrong?

392
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,630
The other team.
We need to take them seriously.

393
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:30,569
Why so?

394
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:32,600
They get on so well
and they're laughing too.

395
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,769
So Woo seems to be pretty confident.

396
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:37,709
He's not the type to be arrogant.

397
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,450
You feel that way because you're anxious.

398
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,979
No. He sounded sure and confident.

399
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,890
They seem to be making progress.

400
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,360
We're making progress too.
We're doing exactly what you want.

401
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:54,830
That's not good enough.

402
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,100
The deadline is tomorrow.

403
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:00,700
We have to do something.

404
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:39,670
(Team members only for a while!)

405
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,140
(Team members only for a while!)

406
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:11,840
What do you want to do, then?

407
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,769
Your daughter.

408
00:28:15,469 --> 00:28:16,709
Let's use her.

409
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:32,759
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

410
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:50,840
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

411
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,080
Shall we take our time
and get to know each other?

412
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,610
I'd like that.

413
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,749
What do you have on your face?

414
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,249
They'd lose their minds
if something were to happen to the kids.

415
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,890
Do we have to go that far?

416
00:29:02,989 --> 00:29:04,259
Don't you miss Ji Hyun?

417
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:05,519
Hello, Ji Hyun.

418
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:06,819
Grandma.

419
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,930
Mom. I need to ask you a favor.

420
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:13,059
