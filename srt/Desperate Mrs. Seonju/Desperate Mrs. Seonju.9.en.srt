1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,659
- Goodness.
- We'll let her go for your sake.

2
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:13,930
Thank you so much, detective.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,900
- Thank you.
- Sure.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,069
- Bye.
- Thank you.

5
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:21,329
Darn you.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,439
Mom.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,739
(Safe Seoul, Happy Citizens)

8
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,900
I'm sorry, darling.

9
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,369
We had to go somewhere.
Were you here for a while?

10
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,610
Hello.

11
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:03,909
Take a seat.

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,110
Are you hungry?

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,850
Get the rice, girls.

14
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:08,150
It's fine.

15
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,720
I waited a while,
then had ramyeon with the kids.

16
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,690
Why did you do that?

17
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,219
It's what the kids wanted.

18
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,389
Why would they want that
when I'd cooked a feast?

19
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,690
Goodness.

20
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:22,460
Auntie. Are you out of prison?

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,630
Gang Dong Won.

22
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,630
What was it like?

23
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,900
Were you handcuffed?

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,040
I was in lock-up in a police station.

25
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,309
I wasn't handcuffed. Maybe next time...

26
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,639
You brat.

27
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:36,279
You still haven't learned a lesson?

28
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:37,609
If you ate, go to your room.

29
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:39,210
Get her out of my sight.

30
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,249
What a mess this is.

31
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:43,619
- I'll get you some water.
- No, water won't cut it.

32
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,949
Where did I put the peach liquor?

33
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:46,949
There it is.

34
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,520
Get me a cup.

35
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,570
What kind of car...

36
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:09,479
did you drive into
that will cost 55,000 dollars to fix?

37
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:10,910
An imported one.

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,279
How did you end up crashing into it?

39
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:16,020
I dozed off and reversed into it.

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,050
It's a pity you can still talk.
Aren't you too ashamed to answer?

41
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:22,390
Mi Ju caused the accident and not you?

42
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:25,890
- Yes.
- Nam Jin.

43
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:27,760
You thought Seon Ju had caused it...

44
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,499
and turned a blind eye?

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,099
When your wife caused an accident
that cost tens of thousands?

46
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,969
He didn't turn a blind eye.

47
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,069
He'd just got a job
and was unable to help out.

48
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:39,240
Why are you defending him?

49
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,010
Why do you all live like this?

50
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:44,279
I worked with chemicals all day long...

51
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:47,150
until my hands turned red
and my legs got swollen,

52
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,180
but I didn't want you to end up like me.

53
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:52,319
My only goal was
to marry you off well so you wouldn't...

54
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,189
have to do much housework.

55
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,990
You said all that at the police station.

56
00:02:58,089 --> 00:03:00,860
Why do you live
like a pack of scrounging animals?

57
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,330
- We're doing just fine.
- To avoid...

58
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,529
giving him the impression
that we were a nuisance,

59
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:10,599
you lied to him
and said you'd caused the accident.

60
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,909
You are troublesome nuisances.

61
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:15,369
Nam Jin.

62
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,980
You know how hard
Seon Ju worked to support you.

63
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,819
Why are you taking it out on him?

64
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,849
You're drunk, Mom. Go to sleep.

65
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,249
Yes, Nam Jin. Don't take it to heart.

66
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,020
Seon Ju got on Mom's bad side.

67
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,990
She brought Ji Hyun over to eat our food,

68
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,300
and she even took our toilet tissue
to save money to send to you.

69
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,270
She was a leech.

70
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,670
I see Mom kept it bottled up for a while.

71
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:44,969
What got into you, Jin Ju?

72
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,170
He came over after a team dinner.

73
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,510
I was just commenting on
how hard you tried.

74
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,680
Let's go home.

75
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:58,219
My goodness...

76
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,920
- Goodbye.
- Hey.

77
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,260
Wake up, Ji Hyun.

78
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,659
Let's go home with Dad.

79
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:11,760
My goodness. Darn them all.

80
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Goodness.

81
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,950
Let's go back to bed.

82
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,669
Will you stay a while?

83
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,700
Or will you just go?

84
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,039
Why does Mother
expect you to sacrifice so much?

85
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,109
She was upset with Mi Ju today.
Don't take it personally.

86
00:04:59,109 --> 00:05:00,609
I know you struggled.

87
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:03,150
But how would I feel
if she said that to my face?

88
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,279
She wants me to feel indebted.

89
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,089
Why would you say that?

90
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,789
Relax and let it go.

91
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,589
Any success is all down to you,

92
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:13,460
and I supported you because I wanted to.

93
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:14,760
Are you happy now?

94
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,200
Stop saying you supported me.

95
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,669
You barely sent me enough for the tuition.

96
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:21,830
You didn't support me that much.

97
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,839
What?

98
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:24,870
You don't know how it was for me.

99
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:28,510
While the others vacationed in Europe
to check out the architecture,

100
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:31,039
I had to walk to the library
and work part-time.

101
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:34,979
I ate leftovers from the restaurant
I worked at while I studied.

102
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:38,080
Do you know how cold New York gets?

103
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,919
Yes, I'm sure it wasn't easy to work hard
and wire me all you had.

104
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,890
But at least here, you speak the language
and you have family.

105
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,690
Everything was normal for you.

106
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,760
Me?

107
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,400
Do you think life was easy for me?

108
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,770
Surviving the workload
with what little money you sent?

109
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,400
I couldn't share that with anyone.
Why not?

110
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:59,440
They wouldn't get it.

111
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,979
They think studying abroad
is a fancy thing people do to relax!

112
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:05,109
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

113
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,179
When we discussed the budget,

114
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:14,320
you asked me to send just enough
that you wouldn't starve.

115
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:17,919
I even sent you boxes of food
and supplies whenever I could,

116
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,630
hoping that would help out.

117
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,000
There were so many unexpected expenses
for graduation projects and things.

118
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:27,429
I even withdrew our security deposit
and wired that to you!

119
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,609
Do you know how much money we have left?

120
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,640
I think I did...

121
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,779
more than enough
considering our circumstances.

122
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,479
You don't see Mom that often,

123
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,650
and today she was upset with Mi Ju.

124
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:47,049
Was it that hard to listen to
a few minutes of her complaints?

125
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:49,460
It's not just Mother. It's you too!

126
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,890
You say it's not what you mean,
but you always say you sacrificed.

127
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,260
You think I owe you all I accomplish.

128
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,830
That I must repay you forever!

129
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,529
Isn't that how you really feel?

130
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,870
- Shoot.
- What the heck?

131
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,029
Darn it all!

132
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,900
Honey! Jeon Nam Jin...

133
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,979
Jeon Nam Jin! Stop right there!

134
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,750
Honey!

135
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,429
This house is a complete mess.

136
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:30,159
My goodness...

137
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:43,909
Gosh.

138
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:47,810
You must make a man
feel comfortable and at ease.

139
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:50,020
Why do you think he left home
this late at night?

140
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,589
It's not like that.

141
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,719
He's staying
at his company's accommodation.

142
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,760
As if it's not like that.

143
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:00,330
I heard you scream
your husband's name for all to hear...

144
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:02,429
as if you were calling a dog home.

145
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,729
I called him to say I'd drop by,

146
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:06,400
but he didn't even wait to see me.

147
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,770
How badly did you upset him?

148
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,969
Doesn't that mean he's avoiding you?

149
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:12,539
- What?
- Well...

150
00:08:13,109 --> 00:08:15,770
You have a way of sounding so hateful.

151
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,539
If you talk like this to me,
you must be extra mean to Nam Jin.

152
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:20,179
It's so obvious.

153
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:23,380
I bet you whined about how hard
you worked to send him money.

154
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,950
Do you think studying abroad
would be any easier?

155
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,120
He flew halfway around the world...

156
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,159
and studied his butt off for his family.

157
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:32,929
Be good to him.

158
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,599
Okay. I'll be good to him.

159
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,169
Why are you here this late anyway?

160
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,039
My singing class wants to go hiking.

161
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:47,610
Do you have a light jacket
or boots I could borrow?

162
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,840
A light jacket?

163
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,679
Wait here.

164
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:53,980
I might have something.

165
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:01,919
Should I carry something like this?

166
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:03,959
This is nice.

167
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:06,929
It's so heavy. What's in here?

168
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,230
Goodness.

169
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:12,199
I'll take this on the hike.

170
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:14,970
Where does she keep her shoes?

171
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:22,539
Yes.

172
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,340
She has hiking shoes.

173
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,850
Let's see if they fit.

174
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:33,689
They're perfect.

175
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,020
The one thing I like about her...

176
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:38,720
is that we wear the same-sized shoes.

177
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,760
I'll take these too.

178
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:50,900
How's this?

179
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,610
Let me see.

180
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,270
I like it.

181
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:55,610
I'll be off, then.

182
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,809
Be extra good to Nam Jin.

183
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:03,720
See you.

184
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:07,289
Goodbye.

185
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,059
What's all this?

186
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:50,329
She took my backpack too?

187
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,159
My gosh.

188
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,770
She doesn't think much of the tuition,

189
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:57,569
and yet she bleeds me dry.

190
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,970
Why didn't you send him any money, then?

191
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,179
Darn her.

192
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,949
It gets cold in New York?

193
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:09,650
Korean winters are just as bad.

194
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:12,020
People freeze to death here too.

195
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,390
I don't believe it.

196
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,090
My gosh.

197
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,929
Who is it now?

198
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,130
It's us.

199
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,299
The door's open.

200
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:34,709
Mom told me to give this to you.

201
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:37,240
She was bothered Nam Jin only had ramyeon.

202
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,610
And you missed dinner.

203
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:42,279
Is Nam Jin not home?

204
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:44,079
He went to the studio apartment.

205
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,990
You have a studio apartment?

206
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,220
It's his company dorm.

207
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,520
It must be a really nice company.

208
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,319
Are you living apart again...

209
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,860
when you were apart for two years?

210
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:57,329
Shouldn't you live together for a while?

211
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:03,240
The pork belly isn't frozen
and must be eaten right away.

212
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,270
Call him if he just left.

213
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:09,140
No. Should we take this
to the studio apartment?

214
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:12,340
Why would you bother doing that?
Let's eat it ourselves.

215
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,480
Get the grill and set things out.

216
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,150
Okay.

217
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:47,679
Quack, quack.

218
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,409
Can you not make that noise?

219
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,679
You're not a duck.

220
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,720
He's that pleased to see you again.

221
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,919
His kindergarten recital tomorrow...

222
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,090
I have work to do.

223
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,689
Tae Ri's recital today...

224
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,260
I said I couldn't make it.

225
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:05,429
Come on.

226
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,110
Why the deep sigh?

227
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,650
Did you two fight
because of what Mom said?

228
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:22,980
It wasn't just Mom. You joined in too.

229
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,689
I could join in all I want,
but I'll never be as scathing as Mom.

230
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:28,750
Wasn't it harsh what she said?

231
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,120
She divulged our past
in front of complete strangers...

232
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,329
at the police station.

233
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,659
She didn't care how we felt about it.

234
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:37,659
That was a bit much.

235
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:40,669
I didn't know
that's how she felt about us.

236
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:44,039
Does she think
we didn't want to make her proud?

237
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:47,270
She corners us whenever she can.
She's merciless.

238
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,340
Right. If she were to talk like that
in front of Nam Jin,

239
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,480
would that help my love life?

240
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,250
Not at all. And the meat's darn hot.

241
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,250
I was right. You and Nam Jin argued.

242
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,819
That's why he's ticked off.

243
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:01,919
Mom's a huge problem.

244
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:03,620
Jin Ju, you're single again,

245
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,029
and the smartest one of us
isn't as successful as she should be.

246
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,959
I see why Mom would be upset.

247
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:12,459
Hey.
Why would you say I'm not successful?

248
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:13,669
What I'm saying is...

249
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:16,640
you two took turns
and crushed Mom's hopes.

250
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,039
Do you have the right to say that?

251
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,110
You're the one
who crushed her beyond recovery.

252
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:23,140
You just cause trouble.

253
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:26,079
Still, I think Mom's the worst of us all.

254
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,809
Her outbursts seem to have a cycle.

255
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:31,620
She goes after one of us
after a certain interval.

256
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,750
Exactly.

257
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,990
I wish she'd target
the person who's in trouble.

258
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,959
If one thing happens,
she goes after all of us.

259
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,329
Let's not do that to our kids.

260
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,029
Yes. Let's be really good moms.

261
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,640
I don't have a kid.

262
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,240
For now, let's toast.

263
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,650
Did the car owner call?

264
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,949
No.

265
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,980
She didn't call you either?

266
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,990
What's the doctor's note about?

267
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:12,819
The police gave us until next week, right?

268
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:13,959
Yes.

269
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,529
It's driving me crazy.

270
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,520
When you came back...

271
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,789
You said you'd spoil me.

272
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,020
You said you'd treat me well.

273
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:54,970
From now on,

274
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,069
let's have an affair.

275
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,970
We could be serious about it,

276
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:02,569
and then end up planning
a future together.

277
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,779
Then this is Day One.

278
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,779
We're official.

279
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,220
I even withdrew our security deposit
and wired that to you!

280
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,919
Do you know how much money we have left?

281
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:53,590
Dad.

282
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,260
I don't want to go there.

283
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,529
Did you tell Tae Ri
about an international school?

284
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:00,900
Yes. Why?

285
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,539
You were apart from him for two years.

286
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:05,900
We texted and made video calls.

287
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,409
Once a month if we got lucky.

288
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:09,880
And only because
I called you and put him on.

289
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,640
Must I be physically present to care?

290
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:13,850
Honey. He's our son.

291
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:17,780
I guess...

292
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:21,350
I shouldn't have become a mom.

293
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,090
I know I shouldn't feel like this,

294
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,790
but the older he gets,

295
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,159
the stranger he feels to me.

296
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,469
Making a wish to a pile of stones.

297
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:44,580
Why do people still do that
in the 21st century?

298
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:46,550
Shall we give it a go?

299
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,449
What did you wish for?

300
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,390
I like Mom.

301
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,759
I want to live with her happily.

302
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,370
(Han Hair Line)

303
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,199
I did as you suggested
and stopped dying my hair.

304
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,840
People have been saying
I look much nicer with white hair.

305
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:53,449
I see.

306
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,679
Hello?

307
00:18:57,749 --> 00:19:00,949
Did something go down
at your place last night?

308
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,820
You and your three girls
walked by looking all glum...

309
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,429
Nothing's going on, so stop asking!

310
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,330
I'm sorry. I think...

311
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:14,969
- you should...
- Mom, lunch...

312
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,499
You have a customer.

313
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:17,739
- Goodness.
- Hello, sir.

314
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,540
I'll blow-dry it for you next time.

315
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,409
Drop by whenever you're free.

316
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:23,880
Okay. I'll do that.

317
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,580
Jin Ju. Close the salon after he leaves.

318
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,880
Are you sure?

319
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,749
- Was it a haircut?
- Yes.

320
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:31,919
- It'll be ten dollars.
- Okay.

321
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,519
Put down the spoon.

322
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:40,560
Get ready to go out.

323
00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:45,729
Where are you going?

324
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,370
I don't know.

325
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,409
Do you have the number of the owner
whose car you drove into?

326
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,580
Why? What do you need it for?

327
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,409
Someone who can afford
such a car will be well-off,

328
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,409
and they might be understanding.

329
00:20:02,709 --> 00:20:05,080
Let's go and plead and beg.

330
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:06,989
She's not understanding.

331
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:08,749
She went to school with Seon Ju,

332
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,790
so I thought of dragging her along too.

333
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,959
But she wouldn't want to
plead to a friend.

334
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:15,890
You caused the mess, so you clean it up!
Give me the number!

335
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,239
This is the car owner's sister's number.

336
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,739
She's the actress you work for?

337
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:28,040
Yes.

338
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,040
Hello.

339
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,949
I'm the mother of the girl who caused...

340
00:20:35,949 --> 00:20:37,949
the recent car accident.

341
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,650
I'm really sorry about that.

342
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,360
Do you think we could meet?

343
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,890
Yes.

344
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:50,259
Okay.

345
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:54,469
Sure. I'll get an estimate later today.

346
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,800
Bye.

347
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,509
(Chatrooms)

348
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,780
Jeon Nam Jin...

349
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:09,679
didn't even text after leaving like that?

350
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:16,449
What is it?

351
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:19,019
Mom closed the hair salon and went out.

352
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,729
What for?
She stays open on holidays too.

353
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,600
She's off to meet the other car owner.

354
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,330
She dragged Mi Ju with her.

355
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,560
For real?

356
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,699
Where did they go?

357
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:30,570
A salon in Cheongdam-dong?

358
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:32,070
Okay, thanks.

359
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,070
What will she say this time?

360
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,679
Why would her mom come over?

361
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:44,550
Why must we meet in person...

362
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,219
when the police and insurance people
can handle it?

363
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:48,620
Her insurance is so cheap
it won't cover the expenses.

364
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,489
Then she's coming here
to ask us to settle for less.

365
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,330
Call her back and tell her not to come.

366
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,530
Why would her mom get involved
when she's an adult herself?

367
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,259
Lots of people are mentally immature...

368
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,499
that their parents need to get involved.

369
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:03,939
I guess the poor are like that.
Isn't that funny?

370
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:05,239
How is that funny?

371
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:08,669
We rarely have to meet
poor, ignorant folk.

372
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,110
- This is fun.
- What?

373
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:14,080
How will you handle them
if they really are ignorant brutes?

374
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,679
- You should call Sang Ah too.
- Okay.

375
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,489
- Hi.
- Hey.

376
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,229
The other car owner's mom
is coming to the salon.

377
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:30,429
What? Her mom?

378
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,199
My goodness.

379
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,400
Okay. Don't say a word until I get there.

380
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:37,669
Darn it.

381
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,780
Mom, I'm starving. Where's lunch?

382
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,219
I'm coming right over.

383
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:53,790
It's a lovely day.

384
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:56,719
Here you go.

385
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,790
What's this?

386
00:22:58,219 --> 00:23:00,489
Potatoes, corn, and sweet potatoes?

387
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,729
Look carefully. There's protein too.

388
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:03,999
Where?

389
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,870
What is this?

390
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:12,400
Is this how people eat eel nowadays?

391
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:15,269
I followed a recipe. It's smoked.

392
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:17,780
Is it?

393
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:24,979
Why does it taste like this?

394
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:27,790
Just eat it. It's good for you.

395
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,790
Mom. Is this...

396
00:23:31,689 --> 00:23:35,060
Yes. It's the snake that came after me.

397
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:39,499
- How could you?
- It's good for you.

398
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,239
(Grace Shim Beauty Studio)

399
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:45,900
This is it, Mom.

400
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:48,509
"Grace Shim?"

401
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:50,610
We're in the same business.

402
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,979
You're not the same at all.

403
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:54,249
She works with top celebrities.

404
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:56,380
It's still just a salon.

405
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,880
I should be able to get through to her.

406
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,350
All you have to do
is beg for forgiveness and mercy.

407
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:06,519
Let's try to reduce the settlement
and keep your job too.

408
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:07,989
- Okay?
- Okay.

409
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,159
Let's go inside.

410
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:17,239
We're here to see Jin Chu Ah.

411
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,540
We have an appointment.

412
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,699
Give me a moment.

413
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:23,239
Someone's here to see you.

414
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:25,679
(Grace Shim)

415
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,850
Okay.

416
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:29,209
Go on inside.

417
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,650
Mom, let's go.

418
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:31,919
Okay. I'll take that.

419
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:40,729
(Grace Shim)

420
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,040
Goodness.

421
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,509
I do hope...

422
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,679
you'll excuse me for coming by.

423
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,580
I feel so bad
that I don't even know what to say.

424
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:07,320
It is you, Soon Ae.

425
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:10,390
You're Shim Soon Ae, aren't you?

426
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:16,900
Man Eun...

427
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,800
Yes, you brat. It's me, Han Man Eun.

428
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,199
How long has it been?

429
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:28,239
You followed me around when we were young.

430
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,439
Do you remember?

431
00:25:33,509 --> 00:25:34,580
Hey!

432
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,979
Man Eun!

433
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,850
Man Eun.

434
00:25:40,949 --> 00:25:42,050
What now?

435
00:25:42,689 --> 00:25:43,759
Does it show?

436
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,519
It's even darker than yesterday.

437
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,519
Darn it.

438
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,759
At first,
he hit me where it didn't show.

439
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,560
My sides, stomach, back.

440
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:54,699
He thought before he hit me.

441
00:25:54,699 --> 00:25:57,199
He's so considerate, isn't he?

442
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,169
Don't be so sarcastic.

443
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,469
What will you do now?

444
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,880
Will you stay with
that considerate gentleman...

445
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,479
while he beats you senseless?

446
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,249
I don't know.

447
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,580
He hits me whenever I'm within reach.

448
00:26:11,449 --> 00:26:13,919
I wish I could teach him a lesson.

449
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,820
I might end up dead one day.

450
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,060
People never change.

451
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,830
Leave him for your sake.

452
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,630
I can't just up and leave.

453
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:27,630
He won't let me go.

454
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,070
I'd love to run away,
but I have nowhere to go.

455
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,909
How about this?

456
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,640
My husband's away deep-sea fishing.

457
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,540
Will you stay with me?

458
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,780
Can I? Can I really do that?

459
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,919
There should be enough room
for you to squeeze into.

460
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:45,780
Man Eun.

461
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,320
You're a lifesaver.

462
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,759
I'll make it up to you
when I become successful.

463
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,929
I'm sure you will.

464
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:58,030
I swear.
I won't live in the countryside for long.

465
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,630
I'll move to Seoul and become successful.

466
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:02,570
Is Seoul that great a place?

467
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:04,269
It is.

An old man from Seoul's
about to board a train for the first time

469
00:27:08,969 --> 00:27:11,709
It's time to board and he needs to poop

470
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:15,080
When he came out of the toilet
the train had already left

471
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:22,390
It really is you, Soon Ae.

472
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,560
No. You mistook me for someone else.

473
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,060
I did not.

474
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,590
You said my name just now.

475
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,800
You recognized me right away.

changes your look completely.

Were you actually close?

Be quiet!

I bet Mr. Kim
can never imagine what we're up to.

484
00:28:28,449 --> 00:28:29,790
Because he trusts you.

485
