1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,859
So...

2
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:12,460
(Episode 55)

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,190
At work and at home,

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,259
let's be like parallel train tracks.

5
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,900
And if we meet by chance like this,

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,809
let's restrict sharing our thoughts
to this room.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,510
That's a good idea.

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,010
Let's be like train tracks.

9
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:37,579
Don't do anything
that could be misconstrued.

10
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:40,019
Let's just...

11
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:42,619
be friends.

12
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,390
Friends.

13
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:46,789
Sounds good.

14
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:50,229
Since we're friends,

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,969
we don't have to avoid each other.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,840
Since we're no longer awkward,

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,740
shall we leave together?

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,810
Yes. Shall we?

19
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,439
Let's go.

20
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,390
Hey.

21
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,859
I will...

22
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,129
go this way.

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,129
You can go this way.

24
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:24,629
Let's go.

25
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,170
No, wait.

26
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,469
Go ahead.

27
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:35,739
Okay.

28
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,219
Jeong Woo Sang!

29
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:50,390
Let's talk.

30
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,430
He said...

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,170
he'd start work in the afternoon.

32
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:05,670
Did he leave already?

33
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,540
Here you are.

34
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:13,150
I made some porridge.

35
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,879
I'm not hungry.

36
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,550
Get out.

37
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,689
Once I make up my mind, I'm done.

38
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,990
I get it. Try to eat a little at least.

39
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,960
The drama is about to climax...

40
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,789
and he shot so many commercials.

41
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:30,460
They're not just ordinary commercials.

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,169
He promoted soju for pure men...

43
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:35,740
and lotion for good young men.

44
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,810
It may look like Woo Sang
shot to stardom right away,

45
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,439
but he worked himself
to the bone to get here.

46
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:46,979
What if he loses everything
because of you?

47
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,349
Do you want to ruin
his life and career like this?

48
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:54,520
I'm looking for a new place.

49
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,189
I'll leave as soon as I find something.

50
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:00,990
Okay.

51
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,400
You can go.

52
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:24,050
Hi. You saw the article, didn't you?

53
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,719
And you didn't call even once?

54
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:29,560
You're just the same.

55
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,219
How am I the same?

56
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,189
Who are you?

57
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,599
Who are you?

58
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,530
- Hi, Mom.
- Son.

59
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,069
This is sudden.

60
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,270
Are you moving back in?

61
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,169
- Yes.
- Then are you done...

62
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,310
distancing yourself from family? Why?

63
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,009
I bought a house,
but I couldn't get a loan,

64
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:54,449
so I had to leave my rental.

65
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,719
I paid the balance on the house
with the deposit.

66
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,319
Are you back for good, then?

67
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:00,990
I'll be here for the time being.

68
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:03,860
Good for you.
You should've come back sooner.

69
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,830
- I was so stressed out.
- Don't.

70
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:10,000
Who is she?

71
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,699
She's our live-in help. She's leaving.

72
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:17,300
Go downstairs. Don't think of staying.

73
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:18,800
Find a place as soon as you can.

74
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,539
Okay.

75
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:28,350
Did you have to be so mean?

76
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,680
Don't go there. It's such a headache.

77
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,750
Is she the mysterious girl from the hotel?

78
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,160
Yes.

79
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:39,930
I didn't think Woo Sang
would upset me in this manner.

80
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,930
I'm so upset these days.

81
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:44,699
- I was...
- Mom.

82
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,569
I came by to leave my things.
I have to go back out.

83
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,170
- See you later.
- No, wait!

84
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,439
Can't you listen for just ten minutes?

85
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,939
Do you have that roller
to de-puff my face?

86
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:57,810
Mi Ju had that too.

87
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,279
Shall I go home and get it?

88
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,949
Don't you keep anything with you?

89
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:01,980
Leave it.

90
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:05,620
Find me a clean studio apartment.

91
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,290
Don't tell anyone I asked.

92
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:09,819
Oh, is it because of that?

93
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,720
Yes. Mom wants her gone.

94
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,230
I don't think she has anywhere to go.

95
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,129
- Was Pi Mi Ju fired?
- My gosh.

96
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,399
Don't ask. You don't need to know.

97
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,709
Was she fired?

98
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:28,240
What?

99
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,810
I think Ms. Oh told her to quit.

100
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,779
Then she won't follow Woo Sang to work...

101
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:34,949
and she'll leave his house too?

102
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,250
Yes.

103
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,220
Yes. I got rid of her at last.

104
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,790
I knew it.

105
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,660
My hard work paid off.

106
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:48,629
Yes.

107
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:50,759
It'll air next week?

108
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:54,430
Yes. Your episode will be the first
in the successful women series.

109
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,540
Okay. Thank you.

(Myungsung Motors)

112
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,220
Sang Ah is slowly coming to her senses.

113
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,689
Pi Seon Ju.

114
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,629
Yes. I hope your well-educated
witch of a daughter...

115
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,100
and this well-educated fool
live happily with you forever.

116
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,970
Here's your 150,000 dollars.

117
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,170
It's the exact amount.
Gather and count the bills.

118
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,910
The brazen thing.

119
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,180
I just want her out of my sight.

120
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,579
I must stay away
from everyone from that family.

121
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,060
Yes.

122
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,089
Goodness.

123
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,060
Really?

124
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:30,759
Sounds great.

125
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:33,899
See you later.

126
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,470
"Sounds great."

127
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,639
"See you later."

128
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Come in.

129
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,579
Professor Albert will bring
some people on the project in today.

130
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,220
He wants to say hi and to brief us.

131
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,459
Really? We should prepare to meet them.

132
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,060
Yes. I think it would be nice
to brief them on our company.

133
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,829
Shall we put together a presentation?

134
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,160
- Yes.
- Okay.

(Head of Interior, Jin Sang Ah)

136
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:28,389
Mr. Kim is not in.

137
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,689
He has a meeting and will be back late.

138
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,189
Where are the others?

139
00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:35,089
At a site. They'll be back late too.

140
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,829
Your lover just went somewhere.

141
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:39,970
Did he?

142
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,700
I'm short on help.

143
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,539
We have an important meeting.

144
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:48,240
Get the room ready for it.

(Seminar Room 1)

146
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,789
Professor Albert's team...

147
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:06,029
and everyone on the project will be here.

148
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,860
We should show our appreciation
with a nice set-up.

149
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,899
Hey. Why should I be the one to set it up?

150
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,470
There's no one else to do it.

151
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,769
Should I call the cleaning crew...

152
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,409
and pull rank to bully them
into doing extra tasks?

153
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,110
What you're doing
is using your rank to bully me.

154
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,210
What? You don't want to do odd jobs?

155
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,710
People call you a designer,

156
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:29,820
so you think this is beneath you?

157
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,649
It's not that. I'm working on...

158
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:35,019
This is way bigger than your project.

159
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,159
Jin Architecture's future
depends on this deal.

160
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,190
Don't you get it?

161
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:42,190
Shall I put it simply?

162
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,429
It's a really important meeting.

163
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:46,799
Then you set up the room.

164
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,700
Shall I set it up, then?

165
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,169
Should a team leader...

166
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:53,470
clean a room
instead of preparing a presentation?

167
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,779
Do as I said and set things up nicely.

168
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,309
My gosh.

169
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,750
Darn her.

170
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,789

and make the table look classy.

It's the first official meeting
of Jin Architecture and Albert's team.

176
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,629
It's like a pre-wedding gathering.

177
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,139
First impressions count.

178
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,320
Not these.

179
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,179

180

182
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,990
Be quick.

183
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,169
Oh, the wine.

00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,779
and flowers from
a Yangjae-dong flower boutique.

187
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,250
Get them here on time.

188
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:50,259
Yes. I just got back.

189
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:52,789
Okay.

190
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,960
Do I have a meeting
with Professor Albert's team?

191
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,500
Yes. All the team leaders were invited.

192
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,399
We were working on
a presentation for Ms. Jin.

193
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
Where's Ms. Pi?

194
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,370
Ms. Jin must've told her
to set up the meeting room.

195
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:09,779
- Really?
- Yes.

196
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,379
Set out glasses and an ice bowl.

197
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:15,980
Set out one cupcake per seat...

198
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,919
on a plate and make sure
there are no crumbs.

199
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,620
Oh, and prepare the drinks too.

200
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:24,320
Everything must be
perfectly ready by 4 p.m.

201
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:28,590
Yes.

202
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Are you done?

203
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,799
Look.

204
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,500
It's perfect, isn't it?

205
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,440
No. It's weird.

206
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,570
The other chairs would work better.

207
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:45,009
- Switch them back.
- What?

208
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,720
Yes, Ms. Jin.

209
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,690
Hi, Albert. Welcome.

210
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:00,059
Oh, my.

211
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,730
I just came by for a quick hello, but...

212
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:04,759
this is such a grand welcome.

213
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,629
It's my pleasure.

214
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,529
And the others?

215
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,740
They're coming.

216
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:11,470
Please have a seat.

217
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,470
Thank you.

218
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,350
I was a bit late
because of the Hansung meeting.

219
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,549
Okay. Take a seat.

220
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:33,490
Get out already.

221
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,399
Hi, everyone.

222
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,940
I'm Sang Ah Jin,

223
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,509
head of Interior Design
at Jin Architecture.

224
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:51,210
It looks like all the industry's
bright minds are here.

225
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:58,350
Then, let's have
Nam Jin Jeon, our connection,

226
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,750
give a toast.

227
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,759
I'm Nam Jin Jeon from Jin Architecture.

228
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,299
Let's do our best. Cheers.

229
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,500
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

230
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,889
(Jin Architecture)

231
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,559
Hello?

232
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,230
Mom. Can you talk?

233
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:44,830
Yes, I can. What's up?

234
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,600
My teacher asked if you could come in...

235
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,769
to teach us for one day.

236
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,200
- Really?
- Yes.

237
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:52,669
I told her...

238
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,840
you worked at a huge company
as an awesome designer.

239
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,779
You only do cool work now, don't you?

240
00:14:58,909 --> 00:14:59,909
That's right.

241
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,909
Okay. See you later.

242
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,250
Oh, my gosh.

243
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,429
I'm a mess.

244
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Goodness.

245
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,840
Thanks for listening to
my full presentation to the end.

246
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,789
Did you tell Ms. Pi to set up the room?

247
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,289
- Yes.
- Why?

248
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,690
She didn't seem busy,
so I asked for her help.

249
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,629
It's what she used to do.

250
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,899
Mr. Jin, why don't you say something?

251
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,039
With a great team on a great project,

252
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,570
there will be great results.

253
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:06,480
- Thank you, Professor Albert.
- Sure, thank you.

254
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,379
Thank you.

255
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,879
We won't let you down.

256
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,990
It was all about the texture.

257
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,139
Is this enough to guarantee
Mr. Jeon's promotion...

258
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,679
at the upcoming restructuring?

259
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:40,080
That's none of your business.

260
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:46,690
He rejected an offer from that professor
to join our company.

261
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,360
Making him work alongside
other ordinary employees...

262
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,059
across from Pi Seon Ju
who's just a short-term assistant...

263
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,990
isn't exactly fair.

264
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,429
I'm ashamed to imagine
what Albert's teammates will think.

265
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,169
Look.

266
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:06,840
Who got us a project
way bigger than the Hansung deal?

267
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,440
You value the company
more than your own children.

268
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:16,109
Don't you think someone other than So Woo
could be the one to expand it?

269
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:22,049
Jin Architecture
is actually part of the K-culture.

270
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,119
And it should be, right?

271
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:29,589
And I hope you'll make
a big success out of this.

272
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:40,869
Is no one in?

273
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,240
Why can't Sang Ah get divorced?

274
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,549
I've been there and done that.
She just has to sign papers,

275
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,980
go to a judge, and say yes a few times.
It's not that hard.

276
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,980
I should talk to her husband...

277
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,990
Goodness.

278
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:57,960
Who's this?

279
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:01,160
You sold your son
for a luxurious lifestyle.

280
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,430
What are you doing here?

281
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,000
I didn't come here to see you.

282
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,730
If not, why are you here looking around?

283
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,710
Give me the number of your homeowner,

284
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,369
the guy whose son is called Tae Ri.

285
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,940
Why do you want his number?

286
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:19,710
Will you kidnap his son this time...

287
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:21,509
to get a ransom?

288
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:23,750
- Are you out of your mind?
- What?

289
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,220
Yes! I'm out of my mind!

290
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:32,559
My daughter worked her butt off
to support your son...

291
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,759
who cheated on her, and you defended him.

292
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:37,029
Don't you fear the deities?

293
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:39,799
- You need to see a shrink.
- Stop it.

294
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:41,869
- How dare you come here?
- My gosh.

295
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:42,930
What's going on?

296
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,839
- What's wrong with you?
- Let go.

297
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,039
Before you badmouth my son for cheating,

298
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,980
keep a rein on your daughter!

299
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,880
Her daughter shacked up with a guy.

300
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,880
What's worse?
That my son cheated on her...

301
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,819
or that she shacked up with another guy?

302
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,690
Mister. Will you tell them what you think?

303
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,289
- My gosh.
- She didn't shack up with anyone!

304
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,460
Oh, dear.

305
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,990
Don't you dare come back here
if you want to say that again!

306
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,660
Stay away!

307
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,670
I'll post your photo
as if you're a wanted criminal!

308
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:18,000
Be sure to put up
her son's photo next to hers.

309
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
My goodness.

310
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,839
What can I do for you?

311
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:42,660
I'm starving.

312
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,049
You bought this...

313
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,019
but didn't get to taste it.

314
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,759
Is the event over already?

315
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,789
It was nearing the end,
so I excused myself and left.

316
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,529
Taste it. It's good.

317
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:24,339
Did you have lunch?

318
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:27,470
Did you skip it to get the room set up?

319
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:31,980
We all feel a bit hungry
around this time of day.

320
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,279
Then shall we skip this...

321
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:38,319
and go eat something decent?

322
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,549
I was out all day
and didn't have time to eat lunch.

323
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:43,859
Can we do that...

324
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,490
when we're parallel train tracks?

325
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:47,660
Yes.

326
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,559
We can eat together as colleagues.

327
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,930
Let's go somewhere non-romantic.

328
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,670
How about blood sausage soup?

329
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:56,900
Sounds good.

330
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:01,039
We clock off soon. Let's leave on time.

331
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,680
Hey.

332
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:09,609
It's on your face.

333
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,079
- What?
- The cake.

334
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:16,619
No. The other side.

335
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,660
No.

336
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,630
A bit higher up.

337
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,089
Goodness.

338
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,660
Shall I get it for you?

339
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,759
Excuse me.

340
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,529
Lean in.

341
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:35,369
What are you two doing here?

342
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,640
You left before the guests said goodbye...

343
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:42,009
to spend time with Seon Ju?

344
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,650
Are you unable to
keep life and work apart?

345
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:51,819
I'm looking out for a team member
who skipped lunch to set up the room.

346
00:21:52,089 --> 00:21:53,589
Isn't this work?

347
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:59,630
The more time you spend with her,
the more shameless you become.

348
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,970
I find it hilarious
that you're calling him shameless.

349
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,500
You keep quiet.

350
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:09,869
No. You're doing well. Keep going.

351
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,650
My gosh.

352
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,049
You seem almost strange.

353
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:21,789
Is this really you looking out for
a team member?

354
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,890
I don't think so.

355
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:28,190
What exactly are you?

356
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,430
Us?

357
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,960
We're train tracks.

358
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:38,170
I know you can't speak English,
but are you forgetting Korean too?

359
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:42,170
And you. Why aren't you getting ready
to clean the seminar room?

360
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:43,710
That's not her job.

361
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,509
The cleaning staff left for the day.

362
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:48,109
Should I get them to come back in?

363
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,819
Darn it. Fine.

364
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,950
You want me to clean the seminar room?

365
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:55,789
You clean this one.

366
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,190
Put all the chairs back.

367
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,089
Be done within the hour and report to me.

368
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:14,809
Don't go too far.

369
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,210
What's wrong?

370
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,349
I'm asking a subordinate to do something
for the company. Is that wrong?

371
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:22,109
Ms. Pi is on my team.

372
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:25,549
If you want her to do something,
follow protocol...

373
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,519
and put in a request through me.

374
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:35,089
Darn it.

375
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,200
They're really getting on my nerves.

376
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:41,230
They really are.

377
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:47,470
What shall I do?

378
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,269
Put everything back?

379
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:51,880
You want to help?

380
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:53,339
Yes.

381
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:58,319
Even with your help,
I won't be done in an hour.

382
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,720
Don't worry about that.

383
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:02,990
You don't have to
report to Ms. Jin either.

384
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,490
Then shall we take our time?

385
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:10,799
Yes. Wait.

386
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:13,869
We're hungry, so shall we eat first?

387
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,069
Shall I get something delivered?

388
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:17,240
Sounds good.

389
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,160
He worked himself to the bone to get here.

390
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,630
What if he loses everything
because of you?

391
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,390
Do you want to...

392
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,029
ruin his life and career like this?

393
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:53,500
Are you about to leave?

394
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:56,609
Yes.

395
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,480
You're back early today.

396
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,549
It's true that my mom
went through a lot to raise me.

397
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:10,990
You may call me a mama's boy,

398
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,730
but I don't dare go against her.

399
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,460
I understand.

400
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,700
I can't challenge my mom either.

401
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:23,329
I'd like to persuade her over time.

402
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:24,900
Can you wait?

403
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:29,069
Right, here.

404
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,279
Have some of this.

405
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,109
It's stuffed squid.

406
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,380
You like it.

407
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,450
Even if you must leave, eat first.

408
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:54,799
Am I destined to get into trouble...

409
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,369
at regular intervals?

410
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,240
Bad things keep happening.

411
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:02,369
I don't know why I'm like this.

412
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:07,049
What we did wasn't something bad.

413
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:10,579
It wasn't trouble.

414
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,180
Didn't we...

415
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,450
like each other a bit?

416
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,819
I thought we did.

417
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,859
What's wrong?

418
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,619
Shall I get it for you?

419
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:46,720
Excuse me.

420
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,789
You don't have to prove it happens.

421
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,579
No. You're doing well. Keep going.

422
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,720
If you want her to do something,
follow protocol...

423
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:26,890
and put in a request through me.

424
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:29,160
What exactly are you?

425
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,390
Us?

426
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,930
We're train tracks.

427
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,579
The food is here.

428
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,019
- Let's eat first.
- Okay.

429
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,420
Where shall I put this?

430
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:01,559
Here.

431
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,900
- Isn't it good?
- It is.

432
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,009
It's nice and hot.

433
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,640
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

434
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:05,589
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

435
00:29:05,589 --> 00:29:06,990
You and Kim So Woo.

436
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,960
That's not normal.

437
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:10,859
It's nothing compared to you, Mr. Jeon.

438
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,799
Get your own life under control.

439
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,470
Is that...

440
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,269
Are you sure
you didn't do anything that night?

441
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,269
You're just the same.

442
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,170
If you pretended to be flawless,
keep up the charade to the end!

443
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:23,809
Why do you suddenly care so much?

444
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,410
What?

445
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
