00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,290
(Episode 41)

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,559
We're both victims in the same boat.

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,759
We have common assailants.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,830
That must be why I feel your pain.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,539
You're not just a stranger to me.

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,669
Pity? Compassion?

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,940
It could be that.

8
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:28,769
But so what?

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,079
We both were forced to divorce.
Let's look out for each other.

10
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:34,510
We were both forced to divorce?

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,850
Don't say that.

12
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,620
You begged and pleaded for the divorce.

13
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,020
I was blindsided and suffered on my own.

14
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:45,219
I was practically ditched...

15
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:46,890
and your comment is offensive.

16
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,259
I begged and pleaded for divorce,

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,000
but I was blindsided too.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,969
- It still feels like...
- I'm not saying this...

19
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:56,270
because I want to help you.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,109
You're someone I'd like to work with.

21
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:01,710
The Hansung HQ project...

22
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,009
always was a joint deal
with the Interior Team.

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,079
They sell light fixtures,
so if other companies...

24
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,350
choose lighting based on the space,

25
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,719
for this project, we must create
a space where the lights can pop.

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,459
The showroom and design details
are the most important.

27
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:23,299
I work exclusively for Jin Sang Ah.

28
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:26,000
Can I join that project if I want to?

29
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,599
I'll talk to HR.

30
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,799
Still, you're Sang Ah's ex-husband.

31
00:01:33,069 --> 00:01:34,540
Wouldn't that be weird?

32
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:37,180
Do you have feelings for me?

33
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:38,950
What?

34
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:42,379
That reaction is proof you don't.

35
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,349
It's fine as long as we're fine with it.

36
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,620
Even so,

37
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,819
people will see and talk.

38
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,359
We already live in the same house.

39
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,090
Isn't that even weirder?

40
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,799
I didn't know you'd bought the house,
and no one else knows about it.

41
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,969
But everyone at work
now knows how we know each other.

42
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:03,670
They gossip even now because they
don't get why I'm working with Sang Ah.

43
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:06,810
If I were to join your project,
that would really...

44
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,939
I went from working for
my ex's mistress in the video...

45
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:12,810
to working for the mistress' ex-husband.

46
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,150
Wouldn't reporters want to interview me?

47
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,379
Do you think...

48
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:21,349
Sang Ah will ever give you actual work?

49
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,330
She's abusing you
hoping you'll get sick of it and quit.

50
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,490
Will you let her do that forever?

51
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,270
So what?

52
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,509
You eat, sleep, and work here
for 2,000 dollars a month?

53
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,710
She said I'd get room and board,

54
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,550
but she docks my pay for utilities,
taxes, and everything I eat.

55
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:51,150
She even counts
how many bowls of rice I eat.

56
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,060
Someone wants a driver.

57
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,889
No. Sit back down.

58
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,990
What for?

59
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:05,770
Would you consider doing something else?

60
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:07,300
Like what?

61
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:08,669
Well...

62
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:12,710
Like being a housekeeper,
driver, and assistant rolled into one?

63
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:13,969
For how much?

64
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,310
Three thousand dollars?

65
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,110
Or 3,500 dollars?

66
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,680
For real? I'll do it. Where at?

67
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,719
Actually...

68
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,120
It's my place.

69
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,650
- Your place?
- Yes.

70
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,659
My mom is a bit picky.

71
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:33,060
Can you put up with her?

72
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:36,460
She's not picky at all. She's lovely.

73
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,930
She's not.

74
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,169
She's very different at home.

75
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,629
My mom...

76
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:45,569
is feisty and aggressive
at home and in public.

77
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,370
My older sisters are just as bad.

78
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,409
I grew up among them and survived
like a tough weed.

79
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,710
I can put up with anything.

80
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,219
That your family is
feisty and aggressive...

81
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,719
and that they're the fraudsters
involved with Chu Ah's family.

82
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,449
I'd rather you not tell Mom that.

83
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:04,389
She won't accept you if she were to know.

84
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,430
Shall I say I have no family, then?
That I'm an orphan?

85
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,300
Rather than that, since my mom thinks...

86
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,069
a happy family is ideal...

87
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:16,740
Shall I say I grew up like a princess
in a really happy family?

88
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,409
Why do you always go to extremes?

89
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:21,939
What should I say, then?

90
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,180
Let's just say...

91
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:28,449
your family is struggling,
so you're determined to work,

92
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,980
but everyone in your family is well...

93
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,620
and you get along well.

94
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:34,720
That means...

95
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,019
they're ordinary...

96
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:38,189
and very normal.

97
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,629
Okay. I can say that.

98
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,899
About Chu Ah's watch.

99
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:48,829
You didn't take it, did you?

100
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,569
- You bet I didn't.
- Right?

101
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,370
I knew it.

102
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,279
You didn't manage to sell a single house?

103
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:05,649
No.

104
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,490
What if you don't make a single sale...

105
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,519
and end up with zero pay this month?

106
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:11,920
Don't say that, Mom.

107
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,660
I'm home.

108
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,759
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

109
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,029
Did you have a drink again?

110
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,430
I'm home.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,100
You came in one after the other
in quick succession.

112
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,269
What? Oh, we did.

113
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,339
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

114
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,579
I picked up the kids today.

115
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,350
You each owe me ten dollars.

116
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,149
- Okay.
- Right.

117
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,980
Your faces are so red.

118
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,220
Did you drink too, Mr. Homeowner?

119
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,319
- At a team dinner.
- At a team dinner.

120
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,490
I drank with my team...

121
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,230
and he drank with his team.

122
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,029
Our separate companies...

123
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:52,930
- held a welcome dinner for us.
- Yes.

124
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:54,329
I see.

125
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,439
You're both weird.

126
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,610
What are you doing?

127
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,079
Oh, Tae Ri.

128
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,410
- He's here, right?
- Yes.

129
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,420
Tae Ri. Let's go upstairs.

130
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,449
- Dad.
- Yes.

131
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,389
- Mom.
- Yes.

132
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,389
- Bye.
- We'll go upstairs.

133
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,230
Bye, Tae Ri.

134
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,329
- Bye.
- Bye.

135
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,720
You and the homeowner
ate out together, didn't you?

136
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,120
No.

137
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,220
Yes, you did.

138
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:51,660
I smelled the tripe on both of you.

139
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,360
The first diner in the market.

140
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:57,329
The lady there uses a lot of garlic
when she cooks the tripe.

141
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,170
Did you meet by chance?
Or did you go together?

142
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,199
Is there a thing?

143
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:04,399
No.

144
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,139
I'll ask the lady, then.

145
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:09,480
Can you not?

146
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:10,879
We just...

147
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,810
We met by chance
and had one drink together.

148
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:16,980
That's how things start.

149
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,220
Hey. Seduce him.

150
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,220
- What?
- Kyung Ae's mom is eyeing him.

151
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,360
Let's beat her to it
and get the house back.

152
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,529
What are you saying?
He's Jin Sang Ah's husband.

153
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,060
That kind of nonsense...

154
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,329
What did you say?

155
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:33,870
He's Jin Sang Ah's husband?

156
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,199
My gosh. Is that even possible?

157
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:41,209
Of all the houses in Seoul,

158
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:43,209
he bought ours...

159
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:45,439
and moved into the upstairs room,

160
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,279
and he's the psycho's husband?

161
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,449
Yes. That's basically it.

162
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:53,889
My goodness. We're connected
in more ways than one, and it's messy.

163
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,220
Is it?

164
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,290
Hey. Didn't you say...

165
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:02,259
Sang Ah's husband
worked at Jin Architecture too?

166
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,129
Well, yes.

167
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:08,930
That's where your ex Nam Jin works too.

168
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,639
Are you saying all four of you work there?

169
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,379
Don't tell anyone. Not even Mom.

170
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,209
Hey. I'm ashamed and embarrassed too.

171
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,350
We're leeching off
our psycho enemy's ex-husband.

172
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,720
And you're working at this company...

173
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,660
with your ex, his mistress, and her ex.

174
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,990
Who could I tell?

175
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,660
Hey.

176
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:40,029
There's a variety show on TV
where divorced couples live together.

177
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,970
This feels like an expansion of that.

178
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,799
My gosh.

179
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,009
What's wrong with my Nam Jin?

180
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:51,379
How dare she talk like that?

181
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Nam Jin.

182
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:57,419
You'll stay here?

183
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:00,649
Yes. Just for a while.

184
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:02,450
Won't she rent you another apartment?

185
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,590
Goodness.

186
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:08,659
What?

187
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,529
Seon Ju got a job there?

188
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,100
And you were in a video that got out?

189
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,940
Did she lose her mind?

190
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:22,169
Is this her getting revenge?

191
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:24,139
Is she trying to ruin your career?

192
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,379
I should call and get her to...

193
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:27,779
No, Mom. Don't.

194
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,679
I just need you to understand...

195
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,419
why Sang Ah's mother is so angry...

196
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,850
and why she disapproves of us.

197
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,889
Now that you explained the situation,

198
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,059
I see why she was so upset.

199
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,129
I think the thing
she hates the most about me...

200
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,230
is that I was married to Seon Ju.

201
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,840
She wasn't like this when we first met.

202
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,240
But when she heard
who I was married to then,

203
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,909
she said she hated
that I was their son-in-law.

204
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:57,879
That was when she changed.

205
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,710
I understand that feeling completely.

206
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,080
Seon Ju's family had no class or money,

207
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,419
her mom was aggressive,
her older sister was useless,

208
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:08,120
and her younger sister was insane.
They were a mess.

209
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,159
And to think that Seon Ju
barged in there claiming to work,

210
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,360
she would be annoyed.

211
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,759
What should we do now?

212
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,200
I lost some serious points
with your future mother-in-law.

213
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,230
I screamed in her face
and said all sorts of things.

214
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:20,970
How should I make up for it?

215
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,100
Mom.

216
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,769
Don't try to make up for it.

217
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,710
Don't think. Don't do anything.

218
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,509
If you do something,

219
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,009
Seon Ju won't be the only one
ruining my career. You will too.

220
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:33,350
- Don't do anything.
- What?

221
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,509
Darn you.

222
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,649
Please don't do anything, okay?

223
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:52,100
"Clean things up?"

224
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,000
Are your wife and child
things that need to be cleaned up?

225
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,769
You two...

226
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:00,610
are both parents. Aren't you ashamed?

227
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,710
You might have started things
because you wanted to,

228
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:05,509
but I'll end it for you.

229
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:09,279
Once you move out of here,
don't dream of dating Sang Ah again.

230
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,879
I came here to get you to promise.

231
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:35,509
You said you'd visit your dad.
Why didn't you?

232
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,179
Is this about letting Mr. Jeon go?

233
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,320
Seeing that woman he calls "Mom"
made me realize I had to step in.

234
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,279
Didn't seeing her change your mind at all?

235
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,350
"A woman called 'Mom.'"

236
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:51,789
That expression.

237
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,460
Doesn't that describe you too?

238
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:57,000
- What?
- You're not my birth mom.

239
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:00,629
I couldn't get
why you were so abusive to Mr. Jeon.

240
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,000
Because I'm not your daughter,

241
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,700
are you trying to disrupt my happiness?

242
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,169
What nonsense is that?

243
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:11,210
I overheard you and Dad talk.

244
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,250
We're not related.

245
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,279
No. You are my daughter.

246
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,549
How so when we don't share any blood?

247
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,350
What about Dad?

248
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,019
I am Dad's daughter, aren't I?

249
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,519
Tell me what happened.

250
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,029
Is it true that...

251
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:30,259
my birth mother died during childbirth?

252
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:33,200
Whatever others say, you are my daughter.

253
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,100
Look ahead!

254
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,009
What do you mean?

255
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,610
You weren't the one...

256
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:21,909
who saved my father-in-law's life?

257
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,620
Ms. Shim.

258
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:29,090
Help me.

259
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:31,889
Ms. Shim.

260
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,759
Were you in an accident?

261
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:42,470
Oh, dear. It looks bad.

262
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,470
Sir.

263
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:51,240
Hey. Wake up. Open your eyes.

264
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:54,679
Can you help us? She needs help.

265
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:55,950
Wake up.

266
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,950
I was driving, and I crashed the car.

267
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:01,289
Oh, no. Please. Wake up.

268
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,059
- I did all I could to help her.
- Wake up.

269
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:05,460
(Community Clinic)

270
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,860
Ma'am. Wake up.

271
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:09,259
Wake up!

272
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,659
What should we do?

273
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,370
- Get the doctor.
- Okay.

274
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:31,779
She died shortly after you were born.

275
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,590
Your birth mom had died so suddenly.

276
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,690
When I picked you up, I realized...

277
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,090
I couldn't just leave you behind.

278
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,529
From that moment on, you were my blood.

279
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,100
Who cares if we're related or not?

280
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:53,639
You know the lengths I went to
to raise you.

281
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,669
I do.

282
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,480
That's why it's weird.

283
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,009
Were you the sacrificial type
to raise an unrelated kid like your own?

284
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,220
You told me to send Tae Ri away
because it was much harder...

285
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,049
to raise an adoptive kid.

286
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,190
If that was how you thought,
why were you so devoted to me?

287
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,789
You didn't have to try so hard.

288
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,289
I thought about it,

289
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:17,159
and the explanation is
that you wanted to...

290
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:19,870
win Dad over by raising his ex's daughter.

291
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:21,799
That's the only thing.

292
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,940
Did you want Dad's money that badly?

293
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,070
What?

294
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,409
You didn't like So Woo much,

295
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,440
but you seem to hate Nam Jin
with a vengeance.

296
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:36,480
Were you hoping to leave everything
to Chu Ah who's actually yours?

297
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:39,320
What are you talking about?

298
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,190
So Woo wasn't greedy or ambitious,
so you thought you could...

299
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,360
get rid of him by mistreating him.

300
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,590
But if I were to remarry
ambitious Nam Jin,

301
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:49,830
did you get scared we'd take everything?

302
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:51,600
Why would you say that?

303
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,500
You're not my birth mother.

304
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,899
And when you start to object
to what makes me happy...

305
00:15:57,669 --> 00:15:59,669
and what I want to do,

306
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,840
I start to imagine why.

307
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,240
Whether I'm right or wrong,

308
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,009
only time will tell.

309
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:11,820
Sang Ah. Will you please get a grip?

310
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,590
No one is on my side.

311
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:17,220
You just poison Dad's mind
against Nam Jin...

312
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,460
and try to get him
to stop So Woo from divorcing me.

313
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,429
Too bad.

314
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:24,100
So Woo and I already submitted
the divorce papers.

315
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,269
- You did what?
- I want to shower.

316
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:52,919
How long will you put up with it?

317
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,360
Didn't you join to design stuff?

318
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,169
Think about it...

319
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,799
and tell me by tomorrow evening.

320
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:04,970
Okay?

321
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:07,169
Okay.

322
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:10,409
Here. Have another shot.

323
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:12,409
Okay.

324
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,750
Still. It's not right.

325
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,529
Oh, dear.

326
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:59,759
They gossip even now because they
don't get why I'm working with Sang Ah.

327
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:03,059
If I were to join your project,
that would really...

328
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,230
I went from working for
my ex's mistress in the video...

329
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,099
to working for the mistress' ex-husband.

330
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,269
Wouldn't reporters want to interview me?

331
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:15,509
Is it that weird?

332
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,420
(Jin Architecture)

333
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,660
(Head of Interior, Jin Sang Ah)

334
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,599
When are you free
to meet with the Hansung people?

335
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,130
Pick whatever date and time.

336
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,430
What do you mean by that?

337
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,369
What if I do that and you're not free?

338
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,869
Check your schedule
and tell me when you're available.

339
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:52,880
Hansung contacted my team
to ask about handling the project.

340
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,180
You were asked to join only because
they decided to expand their office space.

341
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,420
I was asked to join?

342
00:18:58,349 --> 00:18:59,480
I believe...

343
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:02,019
Hansung demanded I head the project.

344
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:03,720
Even if that was their demand,

345
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,160
they can't object if we say
we put someone else in charge.

346
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,089
The contract doesn't say
that's a deal-breaker.

347
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:11,400
That means I can get you...

348
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:13,470
kicked out of the project.

349
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,470
Do you want to work on it with Mr. Jeon?

350
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,170
Let's do this, then.

351
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,369
Without telling Hansung
we'll switch the person in charge,

352
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,910
you and I can submit
our own proposals for the project.

353
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:28,910
Wouldn't it be fair
to ask the client to choose blindly?

354
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,150
We can put together our own team too.

355
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:32,519
I'm here.

356
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:35,150
You asked me to get...

357
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,319
the jacket you left to be altered.

358
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:41,460
Okay. I'll think about it.

359
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,769
He should do as I say.
What's there to think about?

360
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,809
Don't just stand there. Clean my office.

361
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:57,039
Okay.

362
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,309
Watch your step.

363
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,880
Don't you have work?

364
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,789
A lot of my scenes got cut.

365
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,720
That's one bad thing
about getting rid of that witch.

366
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:13,789
Who's "that witch?"

367
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:16,160
This girl who can't act
to save her life...

368
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,829
got fired for stealing.

369
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:35,349
My gosh.

370
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:37,480
Hello.

371
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,819
Oh, hey. Goodness.

372
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,890
What are you doing here?

373
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:48,829
Son.

374
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,299
Did you tell her to come here?

375
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:54,799
- Yes. We need a housekeeper.
- What?

376
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,000
You said she was strong and amiable.

377
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,069
She'd be perfect to put to work.

378
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,210
How could you make the call
without talking to me...

379
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,170
You told me to find someone.

380
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:05,509
So I did. Why are you complaining now?

381
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:07,450
- Sit down.
- Okay.

382
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:13,390
It looks like just anyone can do the work,
but helpers have their expertise.

383
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,390
More than anything,

384
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,460
is a young girl patient enough to stay on?

385
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:21,259
The older people you hired
weren't that more patient.

386
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,299
We must make something very clear,

387
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,730
so I must ask point-blank.

388
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,430
Why did you have Chu Ah's watch?

389
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,670
- She didn't take it.
- Are you her spokesperson?

390
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,500
You be quiet.

391
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:35,809
He's right. I swear I didn't take it.

392
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:38,779
I grew up in an incredibly happy family...

393
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:40,480
with a hungry spirit for work.

394
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:43,210
My mom is sweet and kind
and my dad is at sea.

395
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:44,819
My sisters are married...

396
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:48,150
and are living happily
without any feuds or breakups.

397
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,990
- What?
- Would you believe...

398
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,059
that our neighbors call us
the honey house?

399
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:54,890
Everyone is sweet and happy.

400
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,529
We need to talk.

401
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:03,400
My gosh.

402
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,109
Get over here.

403
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:13,710
I don't have a good feeling about this.

404
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,309
We have lots of valuables,

405
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:19,519
and I leave cash and credit cards
all over the place.

406
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:21,549
If you know that,
it's time to put them away.

407
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,549
How dare you?

408
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,460
Can we let her move in
without a thorough background check?

409
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:29,730
What if she's a spy
working with the press?

410
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,829
What if she's a fraud?

411
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:35,630
People don't stick around
because you're so negative.

412
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,500
I barely got her to take the job,

413
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,869
so don't make her run away.

414
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,339
You're being weird. Do you...

415
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,240
have feelings for her?

416
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:48,779
What do you think of me?

417
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:50,450
I have eyes and standards too.

418
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:58,359
Man Eun.

419
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:00,559
Did you ask your homeowner?

420
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,890
No. If you came to ask, you can get lost.

421
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,259
Do you think
I don't know what you're up to?

422
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:06,599
What am I up to?

423
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,930
You want Kyung Ae to marry my homeowner
so you can take this house.

424
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:11,269
What are you on about?

425
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:13,970
Kyung Ae has a house of her own.

426
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,980
My gosh. I'd have him move into her house.

427
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,839
I'd never let Kyung Ae move into this one.

428
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,779
- Is that true?
- Shall I sign something?

429
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:26,180
That means you can
keep this house to yourself.

430
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,950
And Seon Ju too.
I'll find her a new husband.

431
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,690
She got divorced.

432
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,529
She should marry
a much better guy than her ex.

433
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,259
He might have dumped her,

434
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:41,200
but if he hears she's getting remarried,
he'll wallow in regret.

435
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,369
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

436
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:54,609
Who cares if we're related or not?

437
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,480
You know the lengths I went to
to raise you.

438
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:01,950
No way.

439
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,920
How is that not important?

440
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,619
I was asked to join?

441
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:10,029
I believe Hansung demanded
I head the project.

442
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:14,799
Darn it.

443
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:23,170
I went to the printer's.
They told me to come for it tomorrow.

444
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,079
Goodness.

445
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,920
Here.

446
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,450
What shall I do now?

447
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,789
How about you get out of my way?

448
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,329
I have so much to think about
other than you.

449
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:43,799
So get out of my sight.

450
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,200
You told me that this was my seat.

451
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,099
Where could I go?

452
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,609
I signed a one-year deal...

453
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:57,740
and I'm going to stick to it.

454
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,079
Shall I go out
and do some market research?

455
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,990
Stand up. Let's take care of you first.

456
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,470
Shoot.

457
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:32,309
(Team Leader's Office, Jin Sang Ah)

458
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,509
Where are we going?

459
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:37,380
To the Ventilation Room
to organize storage.

460
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,750
The Ventilation Room?

461
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,460
Don't push me.

462
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,690
Let go.

463
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:51,099
Why are you so violent?

464
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,869
(Authorized Personnel Only)

465
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,170
- Get in here.
- What is this place?

466
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:03,640
Clean this room up...

467
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,380
and organize those shelves.

468
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:07,809
This room?

469
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,849
Why should I clean this room?

470
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:11,180
If you don't want to, quit.

471
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:16,519
What time is it?

472
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,460
No. I'll do it.

473
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,670
Let's see...

474
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,890
Hey!

475
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,849
Hey!

476
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,359
You're not leaving, are you?

477
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,019
Hey!

478
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,470
Hello?

479
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,740
I'm locked up in here!

480
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,369
Can you let me out?

481
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,490
What's that?

482
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,789
Oh, my gosh.

483
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
There's a light?

484
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:56,289
I can't see anything.

485
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
Oh, dear.

486
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,500
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

487
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,549
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

488
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,960
Seon Ju will admit defeat and leave soon.

489
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:06,390
You didn't aggravate her, did you?

490
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,589
Jin Sang Ah, I'll kill you for this!

491
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:09,759
Darn you!

492
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,400
Did you see the locket that was here?

493
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:14,170
I don't know about a locket.

494
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:15,670
You dropped something.

495
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:17,339
Do you know where Ms. Pi is?

496
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,970
Ms. Jin took her...

497
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,809
to the Ventilation Room to clean it up.

498
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:22,009
You just sit by and watch.

499
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,279
