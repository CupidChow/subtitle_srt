1
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,090
The CEO wants to see me?

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,219
(Episode 45)

3
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:13,229
What for?

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,460
(Team Leader's Office, Kim So Woo)

5
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:40,519
Come in.

6
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:51,330
- Take a seat.
- Okay.

7
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:00,909
Ms. Pi Seon Ju.

8
00:01:01,669 --> 00:01:03,479
I don't want my company...

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,909
to be reduced to a laughingstock.

10
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,580
I want you to leave.

11
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:16,819
I'll pay you a year's salary.
Please do as I ask.

12
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,560
I'm not sure how to phrase this.

13
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:27,569
I'm not used to speaking with a CEO.

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,610
I don't know if I can
get my thoughts across clearly.

15
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,409
But I'd like you to see I'm sincere.

16
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,519
I've been struggling a great deal lately
with many things.

17
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:51,959
But Mr. Kim thought highly of my skills...

18
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,489
and got me back into the design field.

19
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,530
Ever since I was young,

20
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,129
I enjoyed creating pretty spaces
that also felt comfortable...

21
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,899
that made people happy.

22
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,039
I ended up here
because I was able to do that.

23
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,050
I didn't join the company
to spread rumors...

24
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,319
or to get revenge.

25
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,890
But now that you, the CEO,

26
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,489
are asking me in person to leave...

27
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,959
I don't think it's right to stay on.

28
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:34,600
I'll do as you wish.

29
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,640
Goodbye.

30
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,689
She acted like she'd stutter,

31
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:56,890
but she spoke just fine.

32
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:10,839
Where were you at? You have a lot to do.

33
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:16,439
What is it? Is something wrong?

34
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:22,050
What should I do with this desk?

35
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,350
I only used it for one day.

36
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:27,420
Can it be returned?

37
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,290
What?

38
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,660
The CEO asked you to resign?

39
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,429
Yes.

40
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,369
I joined the company
my ex-husband works at...

41
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,899
who happens to be
his daughter's affair partner.

42
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:48,739
I get he's doing what he can
for his daughter's sake.

43
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,380
The company he established...

44
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,209
is now the center of attention
of people who love to gossip.

45
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:57,320
He won't want to be humiliated.

46
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,920
I totally understand.

47
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:06,130
My time with this place
has come to an end.

48
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,660
After I survived and got this far.

49
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,499
Right?

50
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:15,469
Wait.

51
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:16,899
Just a moment.

52
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,600
Wait here.

53
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,059
Sir. I'd like to speak with you
for a minute.

54
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,329
About what?

55
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:43,499
I heard you asked Ms. Pi to resign.

56
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:46,629
I can't give people
more reason to gossip about us.

57
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,840
That will die down. It just takes time.

58
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,270
Please trust what I see in her.

59
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:54,809
Are you sure
you have no feelings for her...

60
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,639
when you vouch for her
and defend her like this?

61
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,939
Yes.

62
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,110
She's on the Hansung project
as my team designer,

63
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:04,079
and we already got to work.

64
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,050
If we change everything now for this,
people will only talk even more.

65
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,819
Let her stay on
at least until this project is over.

66
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:14,960
Please, sir.

67
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:37,980
He said no, didn't he?

68
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:49,389
Hello?

69
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,530
So Woo.

70
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:53,199
For as long as you work with her,

71
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,970
are you confident
you won't humiliate me or my company?

72
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,739
Yes, I am.

73
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:03,579
Okay, then. Make sure
no one has reason to mock us again.

74
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,179
I'll see how you both do on this project.

75
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:09,009
Okay. Thank you.

76
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,730
Was that the CEO? What did he say?

77
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,629
It's done.

78
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:24,660
You can work on the project.

79
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:28,129
Can I really? My gosh.

80
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,499
He really is a great man.

81
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:33,069
He looked nice too.

82
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,910
It looks like...

83
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,340
I climbed all the necessary mountains
to get a job here,

84
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,579
so I'll work really hard.

85
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:42,350
I'll quench the gossip...

86
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,780
with my fiery passion.

87
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,420
- Are you confident?
- Yes.

88
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,319
Why are you so confident?

89
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,660
I don't know
where the confidence comes from,

90
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,129
but I have it.

91
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,100
(Hospital)

92
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:14,009
Woo Sang. You work this afternoon, right?

93
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,319
Where are you right now?

94
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,249
I'm at home. Why?

95
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:19,449
Woo Sang.

96
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:22,319
I fainted and now I'm in the hospital.

97
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,290
I must've been overworked.
I was walking along...

98
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,629
Go elsewhere while I clean the room.

99
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:34,129
My room is not that dirty.

100
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:36,569
It still has to be vacuumed.

101
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:39,610
Does Pi Mi Ju come into your bedroom?

102
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,639
What? Yes.

103
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,679
- Why?
- And that T-shirt.

104
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:45,939
Take it off. You wore that for days.

105
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:48,879
It's not that dirty.

106
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:52,920
What did you say?

107
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,020
Forget it. Bye.

108
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:57,020
I wish I could barge in there.

109
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,860
I can.

110
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,100
I went to where he lived
and asked for a cup of tea.

111
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:05,499
I can do the same.

112
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,929
She lives there.

113
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:17,480
I showed you every available place
in the neighborhood.

114
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,679
If you don't like any of them,
you can't buy a place here.

115
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,679
This neighborhood.

116
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:27,619
It's so hilly. Even if they build
an apartment complex,

117
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:31,119
it'll have so many levels
that it won't look that pretty.

118
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:34,030
It is a bit hilly for a residential area,

119
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,030
but global warming is a huge issue.

120
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:39,970
The sea level is rising,

121
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,900
and most places will end up underwater.

122
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,439
Only hilly areas like this will survive.

123
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,109
That's pretty plausible.

124
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,280
Is that what you expected me to say?

125
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,209
Back when we were in school and even now,
you still have such weird logic.

126
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:57,420
I always beat you in debate class.

127
00:08:57,949 --> 00:08:59,349
You did not.

128
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,890
Your memory is all wrong.

129
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:05,819
Are you serious
about investing in property?

130
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:07,459
You bet I am.

131
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,729
Why else would I spend
my precious time to come here?

132
00:09:10,929 --> 00:09:13,569
Then which place
did you like the most? Name one.

133
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:14,900
Well...

134
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,640
Let me think about it some more.

135
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,069
Come back only after you're done thinking.

136
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,939
Hey.

137
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,150
You always try to take back
what you offered. That's not nice.

138
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,849
Thanks for that.

139
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:41,490
Does he come here to taunt me?

140
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,670
The most important task...

141
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,069
is to create a nice showroom.

142
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:55,410
To make sure
Hansung's signature chandelier pops,

143
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,679
we must decide what approach to take.

144
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,380
It must be as flashy as possible.

145
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,219
So people feel it's a successful company
the moment they step inside.

146
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,650
They must feel overpowered.

147
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:09,550
That sounds good.

148
00:10:10,719 --> 00:10:11,890
Where are you going?

149
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,459
- To the men's room.
- Okay.

150
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:22,229
Our final court date.

151
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:24,540
Be sure to come.

152
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,439
Don't back out at the last minute.

153
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,540
Why would I back out?
I really hope you don't.

154
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,979
I'd love to sue you both
and get a hefty alimony and compensation,

155
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:41,550
but you need to know I'm holding back
with the grand intention...

156
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,990
of not causing any more trouble
for the company.

157
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,530
What? Alimony?

158
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,059
My gosh.

159
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:53,270
Do you still think
I provided the cause for our divorce?

160
00:10:54,099 --> 00:10:56,270
What are you on about?

161
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,770
You went on a blind date.

162
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,510
- What?
- You proudly gave an interview too.

163
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,309
That man is perfect for you.

164
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:06,750
- What?
- You called me all sorts of things...

165
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,179
for having an affair.

166
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:12,150
Why did you go on a blind date
even before our divorce was final?

167
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:14,050
My goodness.

168
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,459
It's unbelievable.

169
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,359
What the...

170
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:22,229
My gosh.

171
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,130
Darn it.

172
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,569
Shoot.

173
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,479
Hey. Why didn't you blur my face?

174
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,910
You said you would.

175
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,410
I asked the editor to blur your face,

176
00:11:41,609 --> 00:11:45,280
but usually, agreeing to an interview
means you agree to show your face.

177
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,150
So I think the guy forgot.

178
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:49,959
How could he forget something like that?

179
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:52,160
This is such a mess.

180
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:54,929
You looked pretty good on camera.

181
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:56,599
You're photogenic.

182
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:59,729
That's not the point of my call.

183
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,670
I'll make an official complaint
to your TV station...

184
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,270
Then the editor will lose his job.

185
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:09,510
He made a similar mistake once before.

186
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,780
His second child was just born too.

187
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,949
Can't we just blur your face
in the reruns?

188
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,319
What's the point
when everyone has seen it...

189
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,660
Just do it now.

190
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,859
Darn it.

191
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,140
Are you done vacuuming?

192
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,050
Yes. I'm about to
steam-clean the floor now.

193
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,079
I'll just mop the stairs before I do that.

194
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,250
Okay.

195
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,520
Who could that be?

196
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:56,890
- Go and see.
- Okay.

197
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,589
Ms. Oh.

198
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,660
Hey. How did you get in?

199
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,099
The door was open.

200
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,599
Did Mr. Jang not shut it on the way out?

201
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,069
Why are you here?

202
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:11,099
To eat this with Woo Sang
then go to work together.

203
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:13,370
- Where is he?
- Woo Sang?

204
00:13:14,609 --> 00:13:15,740
Woo Sang!

205
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:17,809
Woo Sang!

206
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:20,910
Woo Sang! Come downstairs!

207
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:22,479
You found your calling.

208
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,050
He can't hear me. Can you go get him?

209
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,189
Okay.

210
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,000
Mr. Jeong.

211
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:41,729
Mr. Jeong. Come outside.

212
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,839
- What is it?
- Jin Chu Ah is here.

213
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,569
What for?

214
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,339
She brought a pizza to share with you.

215
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,609
Why on earth...

216
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:55,449
Let's go.

217
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:35,550
What's wrong? What happened?

218
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,890
Nothing happened.

219
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,660
Why did Chu Ah scream, then?

220
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:41,260
I don't know.

221
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,000
She startled me.

222
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:47,630
Goodness.

223
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,640
Hansung's CEO's priority...

224
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,780
was the showroom.

225
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,949
Yes.

226
00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:06,250
You said he wanted
their signature chandelier to stand out.

227
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,920
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

228
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:12,920
- Hello?
- Someone is here to see you.

229
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,729
Who is it?

230
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,770
My gosh.

231
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,550
Hey. Why don't you take my calls?

232
00:15:35,849 --> 00:15:37,550
What are you doing here?

233
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,189
Did you get a job here
to bother my Nam Jin?

234
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,359
Come with me.

235
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,520
Yes or no?

236
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:48,160
- Get in here.
- Don't push me.

237
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,859
- You're embarrassing me.
- Am I?

238
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,770
Take a look at this.

239
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,069
You even introduced her to your mother.

240
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:05,179
I hope your well-educated witch...

241
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,010
Did you cause a fuss at the salon?

242
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,750
Nam Jin aged a good few years
because of you.

243
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,349
You never know how things might pan out.

244
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,620
Nam Jin might change his mind
and go back to you.

245
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:20,859
Don't you give up on that hope.

246
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,689
But if you wish for that,

247
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,059
you shouldn't go around doing this.

248
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,670
- Mother.
- A friend who saw this called me...

249
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,400
to ask if this were you and Nam Jin.

250
00:16:30,469 --> 00:16:32,740
I was too embarrassed to say yes,

251
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:35,209
but then I saw you on the news
on the blind date.

252
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,740
She'd seen that too.

253
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,979
Everyone is asking...

254
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:40,280
if you left him over an affair
and scored a new date.

255
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,819
You said some pretty harsh things here.

256
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:46,920
You just have to watch the clip once
and it stays with you.

257
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,449
It's humiliating.

258
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,189
If you're doing this to win Nam Jin back,

259
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:53,260
you're using the wrong tactic.

260
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,459
How sick of you would he be after this?

261
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,099
He can't go back to you
even if he wants to.

262
00:16:58,099 --> 00:16:59,559
You dug your own grave.

263
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,270
Mother. No, wait.

264
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,400
You're no longer my mother-in-law.

265
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,770
Ms. Wang.

266
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,880
I wanted to live in peace and quiet.

267
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,809
I didn't want to
remain in everyone's memory.

268
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,119
All this happened
because of what your son did,

269
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,119
so go and complain to him.

270
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,720
Look at you.

271
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,819
I'm trying to help you out.

272
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,790
You should say, "Yes, thank you."

273
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,859
I defended you a lot, you know.

274
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:32,260
I said you might be dull,
but at least you weren't a schemer.

275
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:35,099
But now you're talking right back at me.

276
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:39,569
You dress pretty nicely for someone
who sleeps on a friend's couch.

277
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,639
You even set up a karaoke machine.

278
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,149
- How do you know that?
- I'm busy.

279
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:49,680
Don't come to see me
over this issue again.

280
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:50,950
Seon Ju.

281
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,790
Why would you be busy?

282
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,819
All you can do here is make coffee
and sweep the floor.

283
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,419
Could you be busier than Nam Jin?

284
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,399
I even got
the CEO's clearance to work here.

285
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,300
I have a job here...

286
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,200
and I'm treated as an equal to your son.

287
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:14,040
I happen to have this with me.

288
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:16,879
Here. Do you see this?

289
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:19,879
It's my business card.

290
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:21,909
It's for you to look at,

291
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:24,950
not to contact me, so just look at it.

292
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:29,990
Push the chair in before you leave.

293
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,629
My gosh. What got into her?

294
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,659
Why did she change so much?

295
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,230
My word.

296
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,440
(Pi Seon Ju, Design Team,
Design Assistant)

297
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,839
Grandma, you got a letter.

298
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,280
A letter?

299
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:55,879
It's from Auntie Mi Ju.

300
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,050
Is it?

301
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:07,230
Mom. How are you doing?

302
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:10,460
Are my sisters and the kids doing well?

303
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,629
I'm crazy busy with work.

304
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:16,430
I'm working and living hard,
so don't worry about me.

305
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,270
I'll make lots of money...

306
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,240
and get back the house
you lost because of me.

307
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,379
I won't come home before I can do that.

308
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:26,480
Pretend I don't exist.

309
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,450
Don't age too much until I come home.

310
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:31,079
Don't die.

311
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,589
What does this mean?

312
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,790
It feels weird.

313
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,460
Wasn't she on a business trip?

314
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,020
Maybe not.
It sounded more like she left home.

315
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,059
She left home?

316
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,530
Dong Won. Call your aunt.

317
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,599
Hurry.

318
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,970
Don't expect anything from me.

319
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,609
How can I not?

320
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:57,079
You're my only hope.

321
00:19:57,139 --> 00:19:59,180
Chu Ah. You need to sound desperate.

322
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,010
Don't call me, Mom.

323
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,180
I put everything in the letter.

324
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,220
You.

325
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,550
She won't pick up.

326
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:09,649
What?

327
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:13,589
Why are you still here?

328
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,329
Give me the phone.

329
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,500
Text her.

330
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:21,230
"Where are you right now?"

331
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:23,000
Where are you...

332
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,109
Mournfully, with teary eyes.

333
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,480
I'm on set. I'm working.

334
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:33,809
"What work do you do on set?"

335
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:35,649
"I want proof you're there."

336
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,879
Proof...

337
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:39,950
Woo Sang, cue.

338
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,589
Don't expect anything from me.

339
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:46,059
How can I not?

340
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:48,030
You're my only hope.

341
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,359
Mournfully, with teary eyes.

342
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,530
Okay. Keep going.

343
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:54,629
Let's shoot while they're in character.

344
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,540
Don't expect anything from me.

345
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,440
How can I not?

346
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,669
You're my only hope.

347
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:03,470
Give me that.

348
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:07,879
Hey.

349
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,980
Do you think she was kidnapped?

350
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,119
This is what kidnappers record
to send to the victim's family.

351
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,290
Poor Auntie.

352
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:19,490
Send her another text.

353
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,829
"Send a photo that shows your face."

354
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:25,930
"Send a photo that shows your face."

355
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:27,669
- Action.
- Darn it.

356
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:31,139
Don't expect anything from me.

357
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,440
How can I not?

358
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:36,710
You're my only hope.

359
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:41,010
Okay. Cut.

360
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:43,210
That was good.

361
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,879
Okay? Now stop calling.

362
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Good. Let's move on.

363
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:11,940
Has she gained some weight?

364
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,980
It doesn't look like
she's locked up, right?

365
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,980
No.

366
00:22:18,349 --> 00:22:20,649
When will she be more mature?

367
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,450
What does that mean?

368
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,220
It means to think like an adult too.

369
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,760
What happens then?

370
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,589
Then she'll be like a grown-up
and not like a headless chicken.

371
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:30,700
My gosh.

372
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,599
Do you want fried chicken?

373
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,930
- Yes!
- Yes!

374
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,069
Goodness. Okay. I'll order you one soon.

375
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:39,399
I can't order one right now
when I don't know...

376
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:42,069
how your aunt is doing. Don't laugh.

377
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,609
What should I do about her?

378
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,020
- Did you have a good day?
- Yes.

379
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,490
What about the new hire?

380
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,990
I talked to her in person.

381
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,059
I don't think
she'll cause the company any harm.

382
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,030
She's brazen but honest and sincere too.

383
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:09,129
I can see why So Woo recommended her.

384
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,300
What did you decide to do?

385
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,970
I'll watch how she does.

386
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,809
You can't let her stay
when people are laughing at us.

387
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,780
Don't you care how Sang Ah feels?

388
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,349
You need to stay neutral
and do the right thing.

389
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,119
Do you want
So Woo and Sang Ah to reconcile...

390
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,490
or are you getting in the way?

391
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,260
If they're meant to reconcile,
they will even if we get in the way.

392
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,359
If we do anything,
it might actually backfire.

393
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,990
Even so.

394
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,829
It might seem weird and silly to others,

395
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:41,569
but Sang Ah started it
by having an affair.

396
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,200
It felt wrong and even worse
to ask the new hire to quit.

397
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,470
I need to shower.

398
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,710
Okay.

Are you both present?

- Yes.
- Yes.

402
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,700
Have you truly and honestly decided
to get divorced?

403
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,059
- Yes, I have.
- Yes, I have.

404
00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:15,669
You have one underage child.

405
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,200
The mother Pi Seon Ju
gets custody and parental rights.

406
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:21,270
On the last day of each month,
the father pays 1,000 dollars...

407
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:22,510
for child support.

408
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,639
Is that correct?

409
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,809
- Yes, it is.
- Yes.

410
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,280
I hereby confirm
you both consent to a divorce.

412
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,089
Only one of us has to submit it.

413
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,430
I'll do it. I don't trust you.

414
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,129
I'll hand it in right now.

415
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,559
Okay.

416

We can date proudly now, can't we?

427
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:06,809
There was no reason
not to be proud before,

428
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,809
but we're free now.

430

I wanted to get you something
that would suit you.

From now on,

432
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,040
you can become a man that suits me.

433
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,379
Okay.

434
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,980
I'll do that.

435
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,149
Hey, what's that?

436

What's this?

437
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:58,760
Give me your hand.

438
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,899
I wanted to...

439
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,700
celebrate too.

440
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:09,510

441
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:12,740
