(Episode 5)

2
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:16,050
- What?
- Seon Ju. It's me.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,609
What? An accident.

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,650
Who drove into whom? You or them?

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,560
Just you wait.

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,560
I need to go out.

7
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,360
Why? Was Mi Ju in an accident?

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,700
What will you do?

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,870
This car is one
of only four of its kind in Korea.

10
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,109
Do you know how much it's worth?

11
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,130
Say something. What will you do?

12
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,130
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,300
Hey!

14
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:08,929
Darn you.

15
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,539
What happened?

16
00:01:15,669 --> 00:01:16,770
Are you the car owner?

17
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,839
There's the owner of this car.

18
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,949
Darn you.

19
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,530
Pi Seon Ju?

20
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:37,890
Jin Sang Ah?

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,929
- Don't touch it.
- Why not?

22
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:44,429
Hurry up.

23
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:46,240
- Don't touch it.
- Why not?

24
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,440
What the heck is that?

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,970
- Hey.
- That's bad.

26
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,509
Girls. Come in and take your seats.

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,009
Be quiet, everyone.

28
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,509
At the National High School Art Contest,

29
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:58,509
Pi Seon Ju came first.

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,190
Congratulations.

31
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,059
The extra points should help you get
into art school.

32
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,459
Well done, Pi Seon Ju.

33
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,699
Applause.

34
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,600
Did you hear that?
I'm going to study art.

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,500
Don't get too carried away.

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,410
There's still the KSAT and practical exam.

37
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,069
- Keep at it.
- I will.

38
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:25,069
Applause.

39
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,710
- Yes.
- Yes.

40
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,280
My gosh.

41
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:35,150
I'm so jealous.

42
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:38,889
I'd say Jin Sang Ah had it coming.

43
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:41,060
Right. All that bragging,
but she didn't get anything...

44
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,530
for participating at all.

45
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,560
Hey.

46
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:45,699
What did you just say?

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,630
What?

48
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,329
Guys. Wait for me!

49
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,400
First Place Pi Seon Ju. Let's go.

50
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:53,870
You should treat us.

51
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,400
- Treat us.
- Treat us.

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,539
I'm too poor to treat you.

53
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:59,109
How about banana-flavored milk?

54
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:00,180
- Deal!
- Deal!

55
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,880
Sang Ah, are you in?

56
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,210
- No.
- No?

57
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:06,319
- Let's go.
- Let's.

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,549
First Place.
I guarantee you'll be crazy successful.

59
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:12,460
Do you see the future?

60
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,720
I'm serious.
You'll succeed in something one day.

61
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,889
Let's see if my palm says the same!

62
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,900
You don't look...

63
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,609
that successful.

64
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,340
What do you mean?

65
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,079
Is that my phone?

66
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:45,419
So this is how we meet again.

67
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:46,419
I know, right?

68
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:47,919
We haven't met since we graduated.

69
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,460
How long has it been?

70
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,630
Long time no see.

71
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:52,600
So this car...

72
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,829
You went to school together?

73
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,699
- Were you close?
- I doubt it.

74
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,269
She recognized you right away.

75
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,940
Whatever.

76
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:04,310
You.

77
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,910
What happened?

78
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,449
I don't know.

79
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,810
You were driving.
How can you not know?

80
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:15,180
Who drove into who? You or her?
Was the car going forward or backward?

81
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,120
How did the accident happen?
You should know that!

82
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,389
Well, actually...

83
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,530
I must've dozed off.

84
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,329
Are you out of your mind?

85
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,570
She drove into me.

86
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,239
She was reversing.

87
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,200
Your dashcam was broken.

88
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,470
It must've been the crash.

89
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,179
That was her too.

90
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,239
Are you sure about that?

91
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,039
You didn't cause it?

92
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:44,679
I'm sure. Would I lie?

93
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:56,030
Did you talk about it?

94
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,530
Your car reversed into mine.
What will you do now?

95
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:03,100
Let's see your dashcam video.

96
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,369
It malfunctioned when the cars crashed.

97
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:07,939
Your car reversed into mine.
What more is there to say?

98
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,710
Am I wrong?

99
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,739
If you really want to figure it out,

100
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,109
let's see your dashcam footage.

101
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,179
I don't have a dashboard camera.

102
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:22,520
Are you even insured?

103
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,820
You bet I am.

104
00:05:24,549 --> 00:05:25,720
My neck.

105
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,359
It hurts so much.

106
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,400
Okay. I won't tell your dad for now.

107
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:38,369
Text me when it's sorted out.

108
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,739
Okay, bye.

109
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,320
Honey.

110
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,390
Do I know any police officers?

111
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,289
What is this about?

112
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,590
Just in case.

113
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,200
What do you mean "just in case?"
What's going on?

114
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,229
You don't know anyone, then?

115
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,999
I'm not saying I don't.

116
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:14,400
I'm asking if we need the police's help.

117
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,239
No, we don't. Bye.

118
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:29,020
You won't go out tonight, will you?

119
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,249
I'll be staying at home whatever happens.

120
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,059
My day has been rotten so far.

121
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,090
Don't worry and go straight home.

122
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,929
Okay, Woo Sang. Bye.

123
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,100
Mom.

124
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:46,439
What happened?

125
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:48,799
Stuff happened. Don't ask.

126
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:49,910
What happened?

127
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,609
I feel humiliated.

128
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:53,879
What on earth happened?
Who did this to you?

129
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:57,450
I went up a mountain to gather herbs
and a snake chased me.

130
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,549
A snake?

131
00:06:58,609 --> 00:06:59,820
And why were you gathering herbs?

132
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,320
Enough of that talking.

133
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,950
Take off that cap.

134
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,820
I can't stand snakes.

135
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,260
I'll kill them all.

136
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,760
Their insurance could cover it,

137
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,929
but they insisted
on filing a police report.

138
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:15,059
Let's check the nearby CCTV cameras.

139
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,169
Once I'm sure
my sister drove into their car,

140
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:20,200
then we'll compensate them somehow.

141
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:23,039
We sent some officers to check.
Let's wait for news.

142
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,840
They had to go out to check
the guilty party's claim.

143
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,539
You officers must have time to kill.

144
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:30,749
Hey.

145
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:34,020
Okay. Good job. Bye.

146
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,660
There are no CCTV cameras
focusing on that area.

147
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:43,660
If you reverse into a parked car,

148
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,530
it's 100 percent your fault, right?

149
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:46,929
If that's what happened, yes.

150
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:49,669
That's what happened.
My car was parked.

151
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,299
That ratty old car reversed
with a whole trunk full of stuff.

152
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:53,939
No wonder she couldn't see.

153
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:55,640
That's why she bumped into my car.

154
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,410
If she can't reverse,
she should've attached a rear-view camera.

155
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:01,510
That means it's all on you.
It's your fault.

156
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,549
Wasn't there another person in that car?

157
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,749
Who do you mean?

158
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:10,789
And what if there were?
Does that make me the guilty one?

159
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:13,419
You're just trying to get out of this.

160
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:16,530
My neck's aching again.

161
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,999
You should at least show some remorse
for causing an accident.

162
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:22,700
Don't you know you should apologize first?

163
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,840
Or do you not know how to apologize?

164
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,809
Then the car owner should instead.

166
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,249
Are you okay?

167
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:44,749
Go to the store if you need herbs.

168
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,119
Goodness.

169
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,899
Who knows what she'd do with this?

170
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,430
Jin Chu Ah can't be trusted.

171
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:01,869
Let's practice my lines.

172
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,680
Oh, dear.

174
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,879
"Not a thing."

(Traffic Investigations Team 1)

178
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,029
There's nothing I can do
if she has reversed into a parked car.

179
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,999
Your policy only covers up to
20,000 dollars worth of property damage.

180
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,399
Just a paint job on that car...

181
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,570
How much is that?

182
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,109
It was imported from the UK,
and it's not just the car.

183
00:09:39,109 --> 00:09:41,909
Stuff that fell out of your car
scratched the hood too.

Repairs might cost
60,000 to 70,000 dollars.

185
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:46,180
The dashcam's broken,

186
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,790
and you have to rent her a similar car,
so it'll be a huge headache.

187
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,350
Then... What...

188
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,220
How am I to cover that?

189
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,430
We'll pay the maximum of 20,000 dollars,

190
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,659
but you must cover the rest.

191
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,869
What if we can't?

192
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,940
It's such a big amount.

193
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,340
The other driver said she hurt her neck.

194
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,310
If she gets a doctor's note,
that means you injured a person too.

195
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,879
If you don't settle today,

196
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,320
your sister might be detained.

197
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,879
Detained?

198
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,489
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

199
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:28,859
Okay.

200
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:30,889
Hey.

201
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,499
The repair will cost 55,000 dollars.

202
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,700
Fifty-five grand?

203
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:37,600
That's less than 60,000 dollars.

204
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,100
Let's see. 55,000 minus 20,000 is...

205
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:41,940
It's 35,000 dollars.

206
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,739
Hey.

207
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,749
There's this repair shop I go to.

208
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,350
It's not that legitimate,

209
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,379
but they do a fantastic paint job.

210
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:57,690
They cover any blemish
as if it were never...

211
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,749
No.

212
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:02,489
I'll send my car to an official garage
managed by the head office.

213
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:05,930
It's not that far from here. It's right...

214
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,529
No, wait. Let's...

215
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:09,670
- Hello?
- Let's go and ask...

216
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:11,930
Yes?

217
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,970
What now?

218
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,869
(Human rights, Impartiality, Kindness)

219
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,509
I'm scared, Seon Ju.

220
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:27,249
Why did you go and do that?

221
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:29,279
I was so tired.

222
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,759
Then you should've parked to take a nap.
Why did you keep driving?

223
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,690
That's not the issue right now.

224
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:37,759
Your insurance covers just 20,000 dollars.

225
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,560
The total is 55,000 dollars.

226
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,529
What if she gets a doctor's note
for her sore neck too?

227
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:42,529
What are we going to do?

228
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:44,470
We have no money.

229
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:49,710
Seon Ju. What happens
if we run off without paying?

230
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,440
What?

231
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:53,979
Shall we do a runner?

232
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,180
Let's go.

233
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,649
What are you doing?

234
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:00,479
I'm going to the toilet.

235
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,080
The toilet's over here.

236
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,889
I'll get some fresh air too.

237
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,960
- Where is she going?
- Hey...

238
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,930
I happened to record you two talk.

239
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:14,259
She dozed off behind the wheel,

240
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:15,859
and she's trying to run away?

241
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:18,600
That's not what she meant.

242
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,170
Pi Mi Ju, get back here!

243
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,540
Detective, the culprit's trying to flee.

244
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,040
- Okay. Where are you?
- Get back here right now!

245
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,279
- She went that way.
- Stop!

246
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:31,009
They run so fast.

247
00:12:32,109 --> 00:12:33,149
Darn it.

248
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,290
She lost her mind and talked gibberish.
Why would she run away?

249
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,659
We will pay for the repairs. We must.

250
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,930
When someone's in a situation
that's so overwhelming...

251
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,859
that they think they can't handle it,

252
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:50,129
they want to just get away.

253
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:51,930
To avoid the situation.

254
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,570
I'm sure you had that experience.
Can you say you didn't?

255
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,139
"We have no money."

256
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:00,580
"What happens if we run off
without paying?" That shows intent.

257
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,850
Stop haggling with us
and get the money and settle the bill.

258
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,680
She did actually run away too.

259
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,749
She went to the toilet.

260
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,920
Why did you say that?
Do you even have a brain?

261
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,519
What's wrong with you?

262
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,759
I'm scared.

263
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,930
And I really need to pee.

264
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,359
You just claimed you went to the toilet.

265
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:22,560
Go on home.

266
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:27,170
- What now?
- Seon Ju!

267
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,440
Seon Ju! Take me with you!

268
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,479
I need to make it really clear.
It wasn't me. I'm a victim.

269
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,509
Then we just pay them right back.

270
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,649
What?

271
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:43,450
The car in the accident was your sister's?

272
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,590
Why did you go and do that?

273
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:48,790
Who was at fault?

274
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,430
It wasn't me.

275
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,499
A stupid brat reversed into me.

276
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,300
Were you hurt?

277
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,769
Not physically.

278
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,869
But my heart's broken.

279
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:02,970
She ruined my date with Woo Sang.

280
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,109
It was a rotten day.

281
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,950
Did you get the insurance company
to settle everything?

282
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:12,279
You bet. I took care of it.

283
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,550
Did you really?

284
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,590
Yes. I even went to the police
and settled the score.

285
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,950
She's definitely at fault.

286
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,359
The darn brat.

287
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,930
Why did she have to park there?

288
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,889
I could've spent more time with Woo Sang.

289
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,940
You don't have to have a pretty face

290
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,139
You don't have to have a great body

291
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,409
As long as you care only for me

292
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:46,080
You are the best man for me

293
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,790
This is just madness.

294
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,960
Why did she go and say that?
Now I need 35,000 dollars.

295
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,100
Mi Ju's accident. What did you do?

296
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,540
You didn't tell Mom about it, did you?

297
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,739
I did.

298
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,810
You ran off as if a disaster had struck.

299
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:19,509
- Just kidding.
- Darn you.

300
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:22,889
Mom would just freak out and yell.

301
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,389
Talk to me. What happened?

302
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:27,519
Well, Mi Ju...

303
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,159
bumped into this car.

304
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:33,759
What? 35,000 dollars?

305
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,859
Keep it down.

306
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:36,930
That's insane.

307
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:41,040
Will she be arrested
if she can't get the money?

308
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,210
Do you have any cash?

309
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:47,009
I don't even have 30 dollars for snacks.
Would I have 35,000 dollars?

310
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,580
My gosh. This is a real disaster.

311
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,320
Mom fainted when I cosigned
my sister-in-law's loan...

312
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,649
and lost our security deposit.

313
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:58,749
If she faints again over this,
she might never recover.

314
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,359
What will you do now?

315
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,960
That's why we need to think.

316
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,999
- Mr. Kim.
- Hi.

317
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:14,100
- Will you look this over?
- Sure.

318
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:17,470
- What are you working on?
- This?

319
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,779
The new hire will start tomorrow.

320
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,540
Oh, the guy who studied abroad?

321
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,950
- He starts tomorrow?
- Yes.

322
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:28,450
I'm sorting out
what projects he can work on,

323
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:32,090
and how to divide the tasks and duties.

324
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:33,320
- Take a seat.
- Okay.

325
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:40,029
You're so meticulous and detailed
even when it doesn't even show.

326
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:42,859
It doesn't show?

327
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,399
Why is that?

328
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,869
Because you don't show it.

329
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,139
Did you meet the guy from abroad?
What is he like?

330
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,710
He won an international competition,

331
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,649
and he joined us even when
his professor wanted him to stay.

332
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,249
He must be talented.

333
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:02,050
That means we have
a whole cavalry at our beck and call.

334
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,190
- See you.
- Bye.

335
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:15,000
Hi.

336
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,530
Why is it just you? Where's Sang Ah?

337
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,800
She must be busy.

338
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,369
She was away for a while.
She must have some catching up to do.

339
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,080
Here you go.

340
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:32,310
This is the final floor plan
for the training institute in Suwon.

341
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,119
Take a look at it for me.

342
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,169
Goodness.

343
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:53,869
What brings you here, Ms. Shim?

344
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:55,540
- Hello.
- Hi.

345
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,510
Is Mr. Kim in his office?

346
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,969
He's with Mr. Jin.

347
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,280
I see.

348
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,109
Okay. Get back to work.

349
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:03,149
Bye.

350
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,790
Hello, Mother.

351
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,520
I came here to see you.

352
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,060
Is something wrong?

353
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,590
I knew it.

354
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:19,330
Come with me.

355
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,359
Okay.

356
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,469
What are you doing here, darling?

357
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:30,709
Goodness.

358
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,869
It's Chu Ah.

359
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,310
She went out in Sang Ah's car
and got in an accident.

360
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,250
- What?
- An accident?

361
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,780
Was she hurt?

362
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:43,990
She wasn't, which is a relief.

363
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,320
They went to the police
and filed a report.

364
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:49,290
It must've been serious.

365
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,830
I'll head over right now.

366
00:18:52,189 --> 00:18:56,429
Don't you find it strange
the girls handled it on their own...

367
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:57,830
without calling you for help?

368
00:18:58,399 --> 00:18:59,530
What does that mean?

369
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,369
Sang Ah would've called him
if he were someone she could rely on.

370
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,139
You always put Tae Ri before your wife.

371
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:07,980
That's why she thinks you're unreliable.

372
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,080
Can't you be...

373
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:12,949
a little more caring and attentive?

374
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:25,330
Hey. I heard about the accident.

375
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,330
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

376
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,770
I wasn't driving, so I'm fine.

377
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,530
You even went to the police station.

378
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:34,139
Where are you? I'll come over.

379
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:36,609
Why would you do that? Don't bother.

380
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:37,869
See you at home.

381
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,919
He's so indifferent.

382
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,649
He's not caring.

383
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:54,090
If this is how I feel,

384
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,590
Sang Ah must feel it much more
and that's why they drifted apart.

385
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,459
Maybe that's why she went abroad to study.

386
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,629
Don't say that.

387
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:06,699
A son-in-law
can become a stranger overnight.

388
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,109
You shouldn't coddle him too much.

389
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:12,010
Goodness.

390
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,080
First, I'll ask my boss,

391
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,810
check with the banks,
and ask people I know and trust.

392
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,050
You should too.

393
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,820
Who could I go to?

394
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,750
Should I track down
my missing sister-in-law?

395
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,189
Or ask the students I tutor
for their pocket money?

396
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,290
You know more people since you work.

397
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,730
What should I do?

398
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,330
Hey. Can't you ask Nam Jin?

399
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:37,770
Did you tell him about the accident?

400
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,169
I don't want to tell him
when he just got back.

401
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:44,310
Others call their husbands right away
when something like this happens.

402
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,439
Are you saving yours up
for something else?

403
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:48,010
I hate this.

404
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:50,280
Oh, my back.

405
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,050
Goodness.

406
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,750
Why did you two jump?
What were you scheming?

407
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,290
What would we scheme about?

408
00:20:59,689 --> 00:21:03,659
Why do you keep coming here
when your husband's back at home?

409
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:05,730
Yes, I should go. I'll go.

410
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,060
When will Mi Ju come home?
Call her and ask.

411
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,869
She can't come home tonight.

412
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,639
Why not?

413
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,709
She's away. On a business trip.

414
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,010
A business trip?

415
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,409
Someone's filming a movie, right?

416
00:21:19,939 --> 00:21:21,340
Yes, it's a movie.

417
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,609
Where did she go?

418
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:25,280
She went pretty far away.

419
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,020
Goodness.
She goes on business trips now?

420
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,590
She must be doing
pretty well at her job, then.

421
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,060
I guess?

422
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,929
- I'll go home now.
- Okay.

423
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,090
Ji Hyun. Let's go home.

424
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:40,260
Okay.

425
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,859
We're off.

426
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,469
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

427
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,800
Why did she leave in such a hurry?

428
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,010
Is someone after her?

429
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,639
Maybe?

430
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:57,409
- My goodness.
- Let's drink.

431
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,949
You wench. Sit up.

432
00:21:58,949 --> 00:22:01,080
- Get a hold of yourself.
- No.

433
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,080
Wake up.

434
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,919
My gosh...

435
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,990
You had pajeon earlier.

436
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,459
It'll stink if you vomit here.
This is my business.

437
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,899
Pull yourself together and get out.

438
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,659
I will, you witch.

439
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,669
- You should control yourself.
- I'll have one more drink.

440
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:21,399
No, you had enough. Go home.

441
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:24,909
- Fine, darn you.
- My gosh.

442
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:30,280
My son will make it up to you.

443
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,109
- Don't worry.
- Oh, will he?

444
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,719
Do you want to stay here?

445
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:12,790
We can meet up whenever.
You should move in.

446
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,879
(Drawing Spaces at Jin Architecture,
Head of Interior, Jin Sang Ah)

447
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,350
Okay. See you then.

448
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,879
Bye.

449
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,820
Oh, dear.

450
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:44,189
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

451
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,359
You're Korean?

452
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:50,629
Yes. Goodness.

453
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,669
Oh. Sorry.

454
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:01,669
- It's you.
- Yes.

455
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,209
We can't meet as freely as before...

456
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,250
once we exit the gate.

457
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:28,899
- Dad's home.
- You're right.

458
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,570
Honey.

459
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,409
What are you doing?

460
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,040
I start work tomorrow.

461
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:44,909
Great. You got the job.

462
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:49,080
Why are you packing a suitcase?

463
00:24:49,449 --> 00:24:51,449
I'm joining a project right away.

464
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:53,859
It's my first one, so I need to focus.

465
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,459
I'll stay at a studio apartment
close to the office.

466
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,629
A studio apartment?

467
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,959
Where did you get the money to rent one?

468
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:04,969
Did you get your new head
to give you a good deal...

469
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,399
so you could afford a deposit?

470
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,510
I told you not to use crass language.

471
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:12,169
It's late, Ji Hyun.

472
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:13,480
- Go to bed.
- Okay.

473
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,639
She yawned so widely that she shed a tear.

474
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,320
Where did you get the money from?

475
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,679
It belongs to the company.
It's not mine.

476
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,389
I see.

477
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,659
Then let us come with you.

478
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,389
- What?
- We can...

479
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:30,659
move out of this place.

480
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,459
We're behind in rent,
and we used up almost all the deposit.

481
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,000
If it's company property,

482
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,530
as your family,
don't we have a right to live there too?

483
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,469
Don't be stupid.

484
00:25:40,699 --> 00:25:43,439
Then honey. I have a question.

485
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,639
Do you have any extra cash?

486
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,909
Money?

487
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,939
I need to take care of something urgent.

488
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,449
Are you eligible for a company loan?

489
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,250
Goodness.

490
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:57,649
Wait.

491
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,619
You have a job now.
Can't you get a loan?

492
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:01,659
Hey.

493
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,530
You're asking that from a guy
who just got a job after years of study?

494
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,699
Can't you offer me support
so I can concentrate on my work?

495
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,629
What's the company called?

496
00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:12,800
I'm just an intern.

497
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,639
I'll tell you if they sign me on.

498
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,740
Why won't you tell me even that?

499
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,740
How much will they pay you?

500
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,709
As much as they pay any other intern?

501
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:23,980
Where's the studio apartment?

502
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,619
Why won't you tell me anything?

503
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,980
You're really weird.

504
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,590
Are we a married couple?

505
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,760
It's Jeil Studio Apartments. Don't visit.

506
00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:35,919
Lots of my colleagues live there.

507
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,459
Jeil Studio Apartments?

508
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:41,260
Wait.

509
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,330
So you're heading over now?

510
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,030
Is that all the stuff you need?

511
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:47,639
I'll see how things go for a few days...

512
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,270
and come back if I need anything else.

513
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:51,570
You just unpacked
after your return flight.

514
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,510
Do you have to pack up and leave so soon?

515
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:57,750
Who cares how long I've been back for?

516
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:00,250
What counts is that
I must concentrate on my job.

517
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,149
You have to be transparent
about your pay.

518
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:05,189
You know that, right?

519
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,359
Is it because you did construction?

520
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,730
Your speech is so rough and vulgar.

521
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:15,560
What? You used to say you liked
how straightforward and tough I was.

522
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,199
Would I always have the same taste?

523
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:22,139
I might have drunk beer
and soju mixers until I blacked out.

524
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:24,240
That doesn't mean I still do.

525
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:27,439
I could've grown to like
a glass or two of wine.

526
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:31,350
You've gotten older.
Try to gain some class.

527
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,159
What? "Class?"

528
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:44,629
My gosh.

529
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,730
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

530
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:34,780
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

531
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,139
Not even 5,000 dollars?

532
00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:37,780
There's really nothing you can do?

533
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:39,409
Can't you ask Nam Jin?

534
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,520
We'll move into that studio apartment.

535
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,850
We can't live apart in this emergency.

536
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:46,320
He acted like he was tolerable and nice.

537
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,719
He just married well
and climbed the ladder.

538
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,119
Honey.

539
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:52,830
