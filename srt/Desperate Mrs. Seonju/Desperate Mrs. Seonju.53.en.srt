1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,040
This must be your grandpa,

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,510
and this must be your great-grandpa.

3
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,180
Who's this?

4
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:19,780
Your grandma?

5
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:23,089
She looks like you.

6
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,760
She looks like me?

7
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,460
Yes.

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,170
She is pretty.

9
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:39,769
Here.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going inside, Ji Hyun.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,110
Don't stay out too long.

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,239
- Okay.
- Okay.

13
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:46,409
Hand these out.

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,150
They look great.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,849
I'll have...

16
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,680
I'm home.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,690
- Hi.
- Hi.

18
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,320
Help us with the vegetables.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,489
Sure.

20
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:04,690
That Grace Shim lady.

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,900
- Jin Sang Ah's mom.
- Yes.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,629
- Was she married twice?
- What?

23
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,169
I saw an old photo of my CEO.

24
00:01:11,169 --> 00:01:14,099
My CEO looked exactly the same,

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,539
but his wife was someone else.

26
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,340
It wasn't your old friend.

27
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:22,009
She used to look really old-fashioned.

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,509
I was shocked too.

29
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,080
Could someone change so much?

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,149
Yes. It's all makeup and fancy hair.

31
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:31,420
- I bet she didn't look nice at all.
- That's right.

32
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:34,289
She'd have looked like
she worked outdoors...

33
00:01:34,289 --> 00:01:36,030
and slaved away for her in-laws.

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,090
No, she didn't look like that.

35
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,500
It was a completely different person.

36
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,129
She didn't look old-fashioned.

37
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:42,830
She looked quite modern and pretty.

38
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,830
What?

39
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,940
Are you cross-eyed?

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,539
Why would you call her pretty?

41
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,909
Okay, fine.

42
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:55,440
You're the prettiest woman
in the world, Ms. Han.

43
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,780
I know I am.

44
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,319
Your eyes are no longer wonky.

45
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,090
What should I do?

46
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,390
How can I sort this out?

47
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,459
Think of something.

48
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,880
It was really someone else.

49
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:30,010
(Jin Architecture)

50
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,439
Well, Nam Jin was one of
the most remarkable students I've had.

51
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,110
I'm very excited to work with him again.

52
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:39,350
Me too, professor.

53
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,689
Let's create something great together.

54
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:47,790
He wouldn't have wanted to work with us
if it hadn't been for Mr. Jeon.

55
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,429
He was the professor's
most prized student.

56
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:51,730
I got that.

57
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,959
Do your best.

58
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,300
Yes, sir.

59
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,899
I'm glad to be on board.

60
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,339
We all are.

61
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,719
Where are you headed?

62
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,679
Would you like to grab lunch together?

63
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,290
That sounds good.

64
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,290
Where should we go?

65
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,059
(Team Leader's Office, Kim So Woo)

66
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,329
You acted like you won the world...

67
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:29,400
because you won the Hansung contract.

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,939
We're going to build a K-culture Town.

69
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,770
Broadcasting stations, OTT platforms,

70
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,410
and entertainment agencies...

71
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,110
are getting together to create
a culture complex for overseas fans.

72
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,650
The Hansung project is nothing
compared to this.

73
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:47,119
Did you even hear about
the K-culture Town project?

74
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,850
You're so childish.

75
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:52,790
Where should we go?

76
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,689
French? Chinese?

77
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,530
Or since you're here, Korean?

78
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,429
There's also a spot by a famous TV chef.

79
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:03,670
Well, anything is fine.

80
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,530
And who is she?

81
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,300
She's support staff.

82
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,509
She's a bit cheeky.

83
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,879
Don't mind her.

84
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,050
You two really...

85
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,319
Is that how you introduce someone
to her face?

86
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,689
Hi. I'm So Woo Kim.

87
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,249
Hello. Nice to meet you.

88
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:26,559
I'm a director here and...

89
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,889
she is Seon Ju Pi, my design partner.

90
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,030
She's very skilled and passionate.

91
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,499
Really?

92
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,499
Hi.

93
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:37,699
I'm fine,

94
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:39,999
thank you, and you?

95
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:42,540
I'm fine too. Thank you.

96
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,970
Oh, my...

97
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,679
Not all of our staff are like this.

98
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,249
Let's go.

99
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,780
See you later.

100
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,819
I told you not to speak English.

101
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,449
You're so embarrassing.

102
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:03,329
I'm more embarrassed by how rude you are.

103
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:05,999
- Let's go.
- Okay.

104
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,400
Bye.

105
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,100
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

106
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,540
- Let's go.
- Okay.

107
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:23,509
What did Sang Ah say in English?

108
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,780
I heard her say a B word which isn't nice.

109
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:29,749
The one that comes after "son of."

110
00:06:30,619 --> 00:06:33,020
Did she say that?
She badmouthed me, didn't she?

111
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,759
No.

112
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:37,860
She said "bit cheeky."

113
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:41,499
It means someone who's odd or amusing.

114
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,869
"Amusing?"

115
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:46,369
There's no way
she said something nice about me.

116
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:48,639
I should learn English.

117
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:52,069
I did awesomely well
in every subject in school,

118
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,239
but English was the one I couldn't master.

119
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,749
That was the only subject I was poor at,

120
00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:01,350
but it made me look ignorant
even though my other grades were great.

121
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,790
It was so unfair.

122
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,189
A foreign language
takes time and exposure.

123
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,090
Even decent English speakers
would get flustered in that situation.

124
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,889
Instead of being intimidated,
you said, "I'm fine."

125
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,360
That's a big deal.

126
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,869
You even gave
the perfect send-off by waving bye.

127
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,999
Even so.

128
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,739
Darn it.

129
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,639
I wish I could
sew a microchip in my head...

130
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,110
that would make me fluent in English.

131
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,650
Why can't scientists develop that?

132
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,249
They might soon.

133
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,249
- Let's go.
- Okay.

134
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,559
Everyone is calling me
asking if this is you.

135
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:45,259
It's not you, is it?

136
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,660
I think it's not.

137
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,569
You think? It's you or it's not.

138
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,670
Actually, it is me...

139
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,800
"It is me?"

140
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:54,900
What is this photo?

141
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,470
Who's this woman?

142
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:58,410
Well...

143
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,550
Let me see who that is.

144
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,949
Did you hear anything?

145
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,119
Well...

146
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,619
So I...

147
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:14,819
Ms. Oh!

148
00:08:15,489 --> 00:08:17,290
Hello, Chu Ah.

149
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,030
Hang on. This is...

150
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,429
Isn't this you?

151
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,199
You have similar clothes.

152
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,939
She's a member of the crew.

153
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:33,079
The female lead
bought the crew the same clothing.

154
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,910
They all have the same thing.

155
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,980
Which crew member is this?

156
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,850
If you two were in the same suite,

157
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,850
something must've happened in the room!

158
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,949
This girl...

159
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:43,150
She's into women.

160
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,920
- Is that true?
- She and Woo Sang...

161
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,959
couldn't have gotten up to no good.

162
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,929
She took Woo Sang there
because he was drunk.

163
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:53,559
Nothing happened at all.

164
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,569
Right?

165
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:05,609
Really?

166
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,079
That's fortunate if nothing happened,

167
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,650
but everyone thinks this is you,
so explain it well!

168
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:12,380
Okay?

169
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,620
My head aches.

170
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,689
I was stressed the whole day...

171
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,959
and my head hurts so bad.

172
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,920
Oh, my gosh.

173
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:26,559
How was that photo taken?

174
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,630
Will it be okay?

175
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,030
I'm a bit scared.

176
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:34,199
That seems to be the only photo.

177
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,640
I'll have my agency fight it hard.

178
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,709
It'll die down soon.

179
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:42,240
It won't get too bad.
Don't worry too much.

180
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,459
Jeong Tae Sang. What are you doing?

181
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,459
Hello, chief. What brings you here?

182
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,969
That idea of yours.

183
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,429
The rebound inferno thing.

184
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:07,500
- That thought.
- Yes.

185
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,370
I gave it more thought,
and I liked that...

186
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:14,179
you came up with something challenging.

187
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,910
Do you really?

188
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,579
I think highly of that.

189
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:20,280
But that show can't air.

190
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:22,079
Keep thinking.

191
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,550
Take that idea
and spin it this way and that.

192
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,890
Yes, sir.

193
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,459
- Good.
- Thank you.

194
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,660
Not at all.

195
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,660
Take care.

196
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,359
You can do this.

197
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:35,829
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

198
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,729
See?

199
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,839
It was the most refreshing idea
you ever had.

200
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:42,500
Was it really?

201
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:47,510
You're a bit timid and easily intimidated.

202
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,449
How did you come up with
an idea that extreme?

203
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:52,479
What?

204
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,059
Hang on.

205
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,729
Darn it.

206
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,630
What the heck?

207
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,900
Watch where you're going, kid.

208
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,569
You didn't either.

209
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:19,010
What?

210
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,209
You should be apologizing.

211
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:22,510
Just me?

212
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,179
You should apologize too.

213
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,949
I got ketchup on my clothes.

214
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:28,679
Plus, you shouldn't walk about
eating stuff in public.

215
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,250
Do you know how much this cost?

216
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,349
How much?

217
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:36,929
Watch it, kid.

218
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,429
Goodness.

219
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:40,800
Darn it.

220
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,099
What a weirdo.

221
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:45,969
We bumped into each other.

222
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,300
He got ketchup on his jacket,
but I lost my corndog.

223
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,469
Adults these days are so rude.

224
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,309
This is so annoying.

225
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,179
You can't get a place like that
with your budget.

226
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,479
How about a studio apartment?

227
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,390
Okay. Come by one day.

228
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:06,819
Bye.

229
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,459
Kids these days are such a nuisance.

230
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,030
- Why?
- Some kid was walking along...

231
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,699
eating a corndog.

232
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:17,329
He got sauce all over me
and didn't even apologize.

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,199
Don't parents teach their kids anymore?

234
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,140
Kids should be scolded
when they're in the wrong,

235
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,640
but parents spoil them instead.

236
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:30,280
If this had happened to me,
I'd have scolded him until he cried.

237
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,079
Why are you here?

238
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,479
You hung up as if you were dead busy.

239
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,990
- What's this?
- You said I came here for free yogurt.

240
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:47,229
This is all for you.

241
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:49,359
What's the occasion?

242
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,770
Hey. Your "Squid Game"
for married couples idea.

243
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,439
- Was it green-lit?
- No.

244
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,839
It was rejected,
but the chief liked my challenging spirit.

245
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,540
He wants me to keep thinking about it.

246
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,209
Nice. You said your chief was crazy,

247
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,880
but he's open-minded.

248
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,050
Wouldn't you say
that kind of reaction isn't too bad?

249
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,059
Well...

250
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,520
It was the first time I was praised.

251
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,390
My gosh. Does that make me your muse?

252
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:22,800
Let's say it does. Now throw stuff at me.

253
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:24,469
- For free?
- What?

254
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,469
Okay, then.

255
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,670
Here.

256
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:32,870
Will that do?

257
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,880
- Hey.
- What?

258
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:39,719
Dating shows are full of
handsome and smart people.

259
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,550
Sometimes they have ordinary people.

260
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,020
They have to have a job
and be of a certain level.

261
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,719
How about a jobless people special?

262
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,859
A show for people who hit rock bottom.

263
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:54,329
Keep talking.

264
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:58,599
(Hansung Company)

265
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,699
The basement Generator Room
has a high ceiling.

266
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:03,069
I think we can lower the floor a bit more.

267
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,640
It's great that
everything is going smoothly.

268
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,050
I had a dream last night, and I saw...

269
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,280
the woman in the photo
from Tae Ri's locket.

270
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,750
- Tae Ri's locket?
- Isn't that weird?

271
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,420
She appeared in my dream
and looked at me intently.

272
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:24,189
Why is that?

273
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:25,229
I don't know.

274
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:27,199
I have lots of weird dreams.

275
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,229
One time I dreamed I was in prison.

276
00:14:31,229 --> 00:14:34,599
And one time I dreamed
I dug up golden potatoes.

277
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,140
I bought a lottery ticket after that.

278
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,969
I lost it, though.

279
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,679
- Did you?
- Last night,

280
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,510
I had three or four dreams.

281
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,979
What were the other ones?

282
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,290
I dreamed...

283
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,920
I was a European princess.

284
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,760
I guess it was because
I wanted to be a princess as a kid.

285
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,630
Did you?

286
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,800
I fought my way
on the quest to find my prince,

287
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,469
and I beat all my foes
and finally found him.

288
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,370
Just then,
someone shot an arrow into my heart.

289
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:16,780
So I fell on top of the prince
and we fell down.

290
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,510
Isn't that childish?

291
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,679
Should I have bought
another lottery ticket?

292
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:25,849
I don't think so.

293
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:27,959
Was it a warning to look out for myself?

294
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,959
I shouldn't upset anyone.

295
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,829
How did you feel after you had the dream?

296
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:38,329
My chest actually hurt
when the arrow hit me in the dream,

297
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:39,729
but I didn't feel bad.

298
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:41,170
Then it's a good dream.

299
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,839
Maybe our project will go well.

300
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,579
Then when we're done with this project,

301
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:51,179
will you win
the Architecture of the Day Award?

302
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:53,219
I doubt that.

303
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:55,050
If you do, you owe me.

304
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,050
Right.

305
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,420
That would be nice. Now dig in.

306
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,890
"This looks like Jeong Woo Sang."

307
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,500
"It's either him or Cha Geum Ho,"

308
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:09,760
"but Cha Geum Ho was in Europe that day."

309
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,900
"Then it has to be Jeong Woo Sang."

310
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,370
"It's Jeong Woo Sang, not Cha Geum Ho."

311
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:15,969
"Get your eyesight checked."

312
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,740
This is not Jeong Woo Sang.

313
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:24,010
If this is Jeong Woo Sang,

314
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,880
call me Son Ae Jin.

315
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:29,150
Reporter Heo. Is that your name
because you report fiction?

316
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:34,890
Reporter Heo.
Why is that article still up?

317
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,459
Must I come after you?

318
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,859
I'll tell you took my money...

319
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:41,099
so that you can never report again.

320
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,370
Take it down already!

321
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,439
She's acting like she's my chief.

322
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:50,910
I don't believe this.

323
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,479
"Is that your name
because you report fiction?"

324
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:57,380
What?

325
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,050
"Jeong Woo Sang's agency..."

326
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,050
"to take strong legal action
against false rumors."

327
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,490
Have they forgotten what I can be like?

328
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,790
I was going to be nice, but not anymore.

329
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,899
We can't work only on domestic projects
and remain narrow-minded forever.

330
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,270
I couldn't stand seeing them rejoice.

331
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,069
They'll feel threatened
when they see us work on...

332
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:28,379
the K-culture Town project.

333
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:29,409
Right.

334
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:32,250
The Hansung project
depended too much on personal taste.

335
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,680
It's time...

336
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,379
we show them what caliber...

337
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,149
truly means.

338
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,119
That's just what I want.

339
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,629
I haven't seen that look in a while.

340
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,200
It's the look I love.

341
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:49,230
Is it?

342
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Hang on.

343
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,169
What's up?

344
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:58,510
Why don't you
bring Sang Ah over for dinner?

345
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:00,639
Dinner? Out of the blue?

346
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:04,010
I was too flustered to say anything
when we last met at the cafe,

347
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,550
but I wanted to ask her a few questions.

348
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,879
Say yes or I'll come to your office again.

349
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,919
Wait.

350
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,419
Mom wants you to come over for dinner.

351
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,619
For dinner?

352
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:16,520
Say yes.

353
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,260
We'll be there.

354
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,460
Okay.

355
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:26,639
I thought she was single,
but she was married with a kid,

356
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,369
and he happens to live with Seon Ju now.

357
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,809
What kind of nonsense is that?

358
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,609
Will they even get divorced?

359
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:34,480
I shouldn't just harass Seon Ju.

360
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:36,180
I should ask my future daughter-in-law.

361
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,250
You worked hard your whole life
to be this successful.

362
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,819
I'm thinking you must be
so happy and satisfied...

363
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:46,659
with life now. How do you feel?

364
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,419
I really am happy.

365
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:53,190
I was in this field for 30 years
and I became successful.

366
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:56,430
You might think I had a tough life,

367
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,940
but it's a blessing
to be able to do what you love.

368
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,940
The path I took...

369
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,680
wasn't full of thorns.
Rather, it was paved with silk.

370
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,379
I enjoyed the stroll.

371
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,980
That comment will energize
a great many young hairdressers.

372
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:15,550
Finally, what would you say
to the youngsters out there...

373
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,849
who call you their role model?

374
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,790
If you put in...

375
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,159
your hard work and passion,

376
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:24,290
strive ahead without any distractions,

377
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,829
and think of nothing but your occupation,

378
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,129
before you know it,
you will be successful.

379
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:32,800
Good luck.

380
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,899
Thank you. We're done.

381
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:38,869
I can't believe how elegant you are.

382
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,339
Thank you.

383
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,349
When will the interview air?

384
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,180
It's for a special broadcast
on successful women entrepreneurs,

385
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,550
and the clips will air in succession.

386
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,950
I'll call you when I know the exact date.

387
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,089
Okay.

388
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:53,520
- Good job.
- Thanks.

389
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,819
- Sure.
- You looked great.

390
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,589
You can see well, right?

391
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:02,530
You went through so many surgeries.

392
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,169
Fortunately this time,
you're recovering well.

393
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,270
- Good.
- You can go home now...

394
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,909
and come in regularly
for outpatient check-ups.

395
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,780
Okay.

396
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,139
Does this mean...

397
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,349
I'll have no problem
going out and getting revenge?

398
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,149
- What?
- There's someone...

399
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:25,649
I have some beef with.

400
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,020
I'll be able to recognize them now.

401
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,260
I swear...

402
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,859
to track them down.

403
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,300
To the end of the earth.

404
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,369
(Top star J parties all night
with a mysterious woman.)

405
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,669
(The fire alarm actually went off!)

406
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:46,780
(The hallway burned up that night!)

407
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:51,879
"It is Jeong Woo Sang."

408
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,579
"Who said it was Cha Geum Ho?"

409
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:56,919
"Who's the witch
who almost burned down..."

410
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,889
"the hotel with Woo Sang?"

411
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:04,790
What the heck is this?

412
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:08,599
She just took you there
because you were drunk?

413
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,869
Do you still say nothing happened?

414
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:13,700
Who is this mysterious woman?

415
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,800
You said she's on the crew. Who is she?

416
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:20,510
I have no choice but to ask your director.

417
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,809
It's her!

418
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,579
What?

419
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,250
It's her.

420
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,389
What...

421
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:34,720
You said... You told me that you had...

422
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,020
no feelings for her.

423
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,389
You denied it!

424
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,700
You said no man would hire
someone he liked as a helper!

425
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:44,230
You. Why did you come to work for us?

426
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,970
Did you come here to seduce Woo Sang?

427
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:49,500
Tell me.

428
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,970
It really wasn't like that.

429
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,909
- I'm sorry.
- Why should you apologize?

430
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,450
My gosh. Are you defending her right now?

431
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:01,450
Are you trying to make me faint?

432
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,020
Mom.

433
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,450
Do you think you're what you are now
because you are special?

434
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:08,220
Is this how I raised you to be?

435
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:11,990
How could you get involved with someone
we brought in to do the housework?

436
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:14,430
Do you want to end your acting career?

437
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:16,159
We'll get married, then!

438
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,169
What?

439
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,030
My goodness.

440
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:21,399
It'll turn the scandal
into an announcement.

441
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,240
- Do you want to marry me?
- My gosh.

442
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,040
Marry me.

443
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,980
We were getting to know each other.
We can keep doing that.

444
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,510
Who would find fault...

445
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,280
if we were to marry?

446
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:40,589
She's up for it too. Will that do?

447
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,359
- Ma'am.
- Mom.

448
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,500
What's up with her now?

449
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,740
I have no idea. Leave her alone.

450
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,099
She'll quieten down soon.

451
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,300
Oh, dear.

452
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,510
Did your interview go well?

453
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:04,280
I just told the truth.

454
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,879
I can't make up stories, you know.

455
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,750
I heard it was a pretty famous show.

456
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:10,720
It is.

457
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,149
You're really something.

458
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,230
You turned the small salon
my father gave you into a huge business.

459
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,700
That's no big deal.

460
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,000
It's hard to expand a business
while raising two kids.

461
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,369
I respect you sometimes.

462
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:30,770
You're embarrassing me now.

463
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:34,440
I did quite well for myself,

464
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:36,980
so people make up stories about me...

465
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,950
out of jealousy.

466
00:23:40,109 --> 00:23:43,250
That's when I regret
and wonder if I worked too hard.

467
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,220
Made-up stories die down in time.

468
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,520
Don't mind them.

469
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:51,629
Let's get changed and ready for dinner.

470
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:53,089
Okay.

471
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:56,730
(Hwarangdae Station)

472
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,180
Why are we here?

473
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,780
This place?

474
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,389
I call it my lucky place.
It's like my own fortune cookie.

475
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:21,559
It's your fortune cookie?

476
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,460
Yes. Shall we get going?

477
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,879
I come here when I feel stuck...

478
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,050
or I want to feel refreshed.

479
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,980
- You come here?
- Yes.

480
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:52,990
This place inspired me
and I drew lots of sketches here.

481
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,260
Looking at the tracks stretching out...

482
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:01,200
kind of helps my thoughts reach out.

483
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,669
I feel like...

484
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,770
following them will take me
to an unknown place.

485
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:11,609
I want us...

486
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:14,109
to do well on the Hansung project,

487
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,010
so I'm sharing my secret spot.

488
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,750
Is it like a trade secret?

489
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,780
Yes.

490
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:24,290
This drawing of a house.

491
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,149
Did you draw this here too?

492
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,490
This is the first drawing I made here.

493
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:46,369
Oh, no.

494
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,210
- Ms. Pi.
- There it is.

495
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:54,079
I hope it doesn't fly away.

496
00:25:57,849 --> 00:25:58,889
Ms. Pi.

497
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,069
What are you doing?

498
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:14,369
Leave it. It's fine.

499
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,300
Whatever it is, we can do without it.

500
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:18,440
It's dangerous. Get down from there.

501
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,639
Don't you worry.

502
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,809
- Watch out.
- Here I go.

503
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,220
Goodness.

504
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,619
I got it!

505
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,760
I got it!

506
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,099
See? I got it.

507
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:49,270
Okay, I see that. Now get down from there.

508
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,010
Can you manage?

509
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:55,180
Watch your step.

510
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,909
Watch out. That's it.

511
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,210
Be careful.

512
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,149
Watch it. Take your time.

513
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,389
Back in the day, people used to call me...

514
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:08,460
"flying squirrel."

515
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:11,260
More like "flying monkey."

516
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,260
I had no trouble climbing trees
and walking on ledges.

517
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,129
That was when you were young.

518
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,069
- What?
- Fine.

519
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,899
You are young, so take your time.

520
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:23,169
Watch your step.

521
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,470
The guys I worked with said...

522
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,339
they'd never seen someone
as athletic as me.

523
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,780
I told you to...

524
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,389
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

525
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,349
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

526
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,950
Your mother has quite the temper too.

527
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,579
Is your father nice and calm?

528
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:11,720
Keep this up
and I won't be your daughter-in-law.

529
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:14,520
Are you two dating at work?

530
00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:17,690
You think it's fine
that you're chatting and laughing?

531
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,760
Is there a photo in your locket?

532
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,000
Dong Won said
she looked like Ji Hyun's mom.

533
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,329
Did he?

534
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,540
