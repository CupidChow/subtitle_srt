00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,989
(Episode 6)

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,970
What? "Class?"

3
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:24,400
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.

4
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,310
I was at my wit's end.

5
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,979
I don't want to get on his nerves
when he's just starting a new job.

6
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,320
What should I do now?

7
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,360
(Contacts)

8
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,729
(The boss)

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,000
Boss. I need you to pay me in advance.

10
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,640
What designer has ever
put up with you for this long?

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,009
Your office has
the highest staff turnover rate...

12
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,009
and the online rating is 0.5 out of five,

13
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:03,780
and I worked without a single complaint
and did all you asked.

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,650
No one but I could do that.

15
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:09,119
If you say no, I quit.
Give me my severance package.

16
00:01:16,589 --> 00:01:17,790
Boss.

17
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,330
I'm glad you called. There's bad news.

18
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,259
What is it this time?

19
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,300
We finished two projects at once,
so there's no work right now.

20
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,669
But the mall across the road found work.

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,240
- So what?
- What should you do?

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,240
I should go out?

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,339
That's right.

24
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,180
Okay. I'll hand out some flyers tomorrow.

25
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,779
- Boss. Could I...
- What?

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,820
Could I get paid in advance?

27
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,850
No!

28
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,690
Why did you take
your sister's car without asking?

29
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:57,630
Things could've gotten really bad.
Don't you dare do that again.

30
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:59,999
It's not fair. You got her
a car like that and not me.

31
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:01,930
You never let me drive it
while she was abroad.

32
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,770
You're in the wrong. Don't complain.

33
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,910
It seemed to be a serious collision.
How did it happen?

34
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,509
It wasn't me.

35
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,740
A crazy brat dozed off at the wheel
and reversed into me.

36
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,479
It turned out to be rookie stylist.

37
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,680
The girl who came to my salon?

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,249
Yes. She was driving
her big sister's car too.

39
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,150
And that big sister
went to school with Sang Ah.

40
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:23,819
The cars both belong to older sisters...

41
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:25,789
and you all know each other?

42
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:28,189
Yes. How funny is that?

43
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,760
It feels a bit weird to say
we know each other.

44
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:32,170
We move in different circles.

45
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,230
Right. Their car was a really ratty one.

46
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:38,369
She caused an accident with a car
that's a miracle that it even moves.

47
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,869
My goodness.

48
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,580
I didn't like the feel of those people.

49
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,379
Honey. Shouldn't you contact the lawyer
you have on retainer?

50
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:50,180
Why call him over a fender-bender?

51
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,849
It's not just a minor scrape.

52
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,119
Right. But I guess she got scared
about causing the accident.

53
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,289
She tried to run away from the police.

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,860
- What?
- It was unbelievable.

55
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,330
She thought of running away
from the police station?

56
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:04,830
Her sister was obstinate back in school.

57
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,330
They grew up poor,
so the whole family's like that.

58
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,999
People like that should be
taught a lesson.

59
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,510
You can't let them off lightly.

60
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,270
Don't worry. I won't let them off lightly.

61
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,050
Don't go too far
and drag our company into it.

62
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,279
Settle with them if you can.

63
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,849
I'm sure they'll take care of it.

64
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:25,650
You must be tired. Go to your room.

65
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,020
Should I have let her get away?

66
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,960
I could've witnessed a police chase...

67
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,189
and pretended it was a movie. Too bad.

68
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,960
Goodnight.

69
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:37,629
Let's go upstairs.

70
00:03:38,029 --> 00:03:39,499
- Goodnight.
- You too.

71
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,980
If the people who caused the accident
are that unruly, will it be okay?

72
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,819
Why wouldn't it be?
We'll do things by the law.

73
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,950
- Is your car at a garage?
- Yes.

74
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:04,189
You can drive my car, then.

75
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,059
I can ride my bike.

76
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,960
I was thinking of renting,
but I'll drive yours.

77
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:11,760
Wait.

78
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:15,300
Don't you think Tae Ri got much better?

79
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,700
His kindergarten teacher said so.

80
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,069
Did she? That's good to hear.

81
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,210
He had regular play therapy...

82
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,180
and we did all his doctor said.

83
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,049
I think he got
much more cheerful and talkative.

84
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,219
The doctor says he's attached to you.

85
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,719
That it would do him much good
if you participated in his treatment.

86
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:36,719
- What?
- It's just once a week.

87
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:39,929
It will take me at least a week
to skim through all the projects...

88
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:42,429
you handled while I was away.

89
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:44,500
I'm just about to get back to work,

90
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,370
and you want me to follow a kid around?

91
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:50,469
I think one of us
could take time off work...

92
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,010
to focus on Tae Ri.

93
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,710
It's an important time for him.

94
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,179
I can't quit.

95
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,109
You can if you want to.

96
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:01,849
Right.

97
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,750
Should I?

98
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,320
I'll drop by the study.

99
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,020
Wake up.

100
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:50,599
Here. Look at this.

101
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,229
I did some research.

102
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:56,270
You're too young to go abroad.

103
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,440
That's the best school in the country.

104
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,510
You like to study.

105
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:02,710
"Jeju Island?"

106
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,679
Student accommodation is run like a hotel,
so it'll be nicer than being at home.

107
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:09,520
Mom's busy working and can't do
everything you need or want.

108
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:11,919
I think that's perfect for you.

109
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,460
Think about it.

110
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,669
- Hey.
- Did you move into the studio apartment?

111
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:01,929
- Yes.
- Good.

112
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,200
You're calling pretty late.
Did your husband go to bed?

113
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,010
He will when he feels like it.

114
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,380
Why? Are you afraid I'll join him?

115
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:13,380
Are you jealous?

116
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:16,279
Sleep well. I'll see you tomorrow.

117
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,489
What?

118
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,289
I'd be jealous of Kim So Woo?

119
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:35,799
Haven't we met somewhere before?

120
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:41,940
Oh. Is he that Kim So Woo?

121
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,650
(We really hope you win!)

122

(12th Standard University Student

123
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:53,890
Hello.

124
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,760
Please hurry. Registration closes soon.

126
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:00,529
Here you go.

(12th Standard University Student

128
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,400
Thanks.

129
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,469
- Hello.
- Just a moment.

130
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,169
Yes.

131
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:13,469
Oh, shoot.

132
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:15,270
I'll call you back.

133
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,049
Oh, my gosh.

134
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,099
I think you can fix this in 30 minutes.

(12th Standard University Student
Architecture Model Competition)

136
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,610
Just in case, I'd brought some glue...

137
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:49,779
and extra material and it came in handy.

138
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,650
If I win, you could lose out...

139
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,919
on a chance to study abroad
and a guaranteed job opening.

140
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,350
Why are you helping me?

141
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:02,350
I don't know.

142
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,199
He acted like he was tolerable and nice.

143
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,069
He just married well
and climbed the ladder.

144
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,039
Goodness.

145
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:20,909
Jeil Interior Design.

146
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:23,240
Jeil Interior Design.

147
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,480
Jeil Interior Design. Give us a call.

148
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:27,909
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

149
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:33,919
Darn it.

150
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:37,220
Let's move on.

151
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,630
Hi, everyone.

152
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,829
Mr. Jeon Nam Jin just joined the company.

153
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,130
Say hi.

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,939
Hello. I'm Jeon Nam Jin.

155
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,299
- Hello.
- It's a pleasure.

156
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,370
Our gymnasium project.

157
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:57,340
Mr. Jeon worked on something similar...

158
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,750
while he studied in the US.

159
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,150
He should be a great help.

160
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,250
I see. That's so reassuring.

161
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,220
You're so handsome.

162
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:09,720
The project will keep you back late.

163
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,159
Where do you live?

164
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,760
I moved to a studio apartment
closer to the office.

165
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,159
Gosh. You get things done right away.

166
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,789
Let's go over the files...

167
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,789
and start the meeting in ten minutes.

168
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,289
- Okay.
- Okay.

169
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:45,789
Excuse me.

170
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,470
They finally reunited,
so they can't get enough of each other.

171
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,840
You don't know they're married, do you?

172
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,579
They met on the job.

173
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:06,150
I heard about that.

174
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:07,679
He scored.

175
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,980
Ms. Jin's nicknamed "Empress Jin."

176
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,250
Only because she has a temper.

177
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,549
But she's beautiful
and she's the CEO's daughter.

178
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,289
She must have one flaw.

179
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,760
Even if she doesn't inherit the company,
the family has other riches.

180
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
- Is that true?
- Yes.

181
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:25,400
Is that so?

182
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,730
Why wouldn't she inherit the company?

183
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,370
Her sister's an actress.
Empress Jin the eldest would...

184
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,569
I mean Ms. Jin would inherit everything.

185
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:37,880
Doesn't the CEO trust
and rely on Mr. Kim a bit more?

186
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:40,549
I agree. He does.

187
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:43,319
Let's see who gets promoted this time.

188
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,090
- I've been thinking.
- About what?

189
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,390
Tae Ri's recital today...

190
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,260
I said I couldn't make it.

191
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:55,659
Yes.

192
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,360
I'm telling you I'll go on my own.

193
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,870
Get back to work. Keep it up.

194
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:04,740
Good luck.

195
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,279
Darn it. Tae Ri, Tae Ri.

196
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,709
Does he do that on purpose?

197
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,360
Hey.

198
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:32,100
I think Mr. Kim's the only one
who's pleased they're reunited.

199
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:36,569
Don't you think Ms. Jin's a bit frigid?

200
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,840
That's impossible.

201
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:41,970
No.

202
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:44,909
If she really were pleased
to see her husband after a few years,

203
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:47,049
wouldn't she have
gone to Mr. Kim's office...

204
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:49,150
- a few times already to catch up?
- Yes.

205
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:51,620
They must catch up at home, not at work.

206
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,890
They're both team leaders,
so they're trying to act appropriately.

207
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,260
Don't you think?

208
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,789
Yes. I think so too.

209
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,699
He thinks so too.

210
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,299
Stop talking about nonsense
and get to work.

211
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:09,470
Okay.

212
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,079
Not even 5,000 dollars?

213
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,779
Not even 3,000?

00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,539

(SGP Saeil Bank)

217
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,679
I wonder how Mi Ju's doing.

218
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,620
What if she meets...

219
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:59,279
some hardened criminals
and comes out even worse?

220
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,590
When will Mi Ju be back from her trip?

221
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,620
What?

222
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:10,900
Her business trip might get extended.

223
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,100
Some movies are filmed
over a year, you see.

224
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,970
What? She can't come home
even once during that time?

225
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,569
Possibly.

226
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:25,340
The actors must keep changing clothes,
so I see why she'd have to be there.

227
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,709
Who's appearing in this movie?

228
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:31,380
I wish I could visit a filming set.

229
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,520
You can't.

230
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,250
Don't yell. I know that...

231
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,260
filming sets are off limits
and only staff are allowed near.

232
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:41,360
I wasn't saying I'd actually visit.

233
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,929
If I'd known, I would've...

234
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:47,529
cooked her a lot of meat before she left.

235
00:14:48,169 --> 00:14:51,400
Don't worry.
She won't starve wherever she is.

236
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:53,069
That's true.

237
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:56,039
Just when she was
about to be successful...

238
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,209
but things went pear-shaped
because of the scandal,

239
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:00,350
she still ate two portions at each meal.

240
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:04,279
Despite how frustrated I was,
that made me smile.

241
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:08,319
I found that more comforting than the idea
of her moping in her bed and not eating.

242
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:10,490
I guess it was because
she was still growing then.

243
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,520
You have a good memory.

244
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,590
You remember those days?

245
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,029
Yes. I feel like reminiscing today.

246
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,929
I think it's because...

247
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:23,340
I wish every day were like today.

248
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,840
What is today like for you?

249
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:28,240
Seon Ju has a job that's hard...

250
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,209
but related to
what she studied in university.

251
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,350
And Nam Jin's back
and he got a job at a good company.

252
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,449
There's no need to worry about them.

253
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,020
- No?
- You have your son Dong Won...

254
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,120
and you tutor kids and make enough
to put food on the table.

255
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:46,360
You're making use of what you studied too,

256
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,130
so that's good enough.

257
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,959
That's not a big deal.

258
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,630
All three of you are healthy,
well, and not in any kind of trouble.

259
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,539
That's enough.
I don't ask for anything else.

260
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,669
You're right. We're doing good.

261
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:00,510
The kids will be here soon, right?

262
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,539
Teach them well.

263
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:07,049
Don't show favoritism
because your son's in the group.

264
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,750
Why would I do that? I don't.

265
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:15,020
- I'm back.
- Hello.

266
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,289
- Hello.
- Hello.

267
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:18,059
Hi. Go on to your room.

268
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,829
Don't touch anything in my room.

269
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,590

270
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:24,130
- Goodness.
- Sit down.

271

This is nice.

00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:33,929
I do. Someone with lots of money.

279
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,570
My mom.

280
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:38,900
Did you handle the accident okay?

281
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,669
Oh, we're handling that right now.

282
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,140
You're still working on it?

283
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:45,979
Did they demand a fortune because
you were an actor in an expensive car?

284
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:48,449
Yes. They think they got lucky.

285
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:49,780
How much did they ask for?

286
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,979
Do you think
they committed insurance fraud?

287
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:54,650
It's possible.

288

Woo Sang.
The dashcam memory card you took.

289
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:00,759
Can I have it back?

290
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,830
Why? What will you do with it?

291
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,560
- Start another scandal?
- No.

292
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:07,729
I could've started one
without that if I'd wanted to.

293
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,269
I went through a great deal
to keep your name out of this.

294
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:13,439
The fraudster said
they saw you after the accident.

295
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:16,070
They said they saw someone in the car
and mentioned your name.

296
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,439
- For real?
- Yes.

297
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:20,080
I think
they're thinking of blackmailing you.

298
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,479
They might come after you. Be careful.

299
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,019
I put on a real show to deny everything.

300
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,820
- Did you?
- If you cared for me a quarter of...

301
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,620
how much I cared for you,

302
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,120
- you should marry me.
- What?

303
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,630
So trust me and give me the memory card.

304
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,630
The card's...

305
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,130
It must be in the jacket I wore that day.

306
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:41,830
Promise to give it to me next time.

307
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,939
The fraudster's going too far...

308
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:47,070
because she knows
I don't have the dashcam footage.

309
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,469
Really? What did she say?

310
00:18:49,469 --> 00:18:51,739
She talked about how I sped up...

311
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,650
and complained her neck hurt.

312
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:55,709
If she keeps insisting,

313
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,219
I must blur your face
and show her the footage.

314
00:18:58,749 --> 00:18:59,749
Okay.

315
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,949
Hi.

316
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:05,390
Did the calming serum work?

317
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,060
Let's have a look.

318
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:10,560
It's perfect.

319
00:19:10,699 --> 00:19:13,699
Your looks amaze me whenever I see you.

320
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,110
I bought a box of Shine Muscat grapes
because they looked tasty.

321
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:24,009
It's at the front desk.
Give it to your mom. It's her favorite.

322
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,610
Thank you.

Hi, Jin Sook.

324
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,790
I'm at home.

325
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,189
I'm busy tending to the garden
with my gardener. I can't make it.

326
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,459
No, the gardener does that
and my son helps a lot too.

327
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,300
But the staff need me
to give detailed orders to...

328
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:51,870
Hello? Jin...

329
00:20:01,949 --> 00:20:03,949
Oh, my poor back.

330
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,449

331
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:12,090

of the chapter until the next class.

332
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,090
- Okay.
- We will.

333
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:16,259
Hey.

334
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:22,229
Did Seon Ju find a solution?

335
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:35,249
There's no solution whatsoever.

336
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,360
- Hi.
- Where are you?

337
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:44,590
At the boxing gym.

338
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:47,759
You're working out
instead of trying to get the money?

339
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,229
I was so frustrated
that I needed some time to think.

340
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,570
Do you punch things to think?

341
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,699
What about the money?

342
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:57,600
Did you talk to Nam Jin?

343
00:20:57,699 --> 00:21:00,669
I did, but he can't seem to help.

344
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,209
Mom's still in the dark?

345
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,380
Of course she is.

346
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,749
Would I be whispering
into the phone if she knew?

347
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,179
There would be a huge mess.

348
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:12,120
The brat caused a catastrophe this time.

349
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:13,620
Exactly.

350
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:18,189
Let's talk later. Bye.

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,900

Couldn't you have chosen a cheaper one?

356
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,179
You cause a massive mess
whenever you decide to.

357
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,380
I think...

358
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,850
I'm the best at causing trouble
that could really ruin your life.

359
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,590
Good for you.

360
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,659
Did you have to drag me into it too?

361
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:54,530
Didn't they have beef gimbap?

362
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,259
I eat enough in here,
but I'm still always hungry.

363
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,269
You ask for too much.

364
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:05,669
You should show some remorse
while you're in here.

365
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:07,439
How dare you ask for beef?

366
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Seon Ju.

367
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,540
It has been just one day,

368
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:14,580
and I miss the outside world
so much already.

369
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,019
I promise to be good and careful
if I ever get a second chance.

370
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,390
Where am I to get the money from?

371
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:23,659
I caused the accident.

372
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:27,229
I should go to prison or just disappear.

373
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,699
Yes. Rather than get out
and cause more trouble,

374
00:22:31,699 --> 00:22:33,630
stay in there and die of old age.

375
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,100
Seon Ju. Didn't they give you any broth?

376
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,840
Pull yourself together. I'm not joking.

377
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,540
You might have to stay in there for years.

378
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,209
We don't even have a few thousand dollars.

379
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:46,209
How are we to get
tens of thousands of dollars?

380
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,080
There's really nothing you can do?

381
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:51,150
Can't you ask Nam Jin?

382
00:22:55,949 --> 00:22:57,759
If we move into the studio apartment,

383
00:22:58,689 --> 00:23:00,259
that might help a great deal.

384
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,189
How?

385
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:04,030
What do you mean?

386
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,459
- Yes.
- Seon Ju!

387
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:08,429
Where are you going?

388
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,390
Goodness.

389
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,989
I thought she'd have filled up the fridge
to feed her husband.

390
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:33,390
There is nothing but greens.

391
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,090
Yes, you eat organic, I get it.

392
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,769
Honey, how did your first day go?

393
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:46,040
Was it good?

394
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,810
Oh, dear.

395
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:55,009
My gosh.

396
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,739
We'll move into that studio apartment.

397
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,110
We can't live apart in this emergency.

398
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,310
We can't.

399
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,209
I used up most of the security deposit,

400
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:30,050
but that's better than nothing.

401
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,320
Would he kick out...

402
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,489
his own wife and child
if we were to barge in?

403
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,499
It's pretty nice.

404
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,900
Gosh.

405
00:24:58,739 --> 00:24:59,810
Honey.

406
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,350
Goodness.

407
00:25:02,949 --> 00:25:04,820
Honey.

408
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,949
Honey.

409
00:25:07,949 --> 00:25:08,949
Darn it.

410
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,159
Can I help you?

411
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:17,330
What unit does the guy
who just got into the elevator live in?

412
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,259
Can I ask what this is about?

413
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,769
I'm his wife.

414
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,969
You're his wife
and you don't know his address?

415
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:28,769
He said his company rented him this place.

416
00:25:28,939 --> 00:25:32,439
I brought some kimchi.
I just came by to drop it off.

417
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,110
- Just a moment.
- Okay.

418
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,390
There.

419
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:43,759
Hey.

420
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:46,189
What's this? Didn't you order in?

421
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,030
We're celebrating your first day at work.

422
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,759
Plating the food
would make it much more appetizing.

423
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,669
I like the way you think.

424
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:55,969
How was your first day?

425
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:58,239
Well...

426
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,009
Mr. Kim and the other employees.

427
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,140
They're all too standardized.

428
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:05,979
The competition is incredibly fierce,

429
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,850
but they act like they're family
and they're a bit naive too.

430
00:26:09,949 --> 00:26:11,320
It's work, not home.

431
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,749
You identified Jin Architecture's problem.

432
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,120
They put too much value on an ideal...

433
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,120
that I feel as if
they're missing out on greater profits.

434
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,259
That's how Mr. Kim works.

435
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:24,929
He's like that
when it comes to work and childcare.

436
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:28,070
He acts like he lives in a fairy tale
and it's pathetic.

437
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:32,870
That's what is keeping Jin Architecture
stagnant when it could expand.

438
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,370
- That's how I feel.
- So I need you...

439
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,810
to gain control.

440
00:26:37,979 --> 00:26:40,380
Of the company atmosphere and my love.

441
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,310
How exactly?

442
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,979
What should I do?

443
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,120
Should I do this?

444
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:54,590
How would you define our relationship?

445
00:26:55,729 --> 00:26:57,060
I don't know.

446
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,729
Nicely put, we're just immoral beings.

447
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:03,900
Infidelity is a serious relationship...

448
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,469
that comes with the intent
to break a marriage.

449
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,040
In that sense,
I don't think this is infidelity.

450
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:12,209
What is it, then?

451
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,550
Aren't we just acknowledging
each other's charm...

452
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:18,179
and enjoying the thrill of the moment?

453
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,689
Isn't that what friends with benefits do?

454
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,959
Putting it like that makes it look like...

455
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,259
we're bad people.

456
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:36,870
The doors are closing.

457
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,880
The food's here.

458
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,650
I'm coming!

459
00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:03,560
Are you in there?

460
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,659
Honey. It's me.

461
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:12,300
Let me in.

462
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,140
Honey.

463
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,380
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

464
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:37,360
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

465
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,630
Mom wants to invite Nam Jin to dinner.

466
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,769
I'm meeting some friends from college.
Come with me.

467
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:45,840
I need you to be the coolest guy there.

468
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,370
What's this feel of emptiness?

469
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,140
How did you find this place?

470
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,479
Why do I smell perfume?

471
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:53,540
Wait.

472
00:28:53,979 --> 00:28:55,409
Pi Seon Ju.
