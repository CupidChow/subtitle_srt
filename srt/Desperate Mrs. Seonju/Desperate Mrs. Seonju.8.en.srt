1
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,200
This isn't my potato.

2
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:19,059
My potatoes are dirty.

3
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:21,800
Pi Seon Ju. You are an honest woman.

4
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:24,999
My gosh!

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,210
These are...

6
00:00:27,639 --> 00:00:28,970
golden potatoes.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,749
What kind of dream was that?

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,249
It would've meant I were pregnant...

9
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:39,589
if only I'd slept with Nam Jin.

10
00:00:40,889 --> 00:00:43,320
That many golden potatoes?

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,489
The tin man.

12
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,029
He's a prince? Who is he?

13
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,659
What dream was that?

14
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:53,529
(Lottery Tickets)

15
00:01:03,209 --> 00:01:07,279
All I want to win
is enough to settle out of court.

16
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:11,320
Let's go!

17
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:20,330
(Episode 8)

18
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,280
Darling. Guess what I bought today.

19
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,720
Did you leave already? Where are you?

20
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:47,119
The thing is,

21
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,259
a team dinner came up.

22
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:55,060
Even the CEO's here. I couldn't say no.

23
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:57,360
What? Goodness.

24
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,830
Can't you drop by and show your face?

25
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,269
I'm not skipping it on purpose.

26
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:05,340
All my superiors are here.

27
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:08,369
First it was a job interview
and now it's a team dinner?

28
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,940
Goodness.

29
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,450
Okay, I get it. But...

30
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:16,679
this is too much.

31
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:20,219
Interviews are important,
you would be busy,

32
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:22,589
and you must suck up to your superiors.

33
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,260
I get all that. I work too.

34
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,360
But if you really cared,

35
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:29,600
you wouldn't have missed both meals.

36
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,339
This means you don't even care.

37
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,110
I'm not trying to put pressure on you.
I'll just tell you how I feel.

38
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,209
I wanted more than anything
for you to do well.

39
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,809
When you said you wanted to study abroad,

40
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:51,380
I was the first to agree,
help you pack, and cheer you on.

41
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:54,219
What did you...

42
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,719
say to me then?

43
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,619
When you came back...

44
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:04,899
You said you'd spoil me.

45
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,230
You said you'd treat me well.

46
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:09,170
At the time,

47
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,739
I didn't want that at all.
I just wanted you to do well.

48
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,040
That was how I actually felt.

49
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:21,209
When I sent you every extra cent
and even more than I could afford,

50
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,380
I wasn't stressed out at all.
I waited for your return excitedly.

51
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,790
I can't complain
because I did it all willingly.

52
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:35,689
But I didn't make the sacrifice
expecting something like this.

53
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,429
Guess what?

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,429
We haven't even...

55
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:46,939
eaten together since you got back.

56
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,480
It really hurts.

57
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,350
You're here.

58
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,360
Hi. Let's go inside.

59
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:10,029
Are you sure Nam Jin's coming tonight?

60
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,130
What?

61
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,429
I think I saw him in some woman's car.

62
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:17,040
He said he had a team dinner.

63
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,540
The woman must be a colleague.

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,369
A team dinner? He'll skip again?
I bought rice cakes.

65
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:24,480
Oh, I don't know. Let's just go inside.

66
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:34,749
Mom. I met Seon Ju outside
and we walked back together.

67
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,119
Did you?

68
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,800
I'll drop by, even if it's a bit late.

69
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,400
I knew it.

70
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:01,249
Oh, dear.

71
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:06,550
You're taking a pretty long break.

72
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:09,020
- Hey.
- Hurry back.

73
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,920
Okay, sure.

74
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:16,999
(Seoul Manna Rice Cakes)

75
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,600
Mom, taste it. It's still warm.

76
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:22,069
Open wide.

77
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:26,110
When will Nam Jin join us?

78
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,340
He has a team dinner, so he'll be late,
but he said he'd come afterward.

79
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,009
What shall I do? Wash my hands?

80
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,550
Separate that into plastic bags.

81
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:41,489
Mom. Why did you buy
a whole box of rice cakes?

82
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,720
I wanted to share with the neighbors too.

83
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,499
- The neighbors?
- Is he at a welcome dinner?

84
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:53,629
The company must be
really pleased he joined.

85
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:54,730
I guess?

86
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,600
He was put on
an important project right away.

87
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,239
I'm glad I have some liquor.

88
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:02,170
We should celebrate with a drink.

89
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,179
It would've been nice
if Mi Ju were here too.

90
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:10,079
She left without a word to me
and now her phone's always off.

91
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,079
Could she be that busy?

92
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,619
Her field is like that.

93
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:17,319
Okay. I'll cook this in the living room.

94
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,790
You two can set things up in here.

95
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:25,460
I can't live like this.

96
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,629
Are you sure Nam Jin will come?

97
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,400
She'll lose her mind if he doesn't.

98
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,439
With Mi Ju gone, we can't eat all this.

99
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,970
He said he'd come after his dinner.

100
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,410
He sent a text.

101
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,509
Are you sure?

102
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,280
That's a relief.

103
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,220
- Cheers.
- Long time no see.

104
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,619
We meet again here, Nam Jin.

105
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,790
You were too busy
to eat out with me in the US.

106
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:56,860
Yes. He refused to join us
even when we said we'd pay.

107
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,699
We thought you disliked us.

108
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:02,069
It's childish to think he disliked you
just because he didn't eat with you.

109
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,470
I like to eat alone too.

110
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,600
What exactly is going on between you two?

111
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,270
You were always together in the US.

112
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,009
Did you have a fling?
Or is it still ongoing?

113
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,949
You're crazy. Are you drunk?

114
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:17,249
What's wrong? "Office wife"
is a common term these days.

115
00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:20,119
Some guys even have
overseas transfer wives.

116
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:21,689
I think you're right.

117
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,389
Good for you, Jin Sang Ah.

118
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,460
It's Nam Jin who got lucky.

119
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:27,889
She's pretty and her dad's
the CEO of Jin Architecture.

120
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:30,699
- For a lover like that...
- Don't go too far.

121
00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:32,629
Nam Jin joined our firm...

122
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:34,429
and I brought him to say hi.

123
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:37,300
Your father hired him right away?

124
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,600
Lucky you.

125
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,340
Yes.

126
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,879
To be able to grab an opportunity
could be considered a skill.

127
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:49,410
You spent a fortune on tuition
and hired someone to write your thesis,

128
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,449
and you're still looking for work,
so it must be hard to admit.

129
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:54,819
- What did you say?
- Stop it!

130
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,119
The more you act out,
the more convinced I am that I'm right.

131
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,629
I had other job offers.

132
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,829
Hey.

133
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,929
Sorry. I should go.

134
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:09,569
Darn you.

135
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,499
- Nam Jin.
- Hey, you!

136
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:12,840
Mr. Jeon!

137
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,639
You can't leave like this.

138
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:20,949
They're just envious.

139
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:24,379
They ran their mouths because
they have nothing but a flashy background.

140
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,090
You'll look bad
if you lash out and then leave.

141
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:29,350
I should go home.

142
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:33,829
- Why?
- My wife wanted to visit her family.

143
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:34,989
I blew her off last time.

144
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:38,300
- I can't do it again.
- Are you that afraid of your wife?

145
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,999
- It's not that I'm afraid...
- What is it, then?

146
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:41,599
Are you that bothered?

147
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,939
She's really something.

148
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:47,510
I set up this gathering just for you.

149
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,809
Is visiting your in-laws that big a deal?

150
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:52,109
Must you ruin the mood then walk off?

151
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:54,449
Didn't I tell you I must be
your priority now?

152
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,150
Even if you're my priority,

153
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,550
I must do my duties to my family
if I'm to stay married.

154
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,790
Is your family that precious
that you want to keep it intact?

155
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:03,359
I'm married with a child too.

156
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:05,420
Exactly. You must get it too.

157
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:11,260
Fine. Leave.

158
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:15,800
Okay. See you tomorrow.

159
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,760
Chu Ah.

160
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,559
Did you get the doctor's note?

161
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,790
You bet I did.

162
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,030
That house will be filled with wailing.
Just you wait.

163
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,010
- Did you see a doctor?
- Yes.

164
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,179
I handed in all the paperwork.

165
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,849
The lawyer said I should get
pretty good compensation.

166
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:08,349
Okay. Well done.

167
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:12,990
The rookie stylist.
She won't cause a problem later, will she?

168
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,160
What can she do?

169
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:16,260
You might not be in the wrong,

170
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,099
but she could spread rumors
that you were abusive.

171
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:22,329
She could twist the story
and complicate things.

172
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:24,300
Don't worry. She's not that smart.

173
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:27,740
If she does that, I'll crush her.

174
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:31,880
You always told me to return
what I was dealt with.

175
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:36,280
That's right. If you give too much,
people take advantage of you.

176
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:41,219
Yes, ma'am.
All you say is wisdom and truth.

177
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:43,390
Go and get changed.

178
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:52,929
"Ali Baba kept all the treasure."

179
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,699
"He treated the wise
and brave Morgiana like his own,"

180
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,010
"and loved her
exactly like he did his children."

181
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,280
The end.

182
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,609
- Dad.
- Yes?

183
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,349
What does it mean
to love a child exactly like their own?

184
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,849
Well,

185
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:12,579
it means he didn't just love
his own children.

186
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,390
He loved them equally.

187
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:18,459
Do people
usually only love their own children?

188
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:20,390
Not always.

189
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,030
- Dad.
- Yes?

190
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,500
What was your dad like?

191
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:28,199
My dad?

192
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:37,439
When the baby bear said
he didn't want to eat,

193
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,050
the mommy bear said this.

194
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:43,010
"You won't grow tall if you don't eat."

195
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,349
So Woo. Are you building a house?

196
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,819
Yes.

197
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,859
Thank you.

198
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,599
Make something even nicer with this.

199
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,959
Okay.

200
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,370
Dad.

201
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,640
Did Grandpa love you a lot?

202
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:09,880
Yes, he was nice to me.

203
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,380
He was very busy...

204
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,679
and couldn't look after just me.

205
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,079
I did feel lonely sometimes.

206
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,250
I see.

207
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,890
That's why I loved
living with your grandpa,

208
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:26,559
grandma, and aunt in a big house.

209
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:39,870
Dad. I don't want to go there.

210
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,040
Where did you get this?

211
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,179
From Mom.

212
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:49,479
You don't have to go
if you don't want to. Why should you?

213
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:51,050
Really?

214
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,120
Yes, really.

215
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:57,859
- Dad, let's build a house.
- What?

216
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:58,920
Shall we?

217
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,189
What house shall we build today?

218
00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:03,559
- Here.
- A house for the three bears.

219
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,699
- The three bears' house? Okay.
- Yes.

220
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,500
Here. Shall we start building?

221
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,609
This goes here.

222
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,540
And then...

223
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,780
Mom always prepares way too much food.

224
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,219
Look at all this.

225
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,420
She bought pork belly too?
We still have some ribs left.

226
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,130
Mom said she wished
every day were like these days.

227
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,260
She brought up the past
and said she's so happy now.

228
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,829
I felt guilty.

229
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,199
My goodness. I can't help but groan.

230
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:45,500
I know. She wants to
hand this out to the neighbors.

231
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,010
What if she really does
tour the neighborhood with Nam Jin?

232
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,780
- What?
- If we tell her about Mi Ju,

233
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:54,780
she'll kill someone.

234
00:13:54,849 --> 00:13:57,349
That's why she must never know.

235
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,219
How are we to handle this on our own?

236
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:05,790
Shouldn't we just tell
and ask everyone for help?

237
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,929
Can you sort it out without Mom knowing?

238
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:11,760
No, but we have no choice.

239
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,229
What could Mom do even if she knew?

240
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:15,400
Nothing.

241
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,339
If she can't do anything
whether she knows or not...

242
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,609
It's best that she doesn't know.

243
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,380
But I'm scared.
It feels like the calm before the storm.

244
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,079
(Criminal Affairs, Police Station)

245
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
(Criminal Affairs, Police Station)

246
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,929
"Criminal Affairs, police station?"

247
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:51,939
How long will she go away for
if we can't settle?

248
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:53,410
I don't know.

249
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:57,439
Nam Jin moved into
a studio apartment his company got him.

250
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,910
What if Ji Hyun and I were to move in
so we can get the security deposit back?

251
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,349
What? You'll spend the deposit
to settle Mi Ju's case...

252
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:09,120
and move in with us without your husband?

253
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,719
As if Mom would welcome you.

254
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:14,929
That's as good as broadcasting
that Widow Plaza is complete.

255
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:16,929
Don't you even think of that.

256
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,099
Darn it.

257
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,429
What should we do, then?

258
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:24,599
Should we let her rot in prison...

259
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:27,240
so she gets a chance to calmly...

260
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:30,079
think about her past and future?

261
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,339
Yes. She could do with that.

262
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,750
That will save us a fortune on food costs.

263
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,150
Hey! What on earth is this about?

264
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,130
- What is it, Mom?
- What's wrong?

265
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,530
What is this police officer saying?

266
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,670
He said something
about a victim bringing a doctor's note.

267
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:56,329
Isn't Mi Ju away at work?

268
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:57,500
A doctor's note?

269
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,670
She wasn't hurt at all. How dare they?

270
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,579
You two. You knew all about it?

271
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,479
Mom, what happened was...

272
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:08,910
It's no big deal.

273
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,819
It was a fender-bender...

274
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:14,650
Why would it cost 55,000 dollars
to settle a fender-bender?

275
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,790
And now with the doctor's note,

276
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,920
if she can't settle,
she'll be sent to lockup.

277
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,189
How is this not a big deal?

278
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,490
What is a big deal to you, then?

279
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,500
Would it be a big deal if I died of shock?

280
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,800
- Mom...
- Lead the way!

281
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:31,199
- Darn it.
- Mom.

282
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,979
This is bad.

283
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,250
Sang Ah's late.

284
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,089
Yes. She must be with someone.

285
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,719
She has a lot of catching up to do
now that she's back.

286
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,420
She would be busy.

287
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,890
So Woo,
don't spend too much time with Tae Ri.

288
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,729
You should meet people too.

289
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,099
Yes. That could benefit our firm too.

290
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:01,400
Sure.

291
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,439
- Sang Ah, you're home.
- Yes.

292
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,010
I'm back.

293
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,380
Did you have a drink?

294
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,910
Try to come home early.

295
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:15,079
You must be tired.

296
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:18,720
You just got back.
Don't work yourself too hard.

297
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,790
Yes. Go right to bed.

298
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,119
I will.

299
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,770
Did you have a lot to drink?

300
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,200
Yes. I met some college friends.

301
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,940
Did you tell Tae Ri...

302
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:43,809
about an international school?

303
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:46,379
- Yes.
- Will you send him away?

304
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:48,609
Yes. Why?

305
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:51,919
You were apart from him for two years.

306
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:55,020
We texted and made video calls.

307
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,450
Once a month if we got lucky.

308
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,460
And only because
I called you and put him on.

309
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,059
You kept count?

310
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:03,089
It's not that.

311
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,800
You were apart for years.
Try to show some care.

312
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,500
Must I be physically present to care?

313
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,770
No, but...

314
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,000
It's different if it's what Tae Ri wants.

315
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,270
Could you consider how he feels too?

316
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:16,069
How do I know how he feels
when I'm not him?

317
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:17,079
Honey.

318
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,309
He's our son.

319
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,480
I guess...

320
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,919
I shouldn't have become a mom.

321
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,690
But you are one now.

322
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,059
Shouldn't you show
some sense of responsibility?

323
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,829
I know I shouldn't feel like this,

324
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,599
but the older he gets,

325
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,899
the stranger he feels to me.

326
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,149
What is it?

327
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,190
Do we have honey tea?

328
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,190
Goodness.

329
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:13,460
Don't drink too much alcohol.

330
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Did you bring up sending Tae Ri
to the international school?

331
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,869
What will you do?

332
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:22,440
I'll send him away.

333
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:24,440
I liked the place you found.

334
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:27,079
Yes. It's the right thing to do.

335
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,419
A kid should grow up a bit rough.
Tae Ri's too coddled and spoiled.

336
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:34,349
If he starts crying for you
and getting clingy, it'll get stressful.

337
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,460
Oh, right.

338
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,230
Be sure to send him,
even if So Woo objects, okay?

339
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:02,750
Gosh, you stink.

340
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,220
How much did you drink?

341
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,720
Watch it.

342
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,690
Did you hand in the doctor's note?

343
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,790
You bet I did.

344
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,919
I couldn't stand how they reacted,

345
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,559
but I was worried you'd let them off
because you knew them.

346
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,030
But you're so exact.

347
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,300
I am.

348
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:20,700
She deserves it.

349
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,399
Hey, I like the look in your eyes.

350
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,069
It's much nicer than the look
the villain in my drama has.

351
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,780
Are you ever going to
get better at acting?

352
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,909
"Are you ever going to
get better at acting?"

353
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,480
My acting's just fine.

354
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,619
Can you free up
your schedule this weekend?

355
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,829
- What for?
- For Tae Ri's new school interview.

356
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,659
I don't think
we should consider that anymore.

357
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:54,369
He's still young.

358
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,430
Come on.

359
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:59,800
That school interviews both parents
and the kid too, in-depth.

360
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,609
Not all applicants are accepted.

361
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,069
Why send him to such a tough place?

362
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,180
He doesn't want to go.

363
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:09,909
He doesn't listen to me
because you coddle him too much.

364
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,619
Did you spend enough time with him
that he got to disobey you?

365
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,159
Tae Ri doesn't want to
sit through tough interviews...

366
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:22,690
and hard classes to learn stuff.

367
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:24,300
He wants to spend time with you.

368
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,430
You said he felt like a stranger.

369
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,629
How could you think of sending him away
when that's how you feel already?

370
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:32,540
You acted like a cool husband
willing to send his wife abroad to study.

371
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,609
Did you hate it
that I left all the childcare to you?

372
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:37,609
Why are we skipping to that topic?

373
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:38,909
I don't dislike that you studied abroad.

374
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,510
It's what you wanted.

375
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,550
Like that,
we can wait until Tae Ri wants to go...

376
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,619
That will be too late.

377
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,550
You asked if I spent time with him.

378
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,490
Did you give me a chance?

379
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,760
You took care of everything
when it came to him.

380
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,190
This is my trying to be a mom for once.

381
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,800
I think it's too much for him to handle.

382
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,859
And he said he didn't want to go.

383
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:03,599
You won't even listen to what I think.

384
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:04,899
We're done discussing that.

385
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:22,690
Oh, my goodness.

386
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,059
Oh, dear.

387
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:32,030
- Oh, my gosh.
- Here you are, Mom.

388
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,460
What's that?

389
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,800
Ms. Shim said it was for you.

390
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,200
She's so thoughtful,
she'd make a perfect in-law.

391
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,740
Help me with this.

392
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,780
Why? Did you hurt yourself?

393
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:47,710
I thought having a garden...

394
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,409
was all about sitting elegantly
and drinking tea outdoors.

395
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:52,379
This lifestyle's killing me.

396
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,889
It's so tough.

397
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:56,190
Hire someone.

398
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,190
They keep quitting on me.

399
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:00,829
You wanted to move here.

400
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,530
You said we should live quietly.

401
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,329
You're enjoying it here but not me.

402
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:07,629
What if I never hire someone to help?

403
00:23:07,629 --> 00:23:09,200
Aren't you too picky?

404
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,270
What are you saying? How am I picky?

405
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:17,909
I'm sorry I'm enjoying this and not you.
I'll go to my room now.

406
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:20,750
Sons are no good once they grow up.

407
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,649
You do all the housework!

408
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:25,680
Or hire someone for me to do it all!

409
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,349
How would I know who to hire?

410
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:30,190
Oh, that hurts.

411
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:33,089
I want to go home.

412
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,329
I miss my sisters' insults...

413
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,260
and Mom's scoldings.

414
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,869
Mom.

415
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:54,609
- Mom!
- Mom!

416
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,550
- Oh, my gosh...
- Mom.

417
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,149
- Oh, no.
- Mom.

418
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,889
- It's too greasy.
- It is.

419
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,030
- Dad.
- Hey.

420
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,599
Hello.

421
00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:13,300
It's just you?

422
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:16,069
Where are the adults?

423
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:17,200
At the police station.

424
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,740
The police station? Why?

425
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,809
Aunt Mi Ju caused a car accident.

426
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,040
She'll go to prison if she can't settle.

427
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:30,980
Some meat...

428
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,319
and seasoned green onions.

429
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,589
This is so good.

430
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,030
According to the spying I've done so far,

431
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,030
something's going on.

432
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,629
I should stake this place out
and find out what that is.

433
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:52,639
Something's not right.

434
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,450
Oh, my goodness. Poor me.

435
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:04,980
Are you her mother?

436
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,550
You can't do this here.

437
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:11,159
I had rotten luck with a husband
and now my kids are letting me down.

438
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:14,460
I was so proud
that I raised my eldest right...

439
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,889
and sent her to a great university.

440
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:20,669
She met a useless guy
and ended up a widow...

441
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:23,530
after just two years of marriage.

442
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:25,700
- Why are you like this, Mom?
- Why do you think?

443
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,510
What kind of woman
could have a life like mine?

444
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,609
You don't live here. Get up.

445
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:33,609
Don't touch me!

446
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,010
You're the worst.

447
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,550
I thought my middle child was smart.

448
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:42,020
You brought home a fool
from goodness knows where...

449
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,159
and let him suck you dry
while he did what he wanted.

450
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:47,730
Mom. Don't take it out on them.

451
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,930
They did nothing wrong.

452
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:52,129
I'm glad you said that.

453
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,700
You're the worst of all!

454
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:59,399
You got up to no good
hoping to become an actress,

455
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:01,909
and almost ruined your life.

456
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,780
And now look at you, sitting behind bars!

457
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,909
- Mom!
- Mom.

458
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,409
- Talk it out with them.
- Stop it.

459
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:11,450
Mom, don't do this to her.

460
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,419
Woe is me.

461
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:16,619
I gave him three girls...

462
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:21,089
and my husband ran away from home.

463
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:24,530
Now that he got a son out of wedlock,

464
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:27,829
he won't ever come back to me.

465
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,669
I was left with daughters and no husband.

466
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,369
Whatever the people said about us,

467
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:38,079
I swore I'd raise them even better
than I would if I'd had a husband.

468
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:42,550
I went to such lengths
as I grit my teeth to raise them.

469
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,550
You're not bad looking or stupid
so why are you all like this?

470
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,720
I thought you were out making money.

471
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,589
Is this work?

472
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,659
How is this a business trip?

473
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:56,889
Did I work on my feet...

474
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,200
and darn day long
perming other people's hair...

475
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:05,099
and putting up with their cynical remarks
about how useless you were?

476
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,540
- Mom.
- Mom. I'm sorry.

477
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,540
- Don't cry.
- Let go of me.

478
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,510
Don't touch me, any of you.

479
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,550
What kind of accident was it?

480
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,589
Well...

481
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,720
Was it 30,000 dollars?

482
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:28,460
Or 50,000 dollars? Something like that.

483
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:31,859
Is 50,000 dollars the same as
100 five-dollar bills?

484
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,800
No, it's the same as
ten thousand five-dollar bills.

485
00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:37,470
That's huge.

486
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:42,240
My gosh.

487
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,540
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

488
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,530
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

489
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:03,730
Why does Mother
expect you to sacrifice so much?

490
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,399
Honey!

491
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,129
This house is a complete mess.

492
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,770
Mom closed the hair salon and went out.

493
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,470
She's off to meet the other car owner.

494
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:15,040
She dragged Mi Ju with her.

495
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:17,780
The other car owner's mom
is coming to the salon.

496
00:28:18,109 --> 00:28:19,240
This is it, Mom.

497
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,950
"Grace Shim?"

498
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,919
