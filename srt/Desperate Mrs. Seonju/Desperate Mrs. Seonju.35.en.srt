00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,760
(Episode 35)

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,100
Darn him.

3
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,679
Let's go, Tae Ri.

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,679
Tae Ri. Let's go.

5
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,319
Bye.

6
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:43,620
Bye, Tae Ri.

7
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:46,489
Just a moment.

8
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:50,559
(Father)

9
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,470
Hello?

10
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,140
I need you
to come to the office immediately.

11
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:04,209
I said all I had to say.

12
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,010
I'm sorry, Father.

13
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,709
Why didn't you tell me
about Sang Ah and Mr. Jeon?

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,050
Come over. Let's talk face-to-face.

15
00:01:12,919 --> 00:01:14,190
I'll be waiting.

16
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,840
Tae Ri. Let's go to Seoul for a bit.

17
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:32,569
Let's go.

18
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,220
Do as your dad says
and at least pretend to apologize.

19
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,019
He was your high school friend's husband.

20
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,619
I hate that family too.

21
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,560
I don't want anything from
or to do with them.

22
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,890
And you want me to accept
their son-in-law as mine?

23
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:58,000
"Son-in-law?" You're going too far ahead.

24
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,599
Are you saying that won't happen?
I don't have anything to worry about?

25
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,840
We got the money that family owed us...

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,269
and Mr. Jeon's divorced.

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,610
Why would we get involved
with that family again?

28
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,909
So you'll keep seeing him?

29
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,679
How far are you going to go with him?

30
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,709
I didn't have any plans or ideas,

31
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,749
but if everyone's so against it,
I might as well marry Mr. Jeon.

32
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:19,890
What?

33
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:22,420
I get why Dad's reacting the way he is,

34
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,689
but why do you dislike Nam Jin so much?

35
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:28,330
If both you and Dad keep this up...

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,800
You know how I go all the way
when someone tries to stop me.

37
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,469
Sang Ah.

38
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,640
My goodness.

39
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,570
The director's not in.

40
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:42,369
What kind of owner is never around?

41
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,140
When is she in?

42
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,749
Why is it this hard to spend here?

43
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:50,420
I told you that you need an appointment.

44
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:51,820
Shall I help you with that?

45
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,420
I dislike that appointment system so much.

46
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:57,760
Since when did we care so much about it?

47
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,160
Let's see how it works here.

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,100
She's available on...

49
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,170
Shall we go?

50
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,800
Dad. I'm sleepy.

51
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,439
I want to lie in the back.

52
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:14,809
Do you? Okay, then.

53
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,519
(Glamping Ground)

54
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,380
You didn't drive here?

55
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:58,219
Where are you headed?

56
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:02,760
Well, if you're headed to Seoul...

57
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:04,689
do you want a ride?

58
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,330
Is that okay with you?

59
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:08,489
Yes.

60
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,280
Why didn't you drive?

61
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,150
My car exploded, so I scrapped it.

62
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,050
- It exploded?
- Yes.

63
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,489
I see.

64
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,650
I got some coffee. Drink this.

65
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,020
Here.

66
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,730
Didn't you get your car checked
at the garage we went to?

67
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,989
I know.

68
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:20,129
I thought I was doing well,
but I'm only good at struggling.

69
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:22,429
How did your car explode?

70
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,410
It was what you'd expect.
There was a loud boom...

71
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,540
and then there was fire and smoke.

72
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:30,639
Have you seen a car explode?

73
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,610
It's really scary.

74
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,650
No, I haven't seen it.

75
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:39,449
I told you how our cars were close by...

76
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:43,290
and it felt like
my husband chose her over me.

77
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:47,230
The moment he chose to ride in her car,

78
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,259
my car must've felt angry too.

79
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:51,860
That's when it blew up.

80
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,499
Oh, dear. I said some things
a kid shouldn't hear.

81
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,639
Is he asleep?

82
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,610
Yes. He must've been tired.

83
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,780
Yes. Shall we get going?

84
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,980
- Yes.
- Okay, then.

85
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,319
(I Lost My Memory but I Want Revenge)

86
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,819
Why did the housing prices
suddenly shoot up?

87
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:20,889
The numbers went up
like the ratings of a show...

88
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:22,259
- Blackmailer.
- My gosh.

89
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,230
What were you saying to yourself?

90
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:27,730
Why did you jump?
Are you guilty of something?

91
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:29,869
Hey.

92
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,369
What's that weird look?

93
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,670
Did a guy reject you?

94
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,869
No.

95
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:38,009
No what? To the rejection or the guilt?

96
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,210
I'm not a blackmailer.

97
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,949
Oh, then you do feel guilty
and you were rejected.

98
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,720
Come on.

99
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,319
You made me sign a contract
so I wouldn't tell.

100
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,720
Why do you keep talking to me?

101
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,989
The contract was to prevent you
from mentioning that incident.

102
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:53,429
You're allowed to respond
when I talk to you.

103
00:06:53,429 --> 00:06:54,559
Oh, I see.

104
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:57,860
You haven't been going around
telling anyone, have you?

105
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,369
Any weird rumors
will ruin my flawless reputation.

106
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:04,770
You're not flawless.

107
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,770
Who has been telling you
your reputation's flawless?

108
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,939
Why do you always talk back at me?

109
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:12,139
Was that not in the contract?

110
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,879
- It wasn't.
- Woo Sang.

111
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,819
Do you want coffee?

112
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,520
No. I had some already.

113
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:21,619
What are you doing here?

114
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,720
I'm cleaning the room.

115
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,660
- Woo Sang.
- Hi, Mom.

116
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,759
The reporter's here. Hurry.

117
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,030
Then stick to cleaning up.

118
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:33,499
No.

119
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:35,470
You can finish up.

120
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:36,699
How dare you boss me around?

121
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,710
Darn it.

122
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,579
I didn't expect...

123
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,949
the property prices to go up.

124
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:54,220
I'm flustered too.

125
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,059
I know. How do you think we feel, then?

126
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,790
That wasn't my doing, though.

127
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,059
You're right. It wasn't anyone's fault.

128
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,759
That's just the state of my life.

129
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:10,470
I thought I'd hit rock bottom
with the divorce.

130
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,540
But then a sinkhole appeared.

131
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,610
I'm going endlessly down.

132
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,679
I'm divorced. I lost my job.

133
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,110
I lost my house.

134
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:26,179
Now Mom sold her house
and the prices went up.

135
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,689
I'm still in shock
about my husband's betrayal,

136
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,259
but I think the pain of the betrayal
of the property market stings more.

137
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,800
You can drop me off
at the subway station over there.

138
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,199
Oh, okay.

139
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:46,000
(Subway)

140
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,219
We wouldn't have sold the house...

141
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:00,250
if we didn't need the money urgently.

142
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,020
I told you, didn't I?

143
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,589
My sister got into...

144
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:07,959
a car accident
with my ex's mistress' sister.

145
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,130
- Yes.
- We sold the house...

146
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,929
because we needed the money to settle.

147
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,569
But as soon as the house sold,
we heard of the development plans.

148
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:19,339
It felt as if I'd been struck
by lightning.

149
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,309
Now even the down payments
for long-term leases have gone up.

150
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:26,410
What did we do wrong
to deserve this kind of punishment?

151
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,949
My mom's ill in bed
with disappointment and stress.

152
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:34,290
Well...

153
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,219
I'm sorry you're in that situation.

154
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,490
Right? It's terrible, isn't it?

155
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:44,130
I bet this is a rare occurrence.

156
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,199
So could you please, just once...

157
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:48,569
I can't help.

158
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,199
Why not?

159
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,339
You're allowed to return a purchase
within a certain time frame,

160
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,339
and even divorces
take a while to be finalized.

161
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,880
Do you have no leeway
when you just bought...

162
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,109
something as huge
and important as a house?

163
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,050
You know you're pleading
when you have no grounds to, right?

164
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,929
I know I'm making a nonsensical request.

165
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:21,429
But I'm in a position
where I must at least try anything.

166
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,339
Just so I'm not left with regrets.

167
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,510
I just blurted out whatever came to mind.

168
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,349
I'm sorry for intruding
when you were camping with your son.

169
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,449
Have you found a job yet?

170
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,459
Are you still looking?

171
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:46,729
Yes.

172
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:50,059
Did you hear from Jin Architecture?

173
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,900
I messed up the job interview.

174
00:10:53,229 --> 00:10:55,030
Stop rubbing salt into the wound.

175
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:00,569
Hey. Your son's coughing.

176
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,109
Oh, dear. He has a fever.

177
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
Does he?

178
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,750
What should I do?

179
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,319
It could be a cold.
Take him home so he can sleep.

180
00:11:16,349 --> 00:11:17,359
Okay.

181
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:20,790
Oh, right. You said you don't have a home.

182
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:23,859
Do you have a relative
you can call for help?

183
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,800
If you don't,
shall I watch him for a while?

184
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,709
I think it's because he's tired.

185
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:38,410
He might feel better after a short nap.

186
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,949
Well...

187
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,949
You wouldn't mind?

188
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,890
You gave me a ride back to Seoul,

189
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,920
and I owe you for this and that.

190
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:53,859
Pick him up when you're done.

191
00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:58,160
Will you do that for me, then?

192
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,900
- Sure.
- Thanks.

193
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,439
You took a long break from acting...

194
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,609
before appearing briefly
in your son's drama.

195
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:18,650
I see why you focused on being a mom
to raise your lovely son.

196
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,890
Thanks.

197
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,990
I felt great about it
even though I couldn't act.

198
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,729
We didn't know for a long time
that he was your son.

199
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:29,359
He didn't tell anyone.

200
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,400
Were you ashamed of me?

201
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:34,270
I can't deny that completely,

202
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:37,300
but I was more ashamed
of the possibility...

203
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,540
that I might have to
promote myself as her son.

204
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,109
He won't let me mention a lot of things.

205
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,880
I didn't tell anyone about this
because he didn't want me to,

206
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,050
but he struggled a lot as a child
because he was ill.

207
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,780
Mom.

208
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,120
- What?
- Is that true?

209
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,150
Oh. He used to be ill.

210
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:07,199
I'm sorry and grateful
for the offer to look after him.

211
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:11,000
It's fine. In return,
you drove me from door to door.

212
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,709
Tell your dad you'll see him later.

213
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,309
- See you later.
- Okay.

214
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,679
I won't be long.

215
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,650
Bye.

216
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,949
Let's go inside.

217
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,390
Finally, let me ask
what your ideal woman would be like.

218
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:39,459
Does it match the daughter-in-law material
your mother wants?

219
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,300
It might be hard
to find someone we both like,

220
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,469
but I only care about
whether we have a connection.

221
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,069
That's me.

222
00:13:47,069 --> 00:13:49,240
I care less about looks and careers...

223
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,640
and more about her family background.

224
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,079
What do you mean by that?

225
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,849
I'm not talking about
whether she's rich or poor.

226
00:13:55,849 --> 00:13:58,949
I want her to be from a family
where common sense means something.

227
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:01,719
People who are ill-mannered or wild...

228
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:04,120
They scare me.

229
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:05,589
I see.

230
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,890
I hope you find someone you both like...

231
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,160
and good luck with the drama.

232
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:12,400
That's all from us...

233
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,670
at the set of "I Lost My Memory
but I Want Revenge."

234
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,740
Goodbye, everyone.

235
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,969
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

236
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,679
- Good job.
- Well done. Thank you.

237
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,679
Everyone. I'll treat you all to dinner.

238
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:31,650
Ms. Oh. I'll come with you.

239
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,979
Wait.

240
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,719
You won't come too?

241
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,459
Don't mind me.

242
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:41,329
She's not a full-time crew member.

243
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:44,199
She plays an on-and-off character.

244
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,630
Yes, come with us.
You helped me carry a heavy load.

245
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:49,630
Do that later and come with us.

246
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Shall I, then?

247
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,339
I like how approachable you are.

248
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,410
Let's go. Come with me.

249
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Come along. Let's go and eat.

250
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:10,719
Did you see Empress Jin's clip?

251
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,319
Oh, my gosh, yes.

252
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:13,959
- It was insane.
- Right?

253
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:15,929
I feel so sorry for Mr. Kim.

254
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:17,000
Empress Jin...

255
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,099
Hello, sir.

256
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,240
I called everyone over.

257
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,839
Take a seat.

258
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:43,990
Mr. Jeon and Sang Ah.
Apologize to Mr. Kim.

259
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,729
No, sir. You don't have to do this.

260
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:49,130
Don't say that.

261
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,729
You two. Apologize and end it.

262
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:54,000
I'll find Mr. Jeon a new job.

263
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,069
I'm...

264
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,900
in love with Ms. Jin.

265
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,609
Dad. We're not children. We're adults.

266
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:05,040
However angry you are,
handling it like this...

267
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,380
How adult-like did you act?

268
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,650
How dare you let
a video like that get out?

269
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:13,719
Why are you so angry about it?

270
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,719
Did we kill someone?

271
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,959
What?

272
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:19,390
It's all on me.

273
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,260
If you want someone
to vent at and criticize,

274
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,199
I'll take it.

275
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:31,770
I'm even relieved
that it's in the open now.

276
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,609
I don't have to explain anything.

277
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:34,939
What utter nonsense...

278
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,079
You two! Get out!

279
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:50,219
My goodness...

280
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,589
Even if they come around...

281
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,660
I won't.

282
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,699
So Woo. I'll scold Sang Ah
and keep her under control.

283
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:03,939
Come back to work.

284
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,709
The company's suffering a great deal.

285
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,640
I'm sorry, sir.

286
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,379
Wait. So Woo.

287
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
Oh, dear.

288
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,960
Go back in there and explain.

289
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,569
Tell him that even before I met Mr. Jeon,

290
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:38,500
even before I went abroad to study,

291
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,540
we clashed over how to raise Tae Ri.

292
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,940
Say that led up to this.

293
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:43,579
When a kid isn't normal,

294
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,710
the marriage is either strengthened
or it breaks it up.

295
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,609
- That's always the case.
- What?

296
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,180
We're the latter.

297
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:52,220
Tell him that.

298
00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:54,889
- You really...
- What?

299
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:56,520
It's partially true.

300
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,990
You have an odd logic.

301
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,129
I used to think it was charming
and that you were confident.

302
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,760
But I was just stupid.

303
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,800
- And you're crazy.
- What?

304
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,710
That's not confidence. It's shamelessness.

305
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,940
How can you...

306
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,309
You can't say that to me.

307
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:19,339
Do you know the situation I'm in?

308
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:22,550
Everyone knows I cheated
and no one takes me seriously.

309
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,619
Is that my fault?

310
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:28,619
Why did you complicate things
by asking for a divorce now?

311
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,659
And what? You're saying I'm crazy?

312
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,889
How dare you?

313
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:36,129
Can you step aside?

314
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,940
Darn it.

315
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:48,909
Shoot.

316
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:54,680
When Ms. Oh says "I lost my memory,"

317
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,710
we'll reply with "but I want revenge."

318
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,879
- Okay.
- Okay.

319
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:00,020
I lost my memory.

320
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,119
- But I want revenge!
- But I want revenge!

321
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,260
- Good work, everyone.
- Thank you.

322
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:06,690
- You too.
- Good job.

323
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:15,569
Who here thinks they can liven the mood?

324
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,540
Anyone?

325
00:19:20,069 --> 00:19:21,109
Me.

326
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,839
I'll sing a song
to thank you for the meal.

327
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,809
- Great.
- Pi Mi Ju.

328
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:30,550
- Sing.
- Let's listen.

329
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:33,450
Okay, then.

330
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,419
I'll miss the first beat.
I'll miss the second beat.

331
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:41,690
I'll miss the third beat,
and one, two, three, four.

332
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,659
Director. My watch is missing.

333
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,300
Look for it carefully.

334
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:50,030
It cost 10,000 dollars.

335
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:52,839
None of you can leave the table.

336
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,440
I'll call the police and have them look.

337
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,609
- What?
- Hey.

338
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,040
Look carefully
before you call the police over this.

339
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,720
I want to see what's in all your bags.

340
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,550
- Me too?
- Starting with you.

341
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,159
Why on earth is that...

342
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:22,169
Why was that...

343
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,169
Do you feel better now?

344
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,980
- Yes.
- Then let's play doctors and nurses.

345
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,849
You too.

346
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,680
That's childish. Who wants to play that?

347
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:39,680
Then can I be the doctor?

348
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,050
Yes. You'd better do a good job.

349
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:43,790
I'll be the mom.

350
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,619
You're the patient,
so lie down on your back.

351
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:50,089
My son says his tummy hurts.

352
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:52,559
When I must cut open his stomach.

353
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:55,270
It hurts because some germs got in.

354
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,470
I must take out his organs,
wash them clean, and put them back.

355
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,300
Really? Okay.

356
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,510
Now get ready.

357
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,409
It's operation time!

358
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,379
- I found one of his organs.
- Let's find the others.

359
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,089
- This is fun.
- Mister.

360
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:16,490
Dad.

361
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,220
Do you feel better, Tae Ri?

362
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,129
Yes. Ms. Pi gave me porridge and medicine.

363
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,730
Dad will go in and say thank you.
Play some more as you wait.

364
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,829
- Okay.
- Okay.

365
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:31,540
- Resume the operation.
- Lie down.

366
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,109
- No wait.
- Again.

367
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:36,069
Here comes an injection.

368
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:45,550
Excuse me.

369
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,460
Did you find a place
we can move to that's within the budget?

370
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:00,970
We can't find a place
big enough for us six.

371
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:08,809
The guy who bought our house said
we can't keep the salon either?

372
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:11,040
- That's right.
- Oh, dear.

373
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,409
How about I meet him and beg?

374
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:18,149
I tried everything already.

375
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:21,220
He has some reasons of his own.

376
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,990
You care so much about others.

377
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,559
Does this mean...

378
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,960
we're going to be homeless?

379
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:35,629
This must be what it's like
to suddenly lose everything.

380
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,069
Oh, dear.

381
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,569
I might as well shave my head
and move to a temple.

382
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:44,579
How can I perm other people's hair
when my head's about to explode?

383
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,050
We have nowhere to go...

384
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,119
and the weather's getting colder.

385
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:54,649
We should've waited
just a few more days to sell the house.

386
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,720
It's my fault.

387
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,059
Mom. Snap my head off.

388
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,389
Or hang me in the town square.

389
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,730
I deserve that
for making you sell your house.

390
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,960
Be quiet.

391
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,000
Hey. The guy who bought the house.

392
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:11,540
If he only has the kid,

393
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,700
can't he live with us?

394
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,710
It'll be like taking in a lodger.

395
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,579
He can move in with his son.

396
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,809
- Like in one of those famous stories.
- Yes.

397
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,079
"My dear landlady."

398
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,250
Come on.

399
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,919
He's the house owner
and we're the intruders.

400
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:33,690
You want him to be a lodger
in his own house?

401
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,690
Does that make sense?

402
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,530
- It doesn't?
- It could.

403
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:41,399
He bought the place
to live alone with his son.

404
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:43,839
If all of us
were to force ourselves on him,

405
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,369
that would be asking too much of him.

406
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:48,240
Would it?

407
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:52,809
If I were to ask, he'd stop me
from even finishing the sentence.

408
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,950
The one word he said...

409
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,020
the most to me today was "no."

410
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,290
Goodness.

411
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
The profit he stands to make
from this house...

412
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,589
is more than I made working my whole life.

413
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,129
How is he so mean?

414
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:10,329
He said he didn't know this would happen.

415
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:13,760
Even he'd be flustered...

416
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,530
if this happened after he sold his place.

417
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:18,970
We need to move out.

418
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,669
Oh, dear.

419
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,980
I'll see if I can find...

420
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:27,040
a salon that provides...

421
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,250
food and lodging.

422
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,649
You'll never find one.

423
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:35,349
Then I'll ask local diners.

424
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,559
I'm sure I'll find something that works.

425
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:41,359
- Mom.
- You can't do that with the kids.

426
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:43,389
One less person should help.

427
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,629
Jin Ju and Dong Won. Seon Ju and Ji Hyun.

428
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,000
You can split into twos
and Mi Ju can live alone.

429
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,700
Find as many studio apartments as you can.

430
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,909
Until we can all get back together,

431
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,180
let's fend for ourselves.

432
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,050
Mom.

433
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,819
If only he would let me keep the salon,

434
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,589
I'd be able to eat and sleep there.

435
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,089
I can't help it if he said no.

436
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,730
Oh, dear...

437
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,730
Are the kids still in the yard?

438
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,000
Give them dinner.

439
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:26,800
I need to lie down.

440
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,309
Oh, dear...

441
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:48,659
- Hello.
- You're back.

442
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,669
Hey. Why are you so downcast?

443
00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:57,940
Are you done for the day?

444
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,599
I got fired.

445
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,020
I'll go on my way, then.

446
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,419
Okay.

447
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,149
I got this for you.

448
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:16,589
Share it with everyone.

449
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,520
- Okay. Thanks.
- Sure.

450
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:20,589
Bye, then.

451
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,899
- You can go.
- You're well.

452
00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:31,500
- You can go home.
- You need to pay.

453
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,639
- Tae Ri. Let's go.
- It's 1,000 dollars.

454
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:35,339
Right now?

455
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:37,680
It'll get dark soon. We must hurry.

456
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,680
- I'll see you again.
- Okay.

457
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,379
- Bye.
- Bye.

458
00:26:43,379 --> 00:26:45,980
- Take care.
- Bye.

459
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,349
Bye.

460
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:51,319
That was a hard operation.

461
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:56,889
Hey.

462
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,470
- I feel bad for them.
- What?

463
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:11,639
If we move in,

464
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,609
they have nowhere to go.

465
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:21,690
When you get to know someone,
you always end up...

466
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,950
seeing something that makes you feel bad.

467
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,889
But we can't help everyone.

468
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,690
Don't worry too much, okay?

469
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,500
Let's go.

470
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,230
Excuse me. Hey.

471
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,700
Yes?

472
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,869
Wait here, Tae Ri.

473
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:46,510
- Yes?
- You left this behind.

474
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,680
Oh, I see. Thank you.

475
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,780
This is fever medicine.

476
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,020
Take it with you, just in case.

477
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:57,319
(Medicine, Kim Tae Ri)

478
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,260
Bye.

479
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,129
Wait. So...

480
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,829
Well...

481
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:11,240
Your mother.

482
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,409
She mentioned us living together.

483
00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:15,970
Oh, that?

484
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:20,280
My mom tends to say
weird things sometimes.

485
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,609
She blurted out whatever idea she had
because she was stressed out.

486
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:24,780
Don't mind it at all.

487
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,089
If we're to do that,

488
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,960
what should we do and how?

489
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,839
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

490
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,790
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

491
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,760
What does the house owner do?

492
00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:08,430
Our relationship could be quite awkward.

493
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,730
Why would it be awkward?

494
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:13,300
It's not like your wife
and my ex-husband are seeing each other.

495
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,800
So Woo. My husband fainted.

496
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,740
Can't you return to the company?

497
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,369
How would you feel if you were to see...

498
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:21,339
- Mr. Jeon's ex-wife?
- What are you talking about?

499
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:23,609
I'm saying I'll be shameless too.
