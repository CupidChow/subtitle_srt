1
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,030
We're being such a nuisance.

2
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,339
Please.

3
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,539
Spare us just two hours of your time.

4
00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:31,710
Still, I think it's a bit...

5
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,050
Jin Ju's friend, the TV show director,

6
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,920
was going to help us out.

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,080
But it turned out
he was the groom's brother.

8
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:42,220
Good people do stuff like this too.

9
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,360
I'm not that good a person.

10
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,129
So...

11
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,059
- I don't think I can...
- If you can't,

12
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:51,459
I can't get married.

13
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:54,729
If you put it like that,

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,870
it sounds like
I'm the reason you can't marry.

15
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,070
I don't think that's the case.

16
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,809
When you're busy with work,

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,449
I pick up Tae Ri from kindergarten a lot.

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,580
Didn't we agree to help each other out?

19
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:12,279
I'm pregnant as well.

20
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:14,550
To be honest,

21
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,819
we're not doing this because we want to.

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,789
Jeong Woo Sang suggested they do this.

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,230
That must be how much
he wants to marry her.

24
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:29,129
I'm really ashamed and humiliated...

25
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:31,899
to ask you to help out...

26
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:34,509
Why are you crying?

27
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:36,640
I apologize.

28
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:40,280
Please don't just say no.

29
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,920
Could you at least think about it?

30
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:47,349
My gosh.

31
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:54,259
(Episode 64)

32
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,530
- Hey.
- What?

33
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,399
I was at Ms. Shim's salon today.

34
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,200
She's pretty cool-headed.

35
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,970
- Is she?
- She congratulated me.

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,269
See?

37
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:04,399
What did I tell you?

38
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,810
I guess I was overly concerned.

39
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:12,140
I looked at Mi Ju more objectively
and she has some good points too.

40
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,280
- Does she?
- She's lacking in many ways,

41
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,450
but she does care about Woo Sang a lot.

42
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:21,189
Rather than marry him off
to someone with a suitable background,

43
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:22,559
this might be better for him.

44
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:25,189
I'll be a grandma soon too.

45
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:31,929
My battery of love must be flat

46
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:34,630
We're done.

47
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,869
Why were you singing?

48
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,600
Did you hear some good news?

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,969
Stop prying. Pay up and leave.

50
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,580
- Here.
- You're a regular,

51
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,809
so all you pay is ten dollars.

52
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:49,980
- Get lost.
- I'm here often instead.

53
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:52,380
- See you.
- Bye.

54
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,089
Did you forget something?

55
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,330
Hey.

56
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:08,600
Why did you come back?

57
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,269
I see you often these days.

58
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,610
You talked about an interest-free loan.

59
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,739
Are you here
to collect money I don't owe you?

60
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:27,350
A photo of your daughters.

61
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,059
I recognize her from when she was young.

62
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:32,760
This is the second,

63
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:35,029
and this is the third.

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,559
You're acting weird.

65
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:40,230
We got into a huge fight
the last time we met.

66
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,399
Why are you acting like
we haven't met in a while?

67
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,369
How is your eldest doing?

68
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:48,410
Your middle daughter
got divorced recently.

69
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,410
Darn you!

70
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,910
Stop worrying about us
and worry about your own family!

71
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,820
Oh, do you remember Dong Soo's dad?

72
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,350
Stop bringing up the past.

73
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,649
He recently...

74
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:03,559
Do as you're told and stop mentioning it.

75
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:05,920
Your family doesn't seem to know
about Dong Soo.

76
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,130
What if his dad
were to come looking for you?

77
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,059
Are you blackmailing me?

78
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:14,730
That's why you need to live
an honest life.

79
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:16,869
Then blessings come knocking at the door.

80
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,540
Look at me. I was an honest woman,

81
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,769
and Mi Ju...

82
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,309
is about to bring me a great son-in-law.

83
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,639
Am I wrong?

84
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,819
Sure. I wish you the best of luck.

85
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:38,389
My gosh. What was that about?

86
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:40,860
She's so strong the door slammed.

87
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,129
What did she come here for?

88
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:48,670
This should free up
the space for the sculpture.

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,900
Let's go with this plan.

90
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,670
- Okay?
- Okay.

91
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,110
By the way,

92
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,939
my sister asked for the favor, didn't she?

93
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,179
Oh, that?

94
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,550
Yes.

95
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:04,020
It's awkward, isn't it?

96
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,619
It is.

97
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:08,150
No one has ever
asked me to do that before.

98
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,520
I apologize.

99
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,860
Why should you feel bad?

100
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:15,860
I have a feeling...

101
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:18,929
that all this is partially my fault.

102
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,530
How so?

103
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,499
If I'd managed
to find someone to stand in,

104
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,239
they wouldn't have asked for your help.

105
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,579
And before that, if I'd managed...

106
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:32,639
to stay married
instead of getting divorced,

107
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,119
then maybe my mom
wouldn't have made this decision at all.

108
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,650
And maybe Mi Ju
and her fiance wouldn't have...

109
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,590
decided to lie about our family.

110
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,590
Are you...

111
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,629
the root of all evil?

112
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,100
- What?
- Why blame yourself...

113
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,559
for every bad thing that happens?

114
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:55,400
Your younger sister and her fiance...

115
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,100
and your mother's decision
are theirs alone.

116
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,739
Your responsibility in all this
is even less than this.

117
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,679
If someone makes a decision,
that's completely up to them.

118
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,150
Don't think like that.

119
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,879
You can do what you want too.

120
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,689
Still, I feel like I'm one of the causes,

121
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:17,759
and I'm not doing anything to help her.

122
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,660
It feels wrong.

123
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,389
You think everything is your fault...

124
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,730
and you must do something about it.

125
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,759
Stop thinking like that.

126
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,300
You have a strong sense of responsibility.

127
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,340
Don't you think you're being...

128
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,069
too desperate to be kind?

129
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,679
Thanks.

130
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,050
I can't believe we're asking you
to pretend to be a husband.

131
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:51,989
Do you regret getting to know my family?

132
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,929
Do you blame yourself
for buying our house?

133
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:00,470
No.

134
00:07:00,929 --> 00:07:01,999
I don't.

135
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:03,699
Why would I regret that?

136
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,770
Come on.

137
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,970
Stop returning to that topic.

138
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,079
Okay, my bad. I was joking.

139
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,550
Goodness.

140
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:24,389
I can't believe we're asking you
to pretend to be a husband.

141
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,329
Do you regret getting to know my family?

142
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,239
- Hello?
- Mi Ju.

143
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,210
Yes, hello.

144
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,509
Did you find people...

145
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,780
to pretend to be your brothers-in-law
at the wedding?

146
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:53,189
No. I asked our upstairs neighbor...

147
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:55,920
who's our homeowner to do us a favor.

148
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,960
Your homeowner?

149
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,860
Kim So Woo?

150
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:01,189
What is it now?

151
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:03,759
We said all we had to say.

152
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,600
You can't marry her.

153
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,300
What? Why not?

154
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,340
You're her enemy
because you ruined her family.

155
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,069
- What?
- Her and I.

156
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,170
Do you remember the accident I caused?

157
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,579
- Yes.
- I put the blame on her.

158
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,980
That's on you. Why am I her enemy?

159
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,579
You were in the car with me.

160
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,249
Her family lost their house
because of the accident.

161
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:30,790
I'll tell that you were there
and that you ran away.

162
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:34,129
If I say you knew everything,
chose to keep quiet,

163
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,160
and let her family sell their house,

164
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:37,600
not just Mi Ju...

165
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:40,569
but the whole world will criticize you.

166
00:08:40,569 --> 00:08:43,500
You're a horrible person.

167
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,900
The truth will hurt you more than me.

168
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,069
Why? Because you're the bigger star.

169
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:52,010
Whatever you say,
what you did is a worse crime.

170
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,010
I can never have you if you marry Mi Ju.

171
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,679
I'll ruin you
so you can never return to acting.

172
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:01,689
I'll ruin Mi Ju as well!

173
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,490
Fine. Let's do this.

174
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,300
Let's get the police
to decide who did worse...

175
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:12,630
and either pay the price or be ruined!

176
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't you feel sorry for me at all?

177
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,099
Why do you think...

178
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,370
I'd go as far as to tell you this?

179
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,809
I will...

180
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,709
let it go just this once
because you have a life and career.

181
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:31,650
But you need to know
what you did was horrible.

182
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,250
Remember that.

183
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:37,189
Don't harass Mi Ju or me ever again.

184
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:40,859
I don't want to see you from now on.

185
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,630
Let's say...

186
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:46,300
we're even now.

187
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:06,949
I guess you are...

188
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,390
nosier than I thought.

189
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,630
You'll pretend to be someone's husband
and attend a wedding you don't care about?

190
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:16,400
Oh, that?

191
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,559
I didn't give them an answer yet.

192
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:24,099
But why do you care about it
that you're being so nosy?

193
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,670
You're unrelated to Ms. Pi now.

194
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,309
I find it odd that you'd ask about it.

195
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,449
Mr. Kim. I went over all the revisions.

196
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:36,050
- Already?
- Yes.

197
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,420
Then shall we talk in the meeting room?

198
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:40,990
Okay.

199
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:49,530
What the...

200
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,309
Seon Ju and So Woo.
They're always together.

201
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,550
I'd say they're together 24-7.

202
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:12,780
He and Seon Ju...

203
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,589
will pretend to be married now?

204
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,390
Hello.

205
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:24,199
Is the K-Culture Town project
making any progress?

206
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,900
Yes, sir. Don't worry about it.

207
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:27,900
Okay. Keep up the work.

208
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:29,469
I will.

209
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:31,599
Bye, then.

210
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:50,459
(Team Leader's Office, Kim So Woo)

211

(Jin Architecture)

212
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:06,740
Oh, dear. I'm very sorry.

213
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,410
Don't mind it.

214
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,790
You said you paid 10,000 dollars
for hair care and facials.

215
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,219
Why do you look more haggard?

216
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,530
What? You think so?

217
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:31,329
Why don't you come to my bar
to drink instead?

218
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:33,800
Your skin would look better.
You wasted your money.

219
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,900
I paid a fortune for them
to use two kinds of lotion...

220
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,910
and shine a light on my face,
and it did me no good?

221
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,609
You're the fool for paying that much.

222
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,010
Yes.

223
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:45,839
You get the best skin...

224
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,650
by sitting at home
and massaging a pack into your face.

225
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:52,550
I went there hoping to meet
some classy people...

226
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,020
and wasted my money.

227
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:58,660
Hey. The baby's swaddling clothes.

228
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:00,290
What should I do with it?

229
00:13:00,859 --> 00:13:03,599
I wanted something of Seon Ju's,
but I got her younger sister's clothing.

230
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:05,900
Then put it back and get something else.

231
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,099
I can't go back there.

232
00:13:07,099 --> 00:13:09,630
I'd feel jinxed and unlucky
until I got the right thing.

233
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,040
Come with me, then.

234
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:25,050
Aren't you...

235
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,250
sharing too many
personal things with Seon Ju?

236
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,120
- What do you mean?
- About yourself and Tae Ri.

237
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,689
Why are you telling her
such private details?

238
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,099
Do you discuss with me
what you tell Mr. Jeon?

239
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:42,300
Don't mind what Ms. Pi and I talk about.

240
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,140
Does Pi Seon Ju appeal to you as a woman?

241
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:48,209
Why won't you answer?

242
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:51,079
Because I'm in disbelief.

243
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,079
I asked Seon Ju...

244
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,780
if she had feelings for you.

245
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:57,380
Why would you ask her that?

246
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,750
She said no.
She doesn't think of you like that.

247
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:03,959
If you're starting to fall for her
on your own, you need to wake up.

248
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,189
You know that relationship is weird,
don't you?

249
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:21,370
Here.

250
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,709
I printed these out for you.

251
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,589
What is it?

252
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,390
It's nothing.

253
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,459
You can get off work.

254
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:40,859
Okay.

255
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:17,829
What was that about?

256
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,800
Is he in a bad mood?

257
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,109
(Han Hair Line)

258
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,550
- Dad.
- Hi, Tae Ri.

259
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,479
- Hello.
- Hi.

260
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:37,120
- You're home.
- Yes.

261
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,020
Did you think about it?

262
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:42,790
Well, yes.

263
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,790
I'm sorry, but...

264
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:47,290
I don't think I can do it.

265
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,290
Okay.

266
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:53,800
Kids. Let's go inside.

267
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:56,469
- Bye.
- Bye.

268
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,170
Let's go upstairs, Tae Ri.

269
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,449
Shall we go out to ride your bike?

270
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:12,880
Let's call Ji Hyun too.

271
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,650
She's really happy that you taught her
how to ride a bike.

272
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:19,059
Is she? Ask if she wants to come, then.

273
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:20,229
Okay.

274
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,059
I want to wear that too.

275
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:23,630
Do you?

276
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,410
To you who wear this hard hat,

277
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,709
peace and new horizons of safety
will come to your family.

278
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:45,280
Your safety means we'll be safe too.

279
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,819
I wish you luck and work hard.

280
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:50,050
Be the person who is there
with me until the very end.

281
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,589
Be happy.

282
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:52,959
From Seon Ju.

283
00:16:56,229 --> 00:16:57,559
Let's go.

284
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,969
Hey.

285
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:03,740
Are you going out, Ji Hyun?

286
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,939
Mr. Kim asked me to go biking with him.

287
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,270
I'm pretty good at it now.

288
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:10,439
Come with us, Mom.

289
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:11,579
Well...

290
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,450
You go and have fun.

291
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,109
I have to run to the store.

292
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,980
- Okay.
- See you later, then.

293
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,119
- See you.
- Bye.

294
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,319
No, wait, Ji Hyun.

295
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,129
I'll help bring your bike to the park.

296
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:30,899
I'll just get my jacket.

297
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:32,359
- Okay.
- Thanks.

298
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:44,040
Even Sang Ah comes over
because she misses Tae Ri.

299
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,050
You. Don't you think of Ji Hyun at all?

300
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,879
Ji Hyun, Tae Ri. Let's go.

301
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:54,389
Didn't you say you had to go to the store?

302
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,649
I'll walk with you to the park.

303
00:17:56,649 --> 00:17:58,520
You can't handle two bikes on your own.

304
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,089
Okay.

305
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,530
Let's get going, then.

306
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,300
Come along.

307
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,629
Ji Hyun, you've gotten much better.

308
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:09,230
That's it. Keep going.

309
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,300
Look straight ahead.

310
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:14,109
Oh, dear.

311
00:18:14,109 --> 00:18:15,169
Are you okay?

312
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:24,119
Dad.

313
00:18:24,149 --> 00:18:26,319
Hi, Ji Hyun. Are you okay?

314
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,460
Why are you teaching her
how to ride a bike?

315
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,460
I asked him to teach me.

316
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:46,099
Hey. Why are you wearing that?

317
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,270
It's mine.

318
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,440
Why are you yelling at him?

319
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,540
Why is your son wearing it?

320
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,510
Mom gave it to him as a gift.

321
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,919
Because he said it was cool.

322
00:18:57,379 --> 00:18:58,419
What?

323
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,319
My gosh.

324
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,220
Tae Ri. It's okay.

325
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,119
Will you two wait over there?

326
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:07,629
Go ahead.

327
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,430
You have...

328
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:19,399
no right or ability to be there...

329
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,639
for someone...

330
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:24,240
until the very end.

331
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,079
What?

332
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,980
Nam Jin.

333
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:29,710
Mom.

334
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,780
What are you doing here?

335
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,790
You two should talk.

336
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,619
I'll take the kids home.

337
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:40,889
Let's go.

338
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,129
Get on your bike, Tae Ri. That's it.

339
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:51,970
My gosh.

340
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:55,540
Just because you live together,
do you think he's your husband?

341
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:57,579
Why are you here throwing a tantrum?

342
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,940
Is he Ji Hyun's dad?

343
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:02,480
You two were acting like a couple.

344
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,550
Mr. Kim isn't divorced yet.
Don't get ahead of yourself.

345
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,790
Whatever.

346
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,720
Sit back down.

347
00:20:09,819 --> 00:20:12,260
Are you insane? Don't do this to me.

348
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,430
Aren't you going too far?

349
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,030
Do you think I left you
so you could do this?

350
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:21,629
What did you expect from me
after you left?

351
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,639
I believed you'd be a good mom.

352
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,510
But instead,
you let another man care for Ji Hyun.

353
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,309
Sang Ah's husband of all people.

354
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,339
I didn't imagine this at all.

355
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:35,450
What are you saying I did?

356
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,180
Do I have to watch Mr. Kim
pretend to be my kid's dad?

357
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:39,980
You said...

358
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:42,149
you were sick of men.

359
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:44,020
Are you sure about that?

360
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,389
You seem to adore men.

361
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,960
What answer do you people want to hear?

362
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,230
Has everyone concluded...

363
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,059
that I like him?

364
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,430
Have you decided to keep asking...

365
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,240
until I say myself that I like Mr. Kim?

366
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:00,339
Is that what you want to hear?

367
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:01,940
Should I say it's true?

368
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,240
Hey. What would happen if I were to say...

369
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,149
I did have feelings for Mr. Kim?

370
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,750
Are you afraid?

371
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:15,089
It's a shame, though.

372
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,659
He's a hundred times
more handsome and smarter,

373
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:21,829
and a million times kinder,
more thoughtful, and polite than you.

374
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:24,329
But he doesn't care for me.

375
00:21:24,329 --> 00:21:25,460
What if he did?

376
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:27,470
Would you like him back?

377
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,230
Who knows? I even fell for you, didn't I?

378
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:37,210
Is that why you invited him
to Mi Ju's wedding?

379
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:41,079
Don't even care who I invited or not.

380
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:45,520
You scared me once before
by taking both our kids without a word.

381
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:47,919
Why do you and Sang Ah
take turns harassing me?

382
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,649
Our house...

383
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:52,690
isn't some place
you can come to wreak havoc.

384
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,030
Don't come here again!

385
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,730
- Darn you.
- What the heck?

386
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,899
I'll hold back this time.

387
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:08,010
My gosh...

388
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,139
This is getting annoying.

389
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,159
What would happen...

390
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,829
if I were to say
I did have feelings for Mr. Kim?

391
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:30,700
Are you afraid?

392
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,329
Darn it.

393
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,270
Goodness.

394
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,280
Mi Ju.

395
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:49,510
Your wedding tomorrow.

396
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:52,450
I'll be there.

397
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,750
You will?

398
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,649
Okay, then.

399
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,790
Will it be okay?

400
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,589
Oh, I don't care.

401
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,099
I'm sorry...

402
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,639
to keep getting you involved.

403
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,710
It's fine.

404
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:19,710
I didn't mind that.

405
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,309
Is everything okay?

406
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,819
Yes.

407
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,750
Good.

408
00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:28,990
I'll go upstairs, then.

409
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,419
What did you say?

410
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,550
That I'd make lots of money...

411
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,059
and get our house back.

412
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:07,059
That she shouldn't grow old too fast.

413
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,790
Did you lose your house?

414
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,960
Will you...

415
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
Oh, no.

416
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,700
Hey.

417
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,530
Why did you use your bare hands?

418
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:21,010
My gosh.

419
00:24:21,309 --> 00:24:22,569
Why did you hide earlier?

420
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:27,109
I was going to make a lot of money...

421
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:28,649
and then come back home.

422
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,149
Instead of money,

423
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:33,579
I got a handsome groom.

424
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,909
Oh, well.

425
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:04,280
It's the best time of their lives.

426
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,220
What now? We talked already.

427
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,520
What's up?

428
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:13,960
Do you miss me already?

429
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,659
We're getting married tomorrow.

430
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Yes.

431
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:19,829
What is it?

432
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,970
Did something upsetting happen?

433
00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:25,040
What happened?

434
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:26,669
Tell me.

435
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,639
I feel...

436
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:33,010
bad and guilty
for putting you through all this.

437
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,680
What do you mean?
Did you do something to hurt me?

438
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,879
I don't know what it is,

439
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:40,050
but I'll forgive you
for everything for now.

440
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,050
Hang on.

441
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,129
Do you know why?

442
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:53,730
Because you grew up so well
and came to me right at this moment.

443
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:59,300
Hey. Mr. Jeong.

444
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:03,270
Woo Sang.

445
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:06,339
When did you get here?

446
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,520
Who's this?

447
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,950
You're my youngest son-in-law.

448
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:18,720
You should be careful.

449
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,990
Why are you hugging
with the gate wide open?

450
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,359
Since you're here,
you might as well come in.

451
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,300
Go on inside.

452
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,859
Hurry up.

453
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,109
I end up telling you all sorts of things.

454
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,680
Because you feel comfortable around me?

455
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,819
Hey. What are you doing tomorrow?

456
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:52,260
Shall we go out to get some air?

457
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:53,389
What?

458
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,960
Well, I have plans for tomorrow.

459
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:58,829
Really? Who is it?

460
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,359
A childhood friend.

461
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,530
Yes.

462
00:27:03,629 --> 00:27:04,669
Okay, bye.

463
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:25,059
Did this belong to that man?

464
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,730
- What?
- Was it his hat...

465
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,930
and we took it from him?

466
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:31,200
No.

467
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,730
I think he misunderstood the situation.

468
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:50,609
Come on in.

469
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:52,180
Sit down.

470
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,349
Come on out, everyone.

471
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:56,450
Mi Ju's fiance is here.

472
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,919
- Hello.
- Hello.

473
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,760
Dong Won, say hi.

474
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,359
- Hello.
- Hello.

475
00:28:03,629 --> 00:28:06,260
You're here this late
when the wedding is tomorrow?

476
00:28:09,569 --> 00:28:10,569
Hey.

477
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:13,669
Are you crying?

478
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,770
Why... What's the matter?

479
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,220
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

480
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:49,109
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

481
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,839
Take good care of my daughter for me.

482
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,309
The favor your sister asked of me.
Tell her I'll do it.

483
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,319
Will the husbands be there tomorrow?

484
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,819
We should all go. Let's see for ourselves,

485
00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:03,319
and if you're right,
let's put a stop to the wedding.

486
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,359
Where's the middle son-in-law?

487
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,859
I'm sorry I'm late.

488
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:09,359
I'm the second brother-in-law,
Jeon Nam Jin.

489
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,159
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
