00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:13,209
(Episode 19)

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,009
You got me from somewhere else.

3
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:19,950
Who said that?

4
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:23,319
That means you could abandon me again.

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,889
If Mom and Dad hate each other...

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,290
and hate me too...

7
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,029
Who said that?

8
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,860
You said...

9
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,470
the three of us
would live like the three bears.

10
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:43,110
Yes. Let's do that.

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,309
We won't split up.
Mom and Dad will stay together.

12
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,280
I promise, Tae Ri. Dad...

13
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:52,420
Dad will try harder, okay?

14
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:54,519
Don't cry.

15
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:05,659
You wanted Tae Ri.

16
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:09,629
I asked many times
if you'd thought it through.

17
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:12,100
You said you'd make him
the happiest kid ever.

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,210
I can't help it that he's not the kid
I expected him to be.

19
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,609
Is that my fault?

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,680
- What?
- I was flustered too.

21
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,690
I tried, but I couldn't love him.
What was I to do?

22
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,719
Is love something you can force?

23
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:37,559
Jin Sang Ah.

24
00:01:38,029 --> 00:01:40,660
What do Tae Ri and I mean to you?

25
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:44,600
You were not too bad as a husband,

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,440
and Tae Ri...

27
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:48,540
That was greed on my part.

28
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,839
Everyone else had a kid, and I didn't.

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,680
It drove me crazy.

30
00:01:55,309 --> 00:01:56,979
Hearing I was infertile...

31
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:00,749
I failed to think straight at the time.

32
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:03,119
If that was your greed,
you should've tried harder.

33
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,859
You should've tried harder
than any birth parent!

34
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:09,660
Why take it out on me
when some people abandon their kids?

35
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,160
- What?
- Sang Ah, are you upstairs?

36
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:16,999
It must be so easy for you.

37
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:18,930
You ditch me for not being fun,

38
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:22,140
and you ditch Tae Ri because he's not
what you expected?

39
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:26,710
Sang Ah, you're home.

40
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,680
Did you sort things out
at the police station?

41
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:30,950
Yes.

42
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,849
Sang Ah, can I have a word?

43
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,990
Sure.

44
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:56,969
- Sit.
- Okay.

45
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:03,779
Are you aware
the executive director will retire...

46
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
and we'll shuffle
some personnel next month?

47
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,879
What?

48
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,349
Well, yes.

49
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:10,920
I'm not sure if you know,

50
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,619
but what I value...

51
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,330
the most in a person
is how they are at home.

52
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,260
So Woo has been looking down lately.

53
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,559
Are you two having problems?

54
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,569
No, we're not.

55
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,939
Good, then.

56
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,809
So Woo allowed you to study abroad.

57
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,670
You should make it up to him.

58
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:34,439
Don't work too hard and upset him.

59
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:38,050
I can't give a hefty position
to someone who can't even...

60
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:40,050
handle a household.

61
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,520
I have no need for such people at work.

62
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:44,319
My board will agree with that.

63
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,990
Not even my own blood is an exception.

64
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:49,730
Do you understand...

65
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,490
what I mean?

66
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,230
Yes.

67
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:15,319
You can continue.

68
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,689
Tae Ri needs a mom.

69
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:21,619
You said it must be easy for me,

70
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,860
that I was ditching you and Tae Ri.

71
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,359
I won't.

72
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,460
I'm still his mom.

73
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:31,229
It wasn't all easy for me either.

74
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,299
It's tough to raise your own kid,

75
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:35,599
so raising a kid that's not your own?

76
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,440
It's extra hard.

77
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,880
But I'll try harder.

78
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,440
So you...

79
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,479
Though it won't be easy
as I know you must be upset,

80
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,650
for a while,
let's pretend we don't have...

81
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,049
any problems.

82
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,659
You want to put on a show?

83
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,190
A happily married couple.

84
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,359
Let's pretend that's what we are.

85
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,960
Lots of people pretend.

86
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,500
Why?

87
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,770
For how long?

88
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,570
Until Mr. Jeon gets divorced...

89
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:07,200
and comes to you?

90
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,940
We could end up reconciling first.

91
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,580
Tae Ri lashed out today.

92
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,779
- Did he?
- He knew that we had...

93
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,049
adopted him.

94
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,349
I didn't tell him.

95
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,060
I don't know how he found out or when,
but it would've been hard on him.

96
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,760
And these days...

97
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:36,500
Because we've been fighting too...

98
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,169
Let's do it.

99
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:45,570
Let's pretend that we're happily married.

100
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,779
You made that suggestion so apathetically,

101
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,049
and I don't get it,

102
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:53,279
but Tae Ri thinks the world of you...

103
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,150
and wants you to remain around him.

104
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,989
I'll keep a safe distance and observe.

105
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:01,159
While we do this,

106
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,260
I want you to do your best
as Tae Ri's mom.

107
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,630
At work and home, I'll act...

108
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,070
as if we have no problems.

109
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:13,440
- Okay.
- Even if we split up in the end...

110
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,109
If you hurt Tae Ri in the process,

111
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,179
I won't let either of you off.

112
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,979
While we're at this,

113
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,020
you'd better really do your best.

114
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:31,549
I will.

115
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,200
Mom.

116
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,339
Oh, dear.

117
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,539
- You woke up?
- Yes.

118
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,679
Did Dad buy you something tasty?

119
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:57,049
Yes. Why didn't you keep your promise?

120
00:06:57,679 --> 00:07:00,150
It was so hard
to get Dad to agree to a date.

121
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,690
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,320
Something came up at work and...

123
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,419
Did you apologize to Dad?

124
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,929
How will you make it up to him?

125
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,589
Ask him again to take us somewhere.

126
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,229
He's busy these days.

127
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,500
Even so.

128
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:20,270
Say "darling" sweetly
and put him in a good mood.

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,370
Everyone calls you dull and thick
because you can't do that.

130
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,909
Okay. I'll spruce myself up,
get the timing right,

131
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,950
and get my darling to take us somewhere.

132
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,979
Let's go to bed.

133
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,960
Are you wide awake?

134
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,320
No.

135
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,239
He's so cute.

136
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,739
I love this baby.

137
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:01,640
He'll grow up to be so smart.

138
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,580
Will he?

139
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,750
Tae Ri.

140
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,979
We're your mom and dad.

141
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:09,489
Thanks for going with what I want.

142
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,890
Why would you thank me? Thank Tae Ri.

143
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,489
The adorable kid came to us
without you having to suffer or struggle.

144
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,960
He's a good son already.

145
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:25,500
I'll make Jin Architecture
ten times bigger for you to inherit.

146
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,539
You'd better become a sweet kid.

147
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,239
I'll scold you if you don't.

148
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,250
- Shall I play some music?
- Yes, do.

149
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:39,679
Listen, Tae Ri.

150
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,520
Isn't that a pretty sound?

151
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,049
He's smiling. Look at Dad.

152
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:47,819
My gosh. Look at his tiny feet.

153
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,020
They're adorable.

154
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,179
(Jin Architecture)

155
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,029
Good morning.

156
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,500
Let's say it is.

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,470
Working with your wife's affair partner.

158
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,370
The pain must be unimaginable.

159
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,740
I'm really impressed.

160
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,279
You said no love lasted forever
and no families were complete.

161
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,779
Do you think your affair will last?

162
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,750
It's a one-off thing.

163
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,919
You wanted to keep it apart from work.

164
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,730
You should do that yourself.

165
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:58,890
We're not a perfect couple,

166
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,360
but Ms. Jin and I...

167
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,199
decided to work things out.

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,199
So aren't I still...

169
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,669
Ms. Jin's husband...

170
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,340
and your superior?

171
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,350
It's true.

172
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,789
Hee Kyung in HR told me.

173
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,189
Really?
Then there must be some truth to it.

174
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,829
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Jeon.

175
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,029
What were you talking about?

176
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:33,730
Well, it's still a secret,

177
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,559
but our executive director...

178
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:37,029
will retire and move abroad.

179
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:40,069
There's a possibility that Mr. Kim
will be promoted to fill the position.

180
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,870
Ms. Jin's father is the owner and CEO,

181
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,409
but there are four planning teams
and one each for interior and inspection.

182
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:50,549
Wouldn't Mr. Kim have
more influence and say in the company?

183
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:54,220
I agree. The previous director
was from planning too.

184
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:57,289
I see.

185
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,260
Let's talk.

186
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:18,069
What's up?

187
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,209
I met your husband on the way to work.

188
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,480
He proudly said he had no issues with you.

189
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:26,579
Didn't you two decide to split up?

190
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:30,490
Just for a while,
we agreed to act like a couple.

191
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,689
- Why?
- Promotion season is coming up.

192
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,459
Nothing good would come from
asking for a divorce right now.

193
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,630
I must get promoted if I'm to help you.

194
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,929
Are you sure
you'll get promoted and not Kim So Woo?

195
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,400
What does that mean?

196
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,500
Don't get silly ideas
and get rid of Pi Seon Ju first.

197
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,340
You agreed to divorce her first.

198
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,010
If one person gets divorced first,
it'll make things much less complicated.

199
00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:56,850
Did you give Seon Ju the ultimatum?

200
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,380
I will.

201
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,120
What phone costs so much to repair?

202
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,959
I'd rather just buy a new one.

203
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,459
Darn it.

204
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:16,159
Boss.

205
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,370
Are you home?

206
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,569
Are you in?

207
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,539
Goodness.

208
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:27,480
Did you really run away?

209
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:34,419
- Boss?
- Ms. Pi?

210
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:37,520
It's Gwangyang Villa, the place
you worked on three months ago.

211
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,689
Oh, hi.

212
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,260
Did you change your number?

213
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,490
Yes. So there's this gaping hole
in the wallpaper.

214
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,900
Come and take a look at it.

215
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,600
- What?
- You said you'd fix anything for me.

216
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,799
Okay. Sure.

217
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,439
Did he really move away?

218
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,490
This is madness.

219
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:16,959
How did this happen? It's all on you.

220
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:22,760
I don't remember anything
about the accident.

221
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:24,370
How could you?

222
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,400
Your memory never was the best,

223
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,039
and you dozed off.

224
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:32,569
I would like to know how I dozed off
and how the accident happened.

225
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,779
Her dashboard camera broke too.

226
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,360
Hey.

227
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,360
Excuse me.

228
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:53,529
I'm sure I saw.

229
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:55,730
- Saw what?
- When the accident happened,

230
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,900
someone else was there.

231
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:00,270
A squiggle like dung?

232
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:04,140
A guy wearing a cap with that design
got out of Jin Chu Ah's car.

233
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,309
If someone got out with a dung-like cap,

234
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:08,779
would that make you innocent?

235
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:11,179
If you find him, will he settle for us?

236
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,709
He wouldn't,

237
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:17,319
but Jin Chu Ah denied
being with anyone, and that's weird.

238
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,860
She's an actress of sorts,
so maybe it was a secret date.

239
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,059
Oh, whatever.

240
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,230
I'm making green onion kimchi
because Mom is upset.

241
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,429
You...

242
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,439
can peel all these.

243
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,470
My back aches.

244
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:42,409
A secret date?

245
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:45,049
Was that it?

246
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,360
What made you decide
to accept the drama role?

247
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,860
Could you tell us?

248
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:58,230
This drama portrays
the revenge of a man with amnesia...

249
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:01,199
who falls for a terminally ill woman.

250
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:05,169
As soon as I read the script,
I knew it was the role of a lifetime.

251
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,169
So I jumped at the chance.

252
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:09,909
Did you feel it right away?

253
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,209
Yes.

254
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:15,439
That cap is quite unusual.

255
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,579
- You wear it often.
- Hey.

256
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,850
Oh, this?

257
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,279
A fan said that snake imagery suited me...

258
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:24,350
and embroidered this herself.

259
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:27,490
Then it's a one-of-a-kind cap.

260
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:29,590
- Can I try it on?
- Sure.

261
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,289
(Hot Scoops,
Actor Jeong Woo Sang Random Interview)

262
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,730
It looks like an actual snake.

263
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,799
That cap.

264
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:40,569
- Jeong Woo Sang.
- Does it suit me?

265
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:43,470
It was Jeong Woo Sang.

266
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,010
- I'm a flower, and it's a snake.
- He got out of the car.

267
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,380
It wasn't a dung-like squiggle.
It was a squirming snake.

268
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,350
Darn it.

269
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:05,959
Let's see.

270
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,199
Let's give it a go.

271
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:11,299
I might not get paid anyway.

272
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,340
Hello, ma'am.

273
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,840
It's Jeil Interior Design.

274
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:22,480
You still owe us 1,000 dollars
for the work we did.

275
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:24,409
What?

276
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,610
Who told you that?

277
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,250
You still owe us
even if we're out of business.

278
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:31,350
Hello? You...

279
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,750
What's this?

280
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,659
She's rotten.

281
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,289
My gosh.

282
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:39,559
My goodness.

283
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,939
You're out of business?

284
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,539
Yes.

285
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,679
That was why yesterday...

286
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,909
Let's talk.

287
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,449
Where are you going?

288
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:02,650
Follow me.

289
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,159
I heard the police took you away
for assaulting Ms. Jin's family.

290
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:14,400
Didn't I tell you she was my superior?

291
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,900
- What?
- You all barged in...

292
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,769
and hurt her mother,
so she had to get admitted.

293
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,939
What's wrong with your whole family?

294
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,640
How much of a pickle
do you want to put me in?

295
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,870
I'm embarrassed to death.

296
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,310
How could you say that?

297
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:31,009
If you heard what happened,

298
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,080
if you found out your wife, mother-in-law,

299
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,280
and sisters-in-law
went to the police station,

300
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,120
shouldn't you have asked
if we were okay...

301
00:17:40,219 --> 00:17:41,560
and if everything was sorted?

302
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,890
You didn't pick up then,
and now you show up and say...

303
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:49,929
you're embarrassed to death
to face your superior?

304
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:52,769
Did they hit you?
You were brought in for assault.

305
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,969
Why wouldn't you be okay?

306
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,179
Jeon Nam Jin.

307
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,140
It's me.

308
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,679
I'm still your wife.

309
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,850
You are.

310
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:08,620
And I don't want you to be.

311
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,090
I came to say that.

312
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,860
Let's end it.

313
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,699
Honey.

314
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,870
Jeong Woo Sang.

315
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:29,570
It was Jeong Woo Sang.

316
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,070
The guy in Jin Chu Ah's car...

317
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,780
It wasn't a dung-like squiggle.

318
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,810
It was a squirming snake.

319
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:43,790
Think. Think, Pi Mi Ju.

320
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,229
Let's end it.

321
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:57,870
You really...

322
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,600
What about Ji Hyun?

323
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:05,840
Don't you care about Ji Hyun?

324
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,840
That bothers me too.

325
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,550
But I don't want to stay married
out of a sense of duty.

326
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,719
Jeon Nam Jin.

327
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,650
You're really out of your mind.

328
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,830
Then...

329
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,560
how should I explain it to her?

330
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:29,699
Should I say her dad...

331
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,300
went crazy for someone else and left?

332
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,040
- It's not like that.
- As if it's not.

333
00:19:34,699 --> 00:19:38,269
You call me dull and thick,
but even dull people think.

334
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,610
You said she was there
to help you put on pain relief patches.

335
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,150
"Oh, I see. That was it."

336
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,550
Do you think anyone would buy that excuse?

337
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,850
Think what you want.

338
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,390
Honey.

339
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,159
Ending things quickly so we can both
settle down...

340
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,259
might be better for Ji Hyun.

341
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,459
If you can't tell her, I'll talk to her.

342
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:03,259
My gosh...

343
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:06,030
You made up your mind.

344
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:07,840
In your mind,

345
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,540
you divorced me and started over...

346
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,709
with the other woman.

347
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,540
While I was...

348
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,380
clinging to the cell rails...

349
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,850
and wailing my eyes out,

350
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,979
you were busy filling in these papers.

351
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:26,320
Right now...

352
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:30,929
You don't know...

353
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,360
what I'm going through right now.

354
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:40,100
Is this that urgent a matter?

355
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,509
We waited for two years
for you to come back.

356
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,140
How could you abandon us like this?

357
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,080
How could you do this to us?

358
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:09,030
Darling?

359
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,199
Honey. Stop this and come back.

360
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:17,310
I'll forget all about it.

361
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,380
Whether you have someone else or not,

362
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,479
who she is,

363
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,709
where you met, and how far you went.

364
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:28,949
The more I know, the more I'll hurt.

365
00:21:30,949 --> 00:21:32,590
I won't ask anything.

366
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,719
I have...

367
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,429
so much to handle,
and I'm really stressed out.

368
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,570
So...

369
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:47,570
So...

370
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:49,570
I'll forget about it all.

371
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,310
I'll be cool and let it go.

372
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:56,810
Okay?

373
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,949
Come back to us.

374
00:22:00,949 --> 00:22:01,949
Okay?

375
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:29,009
Are you sure you're okay?

376
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,850
You should've stayed a few more days.

377
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:33,409
I just have to be careful.

378
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:35,050
You're too stubborn.

379
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,019
What about the assailants?

380
00:22:38,249 --> 00:22:41,419
They were caught at the scene,
and we had CCTV footage.

381
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,560
There's no way out.

382
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,759
You can go and shower.

383
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,360
Okay.

384
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,070
Han Man Eun.

385
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:59,239
Why did you show up and get on my nerves?

386
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:03,679
- Goodbye.
- Bye. Thank you.

387
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:33,880
- Hello?
- Hi.

388
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,709
Nam Jin, it's me.

389
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:37,380
Are you busy?

390
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:38,749
Yes, I'm at work.

391
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,679
Yes, you should work hard
to support your wife and kid.

392
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,650
- The breadwinner should...
- Why did you call?

393
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:46,590
Oh, well...

394
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,530
Could you lend us some money?

395
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:53,259
Seon Ju was against me telling you,

396
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,860
and it's hard to even ask you for help,

397
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,469
but since you found a nice job...

398
00:23:58,469 --> 00:23:59,630
I can't help with that.

399
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,640
Oh, okay, then.

400
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:04,140
Pretend you didn't hear anything.

401
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:06,709
Don't tell Seon Ju I called.

402
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,679
Bye.

403
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,249
How is this fool so cold?

404
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,600
Did you talk to Seon Ju?

405
00:24:35,699 --> 00:24:37,169
I gave her the divorce papers.

406
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:38,570
What did she say?

407
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:40,439
She can't accept it right now.

408
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,739
But I'll see to it that she does.

409
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:44,280
What about the kid?

410
00:24:45,209 --> 00:24:46,749
Seon Ju will want custody.

411
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,580
Still,

412
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:50,620
I want to be the dad.

413
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,890
You mean you want to pay child support?

414
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:59,989
She's going around asking for cash.
It looks like she has nothing.

415
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:02,759
How will you split your assets?

416
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,330
Don't worry about that. I'll handle it.

417
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:08,669
Your father has passed.

418
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,140
What's your mother like?

419
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,610
She's a homebody.

420
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,110
Do you pay her expenses?

421
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,509
She lives off of Father's inheritance.

422
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:24,189
You're better off than I thought.

423
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,850
I am.

424
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,640
(Boxing Club, Main Branch)

425
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,780
Where do you think this is?

426
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,449
Where are we?

427
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:28,949
It's where people learn to do this.

428
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,949
It's a boxing club.

429
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,919
They had some pretty nice reviews.

430
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:38,060
Let me check.

431
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,860
(Manjang-gu Boxing Club)

432
00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:42,699
Hello. I'm in front of the building.

433
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:44,130
Are you in?

434
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:49,469
Oh, really?

435
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:52,640
Okay, then. Thank you.

436
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:55,709
Let's go, Tae Ri.

437
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,679
(Manjang-gu Boxing Club)

438
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:02,749
Hang on.

439
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,919
Someone's inside.

440
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,330
Excuse me.

441
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,659
Excuse me.

442
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,169
Hello? Excuse me.

443
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,709
Let's end it.

444
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:28,009
That bothers me too.

445
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,449
But I don't want to stay married
out of a sense of duty.

446
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:37,519
Excuse me. Can you...

447
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,090
Oh, dear.

448
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,300
- Goodness.
- Hey.

449
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:52,530
Oh, gosh.

450
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,570
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

451
00:28:11,949 --> 00:28:13,650
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

452
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,259
Say hello. This is my mom.

453
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:19,189
I'd have liked you to be my son-in-law
if Sang Ah wasn't married.

454
00:28:19,189 --> 00:28:20,229
What...

455
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:21,530
Are you okay?

456
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,830
She must be in lots of pain.

457
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:25,229
Are you even thinking about the money?

458
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:28,199
Do whatever it takes
to think of a plan by this evening.

459
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:30,469
Should we all buy lottery tickets?

460
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:32,509
Mother. Did you see a lottery ticket?

461
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,640
