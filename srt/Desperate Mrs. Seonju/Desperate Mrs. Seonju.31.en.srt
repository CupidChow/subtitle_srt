00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,510
(Episode 31)

2
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:17,950
Father.

3
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,620
Well, hello there.

4
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,359
Say hello.

5
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,830
- Hello.
- You cute thing.

6
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,929
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:33,960
Let's go inside.

8
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,530
Yes, let's.

9
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,010
Goodness.

10
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,040
We managed to sell the house
within the deadline.

11
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,250
The deities didn't abandon us after all.

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,519
- Yes.
- Do you think...

13
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:56,750
we're rushing it a bit by saying
we'll move out in a fortnight?

14
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,890
He paid half as a down payment,
not the usual ten percent.

15
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,459
It's true that a buyer
would rarely agree to that.

16
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,029
We just have to find an empty house.

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,930
Are you sure it's okay not to mention
I want to keep my business...

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,870
and pay a monthly rent?

19
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,800
What if he were to back out of the deal
if we mentioned that condition too?

20
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:18,369
I'll ask about keeping the hair salon
a few days later.

21
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:19,709
Let's not show that we really need to.

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,110
Okay.

23
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,759
We sold the house today, Dong Won.

24
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,560
Did you really?

25
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,289
Will Auntie Mi Ju
stay out of prison, then?

26
00:01:36,489 --> 00:01:39,759
Can you stop talking about her
going to prison?

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,929
Start looking for a place for us nearby.

28
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,700
I don't want to move far away.

29
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:47,739
Okay. I'm checking the online sites,

30
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:49,539
and the place I like is still available.

31
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,110
I'll take a look tomorrow.

32
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,780
Have you heard from Seon Ju?

33
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:57,379
I texted her that we sold the house,
but she hadn't read it yet.

34
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,319
Tell her to come over later.
Let's grill some pork belly.

35
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:03,220
Nam Jin saw and heard
the situation we were in.

36
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,890
Didn't he say anything?

37
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:08,190
- Should I visit him...
- No, Mom! Don't do that.

38
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,929
You see,

39
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:14,429
Nam Jin hasn't been at
his workplace for long.

40
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:16,099
He's still sensitive.

41
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,029
We sold the house.

42
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:22,100
He's family too. Wouldn't it be nice
if he were to join us for dinner?

43
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,769
No. He's your son-in-law,
but he's not family.

44
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,380
In-laws are not the same as family.

45
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,040
Call Seon Ju, then.

46
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:30,309
Nam Jin is staying at a dorm now.

47
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,920
Seon Ju will be feeling lonely
as if she were a single woman again.

48
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,719
She hasn't picked up all day.

49
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,790
- Is something wrong?
- The person is unable to...

50
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,230
She's that absent-minded.

51
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:48,999
I gave her a chicken,
and she never thanked me for it.

52
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,570
You said we sold the house,
and there was no reply.

53
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:53,800
- Goodness.
- Mom.

54
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:56,170
How about I go and check on her?

55
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,670
Can you cook the rice for me?

56
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,439
I'll get the pork belly on the way back.

57
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,580
Chu Ah. She hit you
and pulled your hair out last time.

58
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,450
You get your revenge today.

59
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,679
- Mi Ju, now you're the victim.
- I got it.

60
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:11,089
Director. Can I make it realistic?

61
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:12,089
How?

62
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:15,420
The script says I slap her like this.

63
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,660
Can't I punch her like this?

64
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,760
Hey, I like that.

65
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:22,499
Are you okay with that?

66
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,700
Well, yes. It's fine.

67
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:26,540
Okay. Let's do this.

68
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:27,999
Ready?

69
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,269
Action.

70
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,709
Last time, you got me with my guard down.

71
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,110
Now it's your turn!

72
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,589
That wasn't hard enough.
I'll do another take.

73
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,059
Will you? Let's go again.

74
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,360
- Ready?
- Yes.

75
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,230
Action.

76
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,459
Now it's your turn.

77
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,230
Oh, gosh.

78
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:02,300
Director, instead of a punch,
how about I film a slap too?

79
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,339
Yes. Let's do another take.

80
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,510
- It's the last one.
- What? Okay.

81
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,939
Ready? Action.

82
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,649
Okay, cut.

83
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,400
(I Lost My Memory but I Want Revenge)

84
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,869
How did you like my acting?

85
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,509
You got some serious revenge.

86
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,379
I got a bit passionate today.

87
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:44,249
Are you scraping together the money?

88
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,249
You don't want to go to prison
when it's this cold.

89
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,350
Don't you worry. We're doing what we can.

90
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:55,360
Where's your mom, Ji Hyun?

91
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,160
Over there.

92
00:04:57,489 --> 00:04:58,530
You're home.

93
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,259
Hey, did you get drunk and pass out?
Why didn't you answer your phone?

94
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,970
We sold the house.

95
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:12,239
Hey. My gosh. What's wrong with her?

96
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,710
You need to see a doctor.

97
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,379
I'll call Nam Jin.

98
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,249
No, don't call him.

99
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,489
He might be madly in love
with another woman,

100
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:26,960
but you're dying over here.

101
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:30,629
You're still his legal wife.

102
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:31,889
No.

103
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,030
Not anymore.

104
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,300
What?

105
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,970
We...

106
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,809
We're divorced.

107
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,710
What?

108
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,179
When?

109
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,550
Are you in?

110
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:51,949
Who is it?

111
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:53,520
I'm the landlady.

112
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:55,720
What's she doing here?

113
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,860
Why the heck won't you answer your phone?

114
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,230
Come in.

115
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Your rent was so behind
that I deducted it from your down payment,

116
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,009
and the lease expires soon too.

117
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:24,150
I'd like to extend your lease,
but my son is getting married,

118
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,319
and he wants to move in.

119
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,189
I kept calling because he wanted to
see the place while he was in the city,

120
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,119
but you didn't pick up.

121
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:34,020
Come in, son.

122
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,090
Take a quick look around.

123
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:44,329
It's nice.

124
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:47,400
- Let's go.
- Did you look thoroughly?

125
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,670
You told me to take a quick look.

126
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,340
You should look carefully, though.

127
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:55,679
Be sure to move out
once the lease expires.

128
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,480
I gave you the notice.

129
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,489
- Bye.
- Take care.

130
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,790
Hey.

131
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:13,960
You need to move out
when things are this bad?

132
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,629
I guess?

133
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,939
Ji Hyun. How long
has your mom been like this?

134
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,069
Since yesterday.

135
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:28,280
Why didn't you call me or the paramedics?

136
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,809
Mom said her phone got wet.

137
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:33,650
You psycho.

138
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,850
You have no job and no husband.

139
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,619
With no home, you have nothing.

140
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,259
What will you do now?

141
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,860
You're getting on my nerves.

142
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,460
Will you leave and let me sleep?

143
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,160
What exactly is wrong with you?

144
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:50,129
It's just a bad cold.

145
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:52,600
I'll be fine after a long nap.

146
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:57,139
You make too much noise.

147
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:00,040
Goodness.

148
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,910
Hey.

149
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:06,520
Can I really go?

150
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,449
Oh, I don't know.

151
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,790
Ji Hyun. I'm leaving.

152
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,689
Bye, Auntie.

153
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:18,989
My gosh.

154
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:31,210
(Pharmacy)

155
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,780
The nuisance.

156
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,250
- Get dressed, Ji Hyun.
- What?

157
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:06,609
Get up.

158
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,510
Why did you come back?

159
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,880
Take this.

160
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:37,640
What are you doing?

161
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Let's go.

162
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,209
Where to?

163
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:44,449
Where do you think? To Mom's.

164
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,079
How am I...

165
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,520
to face her looking like this?

166
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:56,689
Will you lie in bed and starve
as Ji Hyun watches you?

167
00:09:58,729 --> 00:09:59,800
Get up.

168
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:07,040
I'd noticed you were on edge.

169
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:09,339
You even took our kimchi...

170
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:13,109
and sent it to your husband and his mom.

171
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,040
Why don't you know...

172
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,250
when to stop giving and helping
to save yourself?

173
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:26,050
It's hard to give away as much as you did.

174
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:28,520
How could you end up...

175
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,359
giving him everything so that
you have nothing in your name?

176
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,699
Get up right now.

177
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,469
I can't.

178
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,910
I'll let Mom beat me instead.

179
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,949
Let's go.

180
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,949
I won't see Mom.

181
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,890
I can't.

182
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,040
It'll be here in five minutes.

183
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,410
Ji Hyun, wait here for a bit.

184
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
Come here.

185
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:34,819
She'll find out sooner or later.

186
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:37,290
Let's just tell her today.

187
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,699
You can say I divorced,

188
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,170
but don't tell her Nam Jin cheated on me.

189
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,829
Why not?

190
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:49,099
She should know
your conniving classmate is the mistress.

191
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:53,240
Do you want to defend him
when he left you in this mess?

192
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,010
- It's not that.
- What will you say, then?

193
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:57,579
I'll say...

194
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,179
our personalities clashed.

195
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:03,250
Let's say we were apart for so long...

196
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:07,890
that we'd drifted apart
and nothing seemed to work.

197
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,829
That Nam Jin had an affair...

198
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,260
and who he had it with...

199
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,929
Let's keep that...

200
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,530
between us.

201
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,939
Okay, you moron.

202
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,370
The taxi is here.

203
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,740
(For hire)

204
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:28,880
Get in, Ji Hyun.

205
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,250
These are the number of
successful bids for the first half.

206
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:36,550
Our ranking dropped five places.

207
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,260
You don't seem to get the situation
because you were abroad,

208
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,520
but our competitors are hot on our heels.

209
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,359
We're where we are
only because So Woo worked so hard.

210
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:48,660
Did you ask him to come back?

211
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,429
No.

212
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:53,900
If he made up his mind,
he wouldn't even consider returning.

213
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,069
You should've still tried to talk to him.

214
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,809
We should be working together
to get more business.

215
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,309
Must you add to my troubles?

216
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,910
What will our board think,
and what will the public think?

217
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,349
Why do you care so much about
what others think?

218
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:08,449
Didn't you hear me?

219
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,390
That's not the only concern.
Our company is not doing as well.

220
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:17,760
If you're thinking of going for
executive director, you can forget that.

221
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,699
If you can't get So Woo to come back,

222
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:22,260
not only will you not get promoted,
but I'll empty your office!

223
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,410
I knew this would happen.

224
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,949
He's this furious already.

225
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,020
If he were to know
you were having an affair with Mr. Jeon,

226
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,719
he'd say you brought Jeon
into his company to keep him close.

227
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:49,459
So Woo is not that special,

228
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,229
but your dad acknowledged him
as a son-in-law and employee.

229
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:56,969
How can Dad care more about him than me?

230
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,199
Am I his daughter?

231
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:00,839
Why would you say that?

232
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,309
He and I are too different.

233
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,809
I've had that feeling for a long time.

234
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:09,339
Don't say that.
What if someone were to hear?

235
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:11,179
It's not like I was adopted.

236
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:13,579
He's threatening to fire me
instead of accepting So Woo's resignation.

237
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,550
That's because you're his daughter.

238
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,959
He's that much more angry with you.

239
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,030
End the affair and start damage control.

240
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:25,229
Wait and see.

241
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,059
I'll get divorced
and keep Jin Architecture.

242
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,229
My goodness...

243
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,890
The real madness starts now.

244
00:14:50,219 --> 00:14:51,719
Brace yourself.

245
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:57,089
What's taking them so long?

246
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,099
Why won't either of them
answer their phones?

247
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:03,969
Did she go to buy the pork belly
or slaughter a pig?

248
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:07,939
How many times must I heat the pan
only to let it cool?

249
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,339
Grandma.

250
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:12,010
My darling Ji Hyun is here.

251
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:15,179
- Where's the meat?
- Here.

252
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:16,449
Are we eating here?

253
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,550
Why is she such a mess?

254
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:24,920
And what's that suitcase?

255
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,189
- Mom.
- Did you and Nam Jin fight?

256
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,059
- No.
- Are you fleeing from a war, then?

257
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,429
Why did you bring that much stuff?

258
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:38,030
And that blanket...
Did you just have a baby?

259
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:39,839
- Mom.
- You fought, didn't you?

260
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,599
Why? Did he mistreat you
because he got sick of you?

261
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,510
No, it's not that.

262
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,679
I'm home.

263
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:51,309
What happened to your cheek?

264
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,849
Were you in a fight?

265
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,949
No, it happened at work.

266
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:58,349
What kind of work
got you slapped that hard?

267
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:03,130
One is here because her husband
fought her in her sickly state.

268
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,689
Another spent half her time
in a booking cell...

269
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:07,829
only to give up on abiding by the law.

270
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,500
It's not that.

271
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,030
Take a look at this. I was on TV.

272
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:15,469
I'll crush you!

273
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,510
The name is Jeong Kkot Ja!

274
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,349
What the heck?

275
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,079
I'm afraid someone will see.

276
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:28,219
Was this why you got that bruised cheek?

277
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,420
What's wrong with you all?

278
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,660
Are you competing against each other?

279
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:37,689
Are you trying to figure out
who can be the worst loser?

280
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:39,530
You, call Nam Jin.

281
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,459
I want to hear his side.
No, I'll call him.

282
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,500
Mom.

283
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,870
We split up.

284
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,439
Nam Jin and I...

285
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:54,109
We signed the divorce papers...

286
00:16:55,809 --> 00:16:57,679
and handed them in.

287
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,160
Oh, my gosh...

288
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,639
Thank you for this month's donation too.

289
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,569
Sure.

290
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,280
This is quite tasty.

291
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,720
Here.

292
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,960
- Eat as much as you can.
- Okay.

293
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,740
You said your life would be rosy now.

294
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:57,740
Why did you split up?

295
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,669
Because...

296
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:03,680
our personalities clashed.

297
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,980
Are you out of your mind?

298
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,050
No one would believe that nonsense.

299
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,819
Did Nam Jin say that?

300
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,349
That darn fool.

301
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:13,220
- Mom.
- Mom.

302
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,790
He's seeing someone else.

303
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,700
He doesn't like me anymore.
He's in love with someone else.

304
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,730
He can't stand a single thing about me.

305
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:28,139
That's even more reason to fight!

306
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:29,440
We must drag him back.

307
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,270
Who's the witch? Who is he seeing?

308
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:32,869
Please...

309
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:35,710
I was happy
that we'd finally sold the house.

310
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,280
Did you get a seal engraved
to sign divorce papers?

311
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,609
Why would you divorce him?

312
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,020
Some men cheat.

313
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,490
Their eyes wander
when they become successful.

314
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,960
But if you hang in there,
he's bound to return to his kid!

315
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:51,659
Did Dad return?

316
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:53,629
He didn't.

317
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,430
What?

318
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:00,169
So were you...

319
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,740
jealous of what I went through?

320
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,040
Did you want to copy me?

321
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:06,740
No, Mom.

322
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:09,240
I tried everything.

323
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,180
I begged, which made me feel miserable.

324
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,980
I tried to change.

325
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:17,119
I can honestly say
I tried everything I could.

326
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:20,619
So I have no regrets.

327
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:23,460
I want to stop now.

328
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:26,559
What about me? What about how I feel?

329
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,500
The mistress should leave him, not you!

330
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,399
Let's go and see that woman.

331
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,940
Or let's go to your place!

332
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,240
Mom.

333
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,909
Let's feed her before kicking her out.

334
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:40,109
She hasn't eaten a thing all day.

335
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,109
She was half unconscious with a fever.

336
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,180
My gosh...

337
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,819
Poor me.

338
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:09,839
It had been so long since I had steak.

339
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:11,409
I really enjoyed that.

340
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:16,040
I thought we'd never get back up
after your dad lost everything.

341
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:20,349
Nam Jin. Let's eat out
at places like this on dates.

342
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:22,149
Sure, let's.

343
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:24,889
Cheers.

344
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,730
After dinner,

345
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,859
go back home.

346
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,930
Even if you get divorced,

347
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,629
you must stay there
if you want to keep the apartment.

348
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,270
What if Nam Jin steals it
from under your nose?

349
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,680
Mom. Considering what Seon Ju...

350
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:51,909
has been through,
she's not in her right mind.

351
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,050
We have to move anyway.

352
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,720
Can't we let her stay with us until then?

353
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,819
Are you crazy?

354
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:02,260
No. Eat, and then leave!

355
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:05,129
Mom.

356
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,930
She lost most of her down payment...

357
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:13,440
because she hasn't been
paying rent on time.

358
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,700
She has to vacate the place.

359
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,109
What?

360
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,569
And Nam Jin...

361
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:23,480
just started at his job,
so he has no assets to split.

362
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:25,579
We have no choice.

363
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:28,550
My goodness. This is so infuriating.

364
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,020
If I had a zipper down the front of me,

365
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:35,690
I'd undo it so you could see my insides.

366
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:39,530
It's half rotten
because of all the stress you caused!

367
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,059
- Mom.
- Seon Ju is sick, Mom.

368
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:45,899
You be quiet! Your cheek is so bruised
you look like a ghost!

369
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:48,270
Mom, let's at least eat.

370
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,639
Let's eat as we fight.

371
00:21:49,639 --> 00:21:52,470
You be quiet too! I hate you all! Get out!

372
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:56,809
Sue the affair partner for alimony
to cover the down payment...

373
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:59,450
or grill Nam Jin
to rent you a tiny apartment.

374
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,579
Get out of this house!

375
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,750
And you too, if you want to defend her!

376
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,790
The kids need to eat,
so I'll keep grilling the meat.

377
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,829
Eat up.

378
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:15,200
Ji Hyun, eat all you want.

379
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:18,869
It's okay.

380
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,859
My gosh.

381
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,230
I used to be able to see
so many stars out here.

382
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,230
I used to...

383
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,970
look at the stars out here...

384
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,669
and end up falling asleep.

385
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,270
- Did you really?
- Yes.

386
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,790
Nam Jin has no assets to split,

387
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,089
and you lost your job.

388
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,159
What do you have now?

389
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,730
- My muscles.
- That's stupid.

390
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:27,069
Have you forgotten you're sick?

391
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,569
All that stress
and alcohol and muscle aches.

392
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:32,210
Did you work that hard
to support him only to get dumped?

393
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:36,240
What did I tell you?
I told you I had a bad feeling about him.

394
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,010
When you brought him home to meet me,

395
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:42,649
he sat there awkwardly
as if he were in a stranger's house.

396
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:45,589
Did I or did I not say he looked like
a fox that shouldn't be trusted?

397
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,819
You said he was sweet,

398
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:49,559
that he cared for you so much.

399
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,730
You insisted,
and this is how he betrayed you?

400
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,899
Will you stop it, Mom?

401
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,629
Mom.

402
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,099
Don't be too harsh on her.

403
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:02,940
You can't push someone too far.

404
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,809
Am I making things up?

405
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:07,680
No. At least finish dinner first.

406
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,710
You'll get hungry
if you interrupt a meal just to scream.

407
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,379
No. I can't eat
when I have something to say.

408
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:16,879
I must vent as I eat
because that makes more space.

409
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,050
Do you know you're venting, then?

410
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,389
You're the best, Mom.

411
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,230
Have you lost your mind?

412
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,099
Shall we start cleaning up?

413
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,399
- I think we should.
- Yes.

414
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,599
- You moron.
- Mom.

415
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,169
You idiot.

416
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:45,750
I'm sorry, Mom.

417
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,450
I'm okay,

418
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,589
but I feel so bad for you, Mom.

419
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:57,859
You struggled so hard
to send me to university.

420
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,099
You must've wanted to see me live happily.

421
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,329
I'm so ashamed.

422
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,409
I thought I could...

423
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:14,139
become successful and spoil you.

424
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:16,339
I thought I could...

425
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:19,609
do that one day.

426
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,649
I got my husband to study in the US,

427
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:24,589
but my own Mom...

428
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:28,119
never got to visit Jeju Island.

429
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,930
I must've thought...

430
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:35,059
having a successful husband
would make you proud.

431
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,829
I am a moron. I was so stupid.

432
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,069
I gave everything to support him
without thinking...

433
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:45,139
of the future. I'm sorry.

434
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,740
You told me...

435
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,780
not to be dull or thick.

436
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,790
I shouldn't have tried so hard.

437
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,030
I was stupid and I tried too hard.

438
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,629
I should've listened to you...

439
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:11,200
and not have been so devoted.

440
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:14,069
I shouldn't have given him everything.

441
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,770
But I didn't listen to you.

442
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,010
I'm really sorry, Mom.

443
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:26,849
You silly thing.

444
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,680
That's what happiness is.

445
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,919
Here's why I'm so upset.

446
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,690
You said yourself
that your dad didn't come home.

447
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,629
I was afraid you would end up like me.

448
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,270
When something like this happens,
it feels like it's my fault.

449
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:52,010
It's my fault, and I'm sorry for that too.

450
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:57,309
You're not at all responsible
for my divorce.

451
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:02,349
Nam Jin was greedy,
and we really weren't a match.

452
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:05,919
He said it was so hard to live with me.

453
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,089
He said he married someone beneath him,

454
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:16,859
and he felt lonely and stressed out
during our whole marriage.

455
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,270
The crazy fool.

456
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,369
I want to...

457
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,740
become way more successful
and make him regret leaving me.

458
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:29,409
But I just don't know what to do.

459
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,250
They say that finding someone better...

460
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,780
and living happily is the best revenge.

461
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,020
I don't think I can do that.
What should I do?

462
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,859
Your daughter is such a loser.

463
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:51,700
Mom. I'm really...

464
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:55,069
I'm so sorry.

465
00:27:55,069 --> 00:27:57,099
I'm sorry, Mom.

466
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,210
I didn't think I'd end up like this.

467
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,780
I'm so sorry, Mom.

468
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,950
Mom.

469
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:17,859
Mom...

470
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:37,510
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

471
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,430
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

472
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,129
Don't you think something's up with them?

473
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:59,099
My mom came to the office.

474
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:01,270
Weren't you the careful type?

475
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,200
You're really pretty.

476
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,270
Lead the way.

477
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,639
Nam Jin, it's me.

478
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:06,839
Open the door.

479
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:09,639
I'm sick of all the Pi women.
I want to cut ties with you!

480
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:12,409
Since you hit me, I'll say one more thing.

481
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,710
Jeon Nam Jin!

482
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,419
Don't you say another word.

483
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,250
