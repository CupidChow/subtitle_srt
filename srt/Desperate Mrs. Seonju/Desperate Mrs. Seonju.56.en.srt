1
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,620
I'm so full.

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,660
(Episode 56)

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,130
By the way.

4
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:18,500
Why do you do everything Ms. Jin says?

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,670
If she does it again, say no.

6
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,939
She said it was
an important deal for the company.

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,339
It's Sang Ah's father's company,

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,339
but you got me the job here,

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,619
and the CEO allowed me to stay,
so I'm grateful for that too.

10
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,889
I hate Sang Ah's guts,
but I want the company to thrive.

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,789
I can't let all my employers go bankrupt.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,529
That's true.

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,459
- Shall we start cleaning up?
- Yes.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,700
Let's go.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,870
How was work today?

16
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:54,029
Yes, that.

17
00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:58,770
We had the first official meeting
with Professor Albert's team...

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,509
whom Mr. Jeon introduced to us
and I think it went well.

19
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,579
- Did it?
- Professor Albert...

20
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:07,410
thinks highly of Nam Jin,
so he's definitely competent.

21
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,649
Sang Ah noticed that much.

22
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:13,649
He could've stayed in the US,
but he returned to be with her.

23
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,220
Nam Jin asked me to observe him
the same way I did So Woo.

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,830
I'll wait and see.

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,229
But darling.

26
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:23,759
What can I do? They're both adamant.

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,470
Not to mention
So Woo lives with Pi Seon Ju.

28
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,970
We might be the only ones
who want him back.

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,140
Sang Ah said
she'd reconsider being with Nam Jin.

30
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,910
She's wavering.

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,809
Is she?

32
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:41,979
Then tell her to be prudent.

33
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:45,190
We should just wait and see how things go.

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,630
Watch out.

35
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,169
I haven't done any cleaning
in a while and it's fun.

36
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,839
My gosh.

37
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:10,110
We might as well do it cheerfully.

38
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,140
Let's go.

39
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,610
- You're pretty good at whistling.
- Am I?

40
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,850
- Catch.
- Okay.

41
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,989
- You can push harder.
- Okay.

42
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:22,019
Here.

43
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:23,889
Move faster.

44
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,590
Move faster.

45
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,430
There.

46
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:34,299
- We're done.
- Yes. Good job.

47
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:36,269
Let's go.

48
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,250
Nam Jin. I went to Manjang-dong...

49
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,850
and met Seon Ju's mom again.

50
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,449
Why do you keep going there?

51
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,859
I had business in the area.

52
00:02:57,859 --> 00:02:59,930
That woman still has a temper.

53
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,600
Seon Ju isn't the only woman
whose husband left after an affair.

54
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,699
She made such a big deal of it.

55
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:07,900
Why do you keep meeting her
when you know what she's like?

56
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,600
You could've just walked by.

57
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,009
They talk about you
like you're the worst guy ever...

58
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:14,569
while they live with Sang Ah's husband.

59
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,239
They're far worse.

60
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,440
How could I ignore the insult?

61
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:23,650
The nasty, hot-tempered old woman...

62
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,620
talked so politely about her homeowner.

63
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,289
You'd think he was above them in class.

64
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,819
Did they ever treat you like that?

65
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,389
I asked her for her homeowner's number...

66
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,799
and she asked if I was going to
kidnap his son to ask for a ransom.

67
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,169
She got fired up as if
she were defending her own family.

68
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:43,600
You'd think he was her son-in-law.

69
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:47,169
Why did you ask her for Mr. Kim's number?

70
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,280
You weren't just passing by, then.

71
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,310
I wasn't.

72
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,210
I went to ask because I was curious.

73
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:55,049
I wanted to ask
what he'd do with Sang Ah...

74
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,049
and what his relationship
with Seon Ju was like.

75
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,720
It would look bad if you were to ask.

76
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,190
Don't you want to know too?

77
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:04,859
I thought Seon Ju
wouldn't care for a man once you left her.

78
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,630
I guess she still has
some skills left in her.

79
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,460
Should I be relieved
she's not waiting for you to come back?

80
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,430
Mom.

81
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,100
I'm really tired.

82
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,269
Goodness.

83
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,340
I'm glad you got divorced.

84
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:22,180
That family is not good for you.

85
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,680
Darn them.

86
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,689
It was a long day for you.

87
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,460
It wasn't.

88
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,859
Sang Ah and Nam Jin...

89
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:44,660
kept comparing the Hansung deal
with their project...

90
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,499
and bragging about it.

91
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:48,869
Is their project that serious?

92
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,140
It is.

93
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,570
Hundreds of millions of dollars
will go into it,

94
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:54,809
and the local government is backing it.

95
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:57,879
That's why they were so proud.

96
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,150
They'll be hard to put up with.

97
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:02,280
Why? Are you jealous?

98
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:03,549
No.

99
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,989
I like our project so much.

100
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,119
I'll pour in all I have and make sure...

101
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,590
it comes out perfectly.

102
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,729
Okay. Go on inside.

103
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:15,999
Okay.

104
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,100
What's wrong?

105
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,080
I must have indigestion.

106
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,350
Do you want some lemon soda?

107
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,780
Shall I let out some blood?

108
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,280
I know how to do it.

109
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,859
No, wait.

110
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,189
I'm scared.

111
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:48,090
- Look away.
- Wait. Not yet.

112
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,700
- Don't...
- What are you doing?

113
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,129
Why are you sitting so close?

114
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,470
Sit far apart. Move!

115
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,270
She doesn't feel well.

116
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,470
How stressed out
must she have been to get sick?

117
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,539
- I was going to...
- No. I feel fine.

118
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:04,239
I'll get some medicine.

119
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:12,289
What are you doing?

120
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:16,390
Is that...

121
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:19,090
When was your last time?

122
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,260
When did you have your last period?

123
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,460
My period...

124
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,629
It's sporadic
and I sometimes skip a month or two.

125
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:31,600
You two. Be really honest.

126
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:34,570
Are you sure
you didn't do anything that night?

127
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,879
Go and get a pregnancy test.

128
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,049
No, wait. I'll get it.

129
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,249
Oh, dear.

130
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,499
(Pregnancy Test Kit)

131
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,669
It was awfully hard
to find a pharmacy that was still open.

132
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,270
Do it now.

133
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,179
Why did you end up doing it?

134
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,150
What if she's pregnant?

135
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,289
Why did you drink so much?

136
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,020
How much did you drink?

137
00:07:25,489 --> 00:07:28,429
I don't know. I think I drank a lot.

138
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,229
I told you to stay away from women.

139
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:33,200
It can't be that.

140
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,600
It must not be that.

141
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:39,140
What's taking her so long?

142
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:44,239
What is it?

143
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,879
What is it?

144
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,789
Oh, my gosh.

145
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,229
- Mom.
- Ma'am.

146
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:05,700
Ma'am.

147
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,470
Pour her some water.

148
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,800
Get off me!

149
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,639
You disgusting thing.

150
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,080
Don't hit me.

151
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:01,090
You darn crow. Go away.

152
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,420
- Darn it. I hate crows.
- It hurts.

153
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:13,330
This is impossible.

154
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:16,399
How could this be?

155
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,109
I should've known...

156
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:21,940
this would happen when you brought her
saying you didn't care for her.

157
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:25,580
I should've refused to let her stay
until the very end.

158
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,979
I was too naive.

159
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,879
Is Woo Sang the dad?

160
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,489
Why would you even ask that?

161
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,619
We never know!

162
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,690
Are there any other possibilities?

163
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:39,430
No.

164
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:44,960
You managed to knock her up in one go?

165
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,430
My sperm must be potent.

166
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,470
Be quiet!

167
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,899
What will you do now?

168
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,070
Will you really marry her?

169
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:56,040
That'll end your career as a romance lead.

170
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:58,009
Actors with two or three kids
manage just fine.

171
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,080
Your brother married
then divorced that weird girl.

172
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,920
You have no idea
how much that hurt us both.

173
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:09,420
I really wished and hoped
to pick a nice girl...

174
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,259
and marry you into...

175
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:15,259
a good family that would make me proud.

176
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,269
I'm sorry, Mom.

177
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:25,710
I know you went through a lot to raise me.

178
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:29,979
But I enjoy being with her,

179
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,840
and I feel at ease.

180
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:38,680
Did I go through all that just for this?

181
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,619
I'm so disappointed.

00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:54,369
My gosh.

184
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:57,139
I had such a horrible dream last night.

185
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,409
What dream?

186
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,210
I stepped into the yard...

187
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,509
and heard a crow squawking.

188
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,680
It was a dreadful sound.

189
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,320
I looked around for it...

190
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,489
and found it sitting on
the bench by the salon.

191
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:15,290
I had a bad feeling, so to chase it away,

192
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,019
I got a broom and whacked it hard.

193
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:19,659
It flew away...

194
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:22,359
but came back and landed right here.

195
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,529
It was such a freaky dream.

196
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:27,470
Mom. Isn't that a conception dream?

197
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,800
Why? Are you pregnant?

198
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,670
Come on, Mom.

199
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:34,009
Crows are an unwelcome guest.

200
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:36,609
It means trouble will befall the family.

201
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:40,609
I must've had the dream
because Nam Jin's mom was here.

202
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:44,019
She was here? What for?

203
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:45,149
I don't know.

204
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:47,149
She asked for the homeowner's number.

205
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,649
Mr. Kim's number?

206
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:50,389
I don't know what she's up to.

207
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,729
She should stay in the apartment
her lover's son bought her.

208
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:56,300
Why does she keep coming here?

209
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:00,100
Mom. You mean "son's lover."

210
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:02,600
No, wait.

211
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,499
What did you just say?
His lover bought her an apartment?

212
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:08,970
She bragged to no end
how her son's great girlfriend...

213
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,340
had bought her the apartment.

214
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,450
She bought it for her?

215
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,279
She's head over heels in love with him.

216
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,680
Do you two know who she is?

217
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,820
No.

218
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:23,389
She shouted so loud
I bet the whole neighborhood heard.

219
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:24,889
I was so annoyed.

220
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,729
She caused such a fuss.

221
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:27,960
The darn hag.

222
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:29,629
Mom.

223
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:32,629
It's okay. I know what words to ignore.

224
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,129
How did such a smart girl...

225
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,570
come from a man who's such a jerk?

226
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,540
I'll ignore that too.

227
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,369
Okay. Good girl.

228
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:45,779
Sorry. I should watch what I say.

229
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:00,229
Why is it so weird?

230
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,359
It's almost dreary.

231
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,499
What time did you come home last night?

232
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,940
Is this because I got back late?

233
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,810
Mom. I have a life too.

234
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:16,080
I can't live with you if you're like this.

235
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,050
Since it has come to this,

236
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,180
- you should get married.
- Who?

237
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,820
- Those two?
- For real?

238
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,190
I can't stop thinking
that Woo Sang is losing out,

239
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,430
and I want to object to the end.

240
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,690
But I have no choice.

241
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,399
I can't evict a baby
that's already inside you.

242
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:40,570
What?

243
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,430
She's pregnant?

244
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:44,440
I apologize.

245
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,279
You said your family was normal, right?

246
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:53,479
What?

247
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,879
You said the day you moved in...

248
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,249
that your mom was sweet and kind...

249
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,019
and your dad was... He's at sea, right?

250
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,430
Yes. I did say that.

251
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,060
Tae Sang's ex's family was a mess,

252
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:12,769
and then there was the blackmailer family
that caused a scene at Ms. Shim's salon.

253
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:15,940
There are so many weirdos out there.

254
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,200
I take solace in the fact
that your family is...

255
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,970
not like that.

256
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,040
Must you bring up the past?

257
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:26,749
You said your older sisters
were happily married, right?

258
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:29,009
What? Well...

259
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,479
- The thing is...
- That's right.

260
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:34,920
Everyone is so happy,

261
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,060
that the neighbors call them
the honey house.

262
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:39,659
Are you her spokesperson? You fool.

263
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:42,529
Okay, then.

264
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,700
I'll accept you only because
you're from a happy family.

265
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:49,170
Get married, but in secret.

266
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:52,170
No one can hear about it
until his drama...

267
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,369
and endorsement contracts expire.

268
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,279
- Okay.
- The wedding...

269
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,950
will be a small affair
that'll double as a family get-together.

270
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,350
Your manager Mr. Jang
will take the photos.

271
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:06,290
Can you do your own hair and makeup?

272
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:08,790
- Yes.
- Good.

273
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,060
I was kind enough to accept you.

274
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,129
No one from your family
will object or complain, will they?

275
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:17,060
- Of course not.
- They're not like that.

276
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,430
Okay, then.
Visit your mother and get permission.

277
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,300
I don't see why you should ask.

278
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:25,739
Who would refuse
a son-in-law like Woo Sang?

279
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,869
You're right.

280
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:33,149
Oh, dear.

281
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:45,489
My sisters aren't happily married.
What should we do?

282
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:49,190
As if my family is normal and happy.

283
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,430
It's the very family
that caused a scene at the salon.

284
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,999
Let's let her believe...

285
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:55,970
your family is ordinary.

286
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,340
If we tell her now that we lied,

287
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:01,310
she'll think worse of you.

288
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,979
She'll meet everyone at the wedding.

289
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:05,940
What then?

290
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:10,119
I don't have any brothers-in-law
who'll be as sweet as honey.

291
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:14,519
Then...

292
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,859
We should hire fill-ins?

293
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,759
- Yes.
- Will that be okay?

294
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,269
What if she finds out afterward?

295
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,100
We just need to get through the day.

296
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,869
Then we can do damage control.

297
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:34,040
My mom can't stay angry for long.

298
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,680
But if we tell her the truth now,
we can never get married.

299
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,609
Then...

300
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:44,619
since we told your mother
that my dad was out at sea,

301
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,889
I should ask my sisters
to bring a husband substitute?

302
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:50,989
Yes. Get them to bring someone...

303
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:54,029
who'll pass as their husbands
who can hang around...

304
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,629
long enough to last the wedding.

305
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,629
- Since it's just one day?
- Yes.

306
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,999
It's just for one day, not two or three.

307
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,470
We barely got her permission.

308
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,070
If she were to realize
we lied about everything,

309
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,239
what would she think of you?

310
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,609
She'd think I was a witch.

311
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,209
Would she accept you then?

312
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:17,350
What we're doing isn't bad.

313
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,090
We're putting on a play.

314
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:21,490
What are we?

315
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:23,159
- We're actors.
- Yes.

316
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,859
This is like...

317
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,129
an improvised play
we're putting on in real life.

318
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,859
You're right.

319
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,500
You're pretty smart, Woo Sang.

320
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:37,699
I am.

321
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:43,340
To celebrate the fact
that we'll get married,

322
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:45,609
shall we hug?

323
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:49,280
Sure.

324
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:58,619
(Jin Architecture)

325
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,550
Step aside.

326
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,879
Your puberty came late.

327
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,750
Don't you care whom you go out with?

328
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,850
What?

329
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
Did you eat something weird for breakfast?

330
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:33,330
What are you on about?

331
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:36,129
You and Kim So Woo.

332
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:38,699
That's not normal.

333
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:40,800
I know you're not smart,

334
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,469
so I'll tell you once more.

335
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,969
Mr. Kim is...

336
00:18:44,969 --> 00:18:47,969
a generous man
who saved us from homelessness.

337
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:51,139
We're nothing but a landlord and tenant.

338
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,209
My gosh.

339
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,320
You decided to stay because he let you?

340
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,119
Do you accept everything you're given?

341
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:05,260
What?

342
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,389
It's nothing compared to you, Mr. Jeon.

343
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:11,359
Sang Ah bought you an apartment.

344
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,100
You got a new car too.

345
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,629
And what about the watch?

346
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,000
Was all that from Sang Ah?

347
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,139
Goodness.

348
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:19,810
It's as if you're being sold off.

349
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,439
Get your own life under control.

350
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,280
I'm being sold off?

351
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,669
You're just the same.

352
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:54,869
What do you mean?

353
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,609
You acted as if I was a pathetic cheater,

354
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,609
but you do that with Seon Ju?

355
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,149
Is this about yesterday?

356
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,889
It looked like she'd missed lunch
because you'd put her to work all day,

357
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,790
so I saved her a cupcake.

358
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,760
Did it upset you that much?

359
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,959
I wondered what she meant
by "train tracks."

360
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,830
I guess she was trying to say
you run parallel to each other.

361
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,540
Don't you think the tracks are too close?

362
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:30,109
Can you go the distance
without crossing over?

363
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:33,409
The fact that
you came up with a definition...

364
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,580
about train tracks means
you're bothered about each other.

365
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,449
I'm not used to you being like this.

366
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,459
Why do you suddenly care so much
about Seon Ju and I?

367
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,359
- What?
- Are you worried our tracks will cross?

368
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,590
Why would you worry?

369
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:51,899
You said I was a pot
calling the kettle black.

370
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,429
You're even worse.

371
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,000
If you pretended to be flawless and moral,

372
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,669
keep up the charade to the end!

373
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,379
You paid the balance.

374
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,820
The house is really yours now.

375
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,919
The registration certificate
will take a few days.

376
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:15,889
Okay.

377
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,290
You had a long face when you put
the down payment on the house.

378
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,830
You settled the balance,
so why aren't you pleased?

379
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,929
Is your chief harassing you again?

380
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:29,899
No. My younger brother is getting married.

381
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:31,740
Congratulate him, then.

382
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:34,639
Fewer people get married these days.
Isn't this a good thing?

383
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:36,240
It's embarrassing to say,

384
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,980
but he knocked up the girl.

385
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:41,780
I'm wondering
if they're somewhat reluctant.

386
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:44,619
Oh, dear. Did the girl get to him?

387
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,020
Is your brother a catch?

388
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,389
Objectively speaking, he's losing out.

389
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,689
Put on the brakes
if you think it's not right.

390
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:52,990
I want to.

391
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,030
But they won't listen to a guy
who failed in marriage himself.

392
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,659
You're divorced too?

393
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:01,969
We split up even though
we'd dated for eight years prior.

394
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:05,699
These two
haven't known each other for long.

395
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,740
Let them be.
They must figure out life on their own.

396
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,379
Stopping them will only ruin your ties.

397
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:13,550
Did you tell your chief your new idea?

398
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:15,379
- What did he say?
- He said no.

399
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,320
Do you have anything else?

400
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,320
Why does he say no to everything?

401
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,520
How about a dating show that...

402
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:32,929
Hey.

403
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:35,230
Woo Sang must be upset
since Mi Ju got fired...

404
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,070
after the scandal broke out.

405
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,139
You told me to seduce him
when he was feeling down.

406
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,480
Yes. Bye, Mom.

407
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,689
Hey. I heard you got fired.

408
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,389
Are you getting kicked out?

409
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,760
How does it feel to fall after barking up
a tree out of your league?

410
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,469
I don't know how that feels.

411
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,770
I see. You don't know the feeling.

412
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,340
Good for you.

413
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,869
Why are you here?

414
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:14,169
You don't need to know.

415
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:17,080
Try to be happy.

416
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,109
Even if life is sad and tough,

417
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,580
you're the type to survive it all,
just like a cockroach.

418
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,980
Goodbye.

419
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:35,659
When will she grow up?

420
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:39,429
I'm not her mom
and even I'm worried about her.

421
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:42,070
I should've taken her home.

422
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:44,000
What's wrong with you?

423
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:48,240
Until your drama is over
and you announce the marriage,

424
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,109
don't be seen in public together, okay?

425
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,679
Woo Sang.

426
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:55,149
Hello, Ms. Oh.

427
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,280
- Hi.
- How did you get in?

428
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,850
I saw Mi Ju leave. We met outside.

429
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:02,619
What brings you here?

430
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,659
You haven't been eating
since Woo Sang's scandal broke, have you?

431
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:08,560
I bought you some porridge.

432
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:10,699
Oh, gosh. Thanks.

433
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,730
You fired Mi Ju
as your helper and manager, right?

434
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:17,169
Why do you care...

435
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,369
That's right.
We're done with her completely.

436
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:22,010
You don't have to wonder.

437
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:23,740
You're the best.

438
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,879
Am I?

439
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:28,649
- Yes. Mom is the best.
- Thanks.

440
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:34,090
A dating show
that's like an idol survival audition?

441
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,219
"Love Survival."

442
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,520
You start with 100 people,
50 men and 50 women,

443
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,159
then keep dropping those
who aren't popular.

444
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,959
When you're left with five couples,

445
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,600
you ask them if they'll stay or switch.

446
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,000
Try to get them to switch partners.

447
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,070
There are similar shows already.

448
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,010
Other networks are doing just that.

449
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,510
Really? I was just throwing out ideas.

450
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,550
Is there really a network
that airs such a show?

451
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,010
Yes.

452
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,750
That means my ideas
could be made into a show.

453
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,090
Your chief is the one
who can't see the trend.

454
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,959
A guy who can't move with the times
is in charge of your department?

455
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Nam Jin.

456
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:22,399
Talk while you eat.

457
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:25,469
I cooked for you for once.

458
00:25:25,469 --> 00:25:27,439
Show your appreciation.

459
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,939
Who's your mom?
Did she teach you to be like this?

460
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,649
It's tasty.

461
00:25:35,449 --> 00:25:38,780
Why do you always have a long face
when you're in love?

462
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,250
Are you in love?

463
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,419
I've had enough.

464
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,290
Goodness.

465
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,659
You look more upset
than when you were living with Seon Ju.

466
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,969
You bragged so much...

467
00:25:56,699 --> 00:25:59,369
and pretended to be busy, and your desk...

468
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,369
ended up...

469
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,379
being right across from mine...

470
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:05,139
in the same space.

471
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:06,879
Shall I get it for you?

472
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,879
Excuse me.

473
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,520
Lean in.

474
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,129
Wait a little longer. It's almost done.

475
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:24,459
Okay.

476
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Here we go.

477
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,550
You can move in after the wedding.

478
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:47,119
Until then, stay with your family.

479
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,250
Or people will gossip again.

480
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,459
Here you go.

481
00:26:54,889 --> 00:26:57,629
It's kimchi jjigae with pork.

482
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,600
It looks amazing.

483
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:01,399
Is this fatty pork belly?

484
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:03,469
The meat is extra thick.

485
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,010
Shall we ask the homeowner to join us?

486
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:08,709
- Shall we?
- Ask him.

487
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:12,379
Kimchi jjigae with fatty pork belly.

488
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:16,409
It's Mi Ju's favorite.

489
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:17,919
It is.

490
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,649
Hey. Mi Ju.

491
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:23,219
My gosh. What are you doing here?

492
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,129
- Goodness.
- Sit down, everyone.

493
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:29,859
I have something to say.

494
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:31,929
What is it?

495
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,030
Were you fired?

496
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
No.

497
00:27:40,469 --> 00:27:42,139
What is it, then? Are you on vacation?

498
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,280
You're scaring me.

499
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,550
Were you conned?

500
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:51,980
No.

501
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,090
What is it, then?

502
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,889
You told me not to call you.

503
00:27:55,889 --> 00:27:58,060
Why are you barging in
all of a sudden acting like this?

504
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,090
You got into trouble again, didn't you?

505
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,600
I had a weird dream last night.

506
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,560
Was it because of you
and not Nam Jin's mom?

507
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,199
What do you have to say?

508
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,369
I...

509
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:16,740
want to get married.

510
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,379
You what?

511
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:20,949
I'm getting married.

512
00:28:22,449 --> 00:28:25,449
Mom. Auntie Mi Ju is going to get married.

513
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,899
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

514
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:54,980
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

515
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,750
You must've found a guy
if you want to get married.

516
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,820
Jeong Woo Sang.

517
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,290
The woman he was at the hotel with.
It was me.

518
00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:04,719
There's no way it's easy dating a woman
who's not yet divorced.

519
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,590
I should meet her husband soon.

520
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,689
Because you don't want to become a liar,

521
00:29:08,689 --> 00:29:11,429
you want to turn
our whole family into frauds?

522
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,159
How can you say that?

523
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,030
