1
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,760
They won't have submitted their work yet.

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,029
The deadline is not far off.

3
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:18,699
Let's go and buy Ji Hyun a nice meal.

4
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,769
Okay. What shall we eat?

5
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,770
(Hansung Company)

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,740
So you and your mom moved in with her mom,

7
00:00:29,909 --> 00:00:31,380
and her mom lost everything,

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,279
so you all live with the new homeowner?

9
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:36,479
And this kid is the homeowner's son?

10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,020
What a complicated mess.

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,359
How did she end up losing the house?

12
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:47,090
Even so, how could
a whole family of single women...

13
00:00:47,459 --> 00:00:50,329
live upstairs and downstairs
with a single dad?

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
Your mom's family is a total disaster.

15
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,340
If Nam Jin hadn't gotten divorced,

16
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,709
he could've gotten shackled
and dragged down too.

17
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,670
What does "get shackled" mean?

18
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:02,509
What?

19
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:05,009
You don't need to know.

20
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:09,319
Kids. Shall we go to a karaoke after this?

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,950
I'm a pretty good singer.

22
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:13,850
Eat up.

23
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,399
- Jeon Ji Hyun!
- Kim Tae Ri!

24
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:25,669
"Jeon Ji Hyun, Kim Tae Ri?"

25
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:27,000
Is this some kind of film?

26
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,440
- Excuse me.
- Whatever.

27
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,240
Did you see...

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,940
a little boy and girl about this tall?

29
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:35,839
No.

30
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,309
The little girl looks like this,

31
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:41,209
and this is the little boy.

32
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,750
We didn't see them.

33
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:48,789
Where are they?

34
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,390
Hey.

35
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,660
Hello?

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,199
Okay.

37
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,669
Your dad is on his way.

38
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:06,410
Spend some time with him,

39
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,580
then go home when your mom comes for you.

40
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:11,809
- Ji Hyun!
- Mom!

41
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:12,850
- Tae Ri!
- Dad.

42
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,050
- My gosh.
- Dad.

43
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,850
Mother!

44
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,919
My gosh. Why are you shouting?

45
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,430
Mother! Why did you take the kids
without calling me first?

46
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,900
"Mother?"

47
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,799
Right. Why would you call me that?

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,299
You decided to call me "Ms. Wang."

49
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:36,500
What do you think you're doing?

50
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,669
What's wrong with
bringing my granddaughter...

51
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:40,509
to a cafe because I missed her?

52
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,210
You should've told me first.

53
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,539
You can't do this without talking to me!

54
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,549
Mom.

55
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,549
Nam Jin. You talk to her.

56
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,250
You said you'd tell Seon Ju.

57
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,319
What? You put her up to this?

58
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,720
What's wrong with a dad
wanting to see his kid?

59
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,960
He was all distracted and down
because he missed Ji Hyun...

60
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,630
and asked me to bring her
so we could eat out.

61
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,229
I took time out of my busy schedule,

62
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:05,000
and she's acting like I'm a kidnapper.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,069
Did you two plan this on purpose
because today...

64
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:09,699
was the deadline for the proposal?

65
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:11,910
You're right.

66
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,310
That's it!

67
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,479
You're all insane.

68
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,609
- I won't let this go.
- What?

69
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,150
What will you do, then?
Will you report this?

70
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,880
Yes, I will!

71
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,549
What?

72
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:27,019
Look who's calling.

73
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:28,819
Hello?

74
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,819
Did you find the children?

75
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,829
Yes. Detective.

76
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:36,060
The people right here are kidnappers.

77
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,060
I want to report them.

78
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,769
- What are you doing?
- Yes.

79
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,440
- What...
- What do you think you're doing?

80
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,539
Hey.

81
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,639
You must be this boy's dad
who lives with them.

82
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,310
I told him to go home,
but he kept following us,

83
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,509
so I brought him along and fed him too.

84
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:53,850
How dare you act like that?

85
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,949
Wait. What's going on?

86
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,449
You live together?

87
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:00,690
He's their homeowner.

88
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,819
Her family lives with him.

89
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,660
Is Pi Seon Ju's family
living in your house, honey?

90
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,829
"Honey?" What's going on?

91
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:11,930
Are you two... My gosh.

92
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,269
You're married?

93
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,799
Hey, kid. Is she your mom?

94
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,639
What an embarrassment.

95
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,079
You two are a married couple...

96
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,940
and you are living together?

97
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,749
Oh, my goodness.

98
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,450
Why is that embarrassing?

99
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,479
We're tenants and we pay rent.

100
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,749
Do you think that's normal?

101
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,950
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

102
00:04:34,989 --> 00:04:36,919
I meant well and look at what happened.

103
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,859
Ji Hyun. Granny is leaving.

104
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:41,390
I can't stand the humiliation.

105
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,559
What the heck?

106
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:44,900
My goodness.

107
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,369
So...

108
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:51,840
you two live in the same house?

109
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,379
Yes. But that's not
what's important right now.

110
00:04:58,379 --> 00:04:59,510
Hello, detective.

111
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,549
Yes. I will sue for kidnapping.

112
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,720
Take the call. It's the police.

113
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:09,590
My gosh.

114
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,289
Why?

115
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,160
What did we do wrong?

116
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,100
Goodness.

117
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,600
Officers are on the way
to discuss the kidnapping.

118
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,999
Wait right here.

119
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,109
- My gosh.
- While we wait for the police,

120
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,609
I'll take the kids home quickly.

121
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,210
- Okay.
- Tae Ri.

122
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,179
Ji Hyun. Let's go.

123
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,520
Don't look at them.

124
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:42,660
My gosh.

125
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,629
What?

126
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,530
Here she is.

127
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,840
Today was the project deadline.

128
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,679
I'm positive
they got my ex-mother-in-law...

129
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:06,379
to kidnap the kids
to make us lose our minds.

130
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,650
A grandma took her granddaughter
out for a snack...

131
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,850
and to play for a while.
How is that kidnapping?

132
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,549
She took her without the carer's consent.

133
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,049
Isn't that kidnapping?

134
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:18,989
Our divorce agreement says
I can see Ji Hyun whenever I want.

135
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,960
Did you forget that?

136
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,760
You should've made an appointment.

137
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,499
Yes. He's right about that.

138
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,830
It's not like that.

139
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,570
We'd just finished a big project,
and we wanted to eat out with my kid.

140
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,809
Then you should've told me.
You didn't even take my call.

141
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,739
You got in our way,
submitted your proposal on time,

142
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:39,580
and waltzed in here cheerfully.

143
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,979
I'm here because I wanted to
get to know Ji Hyun.

144
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:43,679
Why should you get to know my daughter?

145
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:45,150
What right do you have to say that?

146
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:47,489
You two live together.

147
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:50,890
This is unbelievable.

148
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,629
He got you a job
and let you stay at his place.

149
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,429
What relationship is this exactly?

150
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:58,799
When did it all start?

151
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:02,600
Did you two get together before we did?

152
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:04,799
- My gosh.
- Mr. Jeon.

153
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:07,840
How can you say that when you know...

154
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,539
what Ms. Pi did for you
and how you treated her?

155
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:13,549
That's what it looks like.

156
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:14,650
- What?
- My gosh.

157
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,379
You only see what you want to see.

158
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:19,419
Yes. So we live together.

159
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,989
But you created the circumstances.

160
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,289
You forced us to pay your settlement,

161
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:26,859
so we had to sell the house,

162
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:29,260
and when we had nowhere to go,
he let us stay.

163
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:31,999
My gosh. Were you that poor?

164
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:34,830
What? Darn you. We're not poor.

165
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:37,169
Okay, fine. Let's say you're not.

166
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:39,340
You put your house up for sale,

167
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,039
and Mr. Kim happened to buy it?

168
00:07:43,179 --> 00:07:46,210
It was a great deal
because they were desperate to sell.

169
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:49,679
This wouldn't have happened
if you'd agreed to settle for less.

170
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,919
That's right. Thanks to you,
Mr. Kim made a massive profit.

171
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:56,320
I bet he's grateful to you for that.

172
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,090
You shouldn't live like this, you know.

173
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:04,700
You seem to be doing all sorts of
silly things to try to get me to quit,

174
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:06,330
but it's only backfiring.

175
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,039
Would I resign after this?
I'd fight even harder!

176
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:10,939
- You...
- Ms. Pi.

177
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,609
Don't get carried away.

178
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:25,549
How did the Hansung project go?

179
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,650
Did both teams submit their work?

180
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:31,119
Only one had when I asked earlier.
I'll call again to confirm.

181
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,030
Okay.

182
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,799
You're home.

183
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,670
You look tired.

184
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,670
You have a lot on your mind
including the personnel shuffle.

185
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,239
Yes.

186
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,310
Is Sang Ah still dating Mr. Jeon?

187
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,379
They're only working on
the project together.

188
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:54,580
She told me they were ending
their personal relationship.

189
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:58,779
How did she end up like that?

190
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:09,930
I'm positive...

191
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,029
that they did this to mess with us.

192
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:15,070
Still, try not to get too worked up.

193
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,269
I'm not worked up!
What makes you think I am?

194
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:20,210
How could he use his own kid for this?

195
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,909
Are you out of your mind?

196
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,940
Are you in your right mind, then?

197
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,979
The kids were on their own
in the playground.

198
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,050
If my mom hadn't shown up,

199
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:30,119
something worse could've happened.

200
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,119
What?

201
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,550
How important could work be?

202
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,920
You've been using work
as an excuse to hang out.

203
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,159
Did you abandon the kids?

204
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,159
Mr. Jeon!

205
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:42,700
This story deserves its own episode
on "Love and War."

206
00:09:42,729 --> 00:09:44,229
You have to work at my company...

207
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,600
and live with my husband?

208
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,930
Is this a coincidence?

209
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:50,739
Did you learn from some TV villains
to concoct this plan?

210
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:53,970
You're the one
who purposely befriended So Woo.

211
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:56,680
Detective.
Can't she be charged with something?

212
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Darn you!

213
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,450
You called me
"mistress" and "affair partner."

214
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,450
You used my husband to get a job...

215
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,979
and now you're living with him.

216
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,450
Who's more immoral now?

217
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,190
Watch what you say, kidnappers.

218
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,019
Detective. Will you type something up?

219
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:13,590
- Fill in the form.
- Just a moment.

220
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,060
Hello?

221
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,830
Yes.

222
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:20,729
Her name is Pi Seon Ju.

223
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,239
It's a bit complicated.

224
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,440
Okay, Detective Kim.

225
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,340
My gosh.

226
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:32,310
You must be famous.

227
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,810
- My gosh.
- This is my home ground.

228
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,420
Don't think of getting away with this.

229
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,749
You go on a blind date in your free time,

230
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:40,989
you frequent the police station,

231
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,389
and you spend time with Mr. Kim here.

232
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,629
You act like
you care so much about the kids.

233
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,629
Aren't you ashamed to expose them to this?

234
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,259
My goodness.

235
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,330
Is it even right to let you raise Ji Hyun?

236
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,200
What's your problem, punk?
Is that all you can say?

237
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,769
- Don't.
- Ms. Pi.

238
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:01,810
- Control yourself.
- Ms. Pi.

239
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,580
Didn't I hit you enough?

240
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,550
Your cheek must still ache from the punch.
Did you forget it already?

241
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,249
- Let go of me.
- Ms. Pi. Don't get so worked up.

242
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:11,820
- Stop it.
- Do you see that?

243
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,820
Do you see how much she hates me?

244
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,960
How could I tell her
I'd like to take Ji Hyun out to eat?

245
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,759
She'd just get upset and fight.

246
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:23,659
I didn't want to risk it.

247
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,769
- What's wrong with...
- Ms. Pi!

248
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,300
- Darn it!
- My gosh!

249
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,100
That's enough. Calm down.

250
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,670
If you keep this up, I can't help you
even if this is your home ground.

251
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,909
You insist he got his mother...

252
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:38,739
to take your daughter...

253
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,810
in order to ruin your project.

254
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,479
That story won't stand.

255
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,850
And you sir.
I get that you want to see your kid.

256
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:51,989
But however scary your ex-wife is,

257
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:55,999
from now on, be sure to talk to her
before taking your kid somewhere.

258
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,759
Okay.

259
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:13,680
The day the proposal was due,

260
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,249
just hours before it was due,
you wanted to see Ji Hyun then?

261
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,389
Enough that you...

262
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:21,720
asked your mother to get her?

263
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:23,960
Think whatever you want.

264
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,629
I don't want to believe
that was your intention.

265
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:29,659
But if it was, you two hit rock bottom.

266
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,129
You can try your hardest
to slither your way out of the blame,

267
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:35,570
but I know.

268
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:38,869
Were you two that afraid of us?

269
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:42,680
You two condemned us for having an affair.

270
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,479
Were you jealous of us?

271
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:48,310
You acted like you were prim and proper
while sneaking around yourself.

272
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:49,920
Do you think we're like you?

273
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,979
You're not.

274
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,450
You two are even worse. You live together.

275
00:12:54,749 --> 00:12:56,759
You made way more progress than us.

276
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,529
My gosh.

277
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:01,930
This is shocking.

278
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,100
We don't have to listen to this. Let's go.

279
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,710
We got to see
how cheap and dirty you can play.

280
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,379
See how high you can climb that way.

281
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:19,979
Okay. We'll do just that and speed ahead.

282
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:22,180
- Let's go.
- Okay.

283
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,149
My gosh.

284
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,399
Hi, Mom.

285
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:44,899
Yes, it's over.

286
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,009
The kidnappers got off with a warning.

287
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:51,879
It was their first offense.

288
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,909
Did the kids eat?

289
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:55,710
Not yet.

290
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,590
Jin Ju searched for the kids everywhere...

291
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,989
before going back to work
to handle something.

292
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,290
She's not home, then?

293
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:07,830
Tell her to bring the kids over.
Let's all eat out.

294
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,529
Mom, will you come out with the kids?

295
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,100
Really?

296
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:15,940
Okay.

297
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,040
She's not interested,
but we can take the kids somewhere.

298
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:26,009
Okay.

299
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,450
- Let's get out of here.
- Yes.

300
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:38,519
Sorry to keep you waiting.

301
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,359
Did you find the kids?

302
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,989
Yes. It scared us all.

303
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,430
Let's go.

304
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:50,570
You two. Don't ever go off
with someone like that again.

305
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,369
- Okay.
- I thought it was okay...

306
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:53,869
because it was Grandma.

307
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:57,139
If you want to go somewhere
with someone you don't live with,

308
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:00,080
even if they're a relative,
you must tell your family first.

309
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:02,409
I'm sorry, Mom.

310
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,019
The food is here.

311
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:13,290
Here you go.

312
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:16,800
Goodness. It looks delicious.

313
00:15:17,999 --> 00:15:19,629
You must've been scared too, Dong Won.

314
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,129
Eat all you want.

315
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:22,570
- Yes.
- Good.

316
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:23,999
Here.

317
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,609
Thanks.

318
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:30,810
Thank you.

319
00:15:33,409 --> 00:15:35,979
We didn't order dumplings.

320
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,779
- It's on the house.
- What?

321
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,649
You're raising three kids in this economy.

322
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:42,859
What? Well, we're...

323
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,290
You're patriots.

324
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,529
We love seeing a happy family.

325
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,330
- What?
- Families these days...

326
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,300
rarely eat out together.

327
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,899
Even if they do,
they're all glued to their phones.

328
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:55,330
Some even fight throughout the meal.

329
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,440
You looked so happy together,

330
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,509
and it warmed my heart.

331
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,379
The chef is making tangsuyuk
and chili chicken right now.

332
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:05,580
I'll bring you some.

333
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,680
No, it's not what...

334
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,779
Thank you.

335
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,019
He'll give us
tangsuyuk and chili chicken too.

336
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,550
Can we take the leftovers home?

337
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,720
Of course you can.

338
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,690
Your eldest is a smart one.

339
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,619
Just like his dad.

340
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,060
The younger son takes after his mom.

341
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,729
- You think so?
- Yes.

342
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:29,499
Your daughter is awesomely pretty
because she looks like neither of you.

343
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,869
Is she? You have a great eye.

344
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:34,710
And a great wit.

345
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,810
I've been in business for years.

346
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,840
My eye is what keeps me on top.

347
00:16:39,909 --> 00:16:42,409
The food must be ready by now.
I'll get it for you.

348
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,249
- Thank him and dig in.
- Thank you.

349
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:46,989
- Do you want some?
- Thank you for the food.

350
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:51,590
Dong Won, do you want a dumpling?

351
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,690
- Yes.
- Okay.

352
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,460
Tae Ri, do you want a dumpling?

353
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,600
- I do.
- Do you?

354
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:07,440
What do you think about
the AC unit and built-in closet?

355
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,409
You can have them if you want.

356
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:11,639
Well, it's not exactly for free.

357
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:14,250
Isn't 1,500 dollars too much?

358
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,679
How much do you want to pay?
Shall I ask if they'll take 1,000?

359
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,719
Yes.

360
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,959
You walked off sulking last time.

361
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:29,760
What's wrong?

362
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:33,129
I can solve everything
minus what I can't. Talk to me.

363
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,500
I swear that...

364
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,340
when the house I buy doubles in price,

365
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:42,810
I'll throw my resignation letter
in my chief's face.

366
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,439
Is he a nutcase?

367
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,580
Totally.

368
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,280
He was born in the year of the chicken...

369
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,879
and he pecks me like crazy.

370
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:52,719
Why?

371
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:56,050
Why would a chief harass a director?
It's about the show, of course.

372
00:17:56,719 --> 00:18:00,290
He wants something provocative,
sensational, and crazy.

373
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,490
How can I come up with that
when I'm not crazy?

374
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,899
Hey. How about something like this?

375
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
What is it?

376
00:18:09,469 --> 00:18:13,240
There's a show called
"Aren't We Divorced?"

377
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:15,540
Why don't you go a step further...

378
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:18,980
and include the affair partners?

379
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:23,480
Put them all together
and let them fight it out.

380
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,020
What?

381
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,350
You don't like it?

382
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:29,790
You're...

383
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,090
a genius.

384
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:34,859
I get that a lot.

385
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:36,129
How do I cast people?

386
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:37,929
Would anyone volunteer?

387
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,399
How do I find such couples?

388
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:40,869
You don't even have to look.

389
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:44,969
At my sister's company.
The cheating husband she divorced,

390
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,570
his mistress, and her husband too.
They all work there.

391
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,480
She's actually living that reality show.

392
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,149
It's a crazy documentary.

393
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:57,480
Put up a few cameras
and you'll have a whole episode.

394
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,080
Can I film them?

395
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:01,090
Will you ask your sister?

396
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:04,090
Can't you take a joke as a joke?

397
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:06,929
I'm serious. I'm desperate.

398
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,760
Shoving cameras in their faces
might be too much.

399
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:13,770
Let's twist it a bit.

400
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,070
How?

401
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:20,169
"I'm crazy worried about her already.
Why must you do this to me too?"

402
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:27,080
Put it on top of the wardrobe.

403
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:28,209
Okay.

404
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,879
Are you reading your script?

405
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,919
- Yes.
- Are you having trouble memorizing it?

406
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:36,359
Shall I play your love interest?

407
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:38,419
No. I can never focus then.

408
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,429
Sons are useless.
They're no good once they grow up.

409
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,100
Mi Ju.

410
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,330
- You help him with his script.
- Me?

411
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,469
He says he can't focus if I help,
but it's better to have someone.

412
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:53,169
Go on.

413
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:57,240
Which part is it?

414
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,750
Here?

415
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:04,679
"I'm crazy worried about her already."

416
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,149
"Why must you do this to me too?"
This part?

417
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:09,590
"Because I love you."

418
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:12,659
"And you love me too."

419
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,490
"You just haven't realized it yet."

420
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,760
You're pretty good.

421
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:20,830
I used to act.

422
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,639
I had a promising career
when I was a teenager.

423
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:27,040
If I hadn't floundered then...

424
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,010
I wouldn't be here working for you.

425
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:32,810
Why did you flounder?

426
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,080
You're asking about
my painful past a bit too easily.

427
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,379
You brought it up.

428
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,189
Let's start over.

429
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,459
"Why must you do this to me too?"

430
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,689
"Because I love you."

431
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:50,129
"And you love me too."

432
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,129
"You just haven't realized it yet."

433
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,540
Then she kisses Sang Woo...

434
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,469
Let's say we kissed.

435
00:21:02,939 --> 00:21:04,379
"Now do you see how I feel?"

436
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,109
"You are mine now."

437
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,389
Shall we just do
what the instruction says?

438
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:15,320
You wanted help
with practicing your lines.

439
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:17,419
This is practice.

440
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,419
Let's do what it says.

441
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:20,530
No way.

442
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:24,859
Why do you refuse now
when we've done it before?

443
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,500
Shall we try going on a date?

444
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,899
- A date?
- Yes.

445
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:35,810
We got the order
a bit messed up, but still.

446
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,510
How much did we
learn about each other last time?

447
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,550
Didn't we learn quite a lot?

448
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,350
- It's time to...
- Where should we go for the date?

449
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,990
The place where everyone else goes?

450
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,060
Let's go.

451
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,790
(I Lost My Memory but I Want Revenge)

452
00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:00,000
It was worth sending
the beef gift set to the scriptwriter.

453
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:04,939
Thank you, beef gift set.

454
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,879
I'll use the kissing scene
to make Woo Sang fall for me.

455
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:17,179
"How to kiss well."

456
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,520
"With emotion and technique,"

457
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,859
"lean into them
with your head slightly tilted."

458
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,929
"Seductively and aggressively..."

459
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,459
"Aggressively?"

460
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,980
Here you go.

461
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,810
Hey.

462
00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:51,320
- Don't I look good?
- This should suit you better.

463
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:52,419
Here.

464
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:55,449
Put it on.

465
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:57,959
There.

466
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:04,699
Ready?

467
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,270
Wait. The next one.

468
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,109
Come on.

469
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:17,939
Here.

470
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,350
Do something.

471
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,760
We're so cute.

472
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,020
It came out pretty nice.

473
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,090
Only I look good, though.

474
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,830
- You can't be serious. I look way better.
- Look.

475
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:42,030
A bit more to that side.

476
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,570
You got it.

477
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,209
Oh, no.

478
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,280
Let's try again.

479
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:55,409
- I got it.
- You got it.

480
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,490
One more try.

481
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,990
Go for that one.

482
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:04,060
That one?

483
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,850
I'd always wanted to go on
a childish date like this.

484
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,080
I thought it would be perfect for you.

485
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,350
What's that? Is it a compliment?

486
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:38,260
It could be.

487
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,730
How was today for you?

488
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:43,760
Well...

489
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,129
It was fun.

490
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:46,669
And?

491
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:48,129
Well...

492
00:24:48,969 --> 00:24:50,139
It was nice.

493
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,570
What was nice?

494
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:54,369
The weather was nice.

495
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,280
The scenery is pretty and nice.

496
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:04,179
And also...

497
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,369
Why did it suddenly get so cold?

498
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,540
Where are you going? Wait for me.

499
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,379
Yes. As soon as
the result is out tomorrow,

500
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:37,179
I'll make them both pack.

501
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,020
Let's make sure we never see them again.

502
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,350
Yes.

503
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:43,490
Go to bed soon.

504
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,320
Okay. See you tomorrow.

505
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:46,419
Bye.

506
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,790
I came out to bring in the washing.

507
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,399
I see. I'm going to the convenience store.

508
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,730
It must've been a long day for you.

509
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:31,540
I apologize for what Nam Jin did.

510
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:33,469
I don't think it was his idea.

511
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,540
I think it was Sang Ah's.

512
00:26:36,939 --> 00:26:39,639
Whoever's idea it was, they're both crazy.

513
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:42,580
Still, I'm glad the kids are all right.

514
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:47,090
Now that they know
we live in the same house,

515
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:50,359
they might cause even more trouble for us.

516
00:26:50,389 --> 00:26:54,189
Don't react to every single thing
and don't get worked up.

517
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:55,990
Can you hold back?

518
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,159
You bet I can.

519
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,129
Why would you say I get worked up?

520
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:01,969
Come on.

521
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,070
I won't flinch,
no matter what they do or throw at me.

522
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,409
Don't worry.

523
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:09,709
Okay.

524
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,909
Go on, then.

525
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:13,209
- Okay.
- Bye.

526
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,649
It's so cold.

527
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,850
My gosh.

528
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:23,919
(Hansung Company)

529
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,399
Why must we come for the announcement
when only one team submitted a proposal?

530
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:34,000
I don't know.
Could they have some instructions?

531
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:40,969
Hey.

532
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,780
What are you two doing here?

533
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,550
We were told to attend the announcement.

534
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:54,990
Why? Is something wrong?

535
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,659
Did you two hand in your proposal?

536
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:09,629
You're all here. Come with me.

537
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,609
They wanted to see us all, so let's go.

538

(Hansung Company)

539
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,560
Then I will tell you which design...

540
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,330
we selected.

541
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,359
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

542
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,350
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

543
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:59,719
Give Mi Ju a call.

544
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,050
I'm at work, Mom.

545
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,619
Guess what the next scene is.

546
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:05,159
I'm shooting the kiss with Woo Sang.

547
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:07,859
Do you know our court date is tomorrow?

548
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:10,760
Of course I do. I want this to be over.

549
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:13,570
It's obvious
they're in the early stages of dating.

550
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,429
It's the perfect setting to fall in love.

551
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:18,869
