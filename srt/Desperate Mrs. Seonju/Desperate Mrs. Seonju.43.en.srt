1
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,990
It's her first day here,

2
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:14,430
so I told her to take her time
and come in time for the meeting.

3
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:17,330
Who is it?

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,899
Here she is.

5
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,279
Hello. The name is Pi Seon Ju.

6
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:39,189
But you know that.

7
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,919
Let's see how things go.

8
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,330
You hired her as your interior designer?

9
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:48,260
Have you lost your mind?

10
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:50,499
You don't seem to recognize talent.

11
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:52,770
"Talent?" Who's talented?

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,900
Whether you can't recognize it
or don't want to recognize it,

13
00:00:56,569 --> 00:00:58,669
you have no right to work with Ms. Pi.

14
00:00:58,669 --> 00:01:00,069
She's my assistant.

15
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,139
How dare you poach her?

16
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:04,440
You did all you could to get me fired.

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,849
You even locked me up.

18
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:07,650
Is there proof that I did?

19
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:10,550
Call the police.
There are no cameras down there.

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,290
First, it was assault.
Then, it was confinement.

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,019
I don't know what it'll be next,

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,859
but I won't let it slide then.

23
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:20,859
You won't learn anything
even if I let you off this time,

24
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,659
but this is my final show of courtesy
as your soon-to-be ex-husband.

25
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,769
So what? Two pairs of
soon-to-be exes should...

26
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:29,669
go against each other as competitors?

27
00:01:29,669 --> 00:01:32,469
You two teamed up. Why can't we?

28
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:34,639
I get that you're angry with us,

29
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:36,980
but work is not child's play.

30
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,740
What? Are you intimidated?

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,820
You want to work with Mr. Kim
as an interior designer...

32
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,719
against us?

33
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,559
Yes. I avoid things I fear,

34
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,760
but I take on things that are dirty.

35
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,059
I have a strong stomach.

36
00:01:58,029 --> 00:01:59,230
Can't you...

37
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,870
change the way you talk?

38
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,040
You're seeing someone classy.

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,600
Talk all you want with her.

40
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:07,769
But remember this.

41
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,409
You can serve her
and grovel at her feet all you want,

42
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,150
but you'll amount to nothing more
than her minion.

43
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,450
Minion...

44
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:20,119
You did cheap labor for a tiny company...

45
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:23,119
and got used to talking like that
with the guys.

46
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,959
Do you even think
you can handle a project like this?

47
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,260
Why don't you change the way
you speak too, Mr. Jeon?

48
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,200
Ms. Pi is no longer Ms. Jin's assistant.

49
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,769
She's on my team.

50
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,470
Treat her as you would Ms. Jin.

51
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:42,510
Kim So Woo. You're crazy too.

52
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,410
Yes. Let's say I am.

53
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,010
We gathered for a meeting.

54
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,519
Hansung's demands
and the details they sent over...

55
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,480
No. We don't need your help.

56
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:53,750
I'll ask them
to send the details to me in person.

57
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:55,519
There's nothing more to discuss.

58
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,820
Let's hand in our separate proposals.

59
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,919
We're done here.

60
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,630
We're done.

61
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,100
Darn it.

62
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,700
They're both insane.

63
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,769
What are they even thinking?

64
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:16,380
Let's say it's for the better.

65
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,339
They'll be easier to take down.

66
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,480
Yes. Rather than forcing her to quit,

67
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,549
it would look better
if we beat them on a project.

68
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:28,850
- Right.
- Once we beat them,

69
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:31,260
they'll have no excuse to stay on.

70
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:33,630
They'd be too ashamed to stay.

71
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:36,859
And my dad will see us in a new light.

72
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:38,730
That's not bad at all.

73
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,329
Let's have lunch. What do you want?

74
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:42,700
- Whatever you want.
- Okay.

75
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:45,299
Ms. Pi.

76
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,040
You'll work with me in my office
until this project is over.

77
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,139
I talked that out with HR already.

78
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,679
Bring your stuff over.

79
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,179
Okay.

80
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:08,790
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

81
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:36,219
Put it flush against that wall.

82
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,760
Thank you.

83
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,930
What's that?

84
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,269
They're setting up your desk.

85
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,570
What's that?

86
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,139
I brought my desk and chair set.

87
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,310
That's your desk from now on.

88
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:55,440
Good job.

89
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,479
- Thanks.
- Sure.

90
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,149
I made sure it was a similar size to mine.
You don't like it?

91
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:08,250
I do love it.

92
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,190
Isn't it a bit over the top, though?

93
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:15,760
It's not over the top for my designer.

94
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,899
You need to pull your weight.

95
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:22,300
I also requested a laptop and supplies.
You'll get them soon.

96
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:25,570
Shall we wipe the desk?

97
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,310
No. I'll do that.

98
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,209
Then... Shall I order us some food?

99
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,149
Lunch is on me today. What do you like?

100
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,360
(Jin Architecture)

101
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,940
Stop doing that and come over.

102
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,570
Okay.

103
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,849
That might spill. Be careful.

104
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:09,779
Here.

105
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:11,019
Let me.

106
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,450
Here you go.

107
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,820
Eat up.

108
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,490
We're up against Ms. Jin and Mr. Jeon,

109
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,800
and it won't be easy.

110
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,329
Nothing is easy.

111
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:27,329
Nothing in the world is for free.

112
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,500
Some things are.

113
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,539
If they're given to you for free.

114
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,670
What?

115
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,240
Was that funny? It made you laugh?

116
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:42,010
My gosh.

117
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,450
Don't you dare
crack those jokes anywhere else.

118
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:48,289
You seem to find them funny.

119
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,620
Let's crack dad jokes
that no one else finds funny...

120
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,360
and have fun at work.

121
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:57,760
We ended up sharing an office
and working together.

122
00:06:58,229 --> 00:06:59,670
That's special.

123
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,229
It is. It's not ordinary.

124
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,599
We met lamenting about
our cheating spouses...

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,269
and ended up as homeowner and tenant.

126
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:10,539
Yes.

127
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:13,110
As soon as I found work,
I realized you were my superior...

128
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,310
and my husband's mistress' husband.

129
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,380
My gosh. What kind of coincidence is that?

130
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,550
Goodness.

131
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,089
Hearing it put into one sentence...

132
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:24,420
makes me almost blush.

133
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,159
- Let's dig in.
- Okay.

134
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:30,060
I hope you like the food.

135
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,269
Here.

136
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,880
Do you know...

137
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,709
how ugly you're being?

138
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,050
I was embarrassed to think
what Ms. Jin would think.

139
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,979
Are you looking into a mirror again?

140
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,920
Mr. Kim lost all sense of reason
because he's furious with Ms. Jin.

141
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,060
How long will you be his puppet?

142
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,789
Do you think...

143
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,529
you should be eating sushi with him?

144
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,060
Think about it.

145
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,729
Whether I become a puppet
or something else, let's wait and see.

146
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:11,500
I'm really curious.

147
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,610
Do you think you're cut out to work here?

148
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,940
My gosh.

149
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:21,810
The more I see, the more I realize
you're a perfect match for Sang Ah.

150
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:24,420
You wondered if I was
cut out to work here,

151
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,690
and Sang Ah gave me
a desk-chair I couldn't even sit in...

152
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,360
when it was flush to a wall on the left.

153
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,589
It's as if
you're Siamese twins of the soul.

154
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,829
Do you even know...

155
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:40,399
the whole company is talking about us?

156
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,400
So what? Let them talk.

157
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,040
You asked me to acknowledge
your relationship with Sang Ah.

158
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,739
You have my full support.

159
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,440
Stay together for the rest of eternity.

160
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,650
You said you'd cheer me on as well.

161
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:56,920
This is my present and future,
so cheer me on.

162
00:08:58,749 --> 00:08:59,920
You clean this up.

163
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,989
Darn it.

164
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,890
My gosh.

165
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,430
She's unbelievable.

166
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:12,969
Oh, my gosh.

167
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:17,369
Get a refund and go to another salon.

168
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:19,200
Do you choose who to serve?

169
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,609
I won't accept the refund.

170
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,810
Then...

171
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:24,310
Get out!

172
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,280
Oh, my gosh.

173
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:30,550
Oh, dear.

174
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,349
I don't want to see you again!

175
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,820
I'm sick of everyone who has...

176
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:37,719
- anything to do with that darn family!
- My gosh.

177
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:40,560
- Get out!
- Okay, fine.

178
00:09:45,229 --> 00:09:46,229
Goodness.

179
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,599
She's insane.

180
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,270
She's as bad as Seon Ju's mom.

181
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,369
She might even be worse.

182
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,479
What on earth is Seon Ju doing there
that that woman...

183
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:10,359
Darn it.

184
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:13,690
(Ex-mother-in-law)

185
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,060
Why is your mother calling me?

186
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,129
Will you stop her?

187
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:21,829
- Darn.
- Wait.

188
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,400
Move. Why do you keep appearing
wherever I am and getting in my way?

189
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,509
What...

190
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,950
There's a TV show for divorced couples...

191
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:37,180
that makes them live together
to reconcile.

192
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,820
I watched a few episodes of that
and felt so jealous.

193
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,430
"Some people actually reconcile
by spending time together."

194
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,089
"I bet..."

195
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:52,129
"that was only possible because
they were willing to make it work."

196
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,030
You know,

197
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,440
I honestly don't want that with you.

198
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:01,709
I have this little intention
of making things work with you.

199
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,609
I don't want us to reconcile at all,

200
00:11:04,609 --> 00:11:06,879
so if you ever dream of wanting that,

201
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:09,109
regret it for the rest of your life.

202
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:15,249
- Hello.
- Hi.

203
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,060
My gosh. Hey, is that water?

204
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,489
It's...

205
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:21,359
Are you all right?

206
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:23,800
It was hot water.

207
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,430
I burned my tongue.

208
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:38,810
My gosh.

209
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:48,890
What's all this?

210
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,190
Hansung's product catalogs...

211
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:53,660
and examples of some overseas
lighting companies' showrooms.

212
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:56,160
That's reference material for you.
Go through it all.

213
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:58,200
All this? Okay.

214
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:00,829
As I said before,

215
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,900
we want Hansung's new HQ
to show off its lights.

216
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,940
The design features will be important,

217
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,040
and that's why I need a designer on board.

218
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:10,239
- Right.
- Filling in...

219
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:12,739
the details I could miss out on
in the planning phase.

220
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,009
That's your job.

221
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,180
Yes, sir.

222
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:21,550
I'm off to get a cup of coffee.
Would you like one?

223
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:23,619
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

224
00:12:34,729 --> 00:12:36,030
Hi, Mom.

225
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,369
Seon Ju. I got you a blind date.

226
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:41,070
What? Mom, I'm busy.

227
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,839
Wait. At least hear what he's like.

228
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:46,879
He is Kyung Ae's mom's nephew,
and he's a bachelor.

229
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,020
Forget it. Why would a bachelor date me?

230
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,550
He's on the old side.

231
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,450
He was told your divorce was pending,

232
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,959
and that it would be official
in a few days,

233
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,160
and he agreed to meet you.

234
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:00,359
Is he in his right mind?

235
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:01,459
Yes.

236
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,400
He's a police officer.

237
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:05,729
Isn't that a great job?

238
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:07,400
It's not that great a job.

239
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,239
If we had an officer in the family,

240
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:12,770
no one would dare harm us.

241
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:15,109
A police officer
who puts away criminals...

242
00:13:15,109 --> 00:13:17,780
is way better than sly and sleazy Nam Jin.

243
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,310
- Mom.
- You need to find...

244
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,009
someone nice to get back at him.

245
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:23,619
As soon as the divorce is final,

246
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,920
you get remarried first.

247
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,349
Mom. If you like him that much,

248
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,390
you can meet him instead, okay?

249
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,959
I'm actually busy.

250
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,530
The darn thing.

251
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,999
What? Did she say no?

252
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,729
She told me to meet him instead.

253
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,999
What? What should we do now?

254
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:44,739
I told the guy about the date already.

255
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:47,369
We can't force her
if she's not interested.

256
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:48,739
It's over.

257
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,009
Oh, no.

258
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,349
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

259
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:58,249
Hey. Did you finish the cleaning already?

260
00:13:58,349 --> 00:14:01,249
Yes. I made eggy bread for breakfast too.

261
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,119
You're pretty useful to have around.

262
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,759
- Hello.
- Hi.

263
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:09,859
Oh, no. Mr. Jang.

264
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,629
What happened?

265
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,200
I slipped in the shower this morning...

266
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:16,540
and held out my arm to break my fall.

267
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,339
I broke my wrist.

268
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,869
- Oh, no.
- Did you tell Woo Sang?

269
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:22,040
Does he know?

270
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,180
Yes.

271
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,839
I have a packed schedule
and he can't drive.

272
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,150
Should I drive you around?

273
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:29,950
Shall we hire someone for a few days?

274
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:31,780
As a driver?

275
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,489
You can drive, can't you?

276
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,089
- I can.
- Tag along.

277
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,930
You can stay on top of the chores
when you're free, right?

278
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,190
What? Oh, sure.

279
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,599
Good, then.

280
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,930
Seon Ju said no?

281
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,800
What should we do? Kyung Ae's mom
is freaking out about the guy being told.

282
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,440
I wish she'd just meet the guy once.

283
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:59,680
A police officer is a civil servant.
Isn't that a reassuring job to have?

284
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,310
He'll never get fired.

285
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:04,320
Why is Seon Ju like that?

286
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,450
She's unusually similar to our homeowner.
They're both so stuck up.

287
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,690
And she thinks she can do art?

288
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,759
What should we do, Jin Ju?

289
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,430
Let's change strategies.

290
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:19,160
Drop her in front of the guy.

291
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,999
It'll be too late to run away then.

292
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:22,599
She could run away.

293
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:25,570
We must drag her to a Chinese restaurant
if we're to set them up.

294
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,910
I told her about the blind date,

295
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,879
so she won't come along
if she thinks it's a set-up.

296
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,410
- Let's do this, then.
- Do what?

297
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,290
You're really strong.
How can you carry that?

298
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,359
I have some strong muscles.

299
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:54,400
Woo Sang.

300
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:11,650
You...

301
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:15,219
What's she doing here? Why is she here?

302
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:17,959
She started
working for my family yesterday.

303
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,629
What? She works for your family?

304
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,660
You mean she lives with you?

305
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,459
Yes. She's here as my manager today.

306
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,129
Your manager? What about Mr. Jang?

307
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:35,839
Hello. I'll see you every now and then.

308
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,579
Are you a zombie?

309
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,249
Am I?

310
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,680
I'll see you around.

311
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,719
Let's go.

312
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:56,030
I got rid of her at last,
and she moved into his house?

313
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,599
They live together?

314
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,999
Woo Sang!

315
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,509
Are the ratings out? What's the number?

316
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:14,479
We're done for.

317
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:16,380
He'll want to see me again.

318
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:21,519
If the chief calls, say I'm out.

319
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:23,249
Wait. Director.

320
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:30,499
Doesn't he look a bit like a bandit?

321
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:32,830
He's not Seon Ju's type.

322
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,529
- Is she going on a blind date?
- My gosh.

323
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:36,370
- You scared me.
- When did you get home?

324
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,739
I think my ex-uncle
was a bit more handsome.

325
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:44,309
- Right?
- No.

326
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:46,309
Men like this are much more sincere.

327
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,779
I like him, and I like what he does too.

328
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
- Go on inside.
- Hello.

329
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,789
- Welcome home.
- Hello.

330
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:58,860
- Can I have a word?
- What?

331
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,630
- Tae Ri. Play for a while.
- Okay.

332
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,759
Let's go.

333
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,700
What shall we play?

334
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,969
My gosh.

335
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,569
It must be hard
trying to stagger your schedules.

336
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,709
It's not like that.

337
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,380
You look good today. Let's take a walk.

338
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:23,209
A walk? Okay. I'll get changed.

339
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:25,420
No, don't change. Let's go as is.

340
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:27,420
I'm tired.

341
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,660
I'm home.

342
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:33,090
Hello.

343
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:36,430
How are things going at work?

344
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,130
Mr. Kim and I...

345
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,630
will have a blind competition
to win the Hansung contract.

346
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,200
I see.

347
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,940
The Hansung people agreed to it.

348
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,410
I'd like you to respect the outcome,
whatever it may be.

349
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,709
If Hansung agreed to it,
I wouldn't object.

350
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:57,019
Leave Mr. Jeon alone
while we work on the project.

351
00:18:57,249 --> 00:19:00,249
If I win the deal,
let me put together my own team.

352
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:03,120
And let me decide what to do with Mr. Kim.

353
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:10,930
He's too prideful to stay on
after losing that kind of deal anyway.

354
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:19,700
(Han Hair Line)

355
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,140
Why are you suddenly washing my hair?

356
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,979
Wait. Would you mind...

357
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:28,249
getting rid of this towel?

358
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:31,950
I don't want to get your face wet.

359
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,549
Our rent is so cheap.

360
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,019
I should offer you
a free service at least.

361
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:37,519
- Okay, then.
- Okay?

362
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:09,120
If we were going to come here,

363
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,690
you should've let me
change shoes at least.

364
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,789
It's fine. We're almost there.

365
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,830
My feet hurt so much.

366
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,370
Hold onto me.

367
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:25,400
- Watch your step.
- Where are we headed?

368
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,809
We're almost there.

369
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,479
Will you wait here for just a moment?

370
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,509
- I need to go and pee.
- What?

371
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,209
You're off to pee?

372
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,279
You should've gone earlier.

373
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,450
You're so weird.

374
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,450
- I'm exhausted.
- Ms. Pi Seon Ju.

375
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:45,559
- Ms. Pi Seon Ju?
- What?

376
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,330
I'm over here.

377
00:20:57,499 --> 00:20:58,569
Who are you?

378
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,380
Ms. Pi.

379
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,150
How do you know me?

380
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,160
You look just like you did in the photo.

381
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:19,890
Oh, let me introduce myself.

382
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:22,459
Nice to meet you. I'm Ryu Seung Ryong.

383
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Who?

384
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,870
Where did my sister go?

385
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,229
Good luck.

386
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,670
What?

387
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,840
Jin Ju.

388
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,610
Jin Ju. Where are you going?

389
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:43,350
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Right...

390
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,519
It's so nice here.

391
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,390
Excuse me? Is anyone there?

392
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,860
Hello.

393
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,529
What the...

394
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,059
Okay. Hello.

395
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,330
Hi.

396
00:22:01,769 --> 00:22:02,799
Who are you?

397
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:04,969
Okay.

398
00:22:05,569 --> 00:22:08,870
This is my daughter Kyung Ae.

399
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,080
Mom. It's Yu Ra.

400
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,279
Yes, right.

401
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:16,249
She changed her name recently.

402
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:19,549
Hello. I'm Lee Yu Ra.

403
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,190
Right. Hello.

404
00:22:22,489 --> 00:22:24,860
- I'm...
- I heard a lot about you.

405
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,360
I saw you pass by a few times too.

406
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:30,360
Did you not see me?

407
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,999
No, I didn't.

408
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:34,269
Oh, I see.

409
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:38,469
We'll leave you two, then.

410
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,069
- No. They just met and are curious.
- Why not?

411
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,940
It'll be so awkward too.

412
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,209
If there's anything
you can't ask yourself,

413
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:49,549
talk to me and I'll ask for you.

414
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,979
Okay, well...

415
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,850
How much does he make a year
and where does he work?

416
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,360
Is this the only house he owns,

417
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,330
and are his parents living?
That should do for now.

418
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:05,059
How much do you make a year?

419
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,529
Can you not do this?

420
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:11,799
Let them talk among themselves.

421
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,269
Let's go elsewhere.

422
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:15,640
- Should we?
- Yes.

423
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,610
I want to listen in.

424
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,979
Why would you do that? My goodness.

425
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,950
- I...
- Bye. Have fun.

426
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,110
What?

427
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,219
Some people go mad with Photoshop
and I can't recognize them at all.

428
00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:33,559
You're even more beautiful
than your photo,

429
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:36,059
and for that, I give you two extra points.

430
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:37,930
Two points?

431
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,700
You're just my type.

432
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,999
How do you like this place?

433
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
I'm not a fan of formalities,

434
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,739
so I tried to find a place...

435
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:51,640
where I could be myself and act naturally.

436
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:53,039
This is that place.

437
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,950
It's too typical
to meet over tea or coffee.

438
00:23:58,049 --> 00:24:01,090
Do you train your qi in your free time?

439
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,019
- No.
- That's a shame.

440
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:08,590
Do you drink alcohol?

441
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:10,660
Well, a bit, I guess?

442
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,400
Nice.

443
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:15,529
Alcohol tastes best outdoors.

444
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,370
Did you bring all this?

445
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:23,910
Yes. While I was at it,
I made some pajeon too.

446
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,239
I'm a pretty good cook.

447
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:29,650
We're not allowed to cook up here,

448
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,219
but it's okay to eat whatever you bring.

449
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,489
Have a drink. Here.

450
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:37,090
I'm in such a good mood.

451
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,860
I love makgeolli.

452
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,830
Let's toast... Wait.

453
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
There's a dead leaf.

454
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,499
It's not working.

455
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,769
Now it's perfect.

456
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,910
Let's drink.

457
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,209
Cheers!

458
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
Are you done?

459
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,249
Then follow me.

460
00:25:09,989 --> 00:25:11,059
Here we go.

461
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,989
This feels great.

462
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,729
You should do it too.

463
00:25:19,229 --> 00:25:20,799
Give it a go, Ms. Pi.

464
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,370
Oh. You don't want to?

465
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:27,069
That feels so good.

466
00:25:29,469 --> 00:25:30,940
You heard what I do, right?

467
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,180
I'm a police officer,

468
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,880
and it's a tough job.

469
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,150
Compared to the effort, I don't make much.

470
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,650
So I run a fried chicken place too.

471
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,559
Civil servants can't work on the side,
so it's in my mom's name.

472
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,959
You work pretty hard.

473
00:25:48,229 --> 00:25:50,700
I'm not that much of a hard worker,

474
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,029
but my second job took off.

475
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,569
Now I make more selling chicken
than I do catching criminals.

476
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,670
It's not bad.

477
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:04,239
Anyway, so next year,
I plan to buy the building my store is in.

478
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,350
How's that?
Do you think that's a good deal?

479
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,120
I guess?

480
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,920
You're younger than me.
Can I speak freely?

481
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:19,989
Yes?

482
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:22,229
Yes. Sure.

483
00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:24,499
Don't say that. Speak casually.

484
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,499
Seon Ju.

485
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,539
Oh, I love this.

486
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,910
Come on!

487
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:36,840
Oh, lovely.

488
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:40,309
- What's that?
- Let's see.

489
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:47,719
So, I heard your divorce wasn't yet final.

490
00:26:49,249 --> 00:26:50,289
Watch out!

491
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,930
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

492
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,469
So...

493
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,670
Well...

494
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,539
I have a house in my name,

495
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:11,340
and I have some land
in the countryside too.

496
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,549
My grandfather gave it...

497
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,350
directly to me
to avoid paying taxes on it.

498
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,120
Can we call this "property flirting?"

499
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:25,019
- So, Ms. Yu Ra.
- Also,

500
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:28,390
I'm a plastic surgery consultant.

501
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:31,729
I get commissions and incentives,

502
00:27:31,729 --> 00:27:35,969
so you can say my pay is
the highest in my field.

503
00:27:36,729 --> 00:27:41,209
I don't know how much an architect makes,

504
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:45,580
but you can move in with me
and take over the housework.

505
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,019
I heard you recently got divorced.

506
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:53,719
- No. It's not yet...
- Well,

507
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,660
when bad things happen,
good things happen too.

508
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,219
When you lose something in life,

509
00:28:00,219 --> 00:28:02,330
you can fill it with something else.

510
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,259
Your skin is sagging right there.

511
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:05,900
- I'd love to fill it in.
- What?

512
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,229
No, it's nothing.

513
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:12,039
- You look just fine.
- Okay.

514
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:17,539
I have made up my mind.

515
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,739
To do what?

516
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:23,680
I'll be a mother to your son.

517
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,319
What?

518
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:30,319
My gosh.

519
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:44,769
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

520
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,819
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

521
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,519
You wrote a letter to your mom?

522
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,860
She said she'd get our house back,

523
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,229
so were not to read it too soon.

524
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:09,959
What if they end up
discussing the accident...

525
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,999
while they're living together?

526
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:13,459
She did cause the accident.

527
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,130
Why can't they talk about it?

528
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,900
The new hire.

529
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,069
Tell her to come see me.

530
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,569
The CEO wants to see me?

531
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,209
What for?

532
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,840
