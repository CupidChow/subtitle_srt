00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:12,360
(Episode 16)

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,990
What's the rush?

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,760
Is this how you like it?

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,430
What are you doing?

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,500
Keep still.

6
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,050
Wait.

7
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:34,680
Keep still.

8
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:47,760
Did you hear that?

9
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,260
Is someone here?

10
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:50,599
That's impossible.

11
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,529
Something must've fallen.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,270
You should go.

13
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:03,379
Is your wife here? In the bathroom?

14
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:05,809
I think so. Get out of here.

15
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:06,910
Why should I go?

16
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,550
Let's not blow this out of proportion.

17
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,620
I'll call you.

18
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:11,679
You said you'd leave her.
What are you afraid of?

19
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:14,189
Becoming the guilty party won't help.

20
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:15,960
I'll pay your alimony.

21
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:17,990
I can hire you the best lawyers too.

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,409
Why should I hide?

23
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:37,510
Those freaks.

24
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,609
I refuse to be treated like this.

25
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,779
Fine. Let's see your ugly mug.

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,850
How could you? Hey.

27
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,519
Hey! Stop right there!

28
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:53,090
- Get back in here.
- Go.

29
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,969
- Move.
- No, don't.

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,639
- Hey!
- Oh, no.

31
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:06,139
Darn you.

32
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,939
Stop right there!

33
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:09,609
I'll kill you.

34
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,779
Wait there.

35
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,150
Hey, you!

36
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,809
Wait, Seon Ju.

37
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:16,219
Come back inside.

38
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:18,649
- Let go of me!
- No, wait!

39
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:20,450
- Don't touch me.
- Okay.

40
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,889
- Let's talk.
- Don't touch me.

41
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,899
Hands off. Don't touch me.

42
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:38,669
You can't go outside wearing that.

43
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,709
Cover yourself up.

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
Why? Are you embarrassed?

45
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,780
Are you proud of what you did
but embarrassed of me?

46
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:50,179
You jerk. You're not even human!

47
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,720
How could you do this to me?

48
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:55,220
You're mistaken!

49
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:58,019
Hear me out before you freak out!

50
00:02:58,690 --> 00:02:59,760
I'm mistaken?

51
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,260
How am I mistaken when I heard everything?

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
What did you hear?

53
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:10,500
I should've caught on
when you moved in here.

54
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:13,510
I should've noticed something was up...

55
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,040
when Jin Ju told me she saw you
in a car with some woman.

56
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,179
I smelled a woman's perfume,
and my nose was right.

57
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,480
You denied it, making me look like a fool.

58
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:29,690
Did you smash your phone
to stop me from going through it?

59
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,320
I hurt my back during dinner,

60
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,859
so she came to help me
put on pain relief patches.

61
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,200
Where are the patches?

62
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,230
Show me.

63
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:59,149
(Jeil Hotel)

64
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:01,049
Show me the pain relief patches!

65
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:03,519
She took them with her!

66
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,760
They weren't mine!

67
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,329
Goodness...

68
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,440
Do you expect me to believe that?

69
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,209
Do you think I'm stupid?

70
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,979
Okay.

71
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,909
If you had dinner together,
it must be someone from work.

72
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,479
Good for you.

73
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:33,019
You shacked up with a side chick
as soon as you found a job?

74
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,959
Don't use such vulgar language,

75
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,659
and don't jump to conclusions!

76
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:39,019
She's just a colleague!

77
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:41,659
She's just a colleague,
and she mentioned alimony and lawyers?

78
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,860
She was talking about
someone she knew unrelated to me.

79
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,269
How will you explain
the cosmetics in the bathroom?

80
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,029
And the toothbrush and sanitary pads?

81
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:50,039
I told you this dorm wasn't just for me!

82
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,740
We meet up here
at all hours of the night to work,

83
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,510
and people leave their stuff behind.

84
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,149
Do you expect me to believe that?

85
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:01,510
I don't care if you don't.

86
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:03,849
I did nothing wrong.

87
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,690
Fine. If you think you did nothing wrong,

88
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,159
call and tell her to come right back.

89
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,990
We can let her explain whether she came...

90
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,260
to help you put on
or take off pain relief patches.

91
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:19,200
- What right do you have?
- Me?

92
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,700
I'm your wife. We're married.

93
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,839
Right.

94
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:25,969
Fine. Let's say you asked her.

95
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,510
Will you let it go
if she denies we cheated?

96
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,479
You'll drag it on
and do anything to make us look bad!

97
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,579
Who are you trying so hard to defend?

98
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,550
So this was why you didn't tell me
where you worked.

99
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,849
This was premeditated.

100
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:42,990
If you know who it is,
will you humiliate her in public?

101
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,589
What would you get out of it?

102
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,300
At least I'll know
whether you're telling the truth or not.

103
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:57,039
Did the client meeting go well?

104
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,909
Yes.

105
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:02,610
Do you have...

106
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,979
anything to say to me?

107
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:07,450
You wanted to talk to me.

108
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,950
The client lives here.

109
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,219
- That was why I was here.
- The client who lives here.

110
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,060
Is it Jeon Nam Jin?

111
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,430
Follow me.

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You yelled about what my mom had said...

113
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:30,570
and talked about wine.

114
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:34,709
All that crappy nonsense
about how hard studying abroad was...

115
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:37,110
It was just an excuse...

116
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,139
to cover up your affair.

117
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,349
Who is it?

118
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:50,459
When did you meet?

119
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,430
How long has it been going on?

120
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,659
Don't say anything
about her being a colleague...

121
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:59,000
who came with pain relief patches.

122
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:02,469
This is what...

123
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,539
I can't stand about you.

124
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:09,170
Let's...

125
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:11,579
get divorced.

126
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,079
How could you say that?

127
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:20,219
I told you to think about us. Did you?

128
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,620
My conclusion...

129
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,329
is that we should split up.

130
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,690
You really...

131
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:32,769
Forget about me.

132
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,229
Don't you care about Ji Hyun?

133
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:37,769
Do you know what she said?

134
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,010
She was jealous of a kid
whose dad was jobless.

135
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,839
We met them in a second-hand bookstore
where they bought lots of books.

136
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,380
She said that dad played with his kid...

137
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,610
and said she wished you were jobless too.

138
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,079
She said...

139
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,420
other kids ate out
and played with their families.

140
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:01,060
How bad do you think
she must've felt to actually say that?

141
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,099
Let's go home.

142
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:16,409
We both know what this place means,
so pack your things.

143
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,649
Pack your things right now.

144
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,420
- It's late.
- It's not late!

145
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,149
The three of us
will at least walk around a park.

146
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,719
We never did anything like that
as a family.

147
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:32,719
Do the bare minimum
before asking for a divorce.

148
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,159
If you want to split up, split up at home.

149
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:37,060
Can't you even do that?

150
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,870
Fine.

151
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,040
I'll see you outside the kindergarten
when Ji Hyun gets out.

152
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,739
You'd better be there.

153
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,969
Or I'll turn this place upside down.

154
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,410
Say something.

155
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,180
Give an excuse at least.

156
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,489
Right.

157
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,320
The dashboard camera.

158
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,520
Then you must know...

159
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,690
who I came here with
and what we meant to do.

160
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:44,660
- Do you want me to say it?
- Aren't you ashamed at all?

161
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:47,729
I'm your husband!

162
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:48,900
I know that!

163
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:51,239
That's why I'm letting you talk.

164
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:53,810
Say everything you want to say.

165
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,410
Fine.

166
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,180
I'll say everything I want to say.

167
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,579
We might as well
keep Jeon Nam Jin in the loop.

168
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,579
You can't.

169
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:10,759
His wife is here too.

170
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,489
It'll snowball if we all meet up.

171
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:16,700
Do you...

172
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,300
even feel bad?

173
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,070
Did you want to send Tae Ri away
to school so you could do this?

174
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,739
He didn't want to go, but you told
his teacher and got him upset!

175
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:28,609
Tae Ri, it's always Tae Ri!

176
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,339
You made me feel lonely.
Don't you feel bad about that?

177
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,050
You're making that face again.

178
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:40,150
I can't stand it!

179
00:11:41,349 --> 00:11:42,349
Oh, dear.

180
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:37,430
That look.

181
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,770
"Why don't you get my profound wisdom?"

182
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,239
You act like you're so sweet and noble.

183
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:45,540
But you have zero ambition.

184
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,509
Were you...

185
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
that resentful?

186
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,209
I might as well be brutally honest.

187
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,709
You frustrated me to no end.

188
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:58,150
I couldn't stand your lame jokes.

189
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,550
I think I went abroad to study
to get away from you.

190
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,820
Did you even love me?

191
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,259
I always felt like
we were a puddle of water.

192
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:12,829
We never burned with passion.

193
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,030
Then what?

194
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:18,900
Are you burning up with Mr. Jeon?

195
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,410
Mr. Jeon...

196
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,009
keeps me on my toes.

197
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:30,879
Why did you marry me?

198
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,450
My dad liked you.

199
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:36,050
I thought it would be nice
to marry a guy Dad liked.

200
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,259
But it's no fun at all.

201
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,489
So...

202
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,060
just for fun,
you gave your affair partner a job?

203
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:46,629
How long...

204
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,570
were you going to keep it up?

205
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,369
If you don't like looking like a fool,

206
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,410
now that you know,
will you divorce me or something?

207
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:01,009
If you won't, don't tire me out even more.

213
00:16:57,859 --> 00:16:58,859
Did she leave?

214
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,969
- Yes.
- What did she say?

215
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,829
Does she want me to kneel and beg?

216
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,999
She doesn't know it's you.

217
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,499
I just demanded a divorce.

218
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,070
What did she say? Did she agree to it?

219
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:10,009
Not exactly.

220
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:12,410
But we will divorce eventually.

221
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,850
My husband knows about us too.

222
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:18,049
What? What happened?

223
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:20,289
I told him we were never a good match.

224
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:23,249
Let's talk tomorrow.

225
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,620
Was it him?

226
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,130
What are you going to do?

227
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,029
Did you send the papers to the car owner?

228
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,299
That?

229
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:35,100
I sent them to Mi Ju's address.
They'll hand it around.

230
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:37,799
I noticed you fixed
a few other things on your car.

231
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,340
I don't like Mi Ju either,
but you must really hate Choon Hyang...

232
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:45,779
Is the woman...

233
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,479
whose husband
you wanted to steal that Choon Hyang?

234
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,719
Darn it.

235
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:53,450
I'm right, aren't I?

236
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,390
What will you do once you steal the guy?

237
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,959
I don't mind if their family breaks up,
but what if yours does too?

238
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,529
Will you keep quiet?

239
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,229
No way.

240
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:08,299

244
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:18,140
Why was your phone turned off?

245
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,279
Ji Hyun wanted to come home.

246
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:23,779

249
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,719
That's some crazy look.

250
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,319
Where did you get the idea from?

251
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,930
You do have an artistic sense
when it comes to fashion.

252
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:34,989
Darn you.

253
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:36,529
Get out of my way.

254
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,799
I played with you for hours
with all my heart,

255
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:47,739
and you betrayed me as soon as
your mom came back? Can I leave?

256
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,340
Yes, it's late. You should go.

257
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,340

258
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,479

Yes.

263
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:11,700

Yes. Us three.

270
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,009

271

00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,819
Ms. Pi.

367
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,749
You came to work.

368
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,259
Yes. What are you all doing here?

369
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:27,289
Where's your boss?

370
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:28,989
He's not here yet.

371
00:27:28,989 --> 00:27:32,130
More like he doesn't want to come in.

372
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,969
He took everything and left.

373
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:35,100
That's nonsense.

374
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:37,299
He must've passed out drunk somewhere.

375
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:40,739
How did you manage to work
when you lacked common sense?

376
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:42,969
Couldn't you tell
when you saw the place was a mess?

377
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:45,640
He ran away last night. He vanished.

378
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,640
He what?

379
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,549
What the...

380
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,680
That can't be.

381
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,749
You're defending him. Are you in on it?

382
00:27:54,749 --> 00:27:56,390
No way.

383
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,590
Hello.

384
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,219
- Who are you?
- What's going on?

385
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,890
- Stick them on this and that.
- Okay.

386
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
(Seized)

387
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:08,870
What are you doing?

388
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,670
He dishonored a promissory note
and went bankrupt.

389
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,200
If they seize everything
to cover the debt,

390
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,239
we won't get a single cent back.

391
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,940
Where's your boss?

392
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:20,410
Get him back here.

393
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:22,209
- Bring him right back!
- Goodness.

396
00:28:42,969 --> 00:28:44,769
"Indian Ocean Law Firm?"

397
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,269
The whole family is crazy.

398
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,940
I'm here to see the owner.

399
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,009
It's time to choose.
Is it me or your family?

400
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:51,739
Can't you be more understanding?

401
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:54,279
You said you'd make the family wail.
How is that going?

402
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,180
Do you have a grudge against me?

403
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,549
Be quiet!

404
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,350
Don't you think this is too much?

405
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,580
You're going too far.
