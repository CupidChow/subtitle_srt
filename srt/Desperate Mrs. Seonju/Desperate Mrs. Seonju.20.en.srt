1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,740
- Oh, my gosh.
- Are you okay, Dad?

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,510
Yes, I'm fine. Don't worry.

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,950
(Episode 20)

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,979
My bad.

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,510
Are you all right?

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,819
Yes, I'm okay.

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,690
We came to register...

8
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,319
Hey.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,530
You work out here.

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,460
We came to register as well.

11
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:35,769
The gym owner said if someone was here,

12
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,699
they'd help us register as members.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,140
Yes. The fee is 100 dollars.
You can pay by card too.

14
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:42,570
Okay. I have a credit card.

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,610
Here.

16
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:46,879
By the way,

17
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:49,150
both my son and I want to register.

18
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:52,320
Then the two of you can pay 150 dollars.

19
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:53,979
Okay.

20
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:57,089
There's no blood, right?

21
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:07,629
Thank you.

22
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,599
You're like the boss here,
giving us a discount.

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,440
What happens now?

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,470
- What do you mean?
- The gym owner said...

25
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,909
he set up a system
that works well without him.

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,310
That the person who helped us register
would explain everything.

27
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:25,780
Seriously, that guy...

28
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,679
He said you trained here for free
for doing all that for him.

29
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,220
Did he tell you that?

30
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:31,890
He said some other stuff too.

31
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,019
That you spar with people who need help...

32
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:38,060
and clean the place
and maintain the facilities.

33
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,700
My goodness.

34
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,830
- Is this place...
- Okay, fine.

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,330
I got it.

36
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:47,269
First, take these.

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,440
- Jump ropes for a while.
- Okay.

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,239
That should be a light warm-up.

39
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,909
And then you can put these on.

40
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,980
- Okay.
- Do you see that? For about 30 minutes,

41
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,610
punch that lightly.

42
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,649
Okay.

43
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,519
- You can leave the door unlocked.
- Okay.

44
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,750
- Thank you.
- Sure.

45
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:06,159
Tae Ri.

46
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,590
Shall we put these on?

47
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,230
Let's see.

48
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,060
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,500
I'll loosen it up for you.

50
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:16,969
Now the other one.

51
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,269
How does this feel?

52
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:21,100
His dad...

53
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:23,709
seems nice and sweet.

54
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:27,610
Would my dad do that if he had no job?

55
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,980
Punch Dad's palm.

56
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,920
- One, two.
- One, two.

57
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,950
Now three punches.

58
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,149
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

59
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:36,149
One, two, three, four.

60
00:02:36,149 --> 00:02:37,619
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

61
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:38,920
You're pretty good.

62
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,959
One, two...

63
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,459
Oh, no. Are you okay?

64
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,899
Oh, dear.

65
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:48,559
Goodness.

66
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,269
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

67
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,499
Or should I get you something
for pain relief?

68
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,670
It looks like you're badly hurt.

69
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,610
Let me help.

70
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:01,209
Be careful.

71
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:04,050
- My gosh.
- Are you okay?

72
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,290
Watch out.

73
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,989
She must be in lots of pain.

74
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
Hang on.

75
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,760
(Manjang-gu Boxing Club)

76
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,559
Hey.

77
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,489
I'm on my way.

78
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,089
I don't have the money.

79
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:55,399
What should we do? This is really bad.

80
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,439
Hey, how are things with Nam Jin?

81
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:04,339
Did the sexy night
at the studio apartment work out?

82
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:08,209
As if it worked out.
I saw something I shouldn't have.

83
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:09,880
What did you see?

84
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,749
No, never mind.

85
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:14,320
Is Ji Hyun doing well?

86
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:18,589
Okay. I'll be there soon.

87
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,600
Can you...

88
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,340
Hey.

89
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,259
- Tae Ri.
- Yes?

90
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:55,319
It looks like...

91
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,189
the members
must take the initiative to train.

92
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,160
Dad is really good at that.

93
00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:03,429
Let's see.

94
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,869
The basics of boxing.

95
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,650
I got it.

96
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:20,780
Tae Ri. You punch with the shoulder.

97
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,790
Shoulder and arm. Like this.

98
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,319
- Like this.
- Reach far out.

99
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,259
- Like this?
- That's it.

100
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,860
- Tae Ri.
- Yes?

101
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:31,590
If you get upset again,

102
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:33,900
don't bang your head against a wall.

103
00:05:34,329 --> 00:05:36,699
Punch a sandbag instead, okay?

104
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,270
Shall I put one in your room?

105
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,040
Quack, quack. Yes.

106
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,439
Copy Dad.

107
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:47,480
- One, two.
- One, two.

108
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,040
- One, two.
- One, two.

109
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,249
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

110
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:53,749
Goodness.

111
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,819
Oh, dear.

112
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:00,989
Here you go.

113
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:10,329
My gosh.

114
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,239
What is it now?

115
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:21,110
Ms. Pi, are you free tomorrow?

116
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:22,410
How about working part-time?

117
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,480
I'll pay you handsomely.

118
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,050
Part-time work? Sounds good.

119
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,710
Here goes.

120
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,980
Come along.

121
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,520
- Hey, Ms. Pi.
- Hello.

122
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,780
Up you go.

123
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,150
Put these on.

124
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,259
There are nails everywhere.

125
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:09,889
- Take your time.
- Okay.

126
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:21,699
What's up?

127
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,540
An emergency meeting?

128
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,970
Mom wants us all here.

129
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,309
Give me the phone.

130
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,110
Are you...

131
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:31,749
even thinking about the money?

132
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,379
I am.

133
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,850
This won't do.

134
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:38,389
Let's find a way to get the money.

135
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:42,220
Come up with a plan each
and come over this evening, okay?

136
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,689
Okay.

137
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,300
I'd have exploited that option already
if I knew of one.

138
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,069
You heard me, didn't you?

139
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:57,369
Do whatever it takes
to think of a plan by this evening.

140
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,780
Don't think of coming in
if you don't have an idea, okay?

141
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,540
- Okay.
- Okay.

142
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,050
My goodness.

143
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:09,280
It looks like you're all
wasting time and not thinking.

144
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:19,059
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

145
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,129
Why are you here?

146
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,770
Are you allowed to be out
when you're recovering?

147
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,369
My back is a little sore,

148
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,869
but I'm not well enough to work,

149
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,710
and being indoors all day is killing me.

150
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,309
I'm glad you're here.

151
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,210
Shall we get dinner on the way home?

152
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,350
Shall we?

153
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:41,150
How is Sang Ah doing at work?

154
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:43,550
She seems to be working hard.

155
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,890
What she saw and heard overseas
must come in handy.

156
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:50,589
How is the man she recommended?

157
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,089
He's capable.

158
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,630
Sang Ah wouldn't have recommended him
if he wasn't.

159
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,900
You think highly of him,
and that's making me really curious.

160
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:02,939
He must be pretty decent.

161
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:06,209
Shall I invite Sang Ah to dinner too?

162
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,280
You're always on about her.

163
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,880
Do you like her that much?

164
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,380
She's the first child I raised myself.

165
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,819
She might not be my blood,
but she's special.

166
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,120
You did raise her since she was a newborn.

167
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,459
Yes.

168
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:28,099
Everyone said the older she got,
the more she took after me.

169
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:31,969
You and my heavily pregnant ex-wife
got in that darn car accident.

170
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:34,099
You were hurt yourself,

171
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,670
but you got her to a hospital
and helped her give birth.

172
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:39,380
My ex-wife died that day,

173
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,109
but Sang Ah might have too
if it hadn't been for your help.

174
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,579
You practically gave birth to her.

175
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,920
You don't have to praise me that much.

176
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,660
It's well-earned praise.
You raised Sang Ah who had lost her mom,

177
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,490
and it can't have been easy.

178
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,589
I have a long way to go...

179
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,000
to repay you for what you did.

180
00:10:02,099 --> 00:10:03,800
Stop it.

181
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:07,770
I might as well drop by
and see Sang Ah while I'm here.

182
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:10,240
You like Sang Ah too much.

183
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:11,910
Be careful.

Bye.

Sang Ah.

187
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:23,849
Mom. Why are you here?

188
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:27,719
Your dad and I will get dinner
on the way home.

189
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:29,020
Do you want to join us?

190
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,890

191
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:33,030
He's a bit busy these days.

192
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,459
Is he?

193
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:36,670
- How is your back?
- Well...

194
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:41,699
I can't go to work in case
the crazy family barges in again,

195
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:43,270
and it's suffocating being at home.

196
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,109
Ms. Jin, later on...

197
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:49,240
You have a guest. I'll come back later.

198
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,510
Say hello. This is my mom.

199
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,079
Hello.

200
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,390
Is this the Mr. Jeon you recommended?

201
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,490
Yes.

202
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,120
Take a seat. Let's chat.

203
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,890
The CEO praised you for being capable.

204
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:06,329
You flatter me.

205
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:12,569
Oh, gosh.

206
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,939
Hey, have a coffee.

207
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,280
You too, Ms. Pi.

208
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,309
- Thanks a lot.
- Goodness.

209
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,079
Thank you.

210
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,250
You must've been stressed out...

211
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:29,849
since your Jeil boss disappeared.

212
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,219
You look dreadful.

213
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,559
My boss' disappearance
isn't the only problem I have.

214
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,099
What other problems are there? Tell me.

215
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:43,829
Who knows?
This old man might have some advice.

216
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:53,309
That was what happened.
What do you think we can do?

217
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:58,209
My goodness. 150,000 dollars is some sum.

218
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:00,120
Tell her to do time.

219
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,719
My brother got into some similar trouble.

220
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,349
He did time too.

221
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,219
A year or so?
That's the maximum she'll get.

222
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,959
Divide 150,000 dollars
by the number of hours in a year.

223
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,829
It's a decent deal.

224
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,670
My brother ended up
befriending some con men,

225
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,770
got out, got into trouble again,
and went to prison again.

226
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,270
Still, he was grossly overpaid
considering what he owed.

227
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:31,109
My goodness.

228
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,880
You're a handsome young man.

229
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,520
What do your parents do?

230
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,219
Why would you ask him that?

231
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,030
Am I being too forward?

232
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:47,130
Not at all. My father has passed away,
and my mother lives alone.

233
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:52,069
Supporting you as you studied abroad
must have been taxing on her.

234
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,599
His father left an inheritance.

235
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,410
But he's so frugal.

236
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,040
He didn't let it show,
so I had no idea his family was well-off.

237
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:02,380
Oh, I see.

238
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:06,079
You're handsome and smart.

239
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:08,250

240

- Yes.

242
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,829
What a shame.
I have another daughter, you see.

243
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,099
Would you like to join me
when I go out to play golf?

244
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,939

You're straightforward

00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,849
I think
they're thinking of blackmailing you.

363
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,919
They caused Chu Ah's car accident.
I guess it's true that...

364
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:44,389
they'd hurt themselves to threaten others.

365
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:48,359
They could be the death of you
if you were to get involved with them.

366
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,290
Oh, my gosh.

367
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,599
Your cap. The dung... No.

368
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,800
The snake embroidery.
It's one-of-a-kind from your fan.

369
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,099
Weren't you wearing that
when you crouched and ran away?

370
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:04,839
What are you on about?
Where's my manager? Mr. Jang!

371
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,510
- What's wrong?
- Where were you? The fraudster got in.

372
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,409
- I'm a what?
- How did you get in?

373
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:13,510
- Get out of here.
- Wait. I'm not a fraudster.

374
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,819
I am not!

375
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:17,919
I won't take too much of his time.

376
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,319
She actually came here.

377
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,220
How did she figure it out?

378
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,220
I need to confirm something.

379
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,530
Let me stay just a little while.

380
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,030
Leave before I call security.

381
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,869
You ran away from the scene.

382
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:39,940
I saw you sneak away.

383
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,109
I want to know what happened.
Just tell me that. Please?

384
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,250
What are you doing here?

385
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,190
I'm not here to do anything.

386
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,119
- Give me just one minute.
- No.

387
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,190
- Please. Just a minute.
- You're leaving.

388
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,290
One minute will do.

389
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,399
I swear. I just want one minute.

390
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,700
Stop harassing him.

391
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:05,329
He's the only witness to my car accident.

392
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,369
I just want to ask him one thing.

393
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:08,440
I'll call the police.

394
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,240
No, wait. Don't call.

395
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,609
- Leave now.
- I won't ask, then.

396
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,349
She'll be back.

397
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,919
She seemed determined.
Keep an eye out for her.

398
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,349
Okay.

399
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:25,389
Woo Sang.

400
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,059
Woo Sang.

401
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:30,430
It's Chu Ah.

402
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,690
What is she doing here?

403
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,069
Why was that girl here?

404
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:40,940
Did she say something?

405
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:44,109
She asked if it was me
in the car with you.

406
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,339
See? I told you she'd come and ask.

407
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,210
You can't talk to her.

408
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,309
Okay.

409

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,300
(2,000 to 300,000 dollars: 22 percent)

411
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,559
(Over 300,000 dollars: 33 percent)

412
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,829
My goodness.

413
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,129
- Where are you going?
- What's up?

414
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,399
What are you doing here?

415
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:51,369
Why did you come here
without calling ahead?

416
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,879
Did you see...

417
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,349
my lottery ticket?

418
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:01,180
The one you found at your mother's
while cleaning up.

419
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,119
That one? I think I threw it out.

420
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:06,520
Did you really?
Without checking the numbers?

421
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,659
It was on the floor,
so I thought it was an old dud.

422
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:13,389
What's wrong?

423
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,599
I think the numbers were similar.

424
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,770
You said Jin Sang Ah was your superior.

425
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,639
Could you talk to her
about the settlement...

426
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,809
Fine.

427
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,379
I really don't want to ask.

428
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,750
Can you...

429
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:37,250
get me a loan?

430
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:39,990
Just a little at least.

431
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,659
Then will you give me a divorce?

432
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:50,399
- What?
- If I get you a loan,

433
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,470
will you divorce me?

(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

436
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,559
Your wife is going crazy
trying to get the money to settle.

437
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:25,700
- Can you do this?
- She doesn't know about this money.

438
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:27,800
Are you interested in selling the house?

439
00:28:28,069 --> 00:28:30,740
How much do you think we could get for it?

440
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,470
You want to sell the house?

441
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,210
Should we let her go to prison, then?

442
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,639
I came to ask one last time.

443
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:39,780
Shouldn't you go on your knees at least?

444
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,450
