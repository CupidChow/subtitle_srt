1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,439
He's coming back. He'll be back tomorrow.

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,879
My husband.

3
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:08,080
The long-distance couple reunites at last.

4
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,779
He said his professor begged him to stay,

5
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,419
but he insisted on returning.

6
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:17,789
And the only reason for that is us.
He misses us, his family.

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,960
And the award goes to...
And the winner is...

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,699
Nam Jin Jeon!

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,300
From Columbia University's
Graduate School of Architecture.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,299
The natural surrounding landscape
in his design.

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,070
Ji Hyun's dad is flying back tomorrow.

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,810
- What?
- For real?

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,810
- For real?
- Yes, for real.

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,820
I don't want to tell.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,979
Ji Hyun!

16
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,049
Tae Ri!

17
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,520
You smashed it down...

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,289
when tomorrow is our D-day.

19
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,060
Now I feel horrible.

20
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,090
It's like I'm jinxed.

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,630
Then how...

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,170
will you manage to work with me
in the same company?

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,780
(Episode 2)

24
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,409
(Jin Architecture)

25
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,290
Dad has some work to finish up.

26
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,030
Let's play when I'm done.

27
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,200
Okay.

28
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,439
She's coming back so suddenly.

29
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,709
What a nuisance.

30
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:42,870
I found out while on the phone with HR.

31
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,379
What if she came to work
and we didn't know?

32
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:47,010
We'd have had a scolding.

33
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,879
Mr. Kim didn't say anything yesterday.

34
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:53,120
You know how spontaneous Empress Jin is.

35
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:55,349
The room's so dusty.

36
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,120
She said no one
was to touch her things until her return.

37
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,329
That's why we couldn't do anything.

38
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:05,359
But if we actually didn't touch anything
and left the room as is?

39
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,870
She'd throw a fit.

40
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,669
Stop yapping and get busy cleaning.

41
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,740
Let's rid the room of dust.

42
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,169
Is it because the room
was unoccupied for two years?

43
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,210
The dust...

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,680
There's no end to it.

45
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:22,849
Who will get us more clean rags?

46
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,020
I'll go.

47
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:28,990
Hey.

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,689
Someone's in.

49
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,189
What's going on?

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,629
Goodness. Mr. Kim.

51
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,469
What are you all doing here?

52
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:47,139
Hello, sir. Hi, Tae Ri.

53
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:49,770
We heard that Ms. Jin's returning.

54
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,280
If anything were out of place,
the fury of clean freak Ms. Jin...

55
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,949
I mean, we came in voluntarily
to get her office...

56
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,650
- back in order.
- I see.

57
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,889
Can I help?

58
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,419
So we can wrap it up quick.

59
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,590
Tae Ri, sit down and wait.

60
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,789
What's the fuss about?

61
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,930
The staff are pretty busy preparing for...

62
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,599
Ms. Jin's return.

63
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,599
She should've told you in advance.

64
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,870
The sudden decision got you all worked up.

65
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,110
I apologize.

66
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,780
It's fine, sir. We volunteered to come in.

67
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,939
That's right.

68
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,250
It's not because we fear her.

69
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:30,250
Okay. Thank you.

70
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,219
You can go ahead.

71
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,889
I must finish up some work.

72
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,819
Okay.

73
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,090
Let's get to it.

74
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,580
Dad's almost done. Bear with me.

75
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,379
Will Mom be back tomorrow?

76
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,120
Yes. Let's go and pick her up.

77
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,060
Don't bother to come
to the airport tomorrow.

78
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,370
I told Tae Ri we'd pick you up.

79
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,769
(Jin Sang Ah, unread)

80
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,220
The person is unable to answer the phone.

81
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,029
Shall we not enter Korea?

82
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,769
Shall we head back to New York?

83
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,430
How?

84
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,540
By turning the plane right around?

85
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,639
Yes, do it.

86
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,410
Are you sure? Okay.

87
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,910
Excuse me.

88
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,209
Don't.

89
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:11,449
In the night sky where the sun is setting

90
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,519
Are three stars that are brothers

91
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,889
They twinkle and sparkle

92
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:23,660
As friendly brothers...

93
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,699
Goodness. Why would he call this late?

94
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,240
- Hello?
- Ms. Pi, there's bad news.

95
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,910
- What is it?
- Hanil Apartments.

96
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,910
They got new built-in cabinets.

97
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,449
- Yes.
- I checked out the place.

98
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,149
The guys who replaced the cabinets...

99
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,490
scraped up the new wallpaper.

100
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,220
So what? You want me to do it over?

101
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,360
Yes.

102
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,620
- Mister.
- Also,

103
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,490
the bathroom mirror's a bit too small.

104
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,959
I can see the bare cement wall.

105
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,459
You need a tile job too?

106
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,740
You gave me the measurements
for the mirror.

107
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,370
I set aside the material you need.
You just have to do the work.

108
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,439
Don't you think
that's beyond my job description?

109
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,980
Come on.

110
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,379
Since when did we do
just what's in our job description?

111
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:16,410
They're moving in tomorrow.

112
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,379
Do we just leave the place as is
because it's not what we do?

113
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,189
I didn't know when we'd be done by,
so I didn't call any cleaners either.

114
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:24,420
I must clean the house too?

115
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,160
Ms. Pi. You're good at this.

116
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
You're calling me now which means...

117
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,459
I have to work all night long.

118
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:33,060
- Tomorrow...
- Did we ever have a schedule...

119
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,769
that we stuck to?

120
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,199
How do you expect to do this job
only when it suits you?

121
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,970
Ms. Pi. How many times...

122
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,769
did I pay you in advance...

123
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,939
when your husband needed tuition
and living expenses?

124
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,279
Three times, remember?

125
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,810
Okay, fine.

126
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,019
I have to go to the airport really early.

127
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,689
Oh, dear.

128
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,759
Ji Hyun. I need you to wake up.

129
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,959
Ji Hyun.

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,199
Ji Hyun. Get up. We need to go out.

131
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,110
My gosh.

132
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,250
Mom!

133
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,680
Oh, dear.

134
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,589
- Let's go!
- Okay.

135
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:31,819
Yes.

136
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,810
We're home.

137
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,110
Welcome back.

138
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,209
Did you take Tae Ri to work again?

139
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,709
I'm glad you're a great dad,

140
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,120
but what would the employees think of you?

141
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,389
We went to the park
after I met with his teacher.

142
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,490
He was in the office in the afternoon
only for a short while.

143
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,959
Go on upstairs.

144
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,990
Okay. Let's go upstairs.

145
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,569
What's wrong with him caring for his kid
while his wife studies abroad?

146
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,810
I didn't complain.

147
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,040
I just asked if he took the kid to work.

148
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,649
Sang Ah grumbles
that he's always with the boy and...

149
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,519
Why is this program so boring?

150
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,919
Shall I put something else on?

151
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,519
Leave it on.

152
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,590
Hey.

153
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:44,100
This car looks nice too.

154
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,230
It would be a smooth ride.

155
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,500
This is it.

156
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,299
My darling ride.

157
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,809
Mom!

158
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:58,580
Darn it. Mom!

159
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,350
Mom.

160
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,090
What's the fuss when you should be in bed?

161
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,889
Don't you think this is perfect for me?

162
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,789
Why do you need a car?

163
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:13,889
Why don't I? I'm an actress.

164
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,429
I need a ride
if I'm to have a private life.

165
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,429
No. You'll only get in trouble.

166
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,899
You drove right into the wall
of your driving school. No way.

167
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:25,399
Watching you try to get your license
was like watching someone pass the bar.

168
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,740
I got so many hours of practice
since then.

169
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,539
If you need a car,
your agency will get you a manager,

170
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:33,340
or you can take a taxi.

171
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:35,879
If you really need to drive,
you can borrow my car.

172
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,379
I don't want to. Your car's for old folk.

173
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:39,779
What?

174
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,059
I mean that cars have a style...

175
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:46,360
that suits their owner, okay?

176
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,860
- My goodness...
- Mom.

177
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,500
I love Sang Ah's car,

178
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,129
but she won't let me touch it.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,299
Mom.

180
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,000
Why don't you...

181
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,340
invest in your future star daughter?

182
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,110
Buy me a nice ride.

183
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,809
My first rule of investment is low risk.

184
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,879
Go to sleep or your skin will get rough.

185
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,379
It has eight cylinders.

186
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,529
(I told Tae Ri we'd pick you up. Unread)

187
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:39,009
How dare they run off
leaving a mess like this?

188
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:41,309
Darn them.

189
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,320
Mom. How did you meet and marry Dad?

190
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,519
What?

191
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:50,190
Your dad begged me to marry him.

192
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,059
Did he really? Where?

193
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,990
Let's see.

194
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,190
By the sea?

195
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:58,100
See this?

196
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:01,169
He put it on my finger.

197
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:06,039
Then he said, "Marry me, Pi Seon Ju."

198
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,169
That's so cool.

199
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,539
I'll marry a guy like Dad too.

200
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,139
You'll have to look hard.

201
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,610
Guys as cool as your dad are rare.

202
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:20,019
Hey, Ji Hyun.

203
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,649
Are you making a sign to welcome Dad with?

204
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,860
- Yes.
- You did such a great job.

205
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,429
You have an aesthetic sense just like me.

206
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,799
You're filled with it.

207
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,269
Shall I become an interior designer too?

208
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:37,029
- What?
- I said you were a designer...

209
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,039
and my teacher said it's a cool job.

210
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,169
You do all sorts of weird, hard tasks,

211
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:45,409
but interior design is a cool job, right?

212
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,450
It is. Mom's a really cool designer.

213
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,179
Drawing at a desk
and flipping through magazines...

214
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,580
doesn't make you a designer.

215
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,690
This looks nice.

216
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,820
A true designer...

217
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:00,960
should be able to...

218
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,000
put up wallpaper
with skills learned on the job.

219
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,870
And put up new tiles.

220
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,169
A true designer starts at the bottom...

221
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:16,539
and learns all the skills
as they climb the ladder.

222
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:19,840
That's right. You're a true designer.

223
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,509
Is there anything you can't do?

224
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:22,909
You're good at your job...

225
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,980
and you're good at fighting.

226
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,250
What?

227
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,549
It's not fighting.

228
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,620
It's boxing. It's a sport.

229
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,490
Come at me.

230
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,460
Hang on.

231
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,600
Hi, Mother.

232
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,159
Nam Jin flies in tomorrow.

233
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,470
What's the plan?

234
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,000
If we're to eat together,
you should cook...

235
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,710
or order catering or call a restaurant.

236
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,669
Shall I come to yours?

237
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,539
I thought you were
traveling with your friends.

238
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,350
I came home early
because one of the hags upset me.

239
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,279
I didn't know that.
My mom said she'd cook us dinner.

240
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,519
We'll eat at hers.

241
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,120
- Will you?
- We'll come see you...

242
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,519
after dinner.

243
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:06,090
Hey.

244
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,029
If she were cooking for your family,

245
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,000
couldn't she have invited me too?

246
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:13,500
You're all so dull-witted and slow.

247
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:17,600
My daughter-in-law and her mom
both lack common sense.

248
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,700
This Wang Yeon Ae
used to be popular, you know.

249
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,769
If we hadn't lost everything,

250
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:27,549
my Nam Jin would never have married
the likes of you.

251
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,149
Are you listening?

252
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,450
When did she hang up?

253
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,190
I'm sleepy.

254
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
Lie down over in that corner.

255
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,129
- I'll finish up quick and come over.
- Okay.

256
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:57,779
How did you propose to your wife?

257
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,480
Why do you want to know?

258
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,710
Tell me.

259
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,480
It was an ordinary affair.

260
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,820
"Ordinary?"

261
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:06,720
Were you eating out?

262
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,750
Did you give her a ring?

263
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:11,889
No. We were by the sea.

264
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,460
The sea?

265
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,159
Yes. We briefly lived by the seaside.

266
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,360
The house was a bit rundown,

267
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:22,429
but if we looked down the hill,

268
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:24,269
we got a great view of the beach.

269
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,269
It was such a pretty neighborhood.

270
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,039
In that pretty neighborhood,

271
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:35,409
by the sea you had a great view of...

272
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,750
"Marry me and I'll make you happy."

273
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,649
Did you say that?

274
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,730
Isn't that a good thing?

275
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,570
- Do you mind?
- Let's check it out later.

276
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,970
- What? Oh, sure.
- Okay?

277
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,110
My gosh. I'm exhausted.

278
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:03,870
Are we there yet?

279
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,039
We are almost there.

280
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,950
- Is this the top?
- What?

281
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,779
My goodness.

282
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,419
Is this where you live?

283
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,850
Yes. It's a shanty town.

284
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,559
That must be quite a climb when it snows.

285
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,259
It's slippery in the winter.

286
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,399
You could sled down the stairs
on a strip of linoleum.

287
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,230
Some kids really do that.

288
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,769
Right? I'm not the only one
with that idea, am I?

289
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,200
That would be so much fun.

290
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,009
You could actually pick up some speed.

291
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,139
You're so much like a child yourself.

292
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:39,740
How will you raise a kid?

293
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:42,580
- What do you mean?
- How will you...

294
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,080
raise a kid with me like this?

295
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,549
Is this...

296
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:50,289
a marriage proposal?

297
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:52,860
What? Well...

298
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,429
I guess?

299
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,029
Is that it? Just a few words?

300
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,830
Of course not.

301
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,600
Do you want this?

302
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,210
What's this? Is this a serious flashback?

303
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,980
The person I'm with now...

304
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:23,019
is you, Sang Ah.

305
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,099
Oh, my gosh.

306
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:16,410
Ji Hyun, wake up.

307
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,039
My sweet girl.

308
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,109
Let's go pick up dad.

309
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:22,609
Wash your face and change clothes.

310
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,980
- I need to pee.
- Gosh, no.

311
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,650
I cleaned the whole house. Keep it in.

312
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,490
Let's wash your face.

313
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,519
There's a good girl.

314
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,460
Now your nose. Blow hard.

315
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,359
Mom, have I grown a lot?

316
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,730
Yes, you grew a lot.

317
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,799
What if Dad doesn't recognize me?

318
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,539
You sent lots of photos
and had many video calls.

319
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,079
Still, what if he sees me in person
and doesn't recognize me?

320
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:55,750
Hey. Don't worry.

321
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,720
Parents recognize their children
even if they're blown up like popcorn.

322
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,349
All it takes is a glance.

323
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,150
You can pop people?

324
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,119
That's cruel.

325
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,190
- Shall I try and pop you?
- No, don't!

326
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,289
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

327
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,660
Darling honey, we're on our way.

328
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,130
Yes.

329
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,700
Fill me up with your love

330
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,940
I think my battery of love went flat

331
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,009
What are you doing, Mom?

332
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:27,109
You're cooking short ribs?

333
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,680
What about our budget?

334
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,279
You said we should scrimp.

335
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,220
We should serve Nam Jin...

336
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,890
something worth eating for dinner later.

337
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,289
My word.

338
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,259
An overseas master's degree
must really be a great deal.

339
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,390
To think that Han Man Eun
is actually cooking ribs...

340
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,799
What's this? Vegetables, glass noodles,

341
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,029
and prawns too?

342
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:48,630
Is it someone's special birthday?

343
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,769
You said we'd just grill some meat.

344
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,839
You never cooked any of this
for my husband when he was alive.

345
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:56,940
What?

346
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,579
What about the food
we cook for him on his death anniversary?

347
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,349
Don't be so jealous...

348
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,680
and come and taste this for me.

349
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,119
- It's tasty.
- Good.

350
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,920
You can season the vegetables, then.

351
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,059
Okay.

352
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,490
Goodness.

353
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,630
It's so tasty.

354
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,500
The short ribs are a bit tough today.

355
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,069
Are they?

356
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,740
It's the department store brand
I always buy.

357
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,339
Cook a new batch for Sang Ah later.

358
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:34,950
Did you buy some abalone too?

359
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,150
Yes.

360
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:38,279
Will you go to the airport, then?

361
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,450
Yes. We'll leave right now.

362
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,990
- Okay.
- Let's go, Tae Ri.

363
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,660
Say goodbye.

364
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,359
See you later.

365
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:50,430
Sang Ah will be tired.
Bring her straight home.

366
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,700
Sure.

367
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,170
(Paran-ro 16-gil 23)

368
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:11,880
- Let's go get your mom.
- Okay.

369
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,650
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

370
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,789
Let's go.

371
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:22,430
I'm so proud of Sang Ah.

372
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,930
She went abroad to study at her age...

373
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,859
instead of settling
because her dad owns a company.

374
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,430
Family should stick together, though.

375
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,970
If she leaves her husband and son behind
to do what she wants,

376
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,210
she'll lose more than she gains.

377
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,339
She left because she wanted to be
a responsible successor.

378
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,410
I'm yet to decide
if I'll make her my successor.

379
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,519
I won't promote her
just because she's my child.

380
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,789
Who else could succeed you?

381
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,990
So Woo doesn't want to own a company.

382
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,960
All he does is look after Tae Ri.

383
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,859
He treats Sang Ah well too.

384
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:57,859
Goodness.

385
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:00,930
Sang Ah was able to go abroad
because So Woo was so understanding.

386
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,769
Let's be honest. You don't have a son.

387
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:06,839
Who can succeed you other than Sang Ah?

388
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,210
A company isn't run by just one person.

389
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,410
What?

390
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:14,309
Why are you so treat Sang Ah so harshly?

391
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,710
Can't you be a bit nicer?

392
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,750
Goodness.

393
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,150
One would think she's your daughter
and I'm the step-parent.

394
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,190
Why would you say that?

395
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:28,630
I never thought of or treated her
as if she weren't my own.

396
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,890
I know that.

397
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,960
You didn't discriminate
between Sang Ah and Chu Ah,

398
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,170
and I'm so grateful for that.

399
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,640
I bet my dead ex-wife...

400
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,369
is even more grateful.

401
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:44,410
I got it, so stop already.
I'm afraid someone might hear us.

402
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,309
Why don't I like any if the options?

403
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:49,750
I'll just wear that set.

404
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,210
Darn it.

405
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,950
This will do.

406
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,720
- Come on.
- Okay, fine.

407
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,089
Dad, I need to poop.

408
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,130
- Can it wait?
- No.

409
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,430
Let's see.

410
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:11,200
- The toilet's over there.
- It's coming out.

411
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,740
He went overseas
to study at a famous university...

412
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,170
and he'll be back with a master's.

413
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:19,410
Goodness. He didn't
divorce your daughter, then?

414
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,809
What?

415
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,880
Well, that's what...

416
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,680
the other ladies said happened.

417
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,289
"The other ladies?"

418
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:31,220
My Seon Ju's such a smart
and meticulous girl.

419
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,619
Why would she get divorced?

420
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:34,420
She was smart even as a kid.

421
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,630
She did so well in school,
I wanted her to study medicine or law.

422
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,230
But she majored in art
because she was gifted that way.

423
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,170
Art degrees cost a fortune,

424
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,670
but we didn't spend a cent.

425
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,269
She went to a college
that gave her a full scholarship.

426
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:47,839
My goodness.

427
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:51,839
She went to a diploma mill
and you still brag about her scholarship?

428
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:54,480
She had diarrhea
the day of the entrance exam.

429
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,380
Who can take an exam in that state?

430
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:59,049
She was good enough
to offer to go to a third-rate college...

431
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:02,049
for a full scholarship instead of
waiting another year to retake the exam.

432
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:05,190
She also made her husband
an architect which isn't easy either.

433
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,460
As if that wasn't enough,
she sent him abroad to study.

434
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,289
No woman does that these days.

435
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:12,099
Exactly, Man Eun. In this day and age,

436
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,500
what's the point
of supporting your husband?

437
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,670
You should succeed in life yourself.

438
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,400
What more could she wish for
when her husband...

439
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,970
will spoil her rotten when he returns?

440
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,410
Okay, whatever.

441
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,640
I'll give you some japchae.
Come by this evening and get some.

442
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,009
Okay.

443
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,509
My goodness.

444
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,180
Is it because two guys lived here
without a woman's touch?

445
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,490
It smells like a bachelor pad.

446
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,119
Don't you think?

447
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:42,690
I air and clean the place regularly.

448
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,690
No, that's not what I mean.

449
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,400
The feel of the place.

450
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,630
The energy or the aura of the space.

451
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,569
That's what I'm talking about.

452
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,170
Okay...

453
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:56,640
Mom!

454
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,779
I've decided.

455
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:00,609
What did you decide on?

456
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,410
That you'll marry Woo Sang?

457
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,880
No. I'll persuade Sang Ah somehow...

458
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,480
and take her car on my date with Woo Sang.

459
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,289
Won't everyone be so envious?

460
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,160
I don't care about that.
I have to prepare to welcome your sister.

461
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,759
Go do your thing
and don't get on my nerves.

462
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:18,799
Okay.

463
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,329
You only care about Sang Ah.

464
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,930
I might go off the rails.

465
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,640
You're already off the rails.

466
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:30,039
Darn it.

467
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:31,740
Where was I?

468
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:34,079
The bachelor pad smell.

469
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,950
Goodness.

470
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:37,809
It's bad.

471
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:40,019
(West Side Parking)

472
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,589
- Mom, the welcome sign.
- Right. Let's hurry.

473
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:46,119
- Do you feel better?
- Yes.

474
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,519
Let's go.

475
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:53,700
Ladies and gentlemen.
Our flight landed in Hansan Airport.

476
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,130
Until the plane
comes to a complete stop...

477
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,539
and the fasten seat belt sign
is turned off, please wait...

478
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:01,839
Dad.

479
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:05,680
Can Mom come to my kindergarten recital?

480
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,039
I guess?

481
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,380
Quack, quack.

482
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,549
You're in a great mood today.

483
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,880
Come on. Let's go.

484
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,849
It's that way.

485
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,589
Let's hurry.

486
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,029
Come on.

487
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,299
Let's go.

488
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,700
We're here.

489
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,769
Let's see.

490
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,369
(Arrivals)

491
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:35,339
His plane landed. He'll be out soon.

492
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:38,170
Oh, gosh.

493
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,839
When will Mom come over?

494
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,210
I don't know.

495
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,779
Have a nice day.

496
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:48,720
I told him not to come. He won't be here.

497
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,019
Let's take the limousine bus.

498
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,220
Okay.

499
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,089
You got a message.

500
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,670
We're here.

501
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,900
(Be quick, Dad! We're here.)

502
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,940
Dad, hurry up.

503
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,670
We're waiting for you.

504
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,640
I miss you. See you soon.

505
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,480
What was that?

506
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,160
Thank you. Goodbye.

507
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,369
We can't meet as freely as before...

508
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:37,430
once we exit the gate.

509
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,799
Well, we'll meet at work.

510
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,170
Let's stay a bit longer.

511
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:53,680
Mom, did you get the time wrong?

512
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:56,720
I didn't.

513
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,660
I missed my flight.

514
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,059
I'm on standby. I think I can get a seat.

515
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,859
I'll be a few hours late.

516
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:11,670
Sorry. There was a mishap.
I'll be a bit late.

517
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:16,910
How many hours exactly?

518
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,180
If it's not that long, we'll wait here.

519
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,349
No, go home. I'll call when I land.

520
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,890
Ladies and gentlemen. This announcement...

521
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,049
Get off the cart.

522
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:34,490
Passengers from Tokyo...

523
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:40,029
on Japan Airlines Flight 4123
will come through...

524
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:44,329
Arrival Gate B, not Arrival Gate A.

525
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,710
Why did Dad miss his plane?

526
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,009
I don't know.

527
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,619
I guess he was distracted.

528
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,049
Still, it's just a few hours.

529
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,859
We waited a few years.
We can wait a few more hours.

530
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:08,630
Hey.

531
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,089
Your welcome signs.

532
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,460
I left them behind.

533
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,329
Where? On the luggage cart?

534
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:14,660
Oh, dear. Let's hurry back.

535
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,369
- Run.
- Run.

536
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,910
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

537
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:15,890
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

538
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,089
Come to the office right now.

539
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,089
There he is.

540
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,730
Meet Jeon Nam Jin whom we just scouted.

541
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:21,730
Nice to meet you.

542
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,900
It was right here?

543
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:25,799
Was the sea you saw
with your wife prettier...

544
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,970
or is this prettier?

545
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:28,400
You're the prettiest.

546
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,769
It's hard keeping up with a husband
that's out of your league.

547
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,740
Are you seeing another woman?

548
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,750
