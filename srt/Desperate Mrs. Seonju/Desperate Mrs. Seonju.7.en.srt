00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,580
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,080
The doors are closing.

3
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:28,990
The food's here.

4
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:30,889
I'm coming!

5
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,270
Who is it?

6
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,870
My wife.

7
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,079
Your wife?

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,880
Are you in there?

9
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,880
Honey. It's me.

10
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,889
Let me in.

11
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,819
Honey.

12
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:14,399
How did you find the place?

13
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:17,509
Did you follow me?

14
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,539
- This is heavy. Let me in.
- What...

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,550
Get out of my way.

16
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,780
Gosh.

17
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:27,449
I wanted to see how you were doing,

18
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:30,319
and bring you Mom's young radish kimchi
that you like so much.

19
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:32,759
You should've called ahead.

20
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,559
You didn't read my text.

21
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:38,759
How was work?

22
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,229
I won't eat at home that often.

23
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:42,800
Take it back home.

24
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,869
You need some kimchi
even if it's just to eat...

25
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,640
a packet of noodles.

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,069
Your fridge is almost bare.

27
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:53,309
My gosh.

28
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,149
What's this?

29
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,990
What is this?

30
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,360
A friend wanted to meet up for lunch.

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,729
There wasn't a good enough place nearby.

32
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:16,799
What friend?

33
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,340
The friend who got me this job.

34
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,470
Oh, really? What a lovely friend that is.

35
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,079
Shall I stay and say hi?

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,979
No.

37
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,609
I'll pass on the message. You can go.

38
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,019
Okay.

39
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,049
My word.

40
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,750
Hey.

41
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,729
This place is more spacious
than I thought.

42
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,590
All three of us could live here.

43
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,530
We can't raise a kid
in a studio apartment.

44
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,799
Why can't we?

45
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:50,769
Back in the day,
people raised kids in rundown shacks.

46
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:54,069
To be honest, this place
is much nicer than our apartment.

47
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:56,340
You can't move in here with me.

48
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,310
My company let me stay
only so I could work.

49
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:02,609
Hey.

50
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,350
Why...

51
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,280
do I smell perfume?

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,620
Wait.

53
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:20,960
Stop being silly...

54
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,400
and go home already.

55
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:26,400
Okay.

56
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,509
Hey, honey.

57
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,039
Can you get us some money?

58
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,310
Why do you keep asking?

59
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,710
Well, actually,

60
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,579
I was in a car accident.

61
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:39,650
A car accident?

62
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,549
Weren't you insured?

63
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:44,519
I got a cheap policy,
so I need some extra cash.

64
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,960
How much extra?

65
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,919
Quite a lot.

66
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,660
Can't you ask someone for a loan?

67
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,530
Wait. The friend you're meeting for lunch.

68
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,239
- Could you ask...
- Let's go outside.

69
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,810
I used to go to school
with the owner of the other car.

70
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,310
She's a mean witch, so it might not work,

71
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,549
but I need to scrounge whatever I can...

72
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,979
to beg or haggle with her...

73
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:13,579
Let's talk about it outside.

74
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:14,620
Come on.

75
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,150
You got a job at a company
that got you this flashy apartment.

76
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,859
Can't you get a loan on your credit?

77
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:23,359
- Let's...
- Whatever you can borrow.

78
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:24,859
Let's talk elsewhere.

79
00:04:24,859 --> 00:04:26,429
You won't even let me explain.

80
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:28,700
- Let's take it elsewhere.
- Why?

81
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,030
Goodness.

82
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,179
Pi Seon Ju.

83
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,510
What's that?

84
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,179
Here.

85
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:26,189
Can you pass it to Pi Seon Ju?

86
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:29,359
Guys. I think...

87
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:32,530
I'll do really well on the KSAT.

88
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,729
I'll get all fired up...

89
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:36,369
and get the highest scores.

90
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,869
Let's rule the world.

91
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,939
We'll get into university...

92
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:43,410
- Do you have a crush on her?
- What?

93
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:45,039
We can do it.

94
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,780
- Yes.
- Why do you like her?

95
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,780
Watching her just puts me in a good mood.

96
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,879
Give it to her for me.

97
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,419
Do you know
what they had to paint last year?

98
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,960
They had to paint a monkey.

99
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,859
- A monkey?
- This time it might be a gorilla.

100
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:05,559
You can draw yourself, then.

101
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:07,999
What about a whale?

102
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:10,299
- A whale?
- Or a mango.

103
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,840
That's a bit too boring.

104
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:15,499
I have a feeling...

105
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:17,539
the topic will be something unusual.

106
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,379
Something like E.T.?

107
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,939
- E.T.?
- You mean an alien?

108
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:24,879
- An alien?
- A gorilla would be better.

109
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,450
Something that requires imagination.

110
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,919
Jeon Nam Jin...

111
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,590
is your husband?

112
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,929
Honey. You can't borrow even a little?

113
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:43,600
Just a small amount.

114
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,970
Darn you.

115
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:47,470
How bad an accident did you cause?

116
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,439
Why can't the insurance cover it?

117
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,070
What do you expect from me
if you tell me now?

118
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,479
Be more cautious when you're on the road.

119
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:57,510
And don't drive around with so much trash.

120
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,979
That's why you don't have
the attention span to watch the road.

121
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,749
- Goodness.
- Darling.

122
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,220
You can't barge in here like this.

123
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,260
Do you think that's why
my boss let me stay?

124
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,729
It's not just me who lives here.
My colleagues could visit too.

125
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,629
My gosh.

126
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:16,570
Wait.

127
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,169
Why are you so annoyed?

128
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,470
Do you think everything's easy
because I got a job right away?

129
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,439
I didn't get the job
just because my friend recommended me.

130
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,710
This field is cut-throat.

131
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,010
I'm fighting hard to make it.

132
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,320
They put me on a project right away,

133
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:36,119
and I must do my best to prove myself.

134
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,989
You offered zero help to land this job.

135
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,090
The least you can do is keep quiet
in the background and cheer for me.

136
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,330
I just got a job
and am trying to gain acceptance,

137
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:48,530
and you want a loan?

138
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,229
And to live here with a kid?

139
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,100
That's too much.

140
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,439
I have a short lunch break.
I must get back to the office.

141
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,249
Mom wants to see you this weekend.

142
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,520
Okay!

143
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,350
Hey.

144
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:13,890
You're home, aren't you?

145
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:17,929
I haven't been eating enough at all.

146
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:19,960
I feel dizzy and...

147
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,299
What's...

148
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,439
this feel of emptiness?

149
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,090
She left. Let's eat.

150
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,220
We must hurry back to work.

151
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,499
Sorry.

152
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,129
I had to tell her something.

153
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:58,670
Maybe I should've told her
where I worked instead of this place.

154
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,899
I didn't think she'd come here.

155
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,040
What? Are you sick of me?

156
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,080
We're just friends with benefits?

157
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:16,690
That's what we are,
according to your definition.

158
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,920
From now on,

159
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:20,989
let's have an affair.

160
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,359
What?

161
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,859
Don't you want to?

162
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,369
My gosh.

163
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,210
The beanstalk is growing so fast.

164
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:37,869
The old man was right.

165
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:42,479
Mom scolded me for selling the ox
and getting no money in return,

166
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:46,749
but look at how much
the beanstalk grew overnight.

167
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,749
My goodness.

168
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,090
It might reach the sky.

169
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,790
- My gosh.
- That's awesome.

170
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,759
Shall we climb it?

171
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,950
What do you mean
you want us to have an affair?

172
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,420
I want to know you even more.

173
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,920
You want to have...

174
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:27,019
a serious relationship?

175
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:29,290
- Yes.
- Why?

176
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,100
Your wife barged in
without warning and I rushed to hide.

177
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:35,300
It made me realize...

178
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:38,600
I can't stand being someone who must hide.

179
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,570
I could just not date you anymore,
but I don't want that, either.

180
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:46,840
Shouldn't a relationship
built on the cost of withstanding...

181
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,139
something they hate carry more weight?

182
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,850
If we have an affair,

183
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,420
what changes?

184
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:55,479
We could be serious about it,

185
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,119
and then end up planning
a future together.

186
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,389
Sounds good.

187
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,600
Then this is Day One.

188
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:10,769
We're official.

189
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,499
From now on, before your family and wife,

190
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:19,409
I must be your priority
and come before anything else.

191
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,840
I'll do the same.

192
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,879
Okay.

193
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,590
That's what an affair partner does.
Do you understand?

194
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,790
Yes.

195
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,300
Darn it.

196
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,639
Shoot.

197
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:54,009
Do you think everything's easy
because I got a job right away?

198
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,840
Did I say that?

199
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:58,180
I'm fighting hard to make it.

200
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,479
The least you can do is keep quiet
in the background and cheer for me.

201
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,720
That's too much.

202
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:09,690
He'll never find another woman
who keeps as quiet as me.

203
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,560
I wouldn't have come over
if it hadn't been for this.

204
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:16,070
I can ask for help
if I can't handle it myself.

205
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,499
Darn it.

206
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:27,779
Yes.

207
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:29,749
He just started at work.

208
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,779
Even I'd feel frazzled
if someone came asking for help.

209
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:34,479
He would be on edge.

210
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,190
It's okay. Let's stay strong.

211
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:39,050
Let's work!

212
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,590
Jeil Interior Design. Give us a call.

213
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,830
We turn even an old rotting building
into something...

214
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,029
that looks as good as new.

215
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:49,359
Okay. You might rupture my eardrum.

216
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:50,430
Thank you.

217
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,239
- I don't own a home.
- We do offices too.

218
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,869
We charge the basic costs.
Forget extra for labor.

219
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:57,070
Just the basic costs.

220
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,070
Thank you.

221
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,310
Jeil Interior Design. Give us a call.

222
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,850
Climb up the growing beanstalk.

223
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,350
And defeat the giant that eats humans.

224
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,889
We took the giant's gold and became rich.

225
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,190
Well done. Now let's go home.

226
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,159
Fill me up with your love

227
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,330
My battery of love must have gone flat

228
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,830
- Goodness.
- What's that?

229
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,229
Peach liquor.

230
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:27,600
The chicken shop lady made it.
Peaches are good for hangovers.

231
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,340
She made a liquor
with something that cures hangovers?

232
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,310
That's why it's extra good.

233
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:33,239
She gave me a bottle for Nam Jin.

234
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,810
It just matured.

235
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,550
Would Nam Jin drink something like that?

236
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,080
Call Seon Ju and ask when he's free.

237
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:43,690
No, there's no need to even ask.

238
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,659
Tell him to drop by after work today.

239
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,220
You can't ask him over on the day.

240
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,029
Nam Jin's the type
that needs to be called out of the blue.

241
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:54,759
If you try to schedule,
he'll just make up an excuse.

242
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:56,200
Call her now.

243
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:59,300
My goodness.

244
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,940
We fix studios too, so take a flyer.

245
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,840
More and more people live alone,
and the paradigm's changing.

246
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,979
There are different kinds of houses.
Take on.

247
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,450
I'm done at last.

248
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,960
Hey.

249
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:22,359
- What took you so long to answer?
- What's up?

250
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:24,629
Mom wants to invite Nam Jin to dinner.

251
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:29,359
He's really on edge
because he just started at work.

252
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:33,100
Mom's trying so hard.
You can't refuse twice in a row.

253
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,499
Okay. I'll ask him.

254
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,109
Talk to him nicely and bring him over.

255
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:39,639
Okay.

256
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,509
Oh, dear.

257
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:52,119
Go on ahead. I'm going to the ladies'.

258
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,590
Okay.

259
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:56,190
What?

260
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,869
Mom wants you to come over for dinner.

261
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,200
You said this weekend.

262
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,340
You need to rest on weekends.

263
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,600
Let's go this evening.

264
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,509
This is too sudden. I have plans too.

265
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:13,540
Spare some time, even if you're busy.

266
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,979
My mom doesn't live that far away.
Let's just have a quick dinner.

267
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:20,519
You just got back from living abroad.

268
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,450
You should visit at least once to say hi.

269
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,550
Okay. I'll come
straight to your mom's later.

270
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,659
Who was that?

271
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,489
It was nothing.

272
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,659
I'm meeting some friends from college.
Come with me.

273
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:39,200
They all work in our field.
It won't hurt to get to know them.

274
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:43,540
I'll go ahead. See you later.

275
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,649
Hey. Nam Jin said he'd come.

276
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,249
Okay, bye.

277
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:08,060
Mom. Nam Jin said yes.

278
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:09,930
He did?

279
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,399
Then run over to the rice cake store.

280
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,170
Do we need rice cakes too?

281
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,639
Do as you're told.

282
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,940
Okay.

283
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,009
Here we go.

284
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,080
Tae Ri, you were incredible today.

285
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,519
Good for you. Well done.

286
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,190
Let's take this off now.

287
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:31,950
I want to show Mom.

288
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,119
Okay. Let's take it off and keep it safe.

289
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,229
- We'll show it to her later.
- Okay.

290
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:42,129
This was so nicely made.

291
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,369
- Who made this?
- You did.

292
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,940
Who's your dad?
How did he do such a good job?

293
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,970
Kim So Woo. He's an architect.

294
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,409
That's right.

295
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,239
Shall we do the beanstalk thing again?

296
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:57,550
You want to see it again?

297
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,720
Yes. You did such a good job.

298
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,989
The beanstalk is growing fast.

299
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,889
It might reach the sky.

300
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:08,659
Shall we climb up?

301
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,989
Am I doing well?
Do I look like I'm growing?

302
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,500
My gosh. You're fantastic.

303
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:18,429
What did I tell you?
I said the beanstalk's really important.

304
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:21,100
It's in the title too.

305
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,040
The play was a success
because you did so well.

306
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,709
My son's the best.

307
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,550
Good for you.

308
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,149
Which one should I use?
Eenie, meenie, minie, moe.

309
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,090
It's this one.

310
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,300
Oh, my gosh.

311
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,580
One, two...

312
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,050
Stay right there.

313
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,520
One,

314
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:16,159
two, three.

315
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,629
Oh, no. My back.

316
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,770
What's all this?

317
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,810
Being in a car accident made me realize...

318
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:34,439
a real couple should help each other
put on pain relief patches.

319
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:35,909
That's what I think.

320
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,449
I wasn't hurt at all.

321
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,850
You don't use these only when you're hurt.

322
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,379
It can be a preventative measure.

323
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,149
Who uses pain relief patches
as a preventative measure?

324
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:46,389
Skip it if you want to.

325
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,429
But can you put one on here for me?

326
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,300
I'm glad you're here.

327
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,230
- Help her with these patches.
- What?

328
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,369
Where were you hurt?

329
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,800
I'm fine.

330
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,439
- I'll help you...
- Don't come closer!

331
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:04,010
Freeze.

332
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:05,939
Stay there.

333
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,320
Hello, Dad.

334
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,990
Where's Mr. Kim. Did he leave already?

335
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:23,859
Yes. He left early
to go to Tae Ri's recital.

336
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,030
You didn't go with him?

337
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,830
Why should both parents
go to a kid's event?

338
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,770
You shouldn't be so indifferent.

339
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,240
It's great to work hard,
but look out for your family too.

340
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,639
Mr. Kim suggested he go alone.

341
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:41,780
Even so. Seeing one parent
care more about the child...

342
00:19:42,379 --> 00:19:43,649
than the other isn't ideal.

343
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,619
I just got back to Korea.

344
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,889
I barely have the time to get my bearings.

345
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:52,919
He offered to go on his own
so I could catch up at work.

346
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,119
Even if you're busy,

347
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,189
you can make the time
depending on what your priority is.

348
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,770
Hello, sir.

349
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,310
Hello.

350
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:29,320
Come in.

351
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,939
The layout you asked to see.

352
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,139
Why are you so cautious when it's just us?

353
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:47,179
My office isn't bugged.

354
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:49,379
I thought I should watch how I act...

355
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,580
when I'm at work.

356
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,689
You're the only one who makes me smile.

357
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:01,359
Let's see.

358
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,899
I need you to be the coolest guy there.

359
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:11,199
What do you think?

360
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,270
- Are you satisfied?
- Yes.

361
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,090
What?

362
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,030
Did you have any plans?

363
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,340
No.

364
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:50,310
How do you connect the Bluetooth?

365
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,010
It's not my car, so I don't know.

366
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:53,209
Whose car is it?

367
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,439
It's my husband's.

368
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,179
I'm driving his
while mine's in the garage.

369
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:57,949
It's quite a nice ride.

370
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,320
Should I just sell my car once it's fixed?

371
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,820
Why would you? I was hoping to drive it.

372
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,790
- Were you?
- It's a cool car.

373
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,820
You can be a cutie.

374
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,159
You can drive it when it's repaired.

375
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,330
Sounds good.

376
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,100
It was never driven in two years.
They only revved the engine sometimes,

377
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,000
and then there was the accident
with the bratty girl.

378
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,040
It's connected.

379
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,270
What bratty girl?

380
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:23,510
Someone I know.

381
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,310
Oh, wasn't your wife in a car accident?

382
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:30,050
She mentioned money when she came over.

383
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,679
Yes.

384
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,580
There have been
a lot of accidents recently.

385
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:42,260
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

My mom does.

389
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,770
You'd think we live in the Joseon era.

390
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,139
Hey.

391
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:00,980
- Yes.
- It's so nice.

392
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,649
- It's perfect weather for an outing.
- It is.

394
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,810
How are you doing, guys?

395
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,209
I'm fine.
I'd been meaning to ask, Seon Ju.

396
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:36,580
Your husband should be back soon, right?

397
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,010
Yes. He's back.

398
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,179
Did you text to brag, then?

399
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:42,520
Did he find work?

400
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,689
It looks like it.

401
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,419
Which firm?

402
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:47,020
You should treat us to celebrate.

403
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,119
I will one day.

404
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,730
Do you guys have some spare cash?

405
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,399
Why?

406
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:55,899
I suddenly need some.

407
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:57,530
How much?

408
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,199
About 3,0000 dollars?

409
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:03,340
As much as you can. Please?

410
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,139
My husband
lost everything on bitcoin. Sorry.

411
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:09,340
My mother-in-law
was scammed by a voice phisher.

412
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,750
The whole family's upset.

413
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,850
Okay. I know you're all struggling. Sorry.

414

I have no one to ask for money.

415

Goodness.

416
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,030
How much is that?

417
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,540
It was imported from the UK,
and it's not just the car.

418
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,439
Stuff that fell out of your car
scratched the hood too.

419
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:40,879
Repairs might cost
60,000 to 70,000 dollars.

420
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,679
The dashcam's broken,

421
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,250
and you have to rent her a similar car,
so it'll be a huge headache.

422
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,419
Then... What...

423
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:51,649
How am I to cover that?

424
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:54,020
We'll pay the maximum of 20,000 dollars,

425
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,129
but you must cover the rest.

426
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:01,399
What if we can't?

427
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,929
If you don't settle today,

428
00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:05,429
your sister might be detained.

429
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:07,100
Detained?

430
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,669
Pi Mi Ju, get back here!

431
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:10,969
Detective, the culprit's trying to flee.

432
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:13,879
- Okay. Where are you?
- Get back here right now!

433
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,840
I'm scared.

434
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,310
And I really need to pee.

435
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,250
Oh, dear.

436
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,800
Goodness.

437
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,530
Hey.

438
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:39,969

439
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,070
Where did the potatoes go?

440
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:47,240
My master will be so angry.

441

That's a knight in shining armor.

442
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,929
But he's not on a horse.

443
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,889
This isn't my potato.

444
00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:34,760
My potatoes are dirty.

445

446
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:41,730
Hold out your apron.

447
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,570
These are...

Can I really keep all these?

453
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,100
What kind of dream was that?

454
00:27:20,469 --> 00:27:22,669
It would've meant I were pregnant...

455
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:25,010

456
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,609

The tin man.

458

We haven't even eaten together
since you got back.

466
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,889
This means you don't even care.

467

You can't leave like this.

468
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,459
