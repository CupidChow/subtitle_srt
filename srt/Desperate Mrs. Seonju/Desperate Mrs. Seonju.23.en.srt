1
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,040
He must've seen an insect go by.

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,710
Right, Tae Ri?

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:14,639
Did you?

4
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:30,089
It's not there anymore. It has gone.

5
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,060
It's okay now, Tae Ri.

6
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,370
I'll take him away to console him.

7
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,040
It's okay.

8
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,209
Why would you be so scared of a bug?
What kind of bug was it?

9
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,779
It was...

10
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:55,050
just a bug.

11
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,919
You read too many books about monsters.

12
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,260
Dad will stay until you fall asleep.

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Here.

14
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:10,269
Here's your happy music.

15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,540
You're not scared anymore, are you?

16
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:15,399
Don't cry. It's okay.

17
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,599
The kid suddenly got upset and screamed.

18
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,599
I hope it didn't ruin your meal.

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,640
Tell So Woo to come and say...

20
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,670
No, it's fine.
We said our farewells upstairs.

21
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,340
I'll leave you, then.

22
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:56,179
See you tomorrow at work.

23
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,509
Goodbye.

24
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,920
Did Tae Ri have to have an outburst today?

25
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,819
- Let's go to our room.
- Okay.

26
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,530
- Good night.
- You too.

27
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,030
Darn you.

28
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,070
The atmosphere was frigid.
So Woo knows, doesn't he?

29
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,200
About how you and Mr. Jeon...

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,839
Yes.

31
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:25,110
And they sat at the same table to eat?

32
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:26,939
So Woo and Mr. Jeon?

33
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,209
We decided to pretend
nothing was going on.

34
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:33,619
Inviting an affair partner home
to eat with her own husband?

35
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,980
I thought that was for US TV.

36
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,149
You be quiet.

37
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:41,790
Mom.

38
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:45,630
I am your son,
but will you respect my privacy?

39
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,929
What's wrong with a mom
seeing her son naked?

40
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,630
Take a look at this photo.

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,439
She's the daughter of someone I know
on Jeju Island. Will you meet her?

42
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,939
- Forget it.
- Why not?

43
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,610
I was trying to
stay out of your love life, but I can't.

44
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,880
Chu Ah's family isn't normal either.

45
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,880
She's still hanging around you.
You can't fall for her, okay?

46
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,249
I won't fall for her.

47
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:11,689
I'll marry whom I want,
so don't accept such photos.

48
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:13,559
- But she's so pretty.
- Watch some TV.

49
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:15,660
- It's time for your favorite show.
- Take another look.

50
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,160
It's so cold.

51
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,700
Goodness.

52
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,769
How did it go?

53
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,869
Did you talk to Nam Jin?

54
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,510
I thought I heard the door. It was you.

55
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,080
You said you had no work
because your company went under.

56
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,450
Why were you out all day
leaving your kid with us?

57
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,790
Didn't Nam Jin complain?

58
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,489
He's staying at the company dorm.

59
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:48,760
I see.

60
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:52,999
He might get up to no good.
You should check on him often.

61
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Okay.

62
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,369
Does anyone want to see the house?

63
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:58,469
Not yet.

64
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,100
You talked as if it would sell
as soon as we put up the house.

65
00:04:04,839 --> 00:04:06,279
Mi Ju, come over here.

66
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:08,779
Are you looking for work?

67
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:11,309
Yes.

68
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,149
All three of you are practically jobless.

69
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:16,749
Is it infuriating or not?

70
00:04:16,749 --> 00:04:17,820
- It is.
- It is.

71
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,619
You know that much?

72
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,790
Here. Let's eat.

73
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,480
What should we do?

74
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:43,850
I wish at least one of us
could find an actual job.

75
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,949
Who's this?

76
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,989
Hello?

77
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,090
Hello?

78
00:04:58,329 --> 00:04:59,499
Ms. Pi.

79
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:03,569
Boss? Where are you?

80
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:07,170
Where are you right now?

81
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,340
I was humiliated and abused
after you disappeared.

82
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,980
People barged in
and turned the office upside down.

83
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,050
I'm not surprised.
I don't feel bad for them,

84
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,749
but I'm really sorry and ashamed
to face you.

85
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,989
I don't care for stuff like that.

86
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,689
Where are you now?

87
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:26,819
Knowing might get you hurt.

88
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:28,819
Fine. I'll get hurt, then.

89
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,329
Where are you?

90
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:33,559
At the bus terminal. I'm leaving.

91
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,759
I won't be in Seoul for a while.

92
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,369
I felt bad for you, though.

93
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,470
I called my friend's company,
so give them a call.

94
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,079
When I'm settled down somewhere,
I'll pay you the salary I owe.

95
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,280
This phone will be disconnected too.

96
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,249
Hello?

97
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:01,590
- What did he say?
- Be quiet.

98
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,629
The number does not exist.

99
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,629
My goodness...

100
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:10,869
- Why? What did he say?
- What did he say?

101
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:13,199
He's at the bus terminal.

102
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,100
He's fleeing the city.

103
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,639
It's the nighttime getaway
I'd only heard about.

104
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,910
And what?

105
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:22,439
He called a friend's company
to get me a job?

106
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,220
He has what's left of a conscience
for a guy who's on the run.

107
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
Hey.

108
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,559
(Seong Il Guk, Head of Human Resources)

109
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:37,629
"Jin Architecture?"

110
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
What is it?

111
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:44,869
It's where the other car owner
and Nam Jin work.

112
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,009
If you get a job there,
will you have to work for that psycho?

113
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:55,679
Yes. That would be
uncomfortable and awkward, wouldn't it?

114
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:59,449
No. She's a team leader
and the CEO and owner's daughter.

115
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,290
I wouldn't have to cross paths
with someone that high up often.

116
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,960
Why would it be awkward?

117
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,590
What about Nam Jin, then?

118
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,400
It's a great opportunity.
I'll find that witch.

119
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,569
What witch?

120
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,869
Yes. Pass the interview and get the job.

121
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,970
Catch them, teach them a life lesson,
and fight for all you have.

122
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,910
I don't know what's going on, but fight.

123
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,210
Do whatever it takes to work there.

124
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,879
Out of the three of us,
I think you have the best chance.

125
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,119
This won't do.

126
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Get up.

127
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,189
- What?
- What?

128
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:43,230
Get up.

129
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,069
It's small because I wore it in my 20s,
but fit yourself into it.

130
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,400
That suit cost a fortune back then.

131
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,340
Yes. I don't have anything
you can wear to an interview.

132
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,439
This is the best so far.

133
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,949
I just need to be able to breathe, right?

134
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:08,819
I thought we were all done for,
but I guess there is a way out.

135
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,520
We got some good news.

136
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,889
- Come on, let's go!
- Let's go!

137
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:20,300
Yes.

138
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:22,230
Oh, no.

139
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,629
What?

140
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,970
Don't tell Mom about the interview.
Tell her if and when I pass.

141
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,040
Bye.

142
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,270
Brush your teeth.

143
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,660
Please give me the job.

144
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:55,760
If you won't give me the job,
at least let me catch the mistress...

145
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,729
so I can end her for good.

146
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,400
You must grant one of these two wishes.

147
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:11,609
Can you move a little forward?

148
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:12,650
Okay.

149
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,079
- Park flush to the side.
- Okay.

150
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:16,520
A bit more. Keep going.

151
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,949
- Stop. That will do.
- Thank you.

152
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,030
Oh? What's wrong?

153
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,329
The door is stuck again.

154
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,770
This car is full of surprises.

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,069
Goodness.

156
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:38,410
Oh, no.

157
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,620
My gosh.

158
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:53,859
Oh, dear.

159
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:55,059
Put that over there.

160
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:57,329
It's expensive, so be gentle.

161
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,429
Don't scratch the floor
when you put it down.

162
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:01,199
Okay. There you go.

163
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,699
It's much nicer and bigger here...

164
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:06,000
than when I saw it in the showroom.

165
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,540
Good job.

166
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,969
- Thank you.
- Sure.

167
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,510
My gosh. I love it.

168
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,209
I'll help you with that.

169
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,719
Are the lights ready?

170
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,359
- About the added scenes...
- Yes.

171
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,219
- Go over them again.
- Okay.

172
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:32,459
I don't mind working on the crew
or acting in a tiny role.

173
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,130
Give me any odd job. Please?

174
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,099
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

175
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,400
Did we cast someone
as the one-off crazy girl?

176
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,670
Not yet.

177
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,319
Look that way. Look this way.

178
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,120
Look up. Look down.

179
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,219
Look at me.

180
00:10:56,849 --> 00:10:58,020
Go cross-eyed.

181
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:00,459
Roll your eyes back.

182
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:06,760
A flower behind the ear,
and you'd be perfect.

183
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,760
Really?

184
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,329
I can do a really good job.

185
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:12,729
I'll go crazy for the camera.

186
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:14,469
- Give her the role.
- Okay.

187
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,670
Thank you.

188
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:17,540
I'll do my best.

189
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,780
Do you sell safety pins?

190
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,449
Look over there.

191
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,020
Thanks.

192
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:31,920
My goodness.

193
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:47,400
It's you.

194
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,640
I'll find out who you are
and end you today.

195
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,949
- It's nice and fresh out.
- Yes.

196
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,679
The sky is beautiful.

197
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,520
Jin Sang Ah?

198
00:12:13,729 --> 00:12:15,229
Office romance is fun.

199
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,229
I didn't know
when I was married to a colleague.

200
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,599
Did Seon Ju say anything since?

201
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,670
No. We haven't talked at all.

202
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:25,709
Are you handling things properly?

203
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,309
I told you that I must be
your priority from now on.

204
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,319
Stop being immature.

205
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,089
Can't we be immature sometimes?

206
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,559
If Seon Ju calls about the kid,
will you go or not?

207
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,229
That's just silly. I won't go.

208
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:46,699
Is it Seon Ju or me?

209
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,329
It's me, you witch!

210
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,429
Honey.

211
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,000
What if he chooses me?

212
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,540
He was seeing you?

213
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,109
- It was you!
- Hey.

214
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,439
Get off her. What's wrong with you?

215
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:04,309
I saw "Jean" on his phone, and it was you.

216
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,520
Did you tell him I was his Choon Hyang
who supported his studies?

217
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,219
How could this be happening?

218
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:11,050
You're married too!

219
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,089
Wait.

220
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,160
When we met and called
each other's husbands. Did you...

221
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,530
call him over instead?

222
00:13:18,729 --> 00:13:21,030
- Don't do this.
- Get off me!

223
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:23,130
The disgusting perfume.

224
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,929
When we met at the police station,

225
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,439
I smelled it on you,
but I didn't realize that then.

226
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,770
We're near my office.
My colleagues might see us.

227
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:33,910
Are you afraid of that?

228
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,540
Good.

229
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,349
Let's go to your office.
I'll cause a scene there.

230
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:40,750
No. Let go of her.

231
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:43,290
Let's go talk somewhere else.

232
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,819
Why? Are you ashamed?

233
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:48,959
Yes. You wouldn't know that feeling,

234
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,390
but we know it well.

235
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,359
That's how different we are
and why he can't stand you.

236
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:56,030
We knew this was how you'd react.

237
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,469
It's so different
from what people usually do.

238
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:00,000
You're so vulgar.

239
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,370
I'm what?

240
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,309
- Honey.
- You must've expected this, then.

241
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,550
What? Is that unfair?

242
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,920
No.

243
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,660
Why would I think it was unfair
when I could get right back at you?

244
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,359
What? Didn't you expect this?

245
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,030
You should've expected this much
when you poured coffee on me!

246
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,599
Why you...

247
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:34,099
If you can't better your husband's future,
don't hold him back.

248
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,609
Life with you is like a muddy bog,

249
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,910
so he wants to live with me and fly high.
Let him go!

250
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,380
You shameless witch.

251
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,550
- This is what a mistress deserves.
- Hey!

252
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,479
- You had this coming!
- Stop it.

253
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:47,819
- Wait.
- Let go of me!

254
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,349
What got into you?

255
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,650
Why did you show up here?

256
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,990
Were you following me?

257
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,390
Yes. I was.

258
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,800
You went to such lengths to cover for her,

259
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,109
so I followed you to find out
what kind of woman she was!

260
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:11,939
You were seeing...

261
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:14,010
Jin Sang Ah?

262
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,109
Yes! He's seeing me, so do what you want.

263
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:19,979
Come to my workplace
and scream and do what you can.

264
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,420
I'll add defamation
to your existing charges.

265
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,620
I'm being extremely nice to you...

266
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,520
by not calling the police!

267
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,890
I'm all wet and I feel gross.

268
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,300
You can't go back like this.
Let's go to the studio apartment.

269
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,170
Jeon Nam Jin!

270
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:39,870
I got coffee on me too.

271
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,540
I got...

272
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:48,339
something way stickier on me.

273
00:15:48,609 --> 00:15:52,209
Why are you dressed up
when you don't have that important a job?

274
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:53,949
Go home and shower.

275
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:30,120
If you can't better your husband's future,
don't hold him back.

276
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,550
Life with you is like a muddy bog,

277
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,819
so he wants to live with me and fly high.
Let him go!

278
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:38,490
I'm all wet and I feel gross.

279
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,000
You can't go back like this.
Let's go to the studio apartment.

280
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,099
You look a bit unusual.

281
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,909
You got an art degree
and worked in interior design.

282
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:27,010
- Yes.
- Your first job lasted...

283
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,379
a month?

284
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,450
Jeil Interior Design was your second job.

285
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:34,450
You worked there for quite a while.

286
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:36,950
Why did you leave
your first job after a month?

287
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,190
A month after I joined,

288
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,260
they went bankrupt.

289
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:42,419
Oh, dear.

290
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,659
Hang on.

291
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,000
- Then...
- Thank you.

292
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:51,030
What about your second job?

293
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,940
They went bankrupt too.

294
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,710
So basically, once you join a company,

295
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,940
I stay until they go out of business.

296
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,579
Does that mean...

297
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:08,149
a company you join is likely to go bust?

298
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,190
No, that's not true.

299
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,819
Okay, that's fine.

300
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:14,419
Your resume...

301
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,790
The person in charge
will call to schedule an interview.

302
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,960
My previous boss said...

303
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,530
he talked to you
and that it was a done deal.

304
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:27,500
I met your boss just once at a sauna.

305
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:30,409
I said hello
because he was with another supplier.

306
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,379
He got excited when I said
we were looking for a designer.

307
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,849
There are many applicants other than you.

308
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:42,919
Most of them studied abroad
or have work experience at large firms.

309
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,050
Then are there...

310
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,690
any other openings?

311
00:18:47,889 --> 00:18:48,919
What?

312
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,230
Like...

313
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,760
moving heavy things around the office...

314
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,329
or running errands on site.

315
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,809
Doesn't a large firm like this
need people to do that too?

316
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:07,579
I really want to work here.

317
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,839
I must work here.

318
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,010
We hire cheap labor for that.

319
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,579
Why don't you ask at a temp agency, then?

320
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:19,020
The doors are closing.

321
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:34,369
Hello?

322
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:37,040
I rinsed it as best as I could.
Shall I hang it here?

323
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:38,639
Yes.

324
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,309
(Jin Sang Ah)

325
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:42,609
(Kim So Woo, Husband)

326
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,690
I think you should shower.

327
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,490
I guess I should.

328
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,790
(Kim So Woo, Husband)

329
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,760
- Shall I scrub you?
- No.

330
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:07,770
She's just crazy.

331
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:12,669
Hello.

332
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:17,109
I just interviewed a strange woman.

333
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,079
- I see.
- Bye, then.

334
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,240
Oh, my gosh.

335
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:52,180
Hey.

336
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,419
What just happened?

337
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,790
The door...

338
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:07,129
Hey.

339
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,329
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

340
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
What happened?

341
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,869
Did you bump into the door
as you passed by?

342
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:19,940
No.

343
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,780
Then why did it fall off?

344
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:24,480
Isn't it because...

345
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,819
you scraped it with your bike?

346
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,220
The door can't have moved
to get in your way.

347
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,849
I didn't bump into it.

348
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:34,220
I was nowhere near it.

349
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,889
- Really?
- Yes.

350
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,230
Then...

351
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,260
do you think you rode by so fast...

352
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,329
that you caused a gust of wind
that made it fall off?

353
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,470
You're kidding, right?

354
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,099
If a door falls off
because a bicycle goes by too fast,

355
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:51,909
that's not a car. It's a piece of paper.

356
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:53,010
Are you...

357
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,339
asking me to pay for repairs?

358
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,579
No, but perhaps...

359
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,710
we could share the responsibility?

360
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:02,879
I mean, share the pain?

361
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,089
What?

362
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:06,250
Can you help me?

363
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,790
Okay, then.

364
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:16,530
My gosh.

365
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,300
- Let's try again.
- Okay.

366
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,329
- Oh, dear.
- My gosh.

367
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,139
This isn't working.

368
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:28,079
Why is your car so...

369
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,750
I can't do it like this.
Can you turn around for a bit?

370
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,280
- What?
- Turn around and face that way.

371
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:37,720
- Okay.
- Thanks.

372
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,290
Why do I have to do this?

373
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,290
Goodness.

374
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,369
I'm done.

375
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:56,270
- Okay.
- You can look now.

376
00:22:56,669 --> 00:22:57,839
Let's try once more.

377
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,409
Okay, then.

378
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:01,010
- Ready?
- Ready.

379
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:03,040
- One, two, three.
- Three.

380
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:08,050
- Goodness. This door...
- Put it in place.

381
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,180
Okay.

382
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,550
Let's try again. One, two, three.

383
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,889
- Oh, dear.
- My gosh.

384
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:15,559
We can't handle this.

385
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:19,389
Let's see.

386
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:21,399
What on earth happened?

387
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,899
- My gosh.
- Get in.

388
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,869
- What?
- Get in.

389
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,399
- You want me to get in?
- Yes. Get in the car.

390
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:31,109
With a door like this, you want me to...

391
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,569
It's fine. Get in quickly.

392
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:35,040
Hurry up.

393
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,609
- Okay, then.
- Hop in.

394
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,450
Can I even ride in this?

395
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,980
- Drive safely or it'll fall off again.
- Okay.

396
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,290
Will the engine even start? It will.

397
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:47,089
- Hold on tight.
- Okay.

398
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,460
Slow down.

399
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,589
- Are you managing?
- Yes.

400
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,200
- Hey.
- What?

401
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,399
- You can keep going.
- You scared me just now.

402
00:23:58,399 --> 00:23:59,770
- Sorry.
- Hold on tight.

403
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,000
- I'm holding on tight.
- Keep a tight grip on it.

404
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,200
- Drive carefully and slowly.
- I will.

405
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,050
- Are you doing okay?
- Yes.

406
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,680
Are we there yet?

407
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,950
We're about ten minutes out.

408
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,349
- Ten minutes.
- Are your arms okay?

409
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:18,349
They're fine.

410
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,960
How can a car be this messed up?

411
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:23,290
I've never seen one like it.

412
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:25,690
This is a first for me too.

413
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,500
- Slow down.
- I am going slowly.

414
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,599
- Be careful.
- I'm driving really slowly.

415
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:31,430
No, I want you to go faster.

416
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,770
Can I really go faster?

417
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,069
- My arms are getting weak.
- No, not yet.

418
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:36,800
- Drive faster, then.
- Okay, I will.

419
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,309
- Please.
- I'll go fast but carefully.

420
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,510
How far do we have to go?

421
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:47,220
We're really almost there.

422
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:49,579
Is there a garage nearby?

423
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:51,450
There is. That's why I drove here.

424
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,990
My arms are about to fall off.

425
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,319
They won't fall off.
The door might, though.

426
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,059
- What?
- Hold on tight.

427
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,399
- Okay.
- We're here.

428
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,730
Stop.

429
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,500
This is just amazing.

430
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:11,109
You just want it to shut tight, right?

431
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:12,510
It needs to open too.

432
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,780
Oh, right.

433
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,740
It'll take about an hour.

434
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,079
What now?

435
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,079
I'll wait with you.

436
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,790
Once the door is fixed,
drive me back to where we were.

437
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,450
- Okay.
- Thanks.

438
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:28,159
We'll wait in the office.

439
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,490
Go ahead. Have a cup of coffee too.

440
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,490
- Thanks.
- Sure.

441
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,559
- Go that way.
- Let's go.

442
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,329
- Do your best work.
- I will.

443
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,800
There's so much tape.

444
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,869
- You can sit over here.
- Okay.

445
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:49,909
My gosh.

446
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,780
I can't serve you much.

447
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,220
I'll make you a cup of coffee.

448
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,750
At the boxing gym...

449
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,159
and here too,
you act like you own the place.

450
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:03,859
I got my car serviced here
for over ten years.

451
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:07,300
I'm half a customer and half the owner.

452
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,730
I see.

453
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,169
- Stir it a bit first.
- Thank you.

454
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,040
I'll sit over here.

455
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,680
This place looks a bit run down,
but they offer great service...

456
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,220
for the money.

457
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:30,690
I see.

458
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,220
I'm sorry, Seon Ju,
but my wife is in labor.

459
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,290
It's our third kid, so it won't take long.
Wait here a few hours...

460
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,790
or leave the car with me, okay?

461
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,200
The guy...

462
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,470
just left.

463
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,270
We should come back later, then.

464
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,470
Okay.

465
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,050
Hey.

466
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,750
That's odd.

467
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,319
Oh, no.

468
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,159
What's wrong? Won't the door open?

469
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:08,960
No.

470
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,659
- Let me try.
- Okay.

471
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Hey.

472
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,240
- It's locked.
- What?

473
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:22,899
What do we do?

474
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,440
- Shall we both try?
- Yes.

475
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:29,780
- It's really locked.
- It won't budge.

476
00:27:31,879 --> 00:27:33,079
- Oh, dear.
- Darn it.

477
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:34,579
- Hang on.
- Okay.

478
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,020
Why won't it...

479
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,230
Well...

480
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:47,329
Goodness.

481
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,099
Why won't it open?

482
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,710
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

483
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,690
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

484
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:20,530
They had the affair...

485
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,500
but called me out for not feeling ashamed.

486
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,470
My wife wants to pretend
everything is fine.

487
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,569
That crazy...

488
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,300
Mother. Have you seen Nam Jin recently?

489
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,309
He wants to leave me.

490
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,809
Will you really get divorced?

491
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:35,480
Did you have an interview
at Jin Architecture today?

492
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:38,250
The friend you were in the accident with.
Is it Mr. Jeon's wife?

493
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,450
