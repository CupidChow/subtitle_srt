00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:09,789
(Episode 65)

2
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:12,560
You're here this late
when the wedding is tomorrow?

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,560
When a couple is madly in love,

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,130
they'll travel around the world
for just a few minutes.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,569
Don't you know that?

6
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:22,040
Oh, really? Is that what this is?

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,269
Shall we bring out some fruit?

8
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:25,970
- Do we have fruit?
- No.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,070
Go and buy some, then.

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,139
No.

11
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,880
It's fine. I won't stay that long.

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,349
We might not have a house,
but we can afford some fruit.

13
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:38,790
Here.

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,650
Mom. You always mention the house...

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,990
when it has nothing to do with the matter.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,290
She's reminding us, that's all.

17
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:49,629
Look at your cheeks.
They're red because you were in the cold.

18
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:52,769
Dong Won, adjust the thermostat.

19
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:53,900
Okay.

20
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:59,040
You want us to wear thermal underwear
so we don't have to heat the house.

21
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,610
Look at you now.

22
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,979
A star son-in-law must be a huge deal.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,150
Hey. Are you crying?

24
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,419
Why... What's the matter?

25
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,190
We didn't say anything.

26
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,229
Why did you make him cry?

27
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:22,300
Yes.

28
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,229
Quit yapping and go.

29
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:26,729
Is it that hard to get some fruit
from around the corner?

30
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:28,729
- I'll go, then.
- No, don't.

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,900
I won't stay that long. It's fine.

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,070
What...

33
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:34,540
Oh, dear.

34
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,650
None of your girls are remarried,

35
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,419
and you got no news of your husband?

36
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,630
Are you going around digging into
people's painful past?

37
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,229
Yes.

38
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:59,229
They're all trying to pull a con.

39
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,100
Your family doesn't seem to know
about Dong Soo.

40
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,440
What if his dad
were to come looking for you?

41
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,440
She dare blackmail me?

42
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,529
Goodbye, then.

43
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,559
Woo Sang.

44
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:29,700
Thank you.

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,230
I'm sorry for everything.

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,599
Why would you apologize?
I should be thanking you.

47
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:39,039
She's a pretty face,

48
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,270
but she knows nothing about life.

49
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:43,539
She causes trouble sometimes,

50
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,510
but she has a good, kind heart.

51
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:48,849
I know that.

52
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:52,390
What we're about to do...

53
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,760
It weighs on me heavily.

54
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,930
Wouldn't it be nice if we could
tell your mother our flaws...

55
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,700
and have her accept us as we are?

56
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,170
But I'm such a coward.

57
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,869
She likes you so much,

58
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:13,309
and so I couldn't insist.

59
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,140
I know.

60
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:19,950
You came up with the idea
and we're going with it.

61
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,650
We're basically
hiding behind you and using you.

62
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:29,789
But I really want you to know
that I wanted to tell your mother...

63
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,529
the whole truth.

64
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,260
Okay.

65
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,529
I'm sorry we have so little.

66
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,200
I don't know...

67
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,539
where the girls will find fake husbands,

68
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:45,809
but let me...

69
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,510
take full responsibility for this, okay?

70
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,809
Take good care...

71
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,309
of my daughter for me.

72
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,819
I will. I'm sorry.

73
00:03:58,619 --> 00:03:59,990
Mom.

74
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:04,260
How will you get through...

75
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,059
the tough world
if you're so weak at heart?

76
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,559
Walk him to his car and come right home.

77
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,629
I'll see you tomorrow.

78
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,270
Goodbye. Get home safely.

79
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,170
- It's cold. Go inside.
- Get going.

80
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,500
It's not that cold tonight.

81
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,000
It's not.

82
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,739
Hang on.

83
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:06,390
I'll be really good to you.

84
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,560
You treat me well enough already.

85
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,320
What more will you do for me?

86
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,260
I'd caused nothing but disasters so far.

87
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:19,830
I think I did something good this time.

88
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,229
My place in the family shot up.

89
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:25,070
It's like they forgot
they sold the house because of me.

90
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:28,270
All your past hardships...

91
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:30,279
and the wrongful treatment you suffered.

92
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,849
I can't make it go away,

93
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,080
but I'll treat you well...

94
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:38,049
and heal you from that.

95
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,190
Will that do?

96
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,630
I love you.

97
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,039
Hey, who's that?

98
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,049
Isn't that
the troublemaker third daughter?

99
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,150
Who's the guy she's with?

100
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,279
I can't see his face.

101
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,880
My gosh.

102
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,349
What on earth are they doing?

103
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,529
Auntie Mi Ju was grinning from ear to ear.

104
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,729
She was.

105
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,200
Did Dad leave?

106
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:31,739
Yes.

107
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:34,140
Nam Jin was here? What for?

108
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,080
Well,

109
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,609
I guess he missed Ji Hyun.

110
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,609
My gosh. I find that hard to believe.

111
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,750
Dear sisters.

112
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,349
What?

113
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,190
Shall I sleep with you tonight?

114
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,630
Ji Hyun, will you sleep with Grandma?

115
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,099
Yes, of course, I will.

116
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,400
- Are you that happy?
- Yes.

117
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,039
Mr. Jeong and I
have so many great memories.

118
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:14,109
When you asked
when I fell in love with him,

119
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:15,779
I couldn't really answer,

120
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,219
but there were many moments.

121
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,989
When did you feel butterflies?

122
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:21,120
Well...

123
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,919
When he said I looked like a cross
between Jun Ji Hyun and Kim Tae Hee.

124
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:27,989
Hey, that was because
he was cross-eyed or something.

125
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:29,960
If he said that about you,

126
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,760
he'd have fainted when he saw us.

127
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,299
No. He really said that.

128
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:37,599
He's a really cool guy.

129
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,810
He looked out for me
like it was his second nature.

130
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,150
You're a member of my team.

131
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,989
And very competent.

132
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:57,359
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

133
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,130
He believes in me and trusts me.

134
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:01,859
Watch out.

135
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:02,960
He helps me.

136
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,359
- Let's go.
- And consoles me.

137
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:10,969
He's great at putting up a wall
when people poke and prod.

138
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,739
You're head over heels in love.

139
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,640
He gave me a job and let me stay with him.

140
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,049
Would you like to...

141
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,080
work with me instead of...

142
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,120
Ms. Jin starting tomorrow?

143
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:27,390
Before I knew it,

144
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,260
- that's how...
- Let's do our best. Cheers.

145
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,560
- my love for him grew.
- Cheers.

146
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:35,589
To be honest, I liked him from the start,

147
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,270
but I thought he and I could never be.

148
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:42,840
I pushed down my feelings...

149
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,400
to stop myself from falling for him.

150
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:58,250
- Let's see.
- Wait.

151
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,720
But I enjoyed every day I spent with him.

152
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:09,659
Every single day I was with him.

153
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,150
So when he said we should marry,

154
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:38,120
I thought he'd blurted it out
because he was arguing with his mom.

155
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,760
But I still loved it.

156
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,760
Goodness.

157
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,630
Even I think that's cool.

158
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:52,770
What's up with you?

159
00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:56,079
Oh, it's nothing.

160
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,679
He seems like a nice guy.

161
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,650
Enough to make me think...

162
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,419
if I should've looked for someone
to bring to the wedding.

163
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,549
That's how nice I think he is.

164
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:10,459
So live happily ever after.

165
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:16,000
Seon Ju. Whatever I did,
I'll make it up to you...

166
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,059
by living happily from now on.

167
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,699
You can both hit me once.

168
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:24,100
Then let's say we're even.

169
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:26,069
Okay, then.

170
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,470
Live happily,

171
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,709
you brat.

172
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,539
One, two, three.

173
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:34,909
My gosh.

174
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:43,620
Hello. You came outside.

175
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,159
Yes. I have a lot to think about
and I can't fall asleep.

176
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:51,529
I see.

177
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,799
I thought so.

178
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:56,600
What are you doing out here?

179
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:00,209
I was weighing things out.

180
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,709
What do you mean?

181
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:03,709
The favor your sister asked of me.

182
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:06,449
Tell her I'll do it.

183
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,510
You will?

184
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
I overheard your mother...

185
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,720
talk to Mr. Jeong before he left.

186
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,360
I felt quite...

187
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,689
I'm a father too,

188
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:23,760
and I'd feel bad if I ignored your plight.

189
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,770
Is that how you felt?

190
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,169
Oh, right.

191
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:31,799
Take this.

192
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,110
My gosh.

193
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:39,809
I don't think we should have it.

194
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,980
Okay.

195
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:44,980
Good night, then.

196
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:47,520
Bye.

197
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,380
Does Pi Seon Ju...

198
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,539
appeal to you as a woman?

199
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,579
He didn't answer right away.

200
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,299
What's up with you?

201
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:32,929
Will alcohol help?

202
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,699
My gosh.

203
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:37,699
What can I do, then?

204
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:40,110
Think of a way to get back at them.

205
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:44,179
Should I tell the press...

206
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:45,740
about Woo Sang's secret wedding?

207
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:53,090
Girls. We need to talk.

208
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:02,490
I met with Ms. Oh.

209
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:05,799
She has no idea what kind of family...

210
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:07,569
Woo Sang's in-laws are.

211
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,939
- She doesn't?
- No.

212
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,970
She thinks the girl's dad works abroad,

213
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,069
and that her older sisters
are both happily married.

214
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:19,179
She believes
they're an ordinary, happy family.

215
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:20,279
Are they?

216
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,510
They're not.

217
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,049
Did they lie to her?

218
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:24,079
My gosh.

219
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,750
She doesn't know
they're the family of frauds...

220
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,650
that caused a scene at Mom's salon, right?

221
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,120
Ms. Oh wouldn't let her son
marry that girl if she knew.

222
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,730
Let's tell her everything
before the wedding.

223
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,529
Will the husbands be there tomorrow?

224
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:38,059
Yes.

225
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,929
If they haven't gotten remarried,

226
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:42,130
they'll find fake husbands to join them.

227
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,270
This is actual premeditated fraud.

228
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,740
I'll be your husband if you want.

229
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:51,079
Well, I have plans for tomorrow.

230
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:55,980
Like Chu Ah said,
should we tip off the press...

231
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:59,020
or tell Ms. Oh
before the wedding starts...

232
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,449
to stop it from...

233
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:01,490
No.

234
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,360
- We should all go.
- Go where?

235
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,360
It's no fun to tip anyone off.

236
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,559
Instead of talking to someone,

237
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:12,929
let's see for ourselves
if they put on a con,

238
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:15,569
and if you're right,
let's put a stop to the wedding.

239
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:17,039
We weren't invited.

240
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,340
Do we just barge in?

241
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:23,610
What? You're not up for it, Mom?

242
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:25,980
Are you okay with that?

243
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,650
Pi Seon Ju and her family will be there.

244
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,279
So what?

245
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,590
We have a few uncomfortable reasons...

246
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,520
to want to stay away from that family.

247
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:40,429
For example, you stole Nam Jin.

248
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:42,959
I see Seon Ju every day anyway.

249
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,130
It's fine. Most of those who know me
know that I cheated.

250
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:47,529
You're awesome.

251
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,199
Your family doesn't seem to know
about Dong Soo.

252
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:52,439
What if his dad
were to come looking for you?

253
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,140
She won't bring that up, will she?

254
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,179
What's wrong?

255
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,110
You're not up for it?

256
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,549
It's not that. You're right.

257
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:06,490
If we can't have it,
we must make sure no one can.

258
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,350
We can't sit and watch
as someone else takes it.

259
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,620
(Han Hair Line)

260
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,159
My gosh.

261
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:46,730
You look beautiful like this.

262
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:48,630
Because I'm your daughter.

263
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,559
Let's do the other side.

264
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,140
You want to overwhelm them...

265
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,510
with your look and presence.

266
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:06,549
You're right.
She'll be in her full bridal makeup.

267
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,079
Make me look amazing
so I look just as good.

268
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,679
I will.

269
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,189
You look great.

270
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,720
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

271
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:20,829
Really?

272
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,199
It was scheduled so suddenly?

273
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:26,770
Where is it at?

274
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,470
Okay. I'll see you later.

275
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,439
Honey, today...

276
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,909
Are you all going somewhere?

277
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,549
Yes. The three of us
decided to have a ladies' day out.

278
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:45,880
All together?

279
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,449
- Where to?
- An art gallery and...

280
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,559
A concert.

281
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:54,329
We only got three tickets each...

282
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,860
because we thought you'd be busy. Sorry.

283
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,000
It's fine.

284
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,400
I was going to invite you to a gathering.

285
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:02,370
Have fun.

286
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,169
Okay, sorry. See you later.

287
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,270
Bye.

288
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,550
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yes.

289
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,290
Where to? You're all dressed up.

290
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,650
I won't be out for long.

291
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:27,189
You're not going somewhere nice
without me, are you?

292
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,689
Goodness.

293
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:34,800
Kyung Ae will come for you a bit later...

294
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,540
to take you to an indoor play area.

295
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,870
Have fun and don't get hurt.

296
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,870
Okay.

297
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,209
My gosh.

298
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,540
You look awesome today.

299
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,810
- Doesn't he?
- What?

300
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,080
Yes, he looks nice.

301
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:50,979
Dad. Ms. Pi is pretty too.

302
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,189
She is.

303
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,419
If you're ready, I'll bring my car over.

304
00:17:57,489 --> 00:17:59,320
- Let's go together.
- Okay.

305
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,759
I'm ready too.

306
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,159
Let's get going.

307
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,999
Let's go.

308
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:08,729
- You look great.
- Let's go.

309
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,870
Watch your step.

310
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,269
- Do you need help?
- My gosh.

311
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:15,610
But I live here.

312
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:17,840
- See you later.
- Bye.

313
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,780
My husband's name is Gang Dan Myeong.

314
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,890
We met at a publishing house
and dated for three years before marriage.

315
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,219
If he were alive, he'd be 45 now.

316
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,659
Gang Dan Myeong, aged 45,

317
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:33,659
met at a publishing house,
and dated for three years.

318
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:34,790
- That's right.
- Okay.

319
00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:40,630
Hey. Get in here.

320
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:45,300
Even if the old hag catches and fights me,

321
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,469
I'd rather die alongside you
than on my own.

322
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:50,380
Look. My legs are shaking.

323
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,380
You idiot.

324
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,850
Yes. If you're committing a crime,
it's better to do it with someone.

325
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:57,620
Let's go inside.

326
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:02,249
- It's this way.
- Okay.

327
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,100
It looks like no one is home.

328
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:16,769
Leave what you took
and find what you came for.

329
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:17,769
Okay.

330
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:22,610
Oh, no. I didn't bring it with me.

331
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:24,880
How could you forget to bring that?

332
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,310
Stupid me.

333
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,080
Whatever.

334
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,949
Darn it.

335
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:35,949
What should I do?

336
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,519
I don't think this is Seon Ju's room.

337
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:41,189
Guys. Shall we just play at home?

338
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,630
Why was the indoor playground closed?

339
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:45,659
I don't know.

340
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:48,729
What do we do? Someone is coming.

341
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,999
- What do we say if we're caught?
- What?

342
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,370
Do we say I thought I lived here?

343
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,509
No.

344
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,409
Say I missed Ji Hyun?

345
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:58,040
Yes, that would be best.

346
00:19:58,179 --> 00:19:59,209
Okay.

347
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,650
Kids. Are you okay being on your own?

348
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,749
- Yes.
- Are you?

349
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,350
I'll go home, then.

350
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,419
I wonder how
Auntie Mi Ju's wedding is going.

351
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,630
I'd have liked to go too. What about you?

352
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,229
They're putting on a play.

353
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,830
They wouldn't want to do that
in front of us.

354
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:23,199
They don't seem to get that we understand.

355
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:26,469
Why is Auntie Mi Ju
marrying someone that famous?

356
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:29,340
I can't even brag
that Jeong Woo Sang is my uncle.

357
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:31,209
Dong Won.

358
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:34,080
Out of us three,
you lived with one parent for the longest.

359
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,350
- What's it like?
- What do you mean?

360
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,150
What do you hate the most about it?

361
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:40,120
Don't ask.

362
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,790
What's wrong?

363
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,689
Grandma.

364
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,600
Ji Hyun.

365
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,699
How did you get in?

366
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:57,800
What?

367
00:20:57,969 --> 00:21:00,739
I came over because I missed you.

368
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,380
Even so, you can't come inside like this.

369
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,840
You took these two
without telling anyone and...

370
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,850
Hey. That was no big deal.

371
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,509
A grandma can see her grandchild.

372
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,179
How dare you talk back at me?

373
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:15,550
Is your auntie marrying Jeong Woo Sang?

374
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,860
Well...

375
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:20,759
What did you really come here for?

376
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:23,929
I said I came here
because I missed Ji Hyun.

377
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,400
Seon Ju would make a fuss
if I called to ask,

378
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:28,499
so I just came over.

379
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:30,840
What if we didn't come home?

380
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:34,239
We meet if we can and not if we can't.

381
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:36,370
I got to see you, so I'll go now.

382
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:38,580
Come on out.

383
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,709
Hi, kids.

384
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:47,320
Who is that woman?

385
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:56,860
The jobless girl
is marrying Jeong Woo Sang?

386
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,159
How come?

387
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:02,130
Is it really the Jeong Woo Sang we know?

388
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:03,739
You heard them.

389
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:06,169
What's happening?

390
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:08,110
My gosh.

391
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,810
The only lie I tell...

392
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,949
is that I should die
because I'm sick and tired.

393
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,449
I'm really nervous about this.

394
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,620
But since we're doing it,
let's do a good job.

395
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,620
Come on.

396
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,060
- One, two. Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

397
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,360
Let's sit down.

398
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,429
- Mom, you sit here.
- Okay.

399
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,130
- Honey, you sit here.
- Okay.

400
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,669
Are you free after this?

401
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,429
My gosh.

402
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:39,699
- Thanks.
- You look amazing.

403
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,979
Shall we check the menu?

404
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:47,780
What do they have?

405
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,850
What do you want?

406
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:56,249
They're here.

407
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,719
- Hello.
- Hello.

408
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:01,290
No. Please stay seated.

409
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,370
You look lovely, Mi Ju.

410
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,939
Thank you.

411
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,280
I'm so pleased to welcome
a great young man into my family.

412
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:24,620
I guess I'm being blessed
for living an honest life.

413
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,280
Do you think so?

414
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,919
I was a huge fan of yours.

415
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:29,949
Oh, my gosh.

416
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,989
My mother was a massive fan of yours,
and she was overjoyed...

417
00:23:33,989 --> 00:23:36,560
to be connected to you by marriage.

418
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,630
Was she?

419
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,169
Are you the eldest daughter?

420
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:42,130
Yes. It's a pleasure to meet you.

421
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:47,439
Hello. I'm Woo Sang's older brother,
Jeong Tae Sang.

422
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:48,570
- Hello.
- Hello.

423
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,739
And you are...

424
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,340
I'm...

425
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:55,209
He's my eldest daughter's husband.

426
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:58,850
People had been telling me
he was handsome,

427
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,150
but I didn't see it
because he was my son-in-law.

428
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,790
Today I finally realize the truth.

429
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,159
He's good-looking, isn't he?

430
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:08,689
Yes, he is.

431
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,229
If you're all here, shall we...

432
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:13,159
start with the official introduction?

433
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:18,239
Where's the middle son-in-law?

434
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,409
I apologize.

435
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:23,640
My husband is on a business trip and...

436
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,840
Hello.

437
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:26,979
Hey, Nam Jin...

438
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:30,650
Sorry, Mi Ju.

439
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,080
I'm sorry I'm late.

440
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,219
I'm the second brother-in-law,
Jeon Nam Jin.

441
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,269
You're sitting over there?

442
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,769
Yes.

443
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,110
Your other brother-in-law is handsome too.

444
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:03,479
If you don't mind,
can I rush to the ladies'?

445
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,150
Come with me.

446
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,850
Okay.

447
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:09,249
Excuse me as well.

448
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:14,590
I guess married couples
go to the toilet together.

449
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,959
Right, honey?

450
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,300
Yes, I guess?

451
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,300
Is he a fake too?

452
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,400
No. He actually was my brother-in-law.

453
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,150
My gosh.

454
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:37,380
What are you doing here?

455
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,919
I was invited and came over to help out.

456
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,019
When did I ask for your help?
I clearly said I didn't need it.

457
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:44,759
That was not what Mi Ju said.

458
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,489
- She thanked me.
- What?

459
00:25:46,489 --> 00:25:50,060
She pleaded because she wanted to
get married so badly.

460
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,030
I couldn't ignore it.

461
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,199
Don't you see how your sister feels?

462
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:57,900
It's her wedding day. Think only of her.

463
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,540
Pi Mi Ju, that brat.

464
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,570
Your mother seemed to be pleased...

465
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,009
that I came to fill a seat.

466
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:06,310
She's not pleased! Who's pleased?

467
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:07,509
Keep it down.

468
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,679
Let's go back inside.

469
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,219
They'll be thinking something is off.

470
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:13,719
Be quiet.

471
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,590
Since you're all here,

472
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,259
shall we eat?

473
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,900
Yes, let's do that.

474
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:27,969
Mr. Jeon, you're an architect?

475
00:26:28,229 --> 00:26:29,570
Yes, I am.

476
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:32,340
It would've been nice
if Mi Ju's father were here.

477
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,870
It's a shame.

478
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:36,610
Yes. It's peak tuna season,

479
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,409
and he couldn't spare the time.

480
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,110
Right, darling?

481
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,709
Yes, right.

482
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:45,320
You're so polite to each other
even though you're a young couple.

483
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,090
It's because they're so close.

484
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:53,320
I'm jealous to death, Brother-in-law.

485
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,360
You shock me with your audacity, Nam Jin.

486
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:08,269
- How about a drink?
- Woo Sang.

487
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:10,110
- Are you okay with that?
- Something is off.

488
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,580
Are you sure they're a happy family?

489
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,880
Yes. You know how...

490
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,320
some families are tense but close.

491
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,590
Why do I only feel tension
and no closeness?

492
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,650
I wonder.

493
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,759
Did you find the wrong guy?

494
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,259
What does that mean?

495
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,830
Can you not cause a scene?

496
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:32,560
Anyway,

497
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,130
both brothers-in-law are handsome
and seem to be decent men.

498
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:37,870
I'm pleased about that.

499
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,199
My gosh.

500
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:42,169
You shouldn't praise us
when you have sons like yours.

501
00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:44,239
I'm flattered.

502
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:48,150
Honey. Dig in.

503
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,449
Hey.

504
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,179
Why is your face so red?

505
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,419
Are you warm?

506
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:55,850
How about a toast, then?

507
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,560
- Yes, good idea.
- Shall we?

508
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,159
We'll cut the cake after the toast.

509
00:28:00,189 --> 00:28:03,189
Mr. Jang. Take some photos.

510
00:28:03,189 --> 00:28:04,560
I am.

511
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,630
Cheers, everyone.

512
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,630
To the bride and groom!

513
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,969
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

514
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:11,140
Wait!

515
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:40,060
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

516
00:28:56,249 --> 00:28:58,019
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

517
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,280
Both brothers-in-law are fakes.

518
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,019
One is my brother-in-law...

519
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:04,390
and one is my sister's lover.

520
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,229
Seon Ju. I'm bleeding.

521
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,729
Did you lose the baby, then?

522
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,530
Did I steal your husband?

523
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,100
You stole mine.

524
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,999
Whatever con we pull,

525
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:17,900
we don't deserve to be told off by you!

526
