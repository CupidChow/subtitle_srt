1
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:16,700
I should tell her this before I go.

2
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,610
The silk nightdress was mine.

3
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:31,410
Nam Jin packed it by mistake
after we met up.

4
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,549
Did you think it was a gift?

5
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,849
So what? Did you enjoy it?

6
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,990
This is just hilarious.

7
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,879
(Episode 28)

8
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,150
How could a car explode?

9
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:17,660
It's just amazing.

10
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:23,759
What?

11
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:25,930
Do you feel bad
you left her standing there?

12
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,529
There's no going back now.

13
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:28,969
You do feel bad.

14
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:33,669
I still chose you in front of Seon Ju.

15
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,779
Should I be understanding
that you're upset about what happened?

16
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,080
You need to keep up.

17
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,380
You said you wouldn't let your kid
drag you down. End it soon.

18
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,949
You couldn't have ended it today
if I hadn't shown up.

19
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,759
Don't worry about my family.
I'll handle them.

20
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,460
How?

21
00:01:57,559 --> 00:02:01,400
So Woo said he'd help with
the Hansung HQ remodeling project.

22
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:03,639
Dad gave me the project to test my skills,

23
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:05,770
but it's massive
and a bit too much for me alone.

24
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,380
So Woo is pointlessly thorough
and checks every detail for himself.

25
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,949
If we win the bid for the project,
I'll secure the promotion.

26
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,210
If your husband helps you win the bid,

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,080
won't it become harder to leave him?

28
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,490
Don't you know me by now?

29
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:25,059
Let's be honest. Won't the company
be yours even if you don't get promoted?

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,529
Do we have to worry that much
about your father?

31
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:31,330
You think my dad will leave me everything
because I'm his daughter?

32
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,270
No way.

33
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:34,700
What about your mother?

34
00:02:35,469 --> 00:02:36,999
She's always on my side.

35
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:39,110
Just wait.

36
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:42,210
Once things at work settle down,
I'll talk to my mom.

37
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:43,909
Then Dad will be easy prey.

38
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,080
He always gives in to Mom.

39
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,849
The end is in sight.

40
00:02:58,289 --> 00:02:59,529
Pi Seon Ju.

41
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:02,260
Are you challenging me to a fight?

42
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,439
You don't need to pack a lot of clothes.

43
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,210
We'll pack your toothbrush tomorrow.

44
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,849
- Is that everything?
- Yes.

45
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:23,680
Why won't you go with us?

46
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,020
Well,

47
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,219
that's because this trip is
for you and Mom to make memories.

48
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,189
I wish you'd come too.

49
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:35,129
You and I have made
many special memories already.

50
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,999
If you spend time with Mom,

51
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,069
you'll be able to make...

52
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,430
some special secret memories.

53
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:45,439
I'll listen to this with Mom.

54
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:48,069
Do you want to? Okay.

55
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,080
(Manjang Kindergarten)

56
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:59,589
Have a good day.

57
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:09,730
What is it?

58
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,260
(Manjang Kindergarten)

59
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,270
Mom.

60
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:13,999
What?

61
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:17,900
I know you keep trying
until something works out,

62
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:21,610
but if it's too hard on you,
it's okay to give up.

63
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,210
What do you mean?

64
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:33,049
You said you couldn't always be
on the exact same page as your friend.

65
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:36,760
But if you have a friend
who you always fight with all the time,

66
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:38,760
it's okay to stop trying.

67
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,789
Are you saying...

68
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,560
Mom and Dad can break up?

69
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:49,940
I'm fine with it. Do whatever you want.

70
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:53,210
Don't put up with it for me.

71
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,049
(Manjang Kindergarten)

72
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,919
I can't stand Pi Mi Ju.

73
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:13,489
I might go mad because of her.

74
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,760
- What is it now?
- I hate everything about her.

75
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,229
We shot a fight scene,

76
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,630
and she hit me so hard she left a scar.
Do you see it?

77
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:24,070
- I don't.
- Darn you.

78
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,839
She spends too much time around Woo Sang.

79
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,539
I don't like that either.

80
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:32,279
I want her gone, but she keeps showing up.

81
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,380
Why worry about losing a man
to someone like that?

82
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:37,049
You're such a loser.

83
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:40,989
Hey. Won't you do something
about her sister who looks down on you?

84
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,219
Get back at her for me.

85
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,029
Her big sister will get divorced soon.

86
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:52,570
Mr. Jeon made up his mind last night.

87
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:55,330
No way. What will you do, then?

88
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:57,370
I should do the same.

89
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,270
They'll get divorced first.
I can take my time.

90
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,849
You really do what you said you would.

91
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,950
Be quiet.

92
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,620
What were you talking about?

93
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,520
Nothing.

94
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:13,919
Is this all you're taking?

95
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:15,219
Yes.

96
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,060
Aren't you too tired to drive?

97
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,760
- I feel fine.
- Did you book a suite?

98
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,729
What? Oh, yes.

99
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,570
Good. I was worried you'd forgotten.

100
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:29,700
Here. These are Tae Ri's stuff.

101
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,669
Play this for him if he gets tired
from the long car ride.

102
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,140
Okay.

103
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:38,440
Are you leaving on a trip with Tae Ri?

104
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,849
You must be excited, Tae Ri.

105
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,080
Aren't you going with them?

106
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:47,150
I have some stuff to do
including checking out a site.

107
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,150
Do you?

108
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:50,859
- Will you be back tomorrow?
- Yes.

109
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:53,390
Work hard on the Hansung project
when you get back.

110
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:55,489
So many places want that deal.

111
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:58,099
Sang Ah knows what to do.

112
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,169
Everything is going as planned.

113
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:02,029
Let's go.

114
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:03,299
Come along.

115
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:06,010
See you.

116
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:10,580
Get up. Jeong Woo Sang.

117
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:13,080
Leave me alone.

118
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:16,279
I really should just make a post.

119
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,489
"My son is so hard to wake up."

120
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,359
Is this how it's done?

121
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:32,469
I'm up.

122
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,099
That actually worked.

123
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,469
Hey.

124
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,339
How was I yesterday?

125
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,270
- What do you mean?
- My special appearance.

126
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,839
The nice girl said I was awesome.

127
00:07:45,109 --> 00:07:46,279
What did you think?

128
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,380
Well, your acting was so-so,

129
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,820
and the yaksik was pretty good.

130
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,250
- That's it.
- What?

131
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,919
Your acting was best when you pretended
to have made the yaksik.

132
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,429
Is that how you talk to your own mom?

133
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:04,029
Is it so hard to say that I was decent?

134
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:06,429
You know you have
a checkup next week, right?

135
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,500
- Yes.
- Come down for breakfast.

136
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,739
I cooked some sea eel.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,070
Kim Soo Bin.

138
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,270
We went over it so many times.

139
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:18,339
"I won't live like you did, Mom."

140
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:20,609
"I'll have a nice job,
make lots of money,"

141
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:22,580
"marry into a rich family,
and have a great life!"

142
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,020
Can't you memorize that?

143
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:27,450
Other kids memorize
much harder and longer scripts!

144
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,960
Oh, no. Look at you!

145
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,289
- How could you?
- Ma'am.

146
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:38,099
She can't memorize the script
not because she doesn't want to.

147
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:39,729
Who are you?

148
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,230
I'm on the filming crew.

149
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,270
She's scared.

150
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,110
Memorizing is even harder
if you're scared.

151
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,880
Do something about her outfit first.

152
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,510
Wait while I get some clothes
from the car.

153
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,750
You're useless.

154
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,959
Soo Bin. Filming is hard, isn't it?

155
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,799
You have to wait for hours and hours,

156
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:15,829
and you get hungry.

157
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,610
So you have no choice
but to keep drinking soda,

158
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,140
and it makes you want to pee so often.

159
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,110
Doesn't it?

160
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,409
Who are you?

161
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:29,250
Well...

162
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:33,890
The number one fan of Kim Soo Bin
who'll become a huge star?

163
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,559
All this is because you're low on sugar.

164
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,470
Here, you can have this.
Don't forget your lines again.

165
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:49,770
Okay?

166
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,740
The blackmailer
has a sweet and gentle side?

167
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:57,539
Come on in.

168
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:00,610
- My gosh.
- It's lovely.

169
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,220
Oh, come on.

170
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,390
Have you never been inside
an expensive apartment? Take a seat.

171
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,360
Wang Yeon Ae.

172
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,419
You bragged about
being pretty successful back in the day.

173
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:14,630
Did you dig up an old gold bar?

174
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:16,000
No.

175
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,459
Did you win the lottery?

176
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:21,900
Don't say that.
I don't wish for or rely on pure luck.

177
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:25,439
- My son bought me the place.
- My gosh.

178
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,939
Ms. Pi. Can you sandpaper
the banister over there?

179
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,250
- Okay.
- Thanks.

180
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,789
Seon Ju.

181
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:49,429
What?

182
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,230
I was serious when I said...

183
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:54,329
we should break up.

184
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:55,429
So what?

185
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:58,169
The longer it takes,
the worse we'll both feel.

186
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:00,709
Finalizing this so you can settle down...

187
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,740
is best for you and Ji Hyun...

188
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,880
You're so darn considerate.

189
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:06,579
If you were a bit more caring,

190
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:09,850
you'd put me in despair by saying
my life wasn't worth living.

191
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,319
- Seon Ju.
- What?

192
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,949
Let's break up.

193
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:17,860
I'll do as you ask.
Bring the papers when they're ready.

194
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,090
Where are you? I'll come right now.

195
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,829
Right now? My gosh.

196
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,829
- That should...
- Someone is here.

197
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:29,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

198
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,740
It's a pleasure to meet you.

199
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,439
I'm Team Leader Kim So Woo
from Jin Architecture.

200
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,750
Team Leader Kim So Woo?

201
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,610
I was expecting Ms. Jin Sang Ah.

202
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,419
She's still in charge of the project.

203
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:47,390
She is busy, so I'm here in her place.

204
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,159
I see. Take a seat.

205
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,189
Thanks.

206
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:00,169
- Our current situation is...
- Yes.

207
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:04,370
Your company grew a great deal,
and you bought the building next door.

208
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:06,110
Yes.

209
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:08,809
With that money,
we could've built a new HQ.

210
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,140
The chairman succeeded in this spot,

211
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:14,579
so he didn't want to leave.

212
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:18,079
Yes. We're expanding
to a neighboring building,

213
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,750
and it made the flow
of human traffic awkward.

214
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,789
And some people think
it feels like they're getting kicked out.

215
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,860
I see.

216
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,490
Then how about you do this?

217
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,559
Show him.

218
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,409
(Doily Water Mansion: Fully Booked)

219
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,120
Let's eat first.

220
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,029
Ms. Pi. Let's eat out
instead of ordering delivery.

221
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,199
I'll buy you something nice and hot.

222
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:10,840
- Will you?
- Yes.

223
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,480
You go ahead. I'll have lunch a bit later.

224
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:22,079
Okay.

225
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,860
You zoomed over in no time
when I said I'd do as you said.

226
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,579
It's tasty food. Eat.

227
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,020
You put in my details for me too?

228
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,990
How sweet.

229
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,600
Did you have this much time to kill?

230
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,069
What did you...

231
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,740
like about her?

232
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:22,770
You and I...

233
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,079
aren't a good match. That's all.

234
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,720
How were we such a bad match? Tell me.

235
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:32,890
Why can't you be cool about it?

236
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,789
Lots of couples get divorced.

237
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:38,459
The more we fight,
the muddier things become.

238
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:40,829
No.

239
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:44,559
I'll give you a clean break,
so talk to me.

240
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,169
I'm really curious.

241
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,000
What do you like about her
that you don't care...

242
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,299
about your own kid?

243
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:18,799
Are we going to the seaside now?

244
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,779
You left us standing...

245
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:34,510
in the restaurant parking lot.

246
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:36,380
Didn't you wonder...

247
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,150
if Ji Hyun was okay?

248
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,319
If it's too much for you,

249
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,220
I'll raise Ji Hyun.

250
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,360
No. Did I say it was too much?
It's not hard at all.

251
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,890
I survived being your wife.

252
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,799
How could raising my kid be hard work?

253
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,799
If she lives with you,
she'll end up just as selfish.

254
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,100
I might be stupid enough
to get stabbed in the back,

255
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,140
but I'd rather she ended up like me.

256
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,870
You asked why we weren't a good match.

257
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:05,039
I hate the way you talk.
It's crass and vulgar, like thug talk.

258
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,179
You go out in public dressed like...

259
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:08,949
No, you barely even dress up.

260
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:12,179
You look like a woman
who's half out of her mind...

261
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,650
Stop.

262
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:18,590
- What?
- "Stop."

263
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,559
Your pronunciation is terrible.

264
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,500
Right.

265
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,340
I have a question.

266
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,909
In the restaurant parking lot.

267
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:39,909
Did you ever wonder who to pick?

268
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:42,179
For a split second,

269
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,520
I did wonder.

270
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,650
But I realized something
the moment I saw your car blow up.

271
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,459
If I were to stay with you,

272
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,959
that was exactly how we'd end up.

273
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,270
There were signs.

274
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,270
There were so many hints and signals.

275
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,209
You'd been preparing to jump ship
and were just fishing for an excuse.

276
00:17:15,249 --> 00:17:18,150
- That's not true.
- The award you won in the US.

277
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:22,189
You said you didn't tell me
because you thought I'd make a fuss.

278
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,429
You kept the truth from me.

279
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:30,800
You didn't want us to know
how renowned you were.

280
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:32,159
Don't jump to conclusions.

281
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,429
You'd agreed to work at...

282
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:36,900
Jin Sang Ah's family firm
before you'd even flown in,

283
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:40,070
then didn't tell me
saying you were still looking for work.

284
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:44,310
You were already gradually planning
and thinking of...

285
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:48,050
how to break up
thoroughly and meticulously.

286
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,280
It's not like that.

287
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,850
Whether it's greed or lust,

288
00:17:52,719 --> 00:17:54,550
is it really better...

289
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,060
to leave your family than give up on it?

290
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,330
I'm doing this because this is easier...

291
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,999
than denying myself.

292
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,840
So this is what it feels like...

293
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,209
to be utterly sick of someone.

294
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,019
(Coast nearest to Seoul)

295
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,050
Darn it.

296
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,969
As you know,

297
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,900
I have no assets.

298
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,409
There's nothing to split.

299
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:52,439
Don't sue Sang Ah for compensation...

300
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,209
just because she has...

301
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,350
a rich family.

302
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,550
Why not?

303
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,919
If you agree not to,
I'll back down without...

304
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:04,790
fighting you for custody.

305
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:08,790
If you fight me, do you think you'll win?

306
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,699
Regardless of the result,

307
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,729
I could harass you...

308
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,830
with a lawsuit.

309
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:17,300
But...

310
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,810
I'm doing this for you.

311
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:23,009
Because I trust you'll raise Ji Hyun well.

312
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,780
You're making me laugh a lot today.

313
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,550
My gosh.

314
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,650
Thanks so much
for your vote of confidence.

Nam Jin.

317
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:51,499
You'll regret this.

318
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,840
(Pi Seon Ju, Signature)

319
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,850
Here.

320
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:06,550
Great.

321
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,590
Shall we...

322
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,890
hand this in?

323
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:19,330
Do you have your ID?

324
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:21,870
Ms. Pi, this room...

325
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,570
Boss. I'm going out for a bit...

326
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,269
to get divorced.

327
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,310
What?

328
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,979
As I explained,

329
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,790
we can connect two floors
with a sky bridge...

330
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,890
with the south side of the bridge
encased entirely in glass.

331
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,959
Rather than corridors
that connect the two buildings,

332
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,030
they'll feel like...

333
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,630
floating lobbies with a nice view
hovering mid-air.

334
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,130
I see.

335
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,699
Could there be any safety issues?

336
00:20:56,699 --> 00:20:59,439
We'll build the whole thing
with the help of a structural engineer.

337
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,239
There are many cases of connecting
two existing buildings with a bridge.

338
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:06,780
But we'll be connecting
two floors of each building, so...

339
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:08,780
Okay.

00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,080
(Seoul Family Court)

341
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:21,030
I hope...

342
00:21:21,729 --> 00:21:23,300
you'll live well and happily.

343
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,070
I mean it.

344
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:31,540
If you're unhappy,

345
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:33,509
I think it'll weigh on me.

346
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:36,880
We should both be happy...

347
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,110
if you're to be at ease.

348
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:42,749
You're really out of your mind.

349
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,280
I was married to a lunatic.

350
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,290
You'll live happily with her
to put me at ease?

351
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:50,919
No.

352
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,419
I want you both...

353
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,300
to have the worst kind of life ever
and die from a bolt of lightning.

354
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,499
That would put me at ease.

355
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,110
The man I loved called Jeon Nam Jin...

356
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,810
is now dead.

357
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
I'm not cool or classy,

358
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,550
so I'll pretend I'm a widow.

359
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:24,219
My only regret is that I can't kill you.

360
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,189
I don't have any other regrets.

361
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:29,530
But...

362
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,199
you will regret this one day.

363
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,530
I tried everything, you see.

364
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:37,140
Will he come back if I act nice?

365
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,439
Will he come to his senses
if I try to be sexy?

366
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:43,479
I looked back on myself
to see if I was the problem,

367
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,640
and I put everything aside
to grovel and beg.

368
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:47,810
I have some self-respect.

369
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,780
As much as anyone else.

370
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,350
But...

371
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:56,090
I threw caution to the wind to fight this.

372
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:59,159
Now I have no regrets or remorse.

373
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,989
But you?

374
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:05,999
You never did your best for us.

375
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:08,370
You'll regret this...

376
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,870
more than anything one day.

377
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:13,540
And then...

378
00:23:14,969 --> 00:23:16,409
you'll weep bloody tears.

379
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:20,110
Remember this.

380
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:21,949
I will.

381
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,219
Goodbye.

(Seoul Family Court)

383
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:01,019
Hello, Jeon Nam Jin speaking.

384
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,060
Yes. Where are you?

385
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,620
Over here.

386
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,830

(Seoul Family Court)

389
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,439
Mom, have some sweet potatoes.

390
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,050
Seon Ju used to come by almost every day.

391
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:38,080
I can't even reach her now.

392
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:39,749
Is it because her husband is back?

393
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,850
She isn't rich,

394
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:46,060
but she's lucky enough
to have a lot of work.

395
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:47,390
Maybe she's just busy.

396
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,830
It looks like it's going to rain.

397
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,100
I ache all over.

398
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:36,009
Look outside. Do you see the water?

399
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,540
All this flows out to the sea.

400
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,179
You could say
we're upstream from the seaside.

401
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,719
- Wait here.
- Mom.

402
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:54,259
I need to take this call.

403
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:56,729
- Mom.
- I'll be back soon.

404
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Hi.

405
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:05,499
You got divorced? For real?

406
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,810
Did Seon Ju sign the form?

407
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,880
Yes.

408
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:14,350
I told you she would.

409
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,380
What about your assets and custody?
Did you finalize that too?

410
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,120
Seon Ju will raise our daughter,

411
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,959
and there are no assets in my name,
so there's nothing to split.

412
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,189
I told her not to sue you
for compensation either.

413
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,729
Did you really? And she agreed not to?

414
00:27:33,229 --> 00:27:35,030
And to think she wanted to fight me.

415
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,850
Mom!

416
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:51,350
Mom!

417
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:05,560
Mom!

418
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:08,999
Mom!

419
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,769
No!

420
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:16,810
Mom!

421
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:20,810
Oh, no.

422
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,179
Oh, dear.

423
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:28,689
(For hire)

424
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,229
To the Han River, please.

(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

427
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,860
You're not having
any destructive thoughts, are you?

428
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,989
You darn scumbag!

429
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:11,699
How did the car roll down the slope?

430
00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:13,699
Lots of people cancel adoptions.

431
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:16,070
Did you talk to him
about the boarding school?

432
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,100
They say you must learn...

433
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,570
to dance in the rain
when you're facing a storm.

434
00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:23,009
You can't do this, however bad things are.
