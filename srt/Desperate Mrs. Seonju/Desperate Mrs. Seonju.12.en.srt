1
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,660
Why would I say...

2
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:14,159
I didn't say any of that.

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,600
- My mom meant to joke...
- It was a joke?

4
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:21,969
My gosh.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,600
- How wicked of you.
- What?

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,670
You and Mother both. You mention
that support whenever you can...

7
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:30,639
and pressure me psychologically.

8
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:31,979
You call that a joke?

9
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:34,350
How much did you send me?

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,950
I'll pay you back including the interest.

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,589
Send an invoice.

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,490
Wait.

13
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:47,690
How could you talk like that?

14
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:51,060
Did I send you the money
to earn back the interest?

15
00:00:58,139 --> 00:00:59,270
Let's talk outside.

16
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:02,440
Wait here, Ji Hyun.

17
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:22,399
I saw your wife.

18
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,160
At a bar. She was with some guy.

19
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:27,169
They could've been friends.

20
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,899
I see.

21
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,140
I know the guy too. We work together.

22
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,539
Right?

23
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:36,240
I thought it was something else.

24
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,979
I was torn as to
whether or not I should tell you.

25
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:40,449
Okay.

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,220
Your imagination went too far. Bye.

27
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,519
- You're here.
- Yes.

28
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,690
Were you at a cocktail bar recently?

29
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:27,829
Yes.

30
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,500
I met a group of friends
who studied in the US.

31
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:33,299
Mr. Jeon was there too.

32
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,769
We all know each other.

33
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,639
Oh, really?

34
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,470
Why? Did someone see us?

35
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:42,509
Yes. A friend of mine.

36
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:43,810
Did that friend...

37
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,810
think I was having an affair?

38
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:49,979
It was a bar late at night.

39
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:51,780
I guess he wondered.

40
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:54,989
That was rude of him.

41
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,430
He should get his facts straight
or stay out of other people's business.

42
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:02,329
Right.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,329
You must've taken
a great liking to Mr. Jeon.

44
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,169
You scouted a guy
you happened to meet abroad...

45
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,440
and took him to a gathering.

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,239
If you live abroad for a while,

47
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,269
the few Korean students
tell each other about everyone else...

48
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:16,380
and what they're like.

49
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:17,739
He's a good guy.

50
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,680
Did you meet up only as friends
of friends who studied together?

51
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,350
What else could it be?
Do you suspect me too?

52
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:30,090
Yes. I almost did.

53
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,259
Try not to appear too close in public.

54
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:36,430
Just like my friend did,
strangers or even our staff...

55
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,130
could get the wrong idea.

56
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,470
Why worry about that?

57
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,810
What do you want, Tae Ri?

58
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:03,690
Talk to me now.

59
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,489
Let's think about our marriage.

60
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:09,859
What?

61
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,669
We're together.
What's there to think about?

62
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:16,970
It's exactly that.
I want to think about us.

63
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:21,410
I'm not sure if we should stay together.

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,509
What?

65
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,379
Show your teeth. There you go.

66
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,280
Now open wide. Good boy.

67
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,450
- Dad.
- Yes?

68
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,590
Mom is a grown-up, and I'm a child.

69
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:39,429
- Yes.
- Is that why Mom...

70
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,299
thinks I'm boring?

71
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,559
- What?
- But...

72
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,330
you're a grown-up too, Dad.

73
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,970
I want you and Mom to get along.

74
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,239
Hey.

75
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:54,470
Am I actually a child?

76
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:57,479
I have more fun when I play with you.

77
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,049
Mom and Dad get along fine.
We're pretty close.

78
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,979
Why would you say that?

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,249
Tae Ri. It's Dad's day off tomorrow.

80
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,660
Shall we go somewhere to play?

81
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,989
Yes. The park we went to last time?

82
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:14,460
Do you like that park?

83
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:18,359
Tae Ri is showing signs of
an obsession with his mother.

84
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,200
If they were to spend time together
to bond...

85
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,239
so he could satisfy that emotion,
it would help.

86
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:27,340
Tae Ri. Should we buy a house
with a small garden in that area...

87
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,770
and live with Mom?

88
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,140
After we fix it up nicely?

89
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,879
Mom will live with us too?

90
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,780
Of course.

91
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,720
What about Grandpa, Grandma, and Auntie?

92
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:43,020
Well...

93
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,020
We can all live together later on.

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,059
How about the three of us
live together for a while?

95
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:50,960
Mom, Dad, and Tae Ri.

96
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:53,369
Like the three bears in the storybook?

97
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:55,999
- Yes.
- Okay. Let's go buy a house.

98
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:58,869
No. We can't do that at night.

99
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:01,010
Let's look at it on my phone.

100
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,739
The real estate app...

101
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,510
Here it is.

102
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,890
What do you mean
you want to think about us?

103
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,489
Are you saying we should break up?

104
00:06:16,489 --> 00:06:20,030
If parting ways would benefit us both,

105
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:22,729
we should...

106
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,059
consider that option too.

107
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,770
What got into you? Why are you like this?

108
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,340
The Choon Hyang
and Princess Pyeonggang stories...

109
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,309
My mom blurted all that out
without thinking.

110
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:41,379
It must've been offensive, though,
so I'm sorry about that.

111
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:44,080
But that's not how I think.

112
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,119
I don't think like that.

113
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:47,890
Forget it. It's not about that.

114
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,260
What is it about, then? Mi Ju's accident?

115
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,260
I'll take care of that too.
And she will grow up.

116
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,929
Pretend you didn't hear about the money.
I'll handle it.

117
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:58,859
- It's not about that.
- Then what is it about?

118
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,109
Did you keep in everything my mom said
until it finally exploded?

119
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:10,939
Jin Ju makes a few comments
here and there,

120
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:12,749
and that would be annoying too.

121
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,780
Is that why you're angry?

122
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,419
I'll tell my family to be really careful.

123
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:22,660
They tend to speak without a filter,

124
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,160
but they're not bad people.

125
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,330
They're really affectionate and...

126
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,229
Who says something like this out of anger?

127
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:30,359
What is it, then?

128
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,200
Is it me?

129
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,669
Why are you upset with me?

130
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:39,640
Talk to me instead of exploding suddenly!

131
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,869
It's not sudden!

132
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:44,340
If it's not sudden, is this how you felt
while you were abroad?

133
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,080
You said life wasn't easy
living on what I'd sent.

134
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,249
Were you stressed out,
thinking of leaving me?

135
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:51,280
My gosh.

136
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,320
You talked about winter in New York...

137
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,359
and eating food waste
from the restaurant you worked at.

138
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,789
Is this because
I didn't send you enough money?

139
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:02,359
You knew our financial situation.
Did you go abroad expecting to be spoiled?

140
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:03,830
Is that how you took it?

141
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,129
I was saying
my life was just as hard as yours.

142
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:08,400
Yes. You said your life there was rough,

143
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,200
but most of your clothes
were designer labels.

144
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,499
I can tell too.

145
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:14,070
Boxing Day!

146
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,179
I told you I got them at a sale!

147
00:08:16,179 --> 00:08:17,840
They're not that expensive in the US!

148
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:24,580
If it's none of that, we can just...

149
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:26,249
We can just...

150
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,489
go on living like this,
trying to understand each other.

151
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,189
We're still happy.

152
00:08:33,189 --> 00:08:34,890
What's so complicated?

153
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,129
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,859
I don't know how to talk to you.

155
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,340
I'm dead serious. Think about it.

156
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,700
- Taxi.
- Honey.

157
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,210
- Taxi.
- Honey.

158
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:51,440
(For hire)

159
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,639
Honey.

160
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:54,450
Jeil Studio Apartments
on Hangang-ro, please.

161
00:08:54,979 --> 00:08:55,979
Why...

162
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,269
Sir.

163
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:48,070
Go to Hwaran-dong instead.

164
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,899
To Hwaran-dong? Okay.

165
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:03,180
Are you still upset?

166
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,790
I heard snake meat
was good for men, that's why.

167
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:10,759
And you liked that cap with snakes on it.

168
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:13,960
I won't talk to you.

169
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,499
What grown man gets upset about that?

170
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,830
Do you want Chu Ah to know
how narrow-minded you are?

171
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,970
Will you please stop?

172
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,670
I'd love for Chu Ah to know...

173
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,940
how narrow-minded I am
so she'll get sick of me.

174
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:28,570
Do you hate her that much?

175
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:31,580
I don't hate her. I just don't like her.

176
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:36,950
- Goodness.
- Mom.

177
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,149
Yes?

178
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,259
You're still up?

179
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:47,889
Mom. Did you and Dad fight?

180
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,930
No. We don't fight.

181
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:57,269
Let's go. I'll put you to bed.

182
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:16,090
Here we go.

183
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,920
Goodness.

184
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,930
Let's go to sleep.

185
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,960
If you weren't fighting,

186
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,700
why did you and Dad leave in a huff?

187
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,600
That was...

188
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,009
Do you always
get on well with your friends?

189
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,340
Are you always on the same page?

190
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:37,979
No.

191
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:42,249
Mom and Dad are like that too.

192
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,619
We don't fight in that situation.

193
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:49,220
We just speak
in a spirited manner to talk it out.

194
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,119
Did you talk it out?

195
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,460
We're trying.

196
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:04,970
- Mom. Sing me to sleep.
- Yes?

197
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,710
Shall I?

198
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:17,279
The big and long clock
that stands on the wooden platform

199
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,290
Is my grandfather's old clock

200
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,639
Work experience?

201
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:42,940
I clothed idol singers,

202
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,409
and recently, I worked for Jin Chu Ah...

203
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,909
What? You said you needed help urgently.

204
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,580
Hello?

205
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:57,320
How come I can't even get an interview?

206
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,560
Isn't this agency famous...

207
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:02,129
for always needing new stylists
because people keep quitting?

208
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,200
And even they won't hire me?

209
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:06,129
My gosh.

210
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:08,570
- Mom.
- What?

211
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,570
Are you sure you and Ms. Shim
were good friends?

212
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:11,999
Yes.

213
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,570
After we visited her at her salon,

214
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,379
it looks like
things are getting even worse.

215
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:21,409
- What?
- I've been looking for work,

216
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,580
but they all say no.
I can't get a single interview.

217
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:29,550
Word about how useless you were
must've traveled far and wide.

218
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,690
No. I'm not useless.

219
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,759
And Seon Ju hasn't mentioned
a reduced settlement either.

220
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,499
She said she'd meet with her friend today.

221
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:41,570
Soon Ae's older daughter called her.

222
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,670
And?

223
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,170
How did it go? Did they talk things out?

224
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:49,470
She hasn't called since they met.

225
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,779
And she won't pick up either.

226
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:53,279
Doesn't that mean things didn't go well?

227
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,350
Her friends asked to see her first.

228
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,180
Maybe she called her just to taunt her...

229
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,790
and got Seon Ju all riled up.

230
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,790
Why would someone do that?

231
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,090
Why does your brain work like that?

232
00:14:06,859 --> 00:14:08,129
Don't talk about me like that.

233
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,460
Goodness.

234
00:14:10,629 --> 00:14:13,369
We all have brains.
They just work differently.

235
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,129
Would you prefer "birdbrain?"

236
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,700
- What's that?
- The brain of a bird.

237
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,340
Darn it.

238
00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:25,909
Soon Ae's daughter would never do that.

239
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:29,409
We were so close, and she adored me.

240
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:32,680
It's time to board and he needs to poop

241
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:35,850
When he came out of the toilet
the train had already left

242
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,259
I'm so happy when I'm with you.

243
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,399
Wait. Didn't you just hear something?

244
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,330
Hear something? Like what?

245
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,269
I don't hear anything. Let's go.

246
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:52,700
No. I heard the sound of a radio.

247
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,340
I didn't.

248
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,909
What? Don't you hear that?

249
00:14:57,909 --> 00:14:58,909
What is it?

250
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:00,850
Where are you going?

251
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,379
Oh, my gosh.

252
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,389
- It's a person.
- What is it?

253
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:10,859
My goodness.

254
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,190
A person?

255
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:16,930
A drunkard fell asleep in the stream.

256
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,060
Is that blood?

257
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,359
Let's keep going.

258
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,800
Is he dead?

259
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,999
No. He's still breathing.

260
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,269
Oh, dear.

261
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:30,279
Hey.

262
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,779
Wake up.

263
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:33,479
Hey. Mister.

264
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:34,950
Wake up.

265
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,950
Hey.

266
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,420
What should we do?

267
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,590
Let's just leave him.

268
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,019
This will just be a nuisance.

269
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:43,519
Call the police from the salon.

270
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,759
What's the point in calling
after he's dead?

271
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,430
Will you ask the Grim Reaper
to send him back?

272
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,830
What if someone were to see you?

273
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,170
What are you doing?

274
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:57,700
Oh, I don't know. I'm leaving.

275
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,210
Go to the salon and call the police.

276
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,970
This is embarrassing.

277
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,009
The neighborhood might hear what you did.

278
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:07,249
Hello? Can anyone help?

279
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:09,180
Someone's dying!

280
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,879
Help! Over here!

281
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,920
The old man woke up?

282
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:17,519
Yes.

283
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,519
Goodness.

284
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:22,290
Wait here. I'm going out.

285
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,359
Where to? The hospital to see the old man?

286
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,330
His family must be there by now
if he woke up.

287
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,070
Do you think they abandoned him?

288
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:36,609
It can't be. I'm sure there's a reason.

289
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,409
You're too caring for your own good.

290
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,850
Don't get involved
in other people's business.

291
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:45,320
What if you end up with the hospital bill?

292
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,889
Or...

293
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:50,720
did you fall for the old man?

294
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:52,790
Why would you say that?

295
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:54,690
Come here. I'll shave off your eyebrows.

296
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,729
- I take it back.
- Get over here.

297
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:59,529
- I'm sorry, okay? Sorry!
- Come here.

298
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:00,830
I won't say it again.

299
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,100
I was just teasing you. I wasn't serious.

300
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,570
I'll shave your head too.

301
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,670
- Darn you.
- Man Eun!

302
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,340
That's what we got up to.

303
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:15,409
The brat had such a hard time,

304
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,850
but she's so successful now.

305
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:23,389
I helped a lot of people
and lived a decent life.

306
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,560
Why did she earn all the money?

307
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,399
What's the matter, honey?

308
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,699
It's nothing.

309
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,070
I must've been tired, recently.

310
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:44,179
Go back to sleep.

311
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:06,399
You witch.

312
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:09,330
You fraud!

313
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:13,939
Why am I having these dreams?

314
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:16,469
Why did our daughters
meet again in that accident?

315
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,409
He'll open you a salon
in the center of Seoul?

316
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:26,550
You saved his life, and the first muscle
he used was his tongue.

317
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,449
He could've given you some cash.
Why did he leave after telling a lie?

318
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:32,090
He must've been grateful enough
that he wanted to open me a salon.

319
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,959
That old man will never appear again.

320
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,530
Instead of thanking you
for saving his life,

321
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,959
he told a lie and disappeared.

322
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:39,730
Isn't that a great relief?

323
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,500
He got well enough
to go home to his family.

324
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,399
I thought his family had abandoned him.

325
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:47,139
What if he actually turns out to be rich?

326
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:50,480
If the salon thing isn't a lie,
will your life be turned around?

327
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,240
I don't wish for such fortune.

328
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:56,550
I just want to be a good mom to Jin Ju...

329
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,850
until her dad comes home.

330
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:00,490
If I were to wish for a bit more,

331
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,290
it would be nice if I could save up
to buy a house connected to a salon...

332
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:05,859
and become a homeowner.

333
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:08,590
It will take so long
that you might die first.

334
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,300
If I become successful,

335
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,899
I'll pay you back, okay?

336
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:15,429
Whatever.

337
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:16,869
I really will.

338
00:19:19,969 --> 00:19:23,639
What's taking her so long
to buy a packet of noodles?

339
00:19:25,939 --> 00:19:28,449
An old man from Seoul
about to board a train for the first time

340
00:19:28,449 --> 00:19:30,080
Excuse me.

341
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:31,719
Gosh.

342
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:36,020
Do you want your hair done?

343
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,159
No. I don't know her name,

344
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:41,959
but I was told
someone here saved my father's life.

345
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,129
Oh, that?

346
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,800
Was that you?

347
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:50,600
Yes.

348
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:04,580
I can't believe he passed away.

349
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,889
Is it true...

350
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,520
that he left me a store space?

351
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:15,689
I thought it was a joke.

352
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,919
To think we met then and there.

353
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:44,820
I taught him a lesson and chased him off.

354
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,830
Soon Ae will be
so pleased to hear about it.

355
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,389
It still hurts.

356
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,000
That darn punk.

357
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:21,959
It wasn't stealing.

358
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:23,929
I took the opportunity that came to me.

359
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,600
I got here through my own hard work.

360
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:30,439
I did nothing wrong.

361
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:05,399
The person is unable to answer...

362
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:07,840
Why is he so impossible to reach?

363
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,040
He might as well still be in the US.

364
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,740
It's no fun.

365
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,879
Hey.

366
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,449
You still owe me because your son
hasn't settled your bill.

367
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,949
Don't worry.

368
00:22:19,949 --> 00:22:21,949
We're friends,
and I don't owe you that much.

369
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,919
This is no fun.

370
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,590
Hire a handsome middle-aged part-timer.

371
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:28,990
Darn you.

372
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,540
Oh, gosh.

373
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,619
- Did you call me a village idiot?
- What?

374
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:54,889
Are you a Choon Hyang
who sent money every month?

375
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:56,389
There's a slight misunderstanding.

376
00:22:56,389 --> 00:22:57,659
Don't you care about my ego?

377
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,389
Am I allowed to be ridiculed
if you paid my tuition?

378
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:02,659
You...

379
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,659
crossed the line.

380
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,600
What line does he think I crossed?

381
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,869
Let's think about our marriage.

382
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,399
What?

383
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:17,179
We're together.
What's there to think about?

384
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:20,580
It's exactly that.
I want to think about us.

385
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,750
I'm not sure if we should stay together.

386
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,750
Why should we think about that?

387
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,149
Goodness.

388
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:42,429
(Pi Seon Ju)

389
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,939
You got the text?

390
00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:50,010
You got here so quick.

391
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,609
This is my husband.

392
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,020
Hello?

393
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:15,100
Nam Jin?

394
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:17,169
What number is this?

395
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,439
A payphone?

396
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,270
Why is your phone broken?

397
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:27,550
I see.

398
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
Right now?

399
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,850
Okay.

400
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,469
(Payphone)

401
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,800
Nam Jin.

402
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:29,969
Be quick. I can't stay out for long.

403
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:31,840
You wanted us to have an affair.

404
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:33,879
Yes. What about it?

405
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,750
That's too hard on me.

406
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,350
And complicated.

407
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,149
- So what?
- Let's leave our spouses.

408
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:43,449
Why is she with a guy late at night?

409
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:46,790
- Goodness.
- Then start over with me...

410
00:25:47,689 --> 00:25:48,990
or end what we have too.

411
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:51,159
What?

412
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:56,030
You said you broke your phone
arguing with your wife.

413
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,340
Was it a big fight?

414
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,869
Because I told you
she called you a village idiot?

415
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:02,969
- It wasn't just about that.
- Then what?

416
00:26:02,969 --> 00:26:04,679
It's more about us than Seon Ju.

417
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,580
Let's talk just about us.

418
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,679
What's this? Is this an affair?

419
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,780
Is she cheating on someone? Is she crazy?

420
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,490
What does he look like?
Is he cuter than So Woo?

421
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,600
- Hello?
- Mr. Kim, I have bad news.

422
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,669
Our Yongin mansion client...

423
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:32,770
Mr. Hong? What about him?

424
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,740
I'll go right now.

425
00:26:43,449 --> 00:26:44,480
Hey.

426
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,389
We're having an affair.

427
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:55,859
Yes. I suggested an affair, not a divorce.

428
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,600
An affair is between two married people.

429
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,060
Quit with the wordplay.

430
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,800
You really want to leave Seon Ju?

431
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,659
What about you? Can you keep this up?

432
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:29,929
What a joke.

433
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,500
You don't have the guts
to leave the wife who paid your tuition.

434
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,000
(My family)

435
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,350
What if I leave her?

436
00:28:29,219 --> 00:28:30,350
What will you do then?

437
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,000
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

438
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,080
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

439
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:58,119
Did you leave home?

440
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,419
You two are fighting, aren't you?

441
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:01,290
You're on my side, aren't you, Mother?

442
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,250
Is it about a woman?

443
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:04,659
Ji Hyun!

444
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,119
Jeon Ji Hyun!

445
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,090
Why did you leave without telling me?

446
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,560
Oh, hello.

447
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:12,560
His dad seems nice and sweet.

448
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Let's quit the affair.
It's not fun anymore.

449
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:17,100
Should I just get them divorced?

450
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,070
