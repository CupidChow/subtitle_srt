1
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,419
Didn't HR tell you?

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,059
I got a job here.

3
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:15,160
I'm here to work.

4
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,859
- To do what?
- Do I have to tell you?

5
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,070
Are you out of your mind?

6
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,300
Well, it could seem so to some.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,210
But I'm not as bad as you two.

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,440
- Come with me.
- Hands off!

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,280
I dressed up specially for my first day.

10
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:35,210
Do you even know
this is my father's company?

11
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:37,379
Mr. Song.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,949
What's she doing here?

13
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:41,219
Who hired her?

14
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,590
Team Leader Kim recommended her.

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,759
Team Leader Kim?

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,359
How do you know him?

17
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,469
Team Leader Kim?

18
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:54,429
Who's that?

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,469
He got you the job here!

20
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:59,039
You're not actually
going to work here, are you?

21
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,869
I will.

22
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:04,509
If I wasn't going to,
why would I come in for an interview,

23
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:06,850
buy new clothes,
and come to where you work?

24
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,149
Because I wanted to see you?

25
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,380
You're pretty high up
and I'm a lowly temporary employee.

26
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,750
What are you afraid of?

27
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,450
The other woman who's the superior...

28
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:17,260
and the exes are now working
in the same building.

29
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:20,260
Why don't we act like
we're in a K-drama...

30
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,400
about hard work, affairs, and in-laws?

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
- Stop it.
- You stay out of it!

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,140
Let's try to get along as coworkers...

33
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,209
while we finalize our divorce
and I sue you, Sang Ah, for compensation.

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,909
Let's do that. Wouldn't that be fun?

35
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,609
I so look forward to working here.

36
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:43,579
You want us three
to work in the same office?

37
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,650
It would be picture-perfect
if your husband were here too.

38
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,650
Why don't you call him?

39
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:19,050
What are you doing here?

40
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,919
Why are you dressed like this?

41
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:27,389
Honey. Did you hire Pi Seon Ju?

42
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:31,659
- "Honey?"
- What are you doing?

43
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:33,930
What do you mean? I'm here to work.

44
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,099
- What?
- You said you were innocent,

45
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,569
so you didn't feel bad or guilty.

46
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,770
So I came back
to try to keep things going.

47
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:42,810
Why? Is that a problem?

48
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:47,509
You mean you came back to work...

49
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,050
and you hired her too?

50
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,750
You want the four of us to work together?

51
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:54,090
So...

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,159
you two...

53
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,659
- are married?
- Yes.

54
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,530
The Team Leader Kim
who hired you is my husband.

55
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,669
We need to talk.

56
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,979
Is that guy really Sang Ah's husband...

57
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:23,219
and a team leader here?

58
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:26,349
Did you get close to him on purpose
to get a job here?

59
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,360
Me, Sang Ah, Mr. Kim, and you too?

60
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,090
Does that make sense?

61
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,330
If it doesn't make sense, you can quit.

62
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,340
What...

63
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:45,370
My gosh.

64
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:50,740
Was this the only place you could work at?

65
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,409
How do you know Pi Seon Ju?

66
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,610
I met her in front of the building
on the day of her interview.

67
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:58,979
I realized she was Mr. Jeon's ex
during a conversation.

68
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,120
Did you put her in front of me on purpose?

69
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:02,490
Think whatever you want.

70
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,189
So what?

71
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,759
You'll give Pi Seon Ju a job here...

72
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:10,330
and you'll come back as well?

73
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,870
So I must see you both every day?

74
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,099
I knew about you and Mr. Jeon...

75
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,900
and still came to work every day.

76
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:23,310
Do you want to harass me
as much as you suffered?

77
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,079
You're so petty, and you keep grudges too.

78
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,079
You said you wouldn't mind
seeing Mr. Jeon's ex-wife.

79
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:30,519
Why are you reacting like this?

80
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,660
That goes for you too.

81
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,790
Don't let it get to you.

82
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,259
You and Ms. Pi are divorced.
What do you care?

83
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,459
My gosh.

84
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:46,930
You're childish...

85
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,139
beyond imagination.

86
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,670
I'd rather be childish
than brazenly shameless.

87
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,480
Fine. Then I'll be childish too.

88
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,009
She joined my team that works on
interior design, so I can boss her around.

89
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:05,790
I'll deal with her as I see fit.
Stay out of it.

90
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,670
(Jin Architecture)

91
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,069
Her mentor is...

92
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:29,779
It's fine. Ms. Pi doesn't need a mentor.

93
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:32,949
I'll keep her around
as my personal intern. That's final.

94
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:35,009
Very well, then.

95
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,720
I'll give you one last chance.

96
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:43,290
Leave voluntarily.

97
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,089
If you put pressure on me to quit,

98
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,490
I'll report you to the Labor Office...

99
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,759
and sue you
for having an affair with my ex.

100
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:53,470
Why do you want to go that far
just to work here?

101
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:55,569
Come on.

102
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,069
Why do you think someone wants to work?

103
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,540
I'm so shocked...

104
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,639
that you're asking
as if you don't know the answer.

105
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,639
You!

106
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,209
So Woo's using you as ammunition.

107
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:11,649
He's angry with me
and he's using you to try to hurt me.

108
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:14,889
Who cares what an employee is for
as long as they have a use?

109
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:18,420
As long as I get paid once a month,

110
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,860
I don't care whose ammunition I become.

111
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,959
Is that so?

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,470
You don't care what you are
as long as you have a use?

113
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:30,439
Okay, then. Let's do this.

114
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:37,980
That is your seat.

115
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:42,779
You're to sit there
and do whatever I tell you to.

116
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,920
Do you get that?

117
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,949
Yes.

118
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,790
This is great.

119
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,860
You must report to me
before going to the toilet.

120
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,829
Oh, and change your tone and speech first.

121
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:56,160
"Ms. Jin." Say it.

122
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,500
Ms. Jin.

123
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,000
I'll tell Admin to tell the cleaner
not to clean my office anymore.

124
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,540
You can take over.

125
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,209
I'm here as a designer's assistant.

126
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,480
You don't want to do that? Then quit.

127
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,980
No, that's fine. I'll do it.

128
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,579
Stop talking like we're friends.

129
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:22,860
Sure, Ms. Jin. I'll do it, Ms. Jin.

130
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,240
Do you like working with a rag and a mop?

131
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,980
Later on,

132
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,379
when the other staff realized
what we were,

133
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,649
wouldn't they laugh?

134
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,250
Is this what you and Mr. Kim came up with?

135
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,819
What a low blow.

136
00:07:58,189 --> 00:07:59,629
I wish you well.

137
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,829
Can you wish me and Sang Ah well
and get on with your life?

138
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,829
Live your own life.
You'll only ruin yourself.

139
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:08,600
- What?
- I get that you're here to harass us.

140
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,839
Using Mr. Kim to get your way
is too dirty a trick.

141
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,709
I hope you use the word "dirty"
knowing what it means.

142
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:15,810
Are you looking into a mirror?

143
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,240
Stop it. I'm being serious,
so take it seriously.

144
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
Right back at you.

145
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,550
Get out of the way. I'm serious.

146
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,120
Move.

147
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:40,830
Hello?

148
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,370
That's right.

149
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,710
An interview?

150
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,139
Okay. Thanks.

151
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:53,909
Oh, my gosh.

152
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,649
(Hospital)

153
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,320
I told So Woo to return to work.

154
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,450
I'm glad you did.

155
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,860
You said you'd find Mr. Jeon another job.

156
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,429
Did you ask around?

157
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:11,230
You liked Mr. Jeon, Mom.
Did you change your mind?

158
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,529
That was an empty compliment.

159
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:15,070
Sang Ah has a family to keep.

160
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,440
Your IV drip is almost done.

161
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,309
I'll go and tell the nurse.

162
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,309
Okay.

163
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:32,519
- Mom.
- Hey. You're here.

164
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,389
Is something wrong? You look upset.

165
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,759
Did Dad ask So Woo to come back to work?

166
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,090
Yes, he did.

167
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,759
Did So Woo come in today?

168
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,299
Yes, but he brought
a pack of explosives with him.

169
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,570
- "Explosives?"
- Mr. Jeon's ex-wife.

170
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,710
What? Is that true?

171
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,909
For real?

172
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,940
You should be with your dad.
Why are you out here too?

173
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,879
Choon Hyang joined Dad's company?

174
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,379
The company is a mess.

175
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,049
Dad hates that.

176
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:09,049
What would he say if he heard
his great son-in-law did this?

177
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:11,789
Wait.

178
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:12,960
What for?

179
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,600
Mr. Jeon's ex-wife.

180
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:19,929
Isn't that Han Man Eun's middle daughter?

181
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:22,100
She joined the company?

182
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:23,639
Yes, Pi Seon Ju.

183
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,039
Don't tell your dad.

184
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,440
Why not? Why should I keep that from him?

185
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,110
Dad should know what So Woo did.

186
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,509
Just don't.

187
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,509
Mom. Are you menopausal?

188
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,750
Your dad is not in the best of health,

189
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,419
and he has a lot on his mind as well.

190
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,929
Telling him that would cause more stress,
and that would be disastrous.

191
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:50,100
Your dad knowing
won't do you any good either.

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,700
So before your dad is discharged
and returns to work,

193
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:58,269
do whatever it takes to get her fired.

194
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,570
Keep her well away from your dad.

195
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,679
He can't see her. Okay?

196
00:11:04,909 --> 00:11:05,909
Okay.

197
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:39,179
(Get vaccinated!)

198
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:10,080
You're a bit on the older side.

199
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:11,480
Yes.

200
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,450
But I taught kids at home
all this while...

201
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,850
I called you to come in
without checking your age.

202
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,190
If someone older with no experience
joins the team as a new employee,

203
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,759
it messes up the hierarchy.

204
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,490
I apologize.

205
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,730
Okay.

206
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,769
What a joke.

207
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,200
She'll get old too.

208
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,139
She wasn't exactly young herself.

209
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:42,840
Ms. Pi.

210
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:45,879
(Jungang Real Estate Agency)

211
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:47,080
Hello.

212
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:49,149
Where are you coming from?

213
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,480
Come in for a chat.

214
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:53,049
Come on.

215
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,059
- For real?
- Well? Are you interested?

216
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,730
Is this a job interview, then?

217
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:03,860
It is.

218
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,600
I feel partially responsible
for the bind you ended up in.

219
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,169
I don't have a real estate agent license.

220
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:12,799
I'll do all the paperwork and signing.

221
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:15,809
You just have to take clients
to see houses.

222
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:18,080
Since the redevelopment was announced,

223
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:20,580
I've been getting
a lot more calls and visits,

224
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:23,350
but our neighborhood is really hilly.

225
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,580
My knees are giving me problems,

226
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:29,149
and I can't take everyone
to view every house they'd like.

227
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:34,129
How much will you pay me?

228
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,600
How about a merit system?

229
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:41,169
- A merit system?
- I'll pay you per deal.

230
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,039
Per deal?

231
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:47,940
Is this where you live?

232
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:49,809
Yes.

233
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:51,809
Come to my place.

234
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:54,009
I couldn't be bothered to go to a karaoke,

235
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:55,580
so I bought three karaoke mics.

236
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,820
- Wait.
- Did you?

237
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,649
- Yes.
- Isn't that Nam Jin's mom?

238
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:00,419
I put up some spinning lights too.

239
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,649
The place looks and feels like
a karaoke bar.

240
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:04,389
- Let's go.
- Okay.

241
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:05,820
This should be fun.

242
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:15,700
Where did this woman go?

243
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
My gosh.

244
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,340
She lives here?

245
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,240
Goodness.

246
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:26,879
Oh, gosh.

247
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,580
I mopped, wiped, copied,
and washed cups all day.

248
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:35,289
I can't believe I dressed up to do that.

249
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,230
Hey.

250
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Are you busy?

251
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,899
So...

252
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,509
Did Ms. Jin treat you poorly?

253
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,009
Forget that.

254
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,080
We need to talk.

255
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,980
Okay.

256
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,720
So, Mr. Homeowner.

257
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:10,019
No, Mr. Kim So Woo.

258
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,360
You're a team leader here?

259
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:14,990
- Yes.
- And you're Sang Ah's husband?

260
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,730
- Yes.
- Since when?

261
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,299
I mean, how?

262
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,269
What kind of question is that?

263
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,299
I mean, why did you...

264
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:27,269
get me a job here?

265
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,779
Am I a bullet or an arrow...

266
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:31,940
you're using to attack Sang Ah?

267
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,350
Why would you say that?

268
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,309
I recommended you...

269
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,179
because you seemed skilled
and the company could use you.

270
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,490
You said you wouldn't mind.

271
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:44,059
That only applies when I'm alone...

272
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:46,090
with Sang Ah and Nam Jin.

273
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:48,990
When it's just those two and I join,

274
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:50,500
it feels like I'm here for revenge.

275
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,370
But if you're part of the equation too,
Mr. Homeowner...

276
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,429
I mean,

277
00:15:55,669 --> 00:15:59,100
if you're here too
and you're Sang Ah's husband...

278
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,309
This is like "Animal Planet."

279
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,779
Is it that bad?

280
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,549
Why didn't you tell me
you were Sang Ah's husband?

281
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:09,750
If you knew, would it change anything?

282
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,620
It would.

283
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:13,620
We live in the same house,

284
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,490
and if we were to work
in the same office too...

285
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,720
More than...

286
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:22,460
the fact that my ex-husband...

287
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:25,000
and his mistress work here,

288
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,370
I'm more shocked
that you're Sang Ah's husband...

289
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,700
and that you're a team leader here.

290
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,340
Didn't you say finding a place to stay
was most important to you?

291
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,909
So I agreed to let you stay.

292
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:37,509
You needed a job, and you made it.

293
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:38,909
You said you were desperate.

294
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:41,350
You said you could do well
on enemy territory.

295
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,480
Didn't I ask and confirm many times?

296
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,320
That was...

297
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:49,450
But still...

298
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,490
That you're Sang Ah's husband...

299
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,389
You said it yourself.
We didn't do anything wrong.

300
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:58,360
You said you'd have no problems...

301
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,269
working with your ex and his mistress.

302
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,240
I don't mind working with them.
That's no big deal at all.

303
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,269
Does the addition
of the mistress' husband...

304
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:07,009
make a huge difference?

305
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,309
So what? Will you quit?

306
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:13,809
You jumped in knowing
this was enemy territory.

307
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:16,150
You have no choice but to keep running.

308
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:23,619
I said I didn't mind or care,

309
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,089
but when I came in...

310
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,329
and then I saw you here...

311
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:32,160
When I saw you, Team Leader Kim,

312
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,769
and I found out who you were,

313
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,240
I was no longer sure if I should do this.

314
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,839
Let's say you can do it.

315
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:42,910
I'm not sure of this myself.

316
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,410
One thing led to another,

317
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,349
and here we are now.

318
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,920
Don't think about anything else.
Let's make it work.

319
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,680
Okay?

320
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,559
People could misunderstand
if they heard we lived in the same house.

321
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:02,730
Let's keep that a secret.

322
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,930
What about my family?

323
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:09,099
Should we tell them
that I, my ex, his mistress,

324
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,200
and her husband
all work at the same company...

325
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,470
and that her husband...

326
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:17,480
is the homeowner we're living with?

327
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:20,779
What do you want to do?

328
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,009
My mom...

329
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,619
doesn't even know
my ex cheated on me with Sang Ah.

330
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:31,859
As you know, her family and mine
are sworn enemies.

331
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,730
That you're Sang Ah's husband,

332
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,299
my mom's enemy's son-in-law...

333
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:41,869
So...

334
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,740
the fact that we all work together.

335
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,369
For my family's peace of mind,

336
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,910
shall we keep it a secret for now?

337
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,509
Let's do that.

338
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,740
Hey.

339
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,240
Giving me a ride from work.

340
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:24,640
This is the last time.
Let's move separately.

341
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:27,109
Okay.

342
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,779
What are you carrying?

343
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,180
Oh, this?

344
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,220
I got my mom something
since I found a job.

345
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,289
I see. Let's go, then.

346
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:55,170
- Hey. Hello.
- Hi.

347
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,380
You came back together?

348
00:19:57,609 --> 00:19:59,839
Yes. We met right outside.

349
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,380
Oh, did you?

350
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,380
She walked up just as I was parking.

351
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,950
I see. Right.

352
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:07,190
Mom. This is a gift.

353
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,789
Okay, thanks. A gift?

354
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,160
What is this?

355
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,529
You struggle at the end of the day
because you're on your feet.

356
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:17,430
I asked people what would be best,
so be sure to take one every day.

357
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,200
I will. Working on my feet
all day at the hair salon...

358
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,740
has been torture on my knees,
so this is just what I needed.

359
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,309
Aren't I the best?

360
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,720
- Don't forget to take it.
- I won't.

361
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:45,420
Hey. I saw your mother-in-law today.

362
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,230
- Where?
- She went into...

363
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,259
a flashy apartment calling it her place.

364
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:52,759
Did she buy an apartment?

365
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,470
No. She's staying with a friend.

366
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,740
She said she decorated her place
to look like a karaoke bar.

367
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,569
I can't believe she'd do that
when she's staying with a friend.

368
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,880
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry
would laugh at that.

369
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,150
My gosh.

370
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,150
It looks delicious.

371
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,750
Here comes the fried chicken.

372
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:15,589
You fried that at home?

373
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,559
Mom did. She said we couldn't afford to
order in for seven people.

374
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:20,690
Kids, the chicken is ready!

375
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,200
Yes.

376
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,339
- Sit down.
- Fried chicken.

377
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,910
It looks good.

378
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,309
Oh, dear.

379
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,450
My gosh.

380
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:44,720
I'm home.

381
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,380
Are you in here, Mom?

382
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:48,650
Oh, my gosh.

383
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:52,660
Mom. What are you doing sitting on my bed?

384
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:55,890
Don't ask. This is all your fault.

385
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,829
- What?
- You asked for the memory card,

386
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:02,599
so I asked the helper about it,
and she quit.

387
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,339
My poor arms and legs.

388
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,109
I ache all over.

389
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:11,640
I'd barely hired her.
What will you do about this?

390
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,240
Darn you.

391
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:29,789
By the way, I offer room and board,

392
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:31,430
but did I tell you...

393
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,529
you needed to pay the utilities?

394
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:39,440
I'll dock the electricity
and water fees from your pay.

395
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:41,109
What?

396
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:42,910
Do you object?

397
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,279
The meters are separate,
so don't worry about that.

398
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:49,380
And I only provide food during work hours.

399
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,220
Anything you eat...

400
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:54,049
before or after work,
I'll charge you half the price.

401
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,890
A bowl of rice is one dollar.

402
00:22:57,789 --> 00:22:59,819
What? Do you object?

403
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,529
Then quit.

404
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,900
In this economy,
I can find a replacement right away.

405
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,670
No, I don't object.

406
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,769
Listen up, everyone.

407
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,410
Our family got to stay in the same house,

408
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:21,279
I got to keep my salon for now,
and these two found jobs.

409
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,019
We have so much to celebrate today.

410
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,049
This is great.

411
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,990
It's a welcome party too.

412
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:32,059
Let's welcome Kim Tae Ri's family...

413
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:34,630
who just moved to Manjang-dong.

414
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,000
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

415
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:39,559
- There's more.
- What?

416
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,269
This is a super extra huge party.

417
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,869
How so?

418
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:46,799
Mom. I found a job too.

419
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,309
- My gosh.
- I start tomorrow.

420
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,680
- What? Is that true?
- For real, Mom?

421
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:52,980
Where at?

422
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,210
Jungang Real Estate Agency.

423
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,650
The darn realtor
who made us sell our house?

424
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,690
Sorry. You made a profit
in the process, but still.

425
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,490
What will you do there?

426
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:10,130
I'll be that person who takes
people around to view houses.

427
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:13,029
I think it's the perfect job for me.

428
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:15,400
I love to see how other people live.

429
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,299
How much will he pay you?

430
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,000
I get paid per deal,
so I could make nothing.

431
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,710
You can't call that getting a job.

432
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:23,240
That's how she'll learn.

433
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,579
Yes. Today I learned
how to post a vacancy...

434
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:28,880
and how to search for properties
with a code.

435
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,519
That was your rookie training.

436
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,279
It was.

437
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,190
He even told me the door code
so I could clean up...

438
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,619
and close for him.

439
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,460
I think that old man is
trying to make you his free labor.

440
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:46,430
Even so, the fact that she has
a workplace to go to is important.

441
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:49,470
- Right?
- Right. You get me.

442
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,099
You're a woman who knows her stuff

443
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,410
Yes, I'm a sexy lady

444
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,009
Hey. On a day like this,
don't you think...

445
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:01,980
- the homeowner should sing?
- Yes.

446
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,220
No. I can't sing.

447
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,220
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

448
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,150
There.

449
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,660
Thank you, Mr. Homeowner.

450
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,890
We promise to be good friends with Tae Ri.

451
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,960
- We welcome the second-floor family!
- We welcome the second-floor family!

452
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,630
What have you done to the curtain?

453
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:27,039
Well done. You're such cute kids.

454
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,670
Here goes.

455
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,680
Sing a song!

456
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,450
- Sing a song!
- Sing a song!

457
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,180
Wait. Just a moment.

458
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:40,250
Won't the neighbors complain?

459
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,589
They won't.

460
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:43,990
They hold an exorcism every year...

461
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,460
and I never complain.

462
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,529
Do you know how noisy a gong is?

463
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,789
I see.

464
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,000
Then...

465
00:25:52,829 --> 00:25:53,869
Just one song.

466
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,079
I hope you enjoy.

467
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:09,849
Good luck, Tae Ri!

468
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,220
Quack, quack!

469
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:15,220
I cross a bridge under the stars

470
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,920
- Quack, quack!
- Go, go!

471
00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:21,059
I go through a windy field of reeds

472
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:24,130
- Go, go!
- Go, go!

473
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:29,599
Waiting for me always

474
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,339
Was your apartment

475
00:26:33,339 --> 00:26:36,309
- I love you, Kim So Woo!
- Kim So Woo!

476
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:39,809
I called you because I missed you

477
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:42,480
- Go, go!
- Go, go!

478
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,750
Your beautiful voice came through

479
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,819
- I love you, Kim So Woo!
- Go, go!

480
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:51,759
Always

481
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:54,490
- Always
- You can sing.

482
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,329
- Come on.
- Your voice

483
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:58,230
- whispered to me.
- Come on up here.

484
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,130
- Lovely, fair-skinned Kim So Woo!
- Kim So Woo!

485
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,769
Just like a flowing river

486
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,579
Just like a floating cloud

487
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,349
You couldn't stay in one place

488
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:19,380
You moved on

489
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,220
I can't forget

490
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:23,890
Someone who suffers a great deal...

491
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,359
can also learn to rejoice
over the small things.

492
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,200
If life is a waterway, to make sure
the water goes where we want,

493
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,000
we shovel with great effort.

494
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,640
Sometimes, a huge flood
wipes everything away...

495
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,039
and takes you to a strange place.

496
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,970
Even if that's meant to be,

497
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:45,109
I will shovel hard today...

498
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,849
and rejoice through my misfortunes.

499
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:54,789
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

500
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:12,799
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

501
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:14,470
Pi Seon Ju, the new hire.

502
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,170
She's Mr. Jeon's wife.

503
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,440
Tell me whenever the work
becomes too much.

504
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,140
Is this the start of a war?

505
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:22,380
You're using that woman pretty well.

506
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,049
You seem to be very wary of Ms. Pi.

507
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,250
Is the art university
entrance exam story true?

508
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,720
Can't you go back on the hiring?

509
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,819
Do you need money?

510
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:31,420
Will you give me whatever I ask for?

511
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:32,890
I'll think about an amount.

512
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:35,589
