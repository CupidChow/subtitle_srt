1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,120
(Episode 51)

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,060
Both teams submitted great ideas,

3
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:16,199
so it was really hard to decide.

4
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:22,200
Team A's design...

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,400
was to merge three floors
to create a tall showroom.

6
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:28,410
That was unconventional and we liked it.

7
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:31,979
We had a lot to think about.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,389
So which proposal did you choose?

9
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:42,960
We chose...

10
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,430
Team B's design.

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,000
We liked your idea of taking...

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,400
a few steps down
into a Colosseum-like showroom,

13
00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:58,939
and it was also considered to be
on the safer side.

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,439
It turned out to be a unanimous decision.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,780
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

16
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,379
That's impossible.

17
00:01:07,449 --> 00:01:09,110
Who made the decision?

18
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:11,220
Myself, the executives, and the chairman.

19
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,820
What do old people know about design?

20
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,490
- Vote again.
- What?

21
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,719
Ask the whole company
and see if the result is still the same!

22
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,460
Ms. Jin. Don't do this here.

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,190
Let go of me. This is nonsense.

24
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,529
Let's go.

25
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,130
Come with me.

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,180
(Jin Architecture)

27
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,820
(Head of Interior, Jin Sang Ah)

28
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,020
They're all cross-eyed.

29
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:55,359
How could old men who know
nothing about design make the call?

30
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,259
What should we do now?

31
00:02:06,309 --> 00:02:10,109
How did you hand it in
when we were so distracted?

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,710
We had no time to print anything,

33
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,309
so I shot off the email
and ran out with you.

34
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:18,719
They liked our work
despite the fact we only sent the files.

35
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:20,890
That's how important design is.

36
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,689
You did great.

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,490
If we hadn't handed it in...

38
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,689
I dread to think of the consequences.

39
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:29,089
Me too.

40
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,599
(Team Leader's Office, Kim So Woo)

41
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,069
How did it go?

42
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:40,909
I saw Ms. Jin's face as she went in.

43
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,140
Did you...

44
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,779
Yes. We won.

45
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,480
- Yes!
- Did you really?

46
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:48,749
Great. See that?

47
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:50,719
You owe me ten dollars.

48
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:52,420
And you owe me 50.

49
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,819
Do I really have to pay up?

50
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:56,390
You bet on the outcome?

51
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,819
Mr. Ko, you didn't bet on us?

52
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,529
Oh, well...

53
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:02,930
- Anyway, Ms. Pi.
- Yes?

54
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,499
You design as well as you can kick.

55
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:06,670
There!

56
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,969
I pulled a muscle.

57
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:10,140
What was that about?

58
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,339
Is your leg okay?

59
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:13,110
Darn it.

60
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:15,969
Do something. Do we just have to take it?

61
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:17,140
Goodness.

62
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,349
You insisted on merging three floors
to create an atrium.

63
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,150
I wasn't able to think of anything else.

64
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:28,020
So what? Are you saying it's my fault?

65
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,349
I'm not, but...

66
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,960
Let's not fight
when we can't overturn the result.

67
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,460
This isn't about us fighting each other.

68
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,599
I told Dad I'd fire So Woo and Seon Ju
once the results came out.

69
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,069
What should we do now?

70
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:48,809
- Hello?
- The CEO would like to see you.

71
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,219
I'll try and talk to Dad.
Think of a solution.

72
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:12,330
You said you'd prove it, and you lost.

73
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,869
You won't object to whatever I decide,
will you?

74
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:19,369
You've done enough
to humiliate the company.

75
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,140
Get Mr. Jeon to resign immediately.

76
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:23,240
Don't say another word about...

77
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,179
what I decide to do
with Mr. Kim or Ms. Pi.

78
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,349
Accept the result and congratulate them.

79
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,950
Mr. Kim.

80
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,820
- He lives with that woman.
- What?

81
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,919
The Kim So Woo you trust so much.

82
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,929
He lives with Pi Seon Ju
who was once married to Mr. Jeon.

83
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,659
How is that different from us?

84
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:44,099
What? Is that true?

85
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:45,960
Call him and ask for yourself.

86
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:48,599
If Nam Jin and I humiliated our company,

87
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:50,599
they ruined our reputation completely.

88
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,440
As long as those two work here,
Mr. Jeon and I have no reason to quit.

89
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,120
Hello, director.

90
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,919
The shopping mall project
you inquired about.

91
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,429
I called because we're able to
meet your schedule.

92
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:16,729
Yes.

93
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,099
Oh, I see.

94
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,029
You signed with another firm?

95
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:24,700
I understand.

96
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,679
(Client List)

97
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,140
You mean...

98
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,779
Nam Jin got his mom to help out...

99
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:37,080
by keeping the kids hostage?

100
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:39,989
How is that not kidnapping?

101
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,820
That's what it looks like,
but he's the dad and there's no proof.

102
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,190
So we can't get them locked up?

103
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,330
Those darn schemers...

104
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,429
Calm down, Mom.

105
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:54,900
Why should I?
I know where Nam Jin's mom lives.

106
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:58,469
I'll stake out the complex
then embarrass her in public.

107
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:59,909
Don't.

108
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,710
You'll only make things worse again.

109
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:06,179
Leave them alone,
and one day a ghost will come for them.

110
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:09,049
Ghosts don't seem to work anymore.

111
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:12,779
Why do you always stop me
from doing something?

112
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:17,219
I miss having the youngest.
She was always on my side.

113
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:20,060
I wonder how she's doing.

114
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,089
I haven't heard from her.

115
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,500
Give Mi Ju a call.

116
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,229
So he has to wear this outfit
for continuity's sake, right?

117
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:29,229
Yes.

118
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:31,469
Excuse me.

119
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,310
- What now?
- Mi Ju.

120
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,909
When does your business trip end?

121
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,950
Can't you even visit until it's over?

122
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:43,250
I'm at work, Mom. I can't make a noise.

123
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,479
Why do you always say...

124
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,419
Are you sure
you're not being held somewhere?

125
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,190
Are you working as a stylist?

126
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,289
Yes, I am. I'll visit once I'm paid.

127
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:55,229
Okay. Bye.

128
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,729
Good. The lights are fixed.

129
00:06:58,099 --> 00:06:59,870
Let's film the next scene.

130
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:01,500
Get the actors.

131
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,830
Yoon Gi.

132
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:06,169
Here.

133
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,849
Guess what the next scene is.

134
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,750
I'm shooting the kiss with Woo Sang.

135
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,429
Enjoy your lollipop.

136
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,370
Woo Sang. I even used mouthwash.

137
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:39,239
And practiced some moves.

138
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,270
Let's make this a legendary screen kiss.

139
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:45,409
Director. Can't we do a fake kiss?

140
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,779
Film at a weird angle
just so it looks real.

141
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,909
What for?

142
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,349
Or let's just set the mood...

143
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:53,049
and have the camera pan away.

144
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,020
No, director. Let's do an actual kiss.

145
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,120
- I did lots of research.
- Yes.

146
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,130
I think the viewers
will retaliate way too much.

147
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,460
Just when your lips are about to touch,
we'll have a breeze...

148
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:07,169
move the curtain and cover you.

149
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:10,070
How can there be a breeze
when we're in an indoor set?

150
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,370
Next week,

151
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:14,169
it'll be revealed
that you're half-siblings.

152
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,880
Do you think it's right
to have siblings kiss?

153
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,179
Darn it. The writer is out of her mind.

154
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,150
I'm afraid we'll get chewed out too much.

155
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,349
What?

156
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,950
Woo Sang and I are related?

157
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,020
Let's get to work, then.

158
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,150
Ready?

159
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,820
Action.

160
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,989
I'm crazy worried about her already.

161
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:37,260
Why must you do this to me too?

162
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,330
Because I love you.

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,729
And you love me too.

164
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,130
You just haven't realized it yet.

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,740
The hatred you have for me
is as strong as your love.

166
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,959
Now do you see how I feel?

167
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:13,799
You are mine now.

168
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:17,900
Cut! Okay.

169
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,699
Let's take a short break.

170
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,809
- My gosh.
- Did you see that?

171
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,750
Did you take photos? I told you to.

172
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,350
- Send them to me.
- Okay.

173
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,480
Why the heck does she want photos?

174
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,610
They were so sweet at this age.

175
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,179
Is this fool dead or alive?

176
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,590
"Divorced couples
who transferred to other people?"

177
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,159
What's this?

178
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:17,429
We put five couples
who are bored of each other in a house...

179
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:18,929
and observe what happens.

180
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:20,829
What do you want to do with that?

181
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,340
You get all the couples
to apply for divorce before moving in,

182
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,600
then set the stage so they can flirt.

183
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,709
- What?
- When they leave the house,

184
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,010
they can either
make their divorce official...

185
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,909
or rip up the papers and go home together.

186
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,309
- How does that sound?
- Hey.

187
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:38,120
- Is it weird?
- Our country...

188
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,150
was built on morals that value marriage.

189
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,949
Do you want to make
the most hated show on the planet?

190
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,620
Were you always this crazy?

191
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,760
You told me to come up with a crazy idea.

192
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,990
Why you...

193
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:53,669
The craziness
should fall within a boundary.

194
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,699
If one couple breaks up,

195
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:58,970
there will be a domino effect.
Do you want to ruin five families?

196
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,370
Bring me an idea we can turn into a show.

197
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,579
Please!

198
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:08,809
I understand.

199
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,159
Did he reject the idea?

200
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,929
You heard everything.

201
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,360
I kind of liked it.

202
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,000
You don't get it!

203
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,539
Were you talking to me?

204
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:33,340
Who was that?

205
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,340
I'm the idiot for listening to Jin Ju.

206
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:50,220
I'm exhausted.

207
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,429
Why do you always lie down on my bed?

208
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:56,429
Because my son's room...

209
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,829
is more comfortable than my mom's.

210
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:00,470
I won't stay too long.

211
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,240
What is it?

212
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:07,640
Are you tired of me already?

213
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,039
Mom. What was Dad like?

214
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:11,809
What do you mean?

215
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:13,809
Yesterday, the restaurant owner asked...

216
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,909
if the upstairs guy was my dad,

217
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:17,779
and it felt a bit weird.

218
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,650
Weird how?

219
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,590
Were you envious?

220
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,819
No.

221
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,189
It's just that...

222
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:31,000
we'd never had an adult man in the house.

223
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,900
He adored you.

224
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,900
If only he were alive,
he'd have been the best dad ever.

225
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,539
A new expansion...

226
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:44,640
(Team Leader's Office, Kim So Woo)

227
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:47,549
Mr. Kim.

228
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,679
Will you celebrate
over a team dinner or something?

229
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,890
I'd love a barbecue.

230
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,990
Are you all free this evening?

231
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,289
- Yes.
- I know I am.

232
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:01,630
What do you know?

233
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:04,230
We haven't officially welcomed Ms. Pi yet.

234
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,169
How about a team dinner
to cover everything?

235
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:10,669
A dinner to welcome me? For real?

236
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:17,110
- Yes, for real. Somewhere nice.
- That sounds good.

237
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:18,939
Let's go. But where to?

238
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,490
I told my dad...

239
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,860
that Mr. Kim lives with Seon Ju.

240
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,459
He won't think so highly of them anymore.

241
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:38,659
So hang in there.

242
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,730
If you quit right now,
I have to put up with that alone.

243
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,939
Then I might really lose control.

244
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,340
I won't ever quit. Don't worry.

245
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:51,640
Those two are shamelessly parading about.

246
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:55,010
I won't go leaving you here.

247
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:01,120
Okay, then. I earned us some time,
and there will be another chance.

248
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:03,319
Let's not mess up then.

249
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:06,419
Okay.

250
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:08,860
Shall we go get a drink?

251
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:10,329
Wait.

252
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:16,770
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

253
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:26,309
We're here to welcome you,
so how about a short speech?

254
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,480
Okay, then.

255
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:32,279
As long as this company stands,

256
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:33,789
I will never...

257
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,289
betray or leave on my own accord.

258
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,529
I got you...

259
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:46,730
a gift.

260
00:14:47,169 --> 00:14:48,169
Here.

261
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:53,770
Business cards?

262
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,209
I have a pack.

263
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,439
They're new.

264
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,909
(Pi Seon Ju, Planning Team 1, Designer)

265
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,150
I'm no longer...

266
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,750
an assistant?

267
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:10,419
You're a member of my team.

268
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,360
And very competent.

269
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,529
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

270
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,900
Ms. Pi. How about a song?

271
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,799
There's an open mic.

272
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,500
- Why on earth...
- Why are you tearing up?

273
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,600
Thanks.

274
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,539
Then...

275
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,179
how about I sing?

276
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,709
Sounds good.

277
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,880
- Mr. Kim.
- Mr. Kim.

278
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:37,079
Darn it.

279
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,449
I need to win a huge deal
to turn the tables.

280
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,090
There will be a way out.

281
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,260
Hey.

282
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,000
What?

283
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:57,939
Hi, professor.

284
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,880
That sounds great.

285
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:05,840
I'd love to.

286
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,510
Let's meet up soon.

287
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:12,220
What did he say?

288
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,150
My professor...

289
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,459
is going to work on
a K-culture Town project here in Korea.

290
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:23,929
- Really?
- He doesn't know anyone else here,

291
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:26,730
so he wants our company
to be joint designers on the project.

292
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:29,970
He called to ask me first
before trying to recruit anyone else.

293
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,400
For real?

294
00:16:34,569 --> 00:16:36,740
There's always a way out.

295
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,709
They're proud that they beat us,
but wait and see.

296
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,850
The Hansung project?

297
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,250
It's nothing compared to this.

298
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:47,549
That's right.

299
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,590
- Shall we get out of here?
- Yes.

300
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,689
I'll tell Dad about it.

301
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,159
As long as we're working on this,

302
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,260
there's no way he can demand you resign.

303
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:05,199
- Stay strong.
- Yes, I feel strong.

304
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:27,130
Everything feels like a dream

305
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:35,229
I could only watch you
but now I can look at you

306
00:17:36,769 --> 00:17:40,669
I think I get it now

307
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:46,909
You're the only one I cherish

308
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,519
- You should sing too.
- Sing along.

309
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:54,949
- Sing along.
- Okay, fine.

310
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:07,530
I hope all I wished for become miracles

311
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:13,540
Spend every fleeting moment with me

312
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,409
When all the stars

313
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:21,280
Shine down on us like this

314
00:18:22,709 --> 00:18:26,989
I will hold you tight

315
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:31,189
Every single day, walk with me

316
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:34,759
And at the end of the road

317
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:39,659
I will not let go of your two hands

318
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,370
I hope all I wished for

319
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,780
Become miracles

320
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:54,150
Every moment we spend together

321
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,650
I will protect you

322
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,219
When the rays of the sun

323
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:05,290
Shine down on us like this

324
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,999
I will hold you tight

325
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:17,769
Every single day

326
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,939
Forever

327
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:45,999
- Sing again.
- Sing again.

328
00:19:45,999 --> 00:19:49,269
Look at them celebrating
over winning just one project.

329
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:51,400
- What a mess.
- Sing again.

330
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:54,669
- Let's go somewhere else.
- Okay.

331
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:56,870
Come on and join us.

332
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,650
I hope all I wished for

333
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:09,890
Become miracles

334
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,189
Spend every fleeting moment

335
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:15,489
With me

336
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:19,300
When all the stars

337
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,429
Shine down on us like this

338
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:30,479
You just got home?

339
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,239
Yes.

340
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,909
The more I think about it,
the more I see how sly she is.

341
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,280
Why do you think Seon Ju
lives with her landlord?

342
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,280
He's Sang Ah's ex, right?

343
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:43,090
She said she was just a tenant.

344
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,560
No. I have a great hunch
when it comes to those things.

345
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:47,689
My name is "Yeon Ae." It means "to date."

346
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,530
It's obvious
they're in the early stages of dating.

347
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,870
I had no idea she was so cunning.

348
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,870
Get them both fired.

349
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:58,239
Can't Sang Ah do that?
She's the boss' daughter.

350
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,709
I don't get what her parents are thinking.

351
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:03,640
How are they letting all four of you...

352
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:05,580
work in the same company?

353
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,580
Will you stop it?

354
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,650
I saw the landlord's face.
It's the perfect setting to fall in love.

355
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,650
Darn you.

356
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,929
I heard you lost.

357
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,669
You acted like Seon Ju was no match,
but you embarrassed yourself.

358
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,209
You said you'd get your way if you won.

359
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:42,509
Now that you lost, do as your dad said
and end it with Mr. Jeon.

360
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:44,880
Seon Ju and Nam Jin...

361
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,790
won't do you any good
if you keep them around.

362
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:51,890
You haven't heard
that So Woo and Seon Ju live together?

363
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,759
- What?
- They're just the same.

364
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,489
Why berate just us?

365
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:58,360
Get So Woo out of that house too, then.

366
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,330
What? Why should I do that?

367
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,130
So Woo won the deal.

368
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:05,439
Doesn't that mean he's not
the pushover you thought he was?

369
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:09,009
If they were to live together
and end up falling in love,

370
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:10,880
are you sure you wouldn't resent that?

371
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:13,810
I wouldn't.

372
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,810
You said you were my mom.

373
00:22:15,979 --> 00:22:19,749
I have a lot on my mind already,
and you're making me feel worse...

374
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,749
when you should be consoling me.

375
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:23,120
That's because I'm your mom...

376
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,189
and I'm the only one
who can think ahead for you.

377
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:30,489
Do you need something?

378
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,429
I'd like to take a walk around the garden.

379
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:34,900
I'll join you.

380
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,610
Must we go to a lab to get our DNA tested?

381
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:17,110
Let's do that, then.

382
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,219
It gets so cold after dark.

383
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:03,390
What are you doing?

384
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:18,669
Shall we wait out here
until we sober up a bit?

385
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,640
I was so pleased today.

386
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,310
Were you?

387
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:30,110
To be honest, I'd been telling people...

388
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:35,949
including my daughter Ji Hyun
that I was an interior designer,

389
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,929
but I questioned myself a lot
if I actually was one.

390
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,429
When you gave me my new business cards,

391
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:50,429
I was moved.

392
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:53,100
- Were you?
- Yes.

393
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,310
Right.

394
00:24:57,409 --> 00:24:59,640
You go to Family Court tomorrow.

395
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:01,509
How do you feel?

396
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,810
The negative feelings seem to have gone.

397
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,949
You said to me...

398
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,290
it was part of your life
and that you'd send it off.

399
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,330
That you can fill in the future pages
and make them pretty.

400
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,800
I'll do that too.

401
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,570
- How pretty.
- You're right.

402
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:51,929
I'm no longer...

403
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
an assistant?

404
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,669
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

405
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:33,269
You're a member of my team.

406
00:26:33,999 --> 00:26:35,140
And very competent.

407
00:26:57,189 --> 00:26:59,330
(Seoul Family Court)

408
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,130
(Seoul Family Court)

409
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,749
(Gene Test Lab)

410
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,019
(Dalton Medical Foundation)

411
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,890
(Kim So Woo)

412
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,959
I'm here to request a DNA test.

413
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,300
You came in person?

414
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:11,669
Yes. Is that not allowed?

415
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:13,340
It's fine. Please wait.

416
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,340
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

417
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,390
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

418
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:05,759
Is it true you two are living together?

419
00:29:05,989 --> 00:29:08,590
Is that how two people act when they say
they have no personal feelings?

420
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,630
Reporter Heo. What is this?

421
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,929
Isn't this you?

422
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:14,530
Tell him to call
as soon as the shoot is done.

423
00:29:14,699 --> 00:29:16,999
Until you have everything
within your grasp,

424
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,999
don't let go of So Woo completely.

425
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:21,439
Why did you turn me into
a member of this family?

426
