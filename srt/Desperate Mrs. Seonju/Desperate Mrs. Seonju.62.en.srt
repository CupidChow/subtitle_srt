1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,040
Mi Ju called.

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,640
Is my sister-in-law getting married?

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,780
Get the titles right.
Who's your sister-in-law?

4
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:20,080
I can help you out with that.

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,920
I'll be your husband if you want.

6
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:24,850
Darn it.

7
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,390
What did you just say?

8
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:29,460
You'll be whose husband?

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,860
No. What I meant was...

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,099
I've had enough.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,029
I'll let you two fight this out.

12
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:39,270
- Move.
- Darn you.

13
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:41,639
You...

14
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:51,550
What were you doing with her?

15
00:00:51,779 --> 00:00:53,080
"I'll be your husband?"

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,950
Do you want to get back together with her?

17
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,790
Seon Ju's sister is getting married...

18
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,919
and she asked me to come
and pretend to be her brother-in-law.

19
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:02,760
Do you expect me to believe that story?

20
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:05,459
At least make up an excuse
with some common sense!

21
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,429
If you don't believe me, ask Seon Ju.

22
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:09,669
Her sister really called me.

23
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,270
She actually asked you to do that?

24
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,270
Yes.

25
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,600
But would I actually go there?

26
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,740
And meet up with
my ex-mother-in-law and her family?

27
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,309
But the girl pleaded for help.

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,450
I was complaining to Seon Ju
out of disbelief.

29
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:25,909
Telling Seon Ju...

30
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:29,620
"I'll be your husband if you want"
was you complaining?

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,450
I was being sarcastic.

32
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,019
Her whole family is crazy.

33
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,260
What's wrong with...

34
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,689
Don't even talk to Seon Ju anymore!

35
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:39,930
Okay.

36
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:54,109
Is Pi Mi Ju out of her mind?

37
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:55,840
(Seon Ju)

38
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,820
Look at her.

39
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,889
You do feel sleepy
in the early stages of pregnancy.

40
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:08,889
The cute thing.

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,730
(Seon Ju)

42
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:18,369
I saw the sticker photos
of you and Mi Ju in your car.

43
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,540
You were really busy with her.

44
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:22,839
You...

45
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,739
Do you think she's pretty?

46
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,980
Yes.

47
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,019
How so?

48
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,989
She has a figure of a pre-pubescent girl
and the face of a simpleton.

49
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,190
Do I have to put everything in words?

50
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,230
My look is more modern and elegant.

51
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,329
She looks common.

52
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:49,000
If you don't get it, memorize it!

53
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,200
You're right.

54
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,440
You're right that you're pretty,

55
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,869
and that I should've...

56
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,440
drawn the line with you
if I didn't care for you.

57
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,209
I'm not saying that's your mistake!

58
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,989
How could you like her?

59
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:12,290
Why did you spend time with her?

60
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,889
Do everything with me.
Take photos and play on the claw machine.

61
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:17,160
Let's go on dates.

62
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,230
Do everything over with me.

63
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:22,200
How could you like her?

64
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:25,799
I can't say.

65
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:29,970
- I'm not sure...
- You don't know.

66
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
You don't know how you feel about me.

67
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:35,780
Like my line in our drama,

68
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,250
you like me,
but you haven't realized it yet.

69
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,079
You're wrong about that.

70
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,320
I don't know what Mi Ju means to me,

71
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,019
but I like being with her.

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,389
I can say for sure
that's why I want to be around her.

73
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,829
I'm sorry...

74
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,030
I can't return your feelings.

75
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,200
You've fallen for her...

76
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:05,040
because she's pretending to be
piteous and sweet.

77
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,910
Your marriage...

78
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:09,910
won't happen.

79
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,510
And if it does, it won't last!

80
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,940
Give up.

81
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,079
Get lost.

82
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,170
Do you have a favor to ask?

83
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,050
Something like,
"Could you sit next to me at a wedding?"

84
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,849
My gosh.

85
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,050
Should I wear something that fits...

86
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:56,820
my fighter character?

87
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,760
My gosh.

88
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,860
I knew you were a good boxer,

89
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,589
- but you can kick too.
- You think so?

90
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,870
Does he want us both or what?

91
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,469
Darn her.

92
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,010
You're home.

93
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:23,779
Hey, you.

94
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,920
Did you call Nam Jin
to ask him to come to the wedding?

95
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
What?

96
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,120
Yes.

97
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,529
I can't believe or understand
how you think.

98
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,690
You used to be married.

99
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:42,200
Wouldn't that be less of a fraud
if you brought him...

100
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,829
instead of a complete stranger?

101
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:48,399
I'd love to take a look at your brain.

102
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:54,039
Hey. He had an affair
and left his own kid for his mistress.

103
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,409
How would it make me look
if you were to ask him that favor?

104
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,079
Just so you can
make your wedding a success,

105
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:01,149
how dare you throw salt
onto my painful divorce?

106
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,450
That was too much.

107
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,789
You kept saying you had no one to ask,

108
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,289
so I got worried.

109
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,190
My gosh. You still won't apologize?

110
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,229
You deserve a beating.

111
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:13,459
- Come here.
- No.

112
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:15,729
Darn you.

113
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:17,130
Stop it.

114
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,899
In case you forgot, I'm pregnant.

115
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,700
I can't take this.

116
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,740
My fist would love to
punch something right now.

117
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,010
Don't you dare
ask a favor like that again!

Pi Seon Ju.

120
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:53,399
Did you ask Mr. Jeon
to act like your husband?

121
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
What?

122
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,870
I didn't ask him to do such a thing.

123
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,440
Your sister did.

124
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,779
Would she have gotten the idea on her own?

125
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,149
Do you still want him back?

126
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,620
I do not.

127
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:11,320
I live in fear
that you'll give him back to me.

128
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,289
Stop getting ideas.

129
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,490
I'm sick of men and marriage
this time around.

130
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,060
I don't think you are.

131
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,659
Kim So Woo. Aren't you interested in him?

132
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:24,070
- What?
- You want Mr. Jeon back...

133
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:26,200
and you're interested in my husband.

134
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,269
Do you want all the men in my life?

135
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:37,380
Your designs are nothing of the sort,

136
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,149
but you're really creative
when it comes to picking a fight.

137
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:42,479
Are you sure
you're not interested in So Woo?

138
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,219
- Hello.
- Hello.

139
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,290
Good morn...

140
00:08:46,489 --> 00:08:47,989
Come to the meeting room.

141
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,489
Okay.

142
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,660
Goodness.

143
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,229
Which is Seon Ju's room?

144
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,729
Is it this one?

145
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,999
My gosh.

146
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,969
Hey.

147
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:39,369
This is Seon Ju's windbreaker.

148
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:40,709
This is her room.

149
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:43,450
I should do something...

150
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:46,379
now that I know
I can help Nam Jin prosper.

151
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,890
No mother could be devoted enough
to steal for her own son.

152
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,719
These are outer clothing.

153
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,729
Where does she keep her underwear?

154
00:10:01,859 --> 00:10:02,900
Is this it?

155
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,469
Wash your hands first.

156
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:05,869
- Okay.
- Ji Hyun.

157
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,070
I called Tae Ri,
so wait until he comes over to eat.

158
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,140
Okay.

159
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:12,170
I'm home.

160
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,479
- You wash your hands too.
- Okay.

161
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:16,410
I wonder if the potatoes cooled down.

162
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,499
My gosh.

163
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,400
Don't tell anyone you saw me.

164
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,009
I bought you a nice treat, right?

165
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,680
Good. Let's go out
and have fun again someday.

166
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,950
Bye.

What brings you here?

00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,770
Me? I'm here to see your boss.

173
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,310
She's not in.

174
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:23,879
Where does she live, then?

175
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:26,150
I can't tell you that.

I'm going to keep track of
all merits and demerits.

Is anyone displeased or offended?

184
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,020
Why won't you answer?

185
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,249
Ms. Pi. I'd like a response.

186
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,150
Sure. Point taken.

187
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,290
I'm not yet done!

188
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,759
Staff who think this company...

189
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:15,499
is some small hairdresser
run by a grandma.

190
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:17,599
Staff who are consistently out of line.

191
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,839
Insubordinate staff
who bring their private lives to work.

192
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,810
Such staff could get fired,

193
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,469
so keep that in mind.

194
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,440
Is that so?

195
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:31,979
I know someone who practically brought
their private affairs to work.

196
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,950
I think the meeting is over.

197
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,390
You three can leave.

198
00:12:39,219 --> 00:12:41,219
- Okay.
- Excuse us, then.

199
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:51,300
The executive director called the meeting.

200
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:53,640
How dare you cut it short?

201
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,040
An "emergency meeting"
to review personnel performance.

202
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,609
"I'm the new executive director."

203
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:00,440
You called this meeting to brag.

204
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,680
Don't you think...

205
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:06,109
that's an example of bringing
personal issues to work, director?

206
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,150
What?

207
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,249
If you don't mind,
we'll leave too now, director.

208
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,560
- Let's go.
- Okay.

209
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,589
Do excuse us.

210
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:17,989
Director.

211
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,589
After you.

212
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
I'll get the door.

213
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,040
I'll close the door, director.

214
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,800
Goodbye.

215
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,239
How dare they...

216
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:32,469
Director.

217
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,280
Why did you aim at me?
That hurt, director.

218
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,509
- Stop it!
- Director, your coffee...

219
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,619
That was almost laughable.

220
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:43,790
Did she want to be called
"director" that badly?

221
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:46,589
I should entertain her when I can.

222
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:47,989
Let's do that.

223
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,469
Can we have a word?

224
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,810
Well, okay.

225
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,290
Of all the houses you could've bought,
you bought Ms. Pi's and moved in with her.

226
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,989
Was that truly just a coincidence?

227
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,190
Yes, it was a coincidence.

228
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,759
I've had enough of the bad blood.

229
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,530
Send her family away.

230
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,329
Or you could move back in with us.

231
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,629
Why should I do that
when the house is mine?

232
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:33,570
I'm offering you a way out.

233
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,599
Be wise enough to give in and take it.

234
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,709
Don't you feel bad for Tae Ri?

235
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:38,910
Tae Ri is doing well.

236
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,709
He's doing better than before.

237
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:42,239
That's what you think.

238
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,349
I bet Tae Ri misses his mom.

239
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,680
You know why we separated.

240
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,820
I'd like you to stop
coming to see me about this.

241
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,119
Sang Ah is slowly coming around.

242
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,989
I know that much.

243
00:14:57,989 --> 00:14:59,530
I really don't get it.

244
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:02,900
You didn't like me much
when I was with Sang Ah.

245
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:05,300
Is there something else
I don't know about?

246
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,969
I don't know why you're doing this.

247
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,770
I just want to see you and Sang Ah...

248
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,040
reconcile and live happily.

249
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,209
I have nothing more to say.

250
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,379
You don't...

251
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,349
have feelings for Seon Ju, do you?

252
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,290
If you do, control yourself.

253
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,489
It could end terribly.

254
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,060
Why would you buy me food?

255
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:37,729
You bought a house from me
and agreed to participate in my play.

256
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:40,469
The deal you signed was my first.

257
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,869
I was so grateful.

258
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:45,070
You're a huge help in many ways.

259
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:46,940
Give and take. It goes both ways.

260
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,040
You're helping me with the new show.

261
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,579
You can treat me too, then.

262
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,150
- Hey.
- What?

263
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,950
How much should we share to pull off...

264
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,849
the one-day husband charade?

265
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,259
Things your sister's in-laws might ask?

266
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,430
How old is your husband?

267
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,859
No. What's his name?

268
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:10,469
Can I just say my name?

269
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,869
You can't. My son's family name is Gang.

270
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,400
I can't change that just for you.

271
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,209
That's true.

272
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,709
How did you meet him?

273
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,180
I briefly worked at a publishing company
before I was married.

274
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:23,879
He worked there too.

275
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,009
And? How did you get together?

276
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,749
We had a team dinner at a beer joint.

277
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,820
He got drunk, went to the toilet,
but wouldn't come back.

278
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,759
I got worried and went looking for him.

279
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:40,129
When I found him, he told me he liked me.

280
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:45,300
It was a unisex toilet.

281
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:49,140
Hey.

282
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,709
Wasn't that too weird a place
to confess his love?

283
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,479
It was, wasn't it?

284
00:16:56,009 --> 00:17:00,379
I don't have a single anecdote
I can brag about.

285
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,520
My mom told me off nonstop
that I was widowed...

286
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,920
because we started off in the wrong place.

287
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,859
Did she?

288
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:11,989
But then...

289
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,229
I was made to feel like I was in the way
of my younger sister's happiness.

290
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,370
That was so upsetting.

291
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:24,069
But then you agreed
to pretend to be my husband,

292
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,110
and I was able to show off.

293
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:29,680
"I'll do it for you once, but not twice."

294
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,150
"Make it up to me."

295
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:34,319
That was what I said.

296
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,950
For once in a while,

297
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,489
I got to be a proud big sister.

298
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,620
It felt nice.

299
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,029
Yes. I'll come over later to try it on.

300
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,430
Bye.

301
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,569
I'm going to the hanbok place.
Drive me to Gangnam.

302
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:58,709
Okay.

303
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,110
I wasn't entirely pleased about it,

304
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:05,350
but preparing for the wedding
is actually fun.

305
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,650
Is it?

306
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:10,890
I just need Chu Ah
to keep quiet and not do anything.

307
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:17,360
It's fun preparing to marry off your son?

308
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,890
You just need me to keep quiet?

309
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,360
How could you say that?

310
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,069
Chu Ah, what I meant was...

311
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,600
I trusted you.

312
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,069
Let's say Woo Sang was bewitched
because he had low standards.

313
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,969
You're the adult!

314
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,509
How could you allow them to marry?

315
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:37,279
What choice do I have?
A parent gives in to their children.

316
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:38,880
You mustn't give in if it's bad for them.

317
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,049
Not when their child...

318
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,420
What?

319
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:45,749
"Their child?"

320
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,759
They're expecting?

321
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,930
Yes!

322
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,630
Nothing happened between them.

323
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,569
How could she be pregnant?

324
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,069
Something had to have happened.

325
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:01,069
That's why she's pregnant.

326
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,840
Did he really sleep with her?

327
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,580
- Chu Ah.
- No.

328
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,140
- That can't be.
- Oh, dear.

329
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,249
It can't be.

330
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,680
Oh, no.

331
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,150
You're in shock. Are you okay?

332
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,850
- Chu Ah.
- Ms. Oh. Let's go to the car.

333
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,819
We must rush
if we want to get to Gangnam in time.

334
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:23,120
Okay. I have to go, Chu Ah.

335
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,130
I'm sorry.

336
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,779
Hello?

337
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:46,350
Are you really pregnant?

338
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,279
It's not a lie?

339
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,519
I'm not like you.

340
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:51,549
Don't call me again.

341
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:53,350
I'll report you if you do.

342
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:07,969
My gosh.

343
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,809
I almost died thinking I'd be caught.

344
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,910
If that loud-voiced woman had caught me,

345
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,009
I'd have ended up in handcuffs.

346
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,450
Goodness.

347
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,120
What's this?

348
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,090
It's a baby's swaddling clothes.

349
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:26,819
Why did I take this?

350
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,029
No. She said the older the better.

351
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:33,289
What could be older than this?

352
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,569
You're home.

353
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,870
Yes.

354
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,870
So whose is this...

355
00:20:46,209 --> 00:20:47,209
Hey.

356
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,580
What's this?

357
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,309
It's a note.

358
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:55,779
"Honey.
This is my daughter from another woman."

359
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,719
"I have my reasons.
I'd like you to raise her for me."

360
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,190
"I promise to come back for her.
I'm sorry."

361
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:04,959
"Pi Su Il?"

362
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,029
Goodness. What's this?

363
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:12,370
One of them was the result of an affair?

364
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,170
My gosh.

365
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:17,370
Is this even Seon Ju's?

366
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:20,509
Hey.

367
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:22,840
Your old in-laws.

368
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,249
Was one of the three girls
born out of wedlock?

369
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,620
What are you on about?

370
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,019
Did you hear anything like that?

371
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
No.

372
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,090
But they did say the youngest sister...

373
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,719
didn't take after anyone.

374
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,130
It's the youngest.

375
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:45,700
My gosh. Her husband had an affair too,

376
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,100
and she rejected my son?

377
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:50,370
The ones with dirty secrets
are even worse.

378
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,539
My gosh.

379
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:54,910
Honey. You're home.

380
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:03,779
I met with So Woo today.

381
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:06,319
Did you? What did he say?

382
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:08,590
He didn't care to listen.

383
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,590
I told you so.

384
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:14,130
Do you think...

385
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,130
it could be because of Pi Seon Ju?

386
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,999
- What?
- She's always around So Woo.

387
00:22:21,469 --> 00:22:23,299
Could she be manipulating him...

388
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:25,440
to get back at Sang Ah
for taking her husband?

389
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:28,640
I get the chills whenever I see her.

390
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,380
It can't be that.

391
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,549
Your flaw is that you're too trusting.

392
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,779
- I'm home.
- Hi, Sang Ah.

393
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:37,549
Can I have a word?

394
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:51,529
I met So Woo today.

395
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,330
You did? What for?

396
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,100
He was alone with Seon Ju.

397
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,969
What are they up to?

398
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,940
They're on the same project.

399
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,380
They looked at each other so fondly.

400
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,640
Are they just working?

401
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:08,249
Are you unable to see
how they feel as well as how you feel?

402
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,719
"How I feel?"

403
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,390
You didn't show up on your court date...

404
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,519
because you partly wanted to stay married.

405
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,459
Or you'd have shown up
even if we stopped you.

406
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:20,660
I don't know what I want.

407
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,700
I should like and want just one man.

408
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,830
I don't want Nam Jin
to go back to Seon Ju,

409
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,799
but I hate it when I see So Woo
smile at Seon Ju.

410
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:31,809
It's not bad to feel that way.

411
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:36,910
In your heart,
you can want every man in the world.

412
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,850
That's not a bad thing. But...

413
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,219
you must make a choice.

414
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:46,090
You must decide
which will benefit your future.

415
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:49,319
What are you saying I should do?

416
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,029
You can go after Mr. Jeon
whenever you want.

417
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,100
But So Woo?

418
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,430
Get him back now or you'll lose him.

419
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,499
- Why?
- Love...

420
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,940
burns like a flame at first.

421
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:05,809
So Woo and Seon Ju
are just about to light the flame.

422
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:08,910
They might not see it, but I do.

423
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,279
Will you hand over your husband to her?

424
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,039
Why did she glare at me like that?

425
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:41,110
I wondered why Sang Ah was like that.

426
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,479
She's exactly like her mom.

427
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:58,330
Tae Ri is So Woo's weakness.

428
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:01,700
You have tomorrow off.
Why don't you go see him?

429
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,910
(Jeon Nam Jin)

430
00:25:13,469 --> 00:25:15,009
- Hello?
- Hi.

431
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:17,380
What are you doing today?
Let's grab lunch together.

432
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:19,380
Sorry. I have plans.

433
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,779
- What plans?
- I'm meeting a friend.

434
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,950
What friend?

435
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:24,549
You wouldn't know
even if I were to tell you.

436
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:25,920
I have to go.

437
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,979
Where are we going?

438
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,410
Well,

439
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,380
shall we ride up to the stone pile?

440
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,219
We can get tteokbokki on the way back.

441
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,249
Sounds good.

442
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,350
Where are you going?

443
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,450
Mom. Mr. Kim is taking us out
to ride our bikes.

444
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:02,219
We'll go to the pile of stones.

445
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,989
The kids wanted some air.

446
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,229
Did they?

447
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,430
It's cold. Tae Ri,
aren't your clothes too thin?

448
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,729
Will this do?

449
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,370
I think he'll be fine.

450
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:19,170
Have fun. I'll make you spaghetti.

451
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,380
She said she'd make spaghetti.

452
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:23,039
Quack, quack.

453
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,279
Let's go, then.

454
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,860
Don't you think
this is too much like a family?

455
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,489
Mom.

456
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,600
Yes, Tae Ri. Hi.

457
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,229
How dare you come here?

458
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:46,630
I missed Tae Ri.

459
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,400
- Who, you?
- Yes.

460
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,090
Let's have lunch together.

461
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,130
What do you want, Tae Ri?

462
00:27:14,229 --> 00:27:16,059
Mom will take you to have something nice.

463
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,729
No, wait.

464
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,400
It's cold. Will you two wait in the salon?

465
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:23,739
- Yes.
- Go on.

466
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,650
You were a pretty good guy.

467
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,519
I didn't see that until now.

468
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:39,350
We were together for years.

469
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,059
Now you suddenly see it?

470
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,390
I did as you said...

471
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,029
and spent the time to see how I felt.

472
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,330
And now I see you in a new light.

473
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:52,529
You were so warm.

474
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,769
I was warm?

475
00:27:55,069 --> 00:27:57,170
Didn't you like hot and fiery love?

476
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,870
Have those flames died out?

477
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,809
I thought we never had a fiery love.

478
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,809
We had embers that lasted longer.

479
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,519
You're really quite interesting.

480
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:15,319
You asked me what I wanted to do with you.

481
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:17,660
I thought about it.

482
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:19,989
I think...

483
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,860
I don't want to divorce you.

484
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,130
What?

485
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:50,059
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

486
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,180
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

487
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,680
Woo Sang is getting married.

488
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,920
Why must you both lose your men
to the girls in that family?

489
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,650
My younger brother is
getting married there that day too.

490
00:29:17,749 --> 00:29:20,120
Who's your younger brother?

491
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:21,319
Jeong Woo Sang.

492
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:24,219
You don't have a thing
with our homeowner, do you?

493
00:29:24,219 --> 00:29:25,789
Can I ask for his help?

494
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:26,860
To be your husband?

495
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,799
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
