1
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:39,069
I saw your wife. At a bar.

2
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,339
She was with some guy.

3
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:43,209
They could've been friends.

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,610
I thought it was something else.

5
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,260
Hello. Yes, hi.

6
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,599
Give me three more days.

7
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,599
- Boss.
- What?

8
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,209
The indoor playground client said
they sent the money, but it's not here.

9
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:18,239
I had to put money down
on some building materials,

10
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,480
so I wired it right away.

11
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,080
Can I have the receipt, then?

12
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,149
Leave it. I'll take care of it.

13
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,220
You can just go home.

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Now?

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,119
Young people these days keep going on
about work-life balance.

16
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,890
Leave before the rush hour.

17
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,560
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

18
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,959
I'll actually leave, then.

19
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,690
- Go.
- Can I really go?

20
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,690
Yes.

21
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,060
I'm off, then.

22
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,300
(Jeil Interior Design)

23
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:46,700
Goodness...

24
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,239
Mom.

25
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,019
My gosh...

26
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:04,920
Darn it.

27
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,390
She spilled soda?

28
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:15,700
She never wipes anything she spills.

29
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,269
What a mess.

30
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:22,070
My gosh.

31
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,410
Oh, dear.

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
What's this?

33
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,420
Why would she buy this?

34
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,550
Oh, my gosh. When did you come in?

35
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,920
I am your mom,
but you should still call ahead.

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,589
Did you buy this lottery ticket?

37
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:41,719
No. Where would I get the money for it?

38
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,730
You didn't buy this?

39
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,059
I didn't. Where did you find it?

40
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,700
Oh, it must've
fallen out of Seon Ju's bag.

41
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,899
It must be a dud.

42
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:54,100
Why else would she have
left it in her bag?

43
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,809
Are you moving back into
your company dorm?

44
00:02:58,339 --> 00:02:59,380
Yes.

45
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:01,380
Goodness.

46
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:03,309
Hey, Nam Jin.

47
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Are you...

48
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,050
seeing someone on the side?

49
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,119
No.

50
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,350
My goodness...

51
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,860
I'm starving.

52
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,070
How do you manage to sleep?

53
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,839
You caused a massive disaster
and lost your job,

54
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,410
and you can still sleep?

55
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:32,910
So well.

56
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,910
I must've been under a lot of stress.

57
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,450
I think this is
a blessed holiday disguised as...

58
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,019
a massive disaster so I can take a break.

59
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:47,320
You pretended to be smart and said
we should find the money ourselves...

60
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,589
instead of relying on Mom's rich friend,
so what have you been doing?

61
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:52,700
I got some before I went to bed.

62
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,700
How?

63
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,800
I texted Jin Chu Ah
and told her to wire my pay.

64
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,640
I'm expecting it soon.

65
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,070
Didn't you just irritate her even more
when we needed to settle?

66
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,040
No. You have no idea how polite I was.

67
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,809
The consultant told me the settlement
and my pay were separate issues.

68
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,219
You know nothing about
law or labor or employment.

69
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,390
What?

70
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,760
Oh, gosh. I'm so hungry.

71
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,489
Good for you.

72
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:24,290
You know a lot about the law
because you were in so much trouble.

73
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,030
- Hey. Are the towels dry?
- Yes?

74
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,329
I just got them off the line.
I'll fold them for you.

75
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:33,040
Couldn't you have folded them
so they'd be ready sooner?

76
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,939
Why are there crumbs on the floor?

77
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,639
Did you not vacuum today?

78
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,840
I vacuumed yesterday.

79
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,639
You must vacuum once a day.

80
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,280
Your son brings in so much dust and sand.

81
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:44,980
What's for dinner?

82
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,819
There are still leftovers
from Nam Jin's failed welcome feast.

83
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:50,319
I was going to make bibimbab
or fried rice with that.

84
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,819
I have no appetite at all.

85
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:54,960
Make some green onion kimchi.

86
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,360
Okay.

87
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,660
Mom, I'm home.

88
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,059
- I'm home, Grandma.
- Yes, hi.

89
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,030
Hey, dust yourself off
before you come inside.

90
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,369
Do you know how much dust
and sand you bring in?

91
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:07,739
Do you wrestle in the sand or something?

92
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:10,670
Wash your hands
before you do anything else!

93
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:15,449
What I say...

94
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,309
carries less weight than a dog's bark.

95
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:21,319
Darn it.

96
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,230
- Wash your hands before you snack.
- Okay.

97
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,069
Goodness.

98
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,540
Seon Ju.

99
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,540
Let's break up.

100
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:50,949
Living with you...

101
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,319
is just too tiring.

102
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,730
(Gwangseong)

103
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,759
Hi. Come in.

104
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,030
You're home early.

105
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,470
Yes. My boss let me off early.

106
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,710
What's the occasion?

107
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,710
Did you do a deep clean?
The place looks different.

108
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:22,850
I needed some cheering up.

109
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,749
I'm the one who needs some cheering up.

110
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,050
Why?

111
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:28,989
Just because.

112
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:32,460
I'm the eldest, but I'm no help at all
when we're in trouble.

113
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,590
I don't know if it's me, but it feels like
everyone looks down on me.

114
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:38,900
I hate my life.

115
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:42,470
"If only my husband were alive."

116
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,670
I keep wondering.

117
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:48,100
I do nothing but cook
and clean all day long,

118
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:51,470
so Mom and Mi Ju think of me as a helper.

119
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,179
They don't. Why would you think so?

120
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,980
I wish I had a job
that paid me every month.

121
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,619
Would that give me some self-esteem?

122
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,249
Have some self-esteem. Why shouldn't you?

123
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:08,960
There's something
women with a husband and a job don't know.

124
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,829
I brought some leftover sujebi dough
from today's lunch.

125
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,499
Eat it when you're hungry.

126
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,770
Let's eat that now.

127
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:22,540
It looks great.

128
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:25,840
Why did you deep clean the apartment?

129
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,980
You do something physical
when you're angry.

130
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,280
Are you and Nam Jin
still trying to work things out?

131
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,780
Don't ask.

132
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,920
Sort it out soon.

133
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,619
Your husband can be a jerk,

134
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:38,819
but at least he's alive.

135
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,420
That's more than enough.

136
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:43,059
Be good to him while he still breathes.

137
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,030
I want to,

138
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,929
but he never gives me the chance.

139
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:53,139
- He wants a divorce.
- What?

140
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,970
No way. Don't ever split up.

141
00:07:57,739 --> 00:08:00,340
If you two split up while
we're trying to fund Mi Ju's settlement...

142
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,650
I'm widowed,
and that's more than enough for us.

143
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:05,480
Don't you dare end up single again.

144
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,020
I can't do that.

145
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:11,590
But how am I to sort this out with him?

146
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,889
I don't even know what the problem is.

147
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,730
I apologized for everything
I thought offended him,

148
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:20,600
tried to understand everything,

149
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,770
and didn't interfere at all.

150
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,900
That's the problem.

151
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,439
You left him alone for too long.

152
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,869
Do you do it these days?

153
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,939
- What?
- You know,

154
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:36,449
if you're physically apart for too long,
your mind drifts apart too.

155
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,449
You were apart for years.

156
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,780
It would be weird
if you didn't have problems.

157
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:43,750
All he had to do was study for a while,

158
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,959
but then he came back and saw you again.

159
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,189
Reality hit him,
but he didn't feel like doing anything.

160
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:52,530
That was why he used work as an excuse
and moved into the dorm.

161
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,530
It's not like that.

162
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,500
That's 100 percent the issue
for all married couples.

163
00:08:58,069 --> 00:08:59,699
There's only one solution.

164
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,740
Physical proximity will warm him up.

165
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,410
You must get busy in the bedroom
as much as possible.

166
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,939
That's really important.

167
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:07,740
Is it?

168
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:10,209
You know...

169
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:12,979
a great deal in that department.

170
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,620
I do. No one knows or appreciates it,

171
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,490
but I know a great deal about it.

172
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,420
An unfamiliar studio apartment.

173
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,920
That could be a huge benefit.

174
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,630
A new location can be stimulating.

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,030
You know,

176
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:31,699
my husband and I
used to meet up at a motel.

177
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,240
For real?

178
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:39,679
He looked frail and impotent,

179
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,380
but he was anything but.

180
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,380
My gosh.

181
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:46,479
It takes some work.

182
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:49,189
You need to set the atmosphere and stuff.

183
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:51,719
Was that why he died before his time?

184
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:54,359
I sometimes wonder
if I'm guilty of draining his essence.

185
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,859
Anyway, I'm saying
you need to be proactive.

186
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,800
Do things like this.

187
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,800
Men want that more than you think.

188
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,000
No.

189
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,240
When I tried to make a move,

190
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,809
he seemed disgusted.

191
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:17,209
I bet you made the move
without setting the mood.

192
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,150
I don't have to see to know.

193
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,689
You should wait for the right time.

194
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:28,760
I'd have done such a good job
if my husband were alive.

195
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:31,589
You have a husband
to do it with if you want to.

196
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,229
Nam Jin is still around.

197
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,740
Actually, Nam Jin did buy me...

198
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,880
a suggestive gift.

199
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,490
This is it.

200
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,089
Nam Jin dropped the hint, then.

201
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:05,189
Are you that thick?

202
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,900
- Was I?
- You idiot.

203
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,599
You have zero wit or passion.
What do you have?

204
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:12,370
Get over there right now.

205
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,770
Forget it.

206
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,809
Ji Hyun can spend the night with us.

207
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,140
Do as your big sister says.

208
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,559
- Are you Jin Chu Ah?
- Who are you?

209
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,589
The assistant director.
Here's your script.

210
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:37,630
Okay.

211
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:42,770
Come this way.

212
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,109
You're pretty connected, Sang Ah.

213
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,179
I demanded a favor in return for
keeping quiet about your affair,

214
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,910
but I didn't think you'd do it.

215
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,079
You actually got me a part
in Woo Sang's drama.

216
00:11:59,349 --> 00:12:02,020
It's unbelievable.
So why didn't you help me out before?

217
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:05,920
We're even now.

218
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:07,660
Don't make any more demands.

219
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,260
Does she like Jeong Woo Sang that much?

220
00:12:12,229 --> 00:12:15,300
(Head of Interior, Jin Sang Ah)

221
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,500
I moved my things.

222
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:23,809
Come in.

223
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,809
What is it?

224
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:32,579
- Let's talk.
- Talk.

225
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,949
Not here.

226
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,849
Let's go elsewhere.

227
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,359
I'm busy right now.

228
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,729
Then let's meet somewhere after work.

229
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:45,689
Can't we talk at home in the evening?

230
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,699
I'm meeting someone after work.

231
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:50,000
- Who?
- A client.

232
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,699
Which client?

233
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,640
Do you know all my clients?

234
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:56,439
It's our first meeting.

235
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,510
Okay.

236
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:03,050
Can I tag along?

237
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:05,949
What's up with you?
Don't you have anything to do?

238
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,819
Did you deal with Mr. Hwang's complaint?

239
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:10,349
Oh, right.

240
00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:12,689
My car is all fixed.

241
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,490
You can take yours back.

242
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,969
Call me after the meeting.

243
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:37,109
What's up with him?

244
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,449
Is it about Tae Ri?

245
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,819
The international school?

246
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:48,390
- Let's eat. I'm hungry.
- Okay.

247
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:52,530
Woo Sang!

248
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,229
What are you doing here?

249
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:57,130
I'm joining your drama.

250
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,929
As the villainess' sister from the US.

251
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,469
Didn't a girl group singer get that role?

252
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,969
She fell from the stage and hurt herself.

253
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,140
Now you can see me every day.

254
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,179
What the heck?

255
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:10,949
Did you bring the memory card?

256
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:12,949
Oh, that jacket.

257
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,920
It's at a dry cleaner's.

258
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:17,520
- What?
- What if it's damaged?

259
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:20,120
Do you really need it?

260
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,760
Well...

261
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,660
Too bad if it's damaged.

262
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:11,370
Help me out tonight.

263
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,140
No one wants to hire you, I heard.

264
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,510
Help me at the salon,
and I'll pay you five dollars an hour.

265
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:20,219
Unlike Jin Ju,
you're good with your hands.

266
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,380
We're done, ma'am.

267
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,120
Hey.

268
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,219
Be sure to wash her hair
until it's nice and clean.

269
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,390
- I need to go to the toilet.
- Okay.

270
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,660
Come this way, please.

271
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,839
(Deposited: 2,000, Balance: 2,001.20,
Buja Bank, Jin Chu Ah)

272
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,709
She paid me for the whole month.

273
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,349
Not bad, Jin Chu Ah.

274
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,449
Yes.

275
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,319
Oh, no.

276
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:55,920
- What was that?
- I'm so sorry.

277
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,949
Oh, my gosh.

278
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,189
What a mess.

279
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,890
What's the matter with you?

280
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,559
I'll tell your mother.

281
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,329
- I'm a mess.
- I'm so sorry.

282
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:07,800
Oh, no. My eyes.

283
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,500
Darn you.

284
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,969
I'm really sorry.

285
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,510
Hey, kid.

286
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,309
- Do you live here?
- Yes.

287
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,250
Can you sign for this piece of mail?

288
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,380
Good job.

289
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,290
- Thanks.
- Bye.

290
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:33,390
A law firm?

291
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,260
What's this?

292
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,530
(Head of Planning, Kim So Woo)

293
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:56,050
- Hello?
- Is this Tae Ri's father?

294
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:58,550
He disappeared.

295
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,280
What? When?

296
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,819
Where?

297
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,260
(Team Leader's Office, Kim So Woo)

298
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,390
I'll be right there.

299
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:19,129
- Tae Ri.
- I think he got outside.

300
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,940
- He looked down this morning.
- Tae Ri!

301
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,369
- Tae Ri.
- Is something wrong at home?

302
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,349
Tae Ri.

303
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:34,879
Tae Ri.

304
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,559
Where on earth is he?

305
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,190
Tae Ri. What are you doing here?

306
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,899
Everyone is so worried about you.

307
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:23,970
My goodness.

308
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,770
How did you get here?

309
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,050
Tae Ri. Did you make a wish?

310
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,550
Grandma said...

311
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,690
I should go to Jeju Island.

312
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,050
What?

313
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:48,159
My teacher said,

314
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,530
"I heard you were going to
go to a nice school."

315
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,540
You said we'd live with Mom
in a house like the three bears.

316
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,770
You said I wouldn't have to go.

317
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,940
You won't.

318
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:07,339
You don't have to go.

319
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:09,339
Grandma said...

320
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,349
I shouldn't bother Mom and Dad.

321
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:17,290
If I brush my teeth on my own...

322
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,960
and do everything else on my own,
will I not be a bother?

323
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,930
I want to live with Mom and Dad.

324
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:05,970
Yes.

325
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:07,839
I found him.

326
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:10,839
Okay, bye.

327
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,389
Tae Ri. Dad will stay
right by your side...

328
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,790
until you say...

329
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,730
you don't need me anymore
and that I'm a nuisance.

330
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,040
- Will you really?
- You bet.

331
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,510
Even when I'm 10? Or 100 years old?

332
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,740
Even when you're middle-aged
and I'm old-aged.

333
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:48,839
I promise.

334
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:53,180
Now that I promised,

335
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,619
you can't walk off
on your own again, okay?

336
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,889
Shall we go for a walk?
We haven't done that in a while.

337
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,290
Let's go.

338
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,359
I wonder what the code is.

339
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,159
It's not Ji Hyun's birthday.

340
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,369
It's not my birthday.

341
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:59,309
No way. It's his birthday.

342
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,450
Well, I feel bad to sneak in uninvited,

343
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,379
but if I called ahead, he'd only complain.

344
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:10,450
Surprise.

345
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,069
Tae Ri.

346
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,940
Go to your room.
I have to go back to the office.

347
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,990
Gosh, your car...

348
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,550
It's a great drive.

349
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,589
(Ji Hyun's mom)

350
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,500
Honey. Do you get off late today?

351
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,430
- Why?
- When do you return to the dorm?

352
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,399
I'll be there soon. Why?

353
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:33,440
It's nothing. Get back safely.

354
00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:35,569
- What's that about?
- What's what about?

355
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,339
Was it Seon Ju?

356
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:39,369
It's nothing.

357
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,980
Let's go inside.

358
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,909
My goodness.

359
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,040
I don't believe it.

360
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:14,210
It suits me so well.

361
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,440
He chose well.

362
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:19,349
I'm so excited.

363
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,119
Oh, I'm dizzy.

364
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,990
Hang on.

365
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,359
Is this a stomach ache?

366
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,430
Darn it. Right now?

367
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,079
You're so silly.

368
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,530
Be careful.

369
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:21,000
Stop it.

370
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,569
Come on.

371
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:24,940
- What are you doing?
- Keep still.

372
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,510
- Keep still, will you?
- Don't.

373
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,280
Stop it.

375
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,639
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

376
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:33,780
You're not even human!

377
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,579
How could you do this to me?

378
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:38,450
She came to help me
put on pain relief patches.

379
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,250
Do you think I'm stupid?

380
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,750
Aren't you ashamed at all?

381
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,950
I'm your husband!

382
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,760
Now that you know,
will you divorce me or something?

383
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:48,260
Why did you marry me?

384
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:49,460
Let's get divorced.

385
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,159
How could you say that?

386
00:28:52,889 --> 00:28:54,899
