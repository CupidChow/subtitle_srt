(Jeil Interior Design)

2
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,190
Shoot.

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,560
Darn it.

4
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,020
Where do you think you're going?

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,950
Tell us where your boss went.

6
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,019
There's no way you don't know anything.

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,990
I really don't know anything.

8
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,369
Give me that.

9
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,900
Wait.

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,740
He called her yesterday...

11
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,000
when he ignored our calls.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,570
- Really? Let me see.
- You're right.

13
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:02,979
You can't go through my phone like that.

14
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,040
Give it back.

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,049
Why won't you let us look
if you have nothing to hide?

16
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,190
Oh, no!

17
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,490
Darn it.

18
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:30,400
I just paid it off.

19
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,639
You went and smashed the touchscreen!

20
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,809
My goodness...

21
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,309
You're not leaving.

22
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:41,350
- Get back in here!
- Let me go!

23
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,850
You can't leave.

24
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,949
- Let me go. I have to go!
- No way!

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,790
I have to go!

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,460
(Episode 17)

27
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,960
Where did I put my phone?

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,900
Oh, here it is.

29
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:06,969
What's this?

30
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:18,279
Oh, my gosh.

31
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,550
Oh, no...

32
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:24,789
What should we do now?

33
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,270
(Manjang Kindergarten)

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,629
Did your parents say they'd come for you?

35
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:37,099
Yes. They're both supposed to come.

36
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,969
Oh, really?

37
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,550
Now I need a new phone.

38
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:49,180
A phone is nothing
compared to what we lost.

39
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,219
I lost a small fortune.

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,289
I lost way more than you.

41
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:55,719
At least three times more.

42
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:58,789
What? Are you saying
what I lost is nothing?

43
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,490
- Darn you.
- You dare pick a fight with me?

44
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:03,230
- Jae Il.
- Yes?

45
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,360
Who do you think lost more between us two?

46
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,830
You did, of course.

47
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:09,439
Listen.

48
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,170
Carpentry and Demolishing
think they're better than us.

49
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,539
- How dare you?
- Watch what you say!

50
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,640
Come at me. Punch me, then.

51
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,150
- You can't.
- I so can.

52
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,909
- Come at me.
- What?

53
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,879
- Let's fight!
- Don't fight!

54
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,219
- My goodness.
- Get back here.

55
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:27,089
- No!
- Come here!

56
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:29,589
- Let's see who wins.
- We'll fight it out.

57
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:31,619
- You can't beat me.
- Yes, I can!

58
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,159
You have no hair to pull out!

59
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,460
- Darn you!
- Know your place!

60
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,059
How dare you think
your money means more than mine?

61
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,800
How dare you say that?

62
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,730
What gives you the right to say that?

63
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,839
Darn you all.

64
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:44,400
Come here, you.

65
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:47,369
I'll put you in your place, you fool.

66
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,610
- Darn you.
- Let go of me!

67
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,050
How dare he punch me in the face?

68
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,990
Darn it.

69
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,189
The three of us
will at least walk around a park.

70
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:08,460
Do the bare minimum
before asking for a divorce.

71
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:10,129
Can't you even do that?

72
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:13,670
Darn.

73
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,539
It hurts each time I walk.

74
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,939
It still hurts.

75
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,880
That punk.

76
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:27,310
- You got hurt?
- Goodness.

77
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:30,080
- I should just...
- What...

78
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,349
Were you in a fight?

79
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,049
Goodness.

80
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,919
Did my husband do that to you?

81
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,159
It's bearable.

82
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,400
Darn it.

83
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,099
I need to clock off early today.

84
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:49,169
Why? Do you have a family business?

85
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,339
I need to wrap things up with my wife.

86
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:54,339
You can do that later, after work.

87
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,010
She wants me to spend time with Ji Hyun.

88
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:00,810
I'll do that,
and then finalize the divorce.

89
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,380
Don't you see she's using your kid
to make you stay?

90
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,789
Say you can't make it.

91
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,020
Spend the evening with me.

92
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:12,260
He caught us, and we hit rock bottom.

93
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:14,630
I don't want to be alone tonight.

94
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:21,770
Fine, then.

95
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,510
Sorry. Let's go to the park another time.

96
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,839
Okay?

97
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,150
(Manjang Kindergarten)

98
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:38,080
Goodness.

99
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,650
Ms. Pi. It won't even turn on now.

100
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,989
You're not going anywhere...

101
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,760
until your boss comes back.

102
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,229
We'll all die here.

103
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,659
Aren't you guys hungry?

104
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:27,770
Well,

105
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:29,370
I am a bit hungry.

106
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,799
You're the youngest. Get us some food.

107
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,669
Darn it!

108
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,419
Oh, my gosh...

109
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,630
You got a new car?

110
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:57,060
The other one is too flashy,
so I drive this now.

111
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,760
It's my mom's car. Get in.

112
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:15,979
Hello?

113
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:18,349
What?

114
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Okay.

115
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:23,960
What is it?

116
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:26,330
My wife didn't come to the kindergarten.

117
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,859
What? You texted her earlier.

118
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:31,529
The phone is turned off.
Transferring to voicemail.

119
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,599
I should get over there.

120
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:38,200
I hate abrupt stops and detours
more than anything...

121
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,370
when I'm on the road somewhere.

122
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:42,909
It's time to choose.

123
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:44,909
Is it me or your family?

124
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,679
I need to pick up my kid.

125
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,950
Can't you be more understanding?

126
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:59,989
Jin Chu Ah.

127
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:03,299
You said you'd make the family wail.
How is that going?

128
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:13,409
Ji Hyun was in such a good mood
about going to a park with both parents.

129
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:17,179
- I apologize.
- Be sure to pick her up on time.

130
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:18,479
That's best for her too.

131
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,750
We can't let this happen again.

132
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:22,750
- Okay.
- Bye.

133
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:25,150
Did you wait for a long time?

134
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:32,190
What on earth is this?
It's certified mail.

135
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,929
We're to cough up 35,000 dollars
for repairs done to the car,

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and there's extra for physical therapy
according to the attached doctor's note?

137
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,500
What on earth... Oh, save me.

138
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,939
- Mom.
- Mom.

139
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,840
What will you do about this now?

140
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,480
The phone is turned off.

141
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,650
- Transferring to voicemail.
- Darn Seon Ju.

142
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,819
Why is her phone turned off?

143
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,750
You two. Go get Seon Ju.

144
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,919
Go to her place... No.

145
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,159
Go to her office...

146
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:05,990
No. I'll go myself.

147
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,730
No, Mom. I'll go.

148
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:10,100
You need to stay here and cool down.

149
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,130
I don't know how to cool down.

150
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,199
- See you.
- No. I'll go.

151
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:17,069
You stay here with Mom.

152
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,840
See you later.

153
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,209
Hey. Shall I come too?

154
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,409
Stay here.

155
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:25,279
This is killing me. I can't just sit here.

156
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:27,750
I don't know how to cool down.

157
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:33,919
Is no one home?

158
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,559
She hasn't been stocking up her fridge.

159
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:43,100
Darn it.

160
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,240
This should last me a week.

161
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,209
What's this?

162
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,909
Did she welcome home her husband
in a shirt with a stretched-out neck?

163
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,079
No wonder he fell out of love.

164
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,880
Goodness.

165
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,350
Sirs.

166
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:10,990
Instead of waiting here aimlessly,

167
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,630
how about we scatter...

168
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,730
and think about what to do next?

169
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,559
Then we can regroup.

170
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:19,370
Scatter where?

171
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:22,000
If we scatter, the chances of us
getting our money back get even slimmer.

172
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,740
- Don't you think of going anywhere.
- That's right.

173
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,640
Until your boss comes back
and we get a hold of him,

174
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,709
you're stuck with us.

175
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,840
- Me?
- Yes.

176
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:34,110
As his employee,
you're partially responsible.

177
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,150
He won't show up
however long you keep me hostage.

178
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,020
Instead of sitting here...

179
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,360
Okay, then. Instead of sitting here,
let's go out and look for him.

180
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,159
Let's search every place he could've gone.

181
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,029
Come on. Get up.

182
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,799
- Me?
- Yes.

183
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,199
Yes. You must know his hangouts.
Lead the way.

184
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,240
Are you thinking of sneaking off too?

185
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,439
Goodness, no.

186
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,409
Why would I sneak off
when I didn't take...

187
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:03,939
any of your money?

188
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:07,049
Sirs.

189
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:11,449
From tomorrow onward,
I'll go anywhere you want,

190
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:13,520
wherever in the country it is.

191
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:16,520
Can you let me go home just for the day?

192
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,919
I have to handle something personal.

193
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,230
- No way!
- No way!

194
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,159
I really need to handle something!

195
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,659
We all have to!

196
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,470
Your boss had problems and stuff too.

197
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,240
We're in this mess because he begged
and we let him pay us a few months later.

198
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:32,640
She's married to a guy who got
a master's degree from overseas.

199
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,039
She'd never understand our desperation.

200
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:36,880
She even dresses differently
now that he's back.

201
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,419
He's having an affair.

202
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,789
What?

203
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,419
The guy with a master's degree
from overseas.

204
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,789
He has another woman
and won't even come home.

205
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:55,529
You all know...

206
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,529
how hard I worked to support him
until he got that degree, right?

207
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,169
But as soon as he got back...

208
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,439
Is that so?

209
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,610
He wanted to leave,
but I begged and pleaded with him to stay.

210
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,409
I barely got him to agree
to spend time with me and our kid.

211
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:14,209
If you keep me here
and end up breaking up my marriage,

212
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:15,750
will you make up for it?

213
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,990
Well, we can't be responsible
for something like that.

214
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,090
Exactly.

215
00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:23,319
I should go, right?

216
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,959
Let's drink.

217
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:28,329
It hurt badly when I got hit on my head.

218
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:30,360
- It hurt, didn't it?
- Yes.

219
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,299
- I was hit really hard.
- You were.

00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:49,179
What kept you?

223
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:50,949
You acted like
you cared so much about Ji Hyun.

224
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,620
Are you out of your mind?

225
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,250
Things at the office got a bit crazy.
I barely got out.

226
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,159
I'll get Ji Hyun something to eat
then take her home.

227
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:00,929
You can go ahead.

228
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,730

- Let's go, Ji Hyun.

- Get in.
- Honey.

231
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,400
Are you really leaving without me?

232
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,970
Honey.

233
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,669

Honey.

236
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,279
My gosh.

237
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,590

239
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:41,630
Get back in. Start the engine.

240
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:43,069
- What for?
- Just do it.

241
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:49,809
What's the matter?

242
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:51,980
We just got bombed.

243
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,750
Let's hurry.

244
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,789
If you pick her over my sister,

245
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,689
I'll get back at you for her.

246
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,059
Do whatever you want.

247
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:09,329
Don't you dare choose her.

248
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,130
I'll show you how hot fire can burn.

249
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,130
Fine. Then let's all crash and burn!

250
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:15,230
Cut!

251
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:17,240
Goodness.

252
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:21,110
Did you get better at acting
or is this character like the real you?

253
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,840
You're a true villainess.

254
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,980
Woo Sang,
let's continue with your next scene.

255
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,949
- Okay.
- Good job, everyone.

256
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:30,779
Ms. Oh, I'm done.

257
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,090
- Let's go.
- Okay.

258
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,659
Mom likes sandwiches too.

259
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,970
Enjoy yourself.

262
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,919
Sang Ah, what brings you here?

263
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,720
I want a shoulder massage.

264
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,890
Do you?

265
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,789
- You heard her. Set things up.
- Okay.

266
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,429
Go on inside when she's ready.

267
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:16,400
I have an important guest.
I'll see you later.

268
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,730
- Okay.
- Sit and wait.

269
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,870
Seon Ju wouldn't lie about that.

270
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:29,140
Her phone's turned off.
Something's definitely up.

271
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:33,449
I need to pick up my kid.

272
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:35,750
Can't you be more understanding?

273
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:41,949
He's a devoted dad.

274
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,220
And he trusts his wife too.

275
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:46,659
And he'll get divorced?

276
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:49,189
As if he could manage that.

278
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,370
What does this say? You read it out.

279
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,470
Goodness. Let's see.

280
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,179
We must pay 35,000 dollars
for repairs done to the car...

281
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,010
and 5,000 dollars for physical therapy
according to the attached doctor's note.

282
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,750
We must also pay compensation...

283
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,679
for the psychiatric injury caused by...

284
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,720
the trauma of construction material
falling on the victim's head.

285
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,159
Including the estimated loss of profits
due to the victim...

286
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,390
being unable to attend auditions,
the total...

287
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:24,929
we must pay the victim is 55,000 dollars.

288
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,600
If we don't pay
within one month of receiving this letter,

289
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,569
they'll assume
we're unwilling to cooperate...

290
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:34,909
and will take legal measures
such as sequestration...

291
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:36,409
and press criminal charges?

292
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,150
So if we don't pay them
55,000 dollars by the 15th of next month,

293
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:44,319
they'll take our assets...

294
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,150
and put her back behind bars?

295
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,390
What's with your friend?

296
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,390
You said she'd follow the legal process.

297
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,520
You said she didn't bear a grudge.

298
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,760
She doesn't.

299
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,760
We weren't exactly close,

300
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:59,630
but I didn't do anything
to make her hate me this much.

301
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,970
We didn't care about each other
when we were in school.

302
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:04,840
Is it you, then?

303
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,370
Did you upset the actress you worked for?

304
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:11,209
No. I didn't do anything to make her
hate me this much until the accident.

305
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,310
Is this how she's paying you back
for asking her to pay you?

306
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,620
It's not.

307
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:18,719
If this were to come in the mail,

308
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,360
she'd have had to set things in motion
long before I asked her to pay me.

309
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:26,729
Mom, do you think
your friend has it in for you?

310
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:28,229
My goodness.

311
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,600
All I did was take her in
and feed her and help her.

312
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:33,300
Why would she hate me?

313
00:17:34,699 --> 00:17:38,140
That's it. The whole family is crazy.

314
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,269
Yes.

315
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,840
There's no way of explaining this
if they don't hate us...

316
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,580
or if they're not crazy.

317
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,350
I should go and talk to them once more.

318
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,479
I'll go too.

319
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,979
Yes. We should all go.

320
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,419
Let's go.

321
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:56,350
I'll come too.

Now that you know,

325
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:13,310
will you divorce me or something?

326
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,769
- Get my phone.
- Okay.

327
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,150
Hello?

328
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,150
Where are you?

329
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:07,459
I'm not in the office.

330
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:08,860
Let's talk.

331
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,130
Say it now.

332
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,469
I'll leave and take Tae Ri with me.

333
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:16,939
What does that mean?

334
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:18,570
Whether we divorce or not,

335
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:21,540
living in the same house
in these circumstances...

336
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,540
won't do us any good.

337
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:27,679
Do you want us to separate?

338
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,179
While we're apart,

339
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:32,019
both you and I should do some thinking.

340
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:35,019
If you feel the same
after we spend time apart,

341
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,659
then I'll respect your wishes.

342
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:48,600
Are you ready to leave?

343
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:52,340
Yes. Do you have something to talk about?

344
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,780
No. I was wondering
if we could go home together.

345
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:00,050
Please, take a seat.

346
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,820
- Are you done?
- Yes.

347
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,429
You look extra tired these days.

348
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,729
Take some time off too.

349
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,900
I will.

00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,040
- Actually...
- Do you have something to say?

she was out before putting her on?

362
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:05,509
No. Please leave.

363
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,610
It won't take long.

364
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,350
Yes. Call her for us.

365
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,679
Soon Ae, I'm glad we met.

366
00:21:11,949 --> 00:21:14,790
How could you do such a thing?

367
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,390
- Move. You're in my way.
- What?

368
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:19,159
- Go back to your seats.
- Okay.

369
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:20,830
My goodness.

370
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:22,229
Go on, Mom.

371
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:23,999
What?

372
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,870
I don't believe this.

373
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,100
- Hey.
- Why did you come here again?

374
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,239
You want us to pay even more than
the amount we first agreed on.

375
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,409
Weren't you two close friends?

376
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,340
Take a look at this.
It's not right, is it?

377
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:40,050
This letter.

378
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:42,909
Instead of letting us off,
you're bleeding us dry!

379
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,320
We didn't say we wouldn't pay up.

380
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:48,550
We asked you to allow us
to pay you in installments over time.

381
00:21:48,949 --> 00:21:53,530
Shouldn't you have at least shown
some effort to reduce the amount?

382
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,229
When did you ask to reduce the amount?

383
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:58,330
Instead of showing remorse,

384
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,669
- you acted like you were on a picnic.
- What's going on?

385
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:02,570
Do you have a grudge against me?

386
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:04,600
Say so if you do!

387
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,340
Is this the police?

388
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,570
Are you acting like this
because you're successful?

389
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:11,040
My gosh. How could you do this to me?

390
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,679
How could someone change so drastically?

391
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,979
Years ago...

392
00:22:14,979 --> 00:22:17,350
You keep bringing up the past...

393
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,320
and acting like I owe you a great deal.

394
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:24,159
Yes. You did say this and that
and lectured me a bit.

395
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:26,189
Let's say I'm in your debt for that.

396
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,100
So what? Now that I look like
I'm doing well for myself,

397
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:31,999
do you want me to repay you?

398
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,499
What did you say?

399
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:38,239
The way you're acting says exactly that.

400
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:40,570
Don't you think that's a bit harsh?

401
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:52,949
Ms. Oh. You're so elegant
even when you exercise.

402
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:55,249
No one is more elegant than your mother.

403
00:22:56,019 --> 00:22:58,090
She's named "Grace" for a reason.

404
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:03,330
You're the person in the proverb
that says we shouldn't...

405
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,830
take anyone in because they'll betray you!

406
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,429
What's your problem?

407
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:11,340
What do you think you did for me
that you keep saying you took me in?

408
00:23:11,469 --> 00:23:13,870
Enough with the nuisance. Get out.

409
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,070
This is my business.

410
00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:18,040
- I'm glad this is your business!
- Oh, my gosh.

411
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,150
- Goodness.
- I'll tell all your customers...

412
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,380
just how rude you are
and how little you think...

413
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,219
of people who did you a favor.

414
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:27,919
Listen, everyone! Shim Soon Ae here...

415
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,150
Be quiet!

416
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:31,219
You're the loudest person here!

417
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,390
- What's going on?
- Ms. Oh.

418
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:34,830
Goodbye.

419
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,100
Don't you leave before hearing me out!

420
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,669
My goodness. What was all that about?

421
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:44,169
Oh, my gosh.

422
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:45,840
(Grace Shim Beauty Studio)

423
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:47,870
I'm not loud at all.

424
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,269
What's going on here?

425
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:50,810
How dare you all?

426
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,749
What are you doing here, lady?

427
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,350
We're here to complain
about the letter you sent.

428
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:00,290
How dare you take that tone with me?

429
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,120
I no longer work for you,
so I'll talk however I want.

430
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,360
Yes! You're equals since you fired her!

431
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:07,489
You don't care because you got paid?

432
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,929
That's right!

433
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,130
You're out of your mind.

434
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:15,229
Dad.

435
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,169
Did you sleep well on your own last night?

436
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,570
Yes.

437
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,909
Will you sleep at home tonight?

438
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:24,739
Tae Ri.

439
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,749
I want to talk to you about something.

440
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,989
We talked about living with Mom
in a sweet home like the three bears.

441
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,159
How about you and I
do that on our own first?

442
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,860
- What?
- We'll move out first...

443
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:45,699
and go on an adventure
to find our sweet home.

444
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:48,330
When we find a nice place, we'll tell Mom.

445
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,630
When?

446
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:51,140
Today?

447
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,239
You're supposed to set off
on an adventure as soon as you decide to.

448
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:56,509
What do you think?

449
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,320
Oh, that was where one of you was hiding.

450
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,650
Don't you think this is too much?

451
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,689
- What do you mean?
- Look at your sister.

452
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:11,790
She's full of energy,
and we must pay 5,000 for her treatment?

453
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,860
What's that about
the trauma and loss of profits?

454
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,229
You're going too far.

455
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:18,729
So what? You can't pay up?

456
00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:20,330
I'm not saying we can't.

457
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:21,929
She should be in bed...

458
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:24,300
with a broken limb
if you want to charge that much.

459
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,800
Are you saying
her doctor's note was a forgery?

460
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,969
No. You said you got a doctor's note,
so we got curious.

461
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,739
After the accident, she got fired.

462
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:34,409
You called me as if you'd settle with us
for less and mocked me.

463
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:37,080
And then you sent a letter
demanding we pay you this much.

464
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,749
Either your family
has something against mine...

465
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:42,350
Or your family is a bunch of psychopaths.

466
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:44,320
- What?
- Are you trying to...

467
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,159
take our money to fill your pockets?

468
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,659
Do they think we can't laugh?

469
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:52,959
My goodness.

470
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:54,729
Oh, gosh.

471
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:01,040
Mom!

472
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:06,280
Mom?

473
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,209
She's not home.

474
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,019
The phone is turned off. Transferring...

475
00:26:15,249 --> 00:26:16,449
Goodness.

476
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,019
Where did she go
with her phone turned off?

477
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,340
Dad. Let's play with this.

478
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:36,640
Ji Hyun. I'm tired. Can I nap for a bit?

479
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,110
Play on your own.

480
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,689
Wait!

481
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,830
You and I can talk in private
in that room.

482
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:02,330
Get your hands off me.

483
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,900
I'm allowed to touch you a bit! Now walk!

484
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,040
Don't touch me.

485
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:07,169
- Go inside.
- Don't push me.

486
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:08,739
Come on.

487
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,509
I can't deal with this lot.

488
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:14,479
I should be saying that.

489
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:17,120
- Then leave!
- Look at you.

490
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,249
You look just fine.

491
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:22,850
Yes. You don't look like someone
who spent 5,000 bucks on therapy.

492
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,860
- The aftereffects are back.
- Oh, dear.

493
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,830
I'm so sad to hear you're unwell.

494
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:29,360
Actress Jin Chu Ah,

495
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,999
how about I take you
to another doctor for a second opinion?

496
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:34,169
Yes. If that doctor
makes the same diagnosis,

497
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:35,800
we'll go on our knees.

498
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,439
Let go of me, both of you!

499
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:38,669
Hey, you!

500
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:42,540
I worked in construction for years,
so I'm stronger than I look!

501
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,780
You won't be able to
break free from my grasp!

502
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,310
Years of housework got me
some pretty strong muscles too!

503
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,249
- What do you think you're doing?
- Stay away from them.

504
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:52,150
- How dare you?
- Can't you tell what they're doing?

505
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,350
Darn you. Get your hands off her!

506
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,350
- Sang Ah!
- No!

507
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,590
Let's go see a doctor!

508
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,259
- How dare you pinch me?
- Let go of her!

509
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:02,830
- We're taking her with us!
- No, you're not!

510
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,459
- Let go of me!
- You let go!

511
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:06,330
- Let her go!
- You witch!

512
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,100
You black-haired witch.

513
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:12,100
My hair isn't black.
This color is called "cool brown."

514
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,110
- They're different.
- Fine, let's say it's cool brown.

515
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,640
- I'll pull it all out for you!
- Mom!

516
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,280
- Call the police.
- Darn you!

517
00:28:19,509 --> 00:28:20,679
- Let go!
- You witch!

518
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,880
That's enough!

(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

521
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:58,550
You won't talk about us, will you?

522
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,120
Do you care what Father thinks?

523
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,290
We won't settle.

524
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:03,989
- Darn you!
- Seon Ju.

525
00:29:04,219 --> 00:29:05,759
It's all my fault.

526
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,259
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- No.

527
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:10,729
What is it, Tae Ri?

528
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,999
Mom. Don't leave her.

529
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:15,370
What do Tae Ri and I mean to you?
