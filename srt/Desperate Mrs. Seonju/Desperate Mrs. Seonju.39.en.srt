00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,509
(Episode 39)

2
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:13,539
I don't know what brought us together...

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,880
and how everything came to be...

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,550
that we ended up being in your debt,

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,650
but you solved half of the worries we had.

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,620
For that, I thank you so much.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,290
Yes. We're grateful, aren't we?

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,689
Other than the house and the salon,
what were you worried about?

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,160
I miss the people who aren't here.

10
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:35,099
Right. It would've been nice
if Mi Ju were here too.

11
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,470
There were times...

12
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:38,900
when I wished I could beat her silly.

13
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,540
But now I miss her.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,670
Do you think
I don't feel the same about you?

15
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,579
I wanted to beat you
half to death so many times.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,509
How could you say that, Mom?
We're your daughters.

17
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:53,979
Every finger hurts equally
if you bite them.

18
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:56,890
You're all fingers I'd love to bite off.

19
00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:00,059
I'd bite them all and spit them out...

20
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,229
if only they weren't my own.

21
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,829
I like everything about you,

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,430
but you can sound quite menacing.

23
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:11,699
Can I?

24
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:14,800
If that's what the homeowner thinks,
I should try to change.

25
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:16,440
I'll be more careful.

26
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:20,240
You infuriate me enough
that my insides hurt.

27
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:23,050
Did that sound better?

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,009
Much better.

29
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,380
Applause.

30
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,779
Oh, gosh.

31
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,460
Mom. You were so scathingly mean to us.

32
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,160
Did you see how obedient she was to him?

33
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,660
Is this the power of capitalism?

34
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,930
If that upsets you, buy back the house.

35
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:40,559
Right, Mr. Homeowner?

36
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,600
You don't have to call me that.
You can speak freely.

37
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,809
What should I call you
that would make you...

38
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,940
comfortable and not that awkward at home?

39
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,540
"Tae Ri's dad?" Or the upstairs guy?

40
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,850
I'm more concerned about
what I should call you.

41
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:01,180
You're the homeowner.
You can call us whatever you want.

42
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,589
You can call me...

43
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:06,919
the tenant granny who lives downstairs.

44
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,859
She's Dong Won's mom. She's Ji Hyun's mom.

45
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:11,490
If you don't like those terms,

46
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,960
you can call them "First" and "Second."

47
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,529
"Dong Won's mom." "Ji Hyun's mom."

48
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,869
"First" and "Second."

49
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,610
I can't say that.

50
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,740
Shall I call you "Director?"

51
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,240
Since you own a hair salon.

52
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,710
Oh, my gosh, yes. I'd like that.

53
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:34,080
And Ms. Pi and Dong Won's mom?

54
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,920
Can you call me "Manager?"

55
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,860
That's what I am at work.

56
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:40,890
Okay, Manager.

57
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,760
We got the titles sorted.

58
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:46,200
Shall we decide this too?

59
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:50,499
(Hospital)

60
00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:55,469
Hello.

61
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,110
What are you doing here?

62
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,839
I brought him because he wanted to know
how Dad was.

63
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,180
Did you have to bring him
in this situation?

64
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,920
I don't think you should go in.

65
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,289
- Mom.
- Your dad is on edge.

66
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:13,260
Seeing the both of you
will only make him angry.

67
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,730
You're right.
That was inconsiderate of me.

68
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,490
Okay, then.

69
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,059
Dad is not pleased to see me these days.
I'll visit some other time.

70
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:22,830
- Sang Ah.
- Let's go.

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,640
My gosh. What's up with her?

72
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:34,510
Why didn't you see your father?

73
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,409
I wish I could stop them
from talking about So Woo.

74
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:43,119
I heard we won the Hansung contract.

75
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,760
It would be nice if we could work on it.

76
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,990
It's a great opportunity
to prove ourselves.

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,059
It's true that my dad is weaker.

78
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,599
It would be effective
if we could prove ourselves now.

79
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,900
But we can't remove So Woo.

80
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,400
There must be a way.

81
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:07,409
He moved out with our son.

82
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,279
He'll have a hard time
juggling childcare and work.

83
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:21,460
So we take turns dropping off...

84
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,830
and picking up the kids from kindergarten.

85
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,130
If we need to...

86
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:28,099
ask the other for help,
that's ten dollars each time.

87
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,570
I like that arrangement.

88
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,270
Right?

89
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,940
My friends called me "Traffic Police"
when I was in school.

90
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,409
Whenever they had an issue,
I sorted it out for them.

91
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:41,979
Gosh, that's impressive.

92
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,159
They gossip that we're having an affair,

93
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,799
but we just need to earn
their acknowledgment.

94
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,429
Then everyone will forget what we did.

95
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:05,570
That would've been the case...

96
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,200
if Seon Ju hadn't joined.

97
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,339
She sent a new fire
to the embers of gossip.

98
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:13,140
Why on earth did So Woo...

99
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,549
I just don't get it.

100
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,409
Just so he could aggravate you and me,

101
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,520
he crossed the line.

102
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,719
"You still won't sign the divorce papers?"

103
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,089
He let his foot off the brakes.

104
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,089
I think you should end it with him
before things get worse.

105
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,200
Sign it right here.

106
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,239
You love to sign things.

107
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:44,140
It's best to keep things clear.

108
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,169
There.

109
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:55,549
Are you done?

110
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,859
Yes. We'll add to the list
whenever we think of something.

111
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,159
Now that we're at... What's that called?

112
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:05,159
- What's what?
- The thing that means a new start.

113
00:06:05,859 --> 00:06:07,200
That thing.

114
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,570
A starting line. A turning point?

115
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,500
Well, let's say we're standing at one.

116
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,169
Now we can forget about the bad past...

117
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:17,310
and go forward and up, right?

118
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:18,469
Yes.

119
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,609
Seon Ju. Did you see the witch at work?

120
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,580
Oh, I did see her.

121
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,419
It's okay. I can manage. Don't worry.

122
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,460
In that case,
how about a toast for us all?

123
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,260
- That sounds good.
- Okay.

124
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:38,229
Can we please soar high now?

125
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:41,859
- Okay. Let's go!
- Let's go!

126
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:43,500
I love you, Mom.

127
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,669
- Okay.
- Me too.

128
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:46,140
- I love you too.
- I love you too.

129
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,640
- I love you.
- Okay.

130
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:49,539
Cheers.

131
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,669
Cheers.

132
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,650
Let's live happily from now on.

133
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:00,979
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,520
Hello.

138
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,890
I'm Pi Seon Ju. I joined yesterday
as Ms. Jin's assistant.

139
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,859
I couldn't say hi because you weren't in.

140
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,159
Are you Ms. Jin's personal assistant
and not a design team assistant?

141
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,299
- Yes.
- I like your energy.

142
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:50,770
Oh, right. Mr. Kim is back at work.

143
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:53,640
What's he thinking?

144
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,839
Returning to a company
where his cheating wife is at...

145
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,940
A reconciliation?
Doesn't it mean there's a chance?

146
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,880
The affair was a huge deal.
Everyone knows about it.

147
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:05,279
Oh, you don't know, do you?

148
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:08,719
These two are married.

149
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:14,960
Mr. Jeon who sits over there
and her are seeing each other.

150
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:16,760
I see.

151
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:18,390
There was a huge ruckus.

152
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,060
Did you see the clip...

153
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:23,429
Hello, sir.

154
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,969
That's Mr. Jeon.

155
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,799
Did you meet yesterday?

156
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,539
Yes. Hello.

157
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:32,810
Hi.

158
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,409
Ms. Jin is not in yet, right?

159
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,819
He and she said they'd go somewhere
before coming to work today.

160
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:46,319
I'm Ko Sim Joong.

161
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:48,620
- You have lots of worries?
- Yes.

162
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:51,490
She's Yoo Nan Hee. Pretty, isn't she?

163
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,900
Yes, she is.

164
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,329
She says she's the prettiest here.

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,370
Maybe the prettiest in the world too.

(Seoul Family Court)

167
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:05,539
Do you feel better now?

168
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,380
You don't? Do you have regrets?

169
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:15,620
Of course not.

170
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,419
I was hoping to wait
because my dad wasn't well.

171
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,490
But you were being ridiculous,
so I decided to end it sooner.

172
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,799
Whatever the reason,

173
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:28,900
I'm glad we could get it done sooner.

174
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,329
Even so,

175
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,740
don't you think it was a bit too much
to bring Seon Ju into the company?

176
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,770
What does this have to do with her?

177
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,010
You crossed the line
to get on my nerves...

178
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,679
so I'd divorce you sooner.

179
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,779
It looks like that was how things went.

180
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:47,250
Seeing Seon Ju so happy to come to work...

181
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,220
not knowing you're just using her...

182
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:54,059
You're using that woman pretty well.

183
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:57,029
You seem to be very wary of Ms. Pi.

184
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,429
- What?
- She seemed skilled.

185
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,199
That was why I recommended her.
That's all.

186
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,829
Why do you care so much?

187
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,340
She's skilled? What skill does she have?

188
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,840
She's the first person you mentioned
as soon as we got divorced.

189
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:13,409
That's odd.

190
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:16,949
Is there more between you two
that I don't know about?

191
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,209
Oh, right.

192
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,620
Is the art university
entrance exam story true?

193
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,549
What story?

194
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,689
Never mind.

195
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,260
See you.

196
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,939
Wait.

197
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:44,169
What for?

198
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,939
Mr. Jeon's ex-wife.

199
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,209
Isn't that Han Man Eun's middle daughter?

200
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,449
She joined the company?

201
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:54,850
Yes, Pi Seon Ju.

202
00:10:58,289 --> 00:10:59,959
Your dad is not in the best of health,

203
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,760
and he has a lot on his mind as well.

204
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,159
Telling him that would cause more stress,
and that would be disastrous.

205
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,429
Your dad knowing
won't do you any good either.

206
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:14,100
So before your dad is discharged
and returns to work,

207
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,510
do whatever it takes to get her fired.

208
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,840
Keep her well away from your dad.

209
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,079
He can't see her. Okay?

210
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,750
(Jin Architecture)

211
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,250
You asked to see me?

212
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:32,919
Yes. Do sit down.

213
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,959
Okay.

214
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,130
What brought you here?

215
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,500
Did you recently hire someone...

216
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,199
- called Pi Seon Ju?
- Yes.

217
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:45,000
I heard from someone who knows her.

218
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:47,600
She can't be trusted.

219
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,209
- Is that so?
- It seems you made a mistake.

220
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,779
Can't you go back on the hiring?

221
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:58,750
We hired her according to protocol
and she signed a formal contract.

222
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:01,949
Dismissing her without a good cause
could become a problem.

223
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,990
Forget what I just said, then.

224
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,130
Don't tell anyone
that I came here to say that.

225
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,159
Okay.

226
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,870
Darn it.

227
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,409
Hey. Did you think it would be easy?

228
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:27,010
My gosh. It's for real.

229
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,779
You're now a designer at Jin Architecture.

230
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:33,779
Hold your head high. Why shouldn't you?

231
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,020
Jin Sang Ah is my superior.
She's a team leader here.

232
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,990
You need to hang onto this job.

233
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,980
Oh, dear.

234
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,510
I'm so sorry.

235
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,919
Goodness.

236
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:10,620
I'm fine.

237
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,059
I heard you'd joined the company.

238
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,429
- Why did you?
- What?

239
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:20,860
Why did you join this company?

240
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:22,970
What?

241
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:27,439
Seeing Sang Ah and Mr. Jeon
must be tormenting.

242
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:29,640
Do you need money?

243
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,740
I'm always in need of money.

244
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,549
How much do you want?

245
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,579
Ma'am.

246
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:41,380
Will you give me whatever I ask for
if I name an amount?

247
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,459
You were so unforgiving
when my sister caused an accident.

248
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,159
You suddenly became generous.

249
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,689
I'm quite perplexed.

250
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:54,029
I'll think about an amount.

251
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:12,850
I'm at the office. We need to talk.

252
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,939
Did you get Pi Seon Ju a job here?

253
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:37,939
- Yes.
- I'd known you were odd,

254
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:40,209
but I didn't know you lacked common sense.

255
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:42,439
Letting someone so ill-mannered...

256
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:44,949
who also happens to be
Mr. Jeon's ex into this company.

257
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,350
Does that make sense?

258
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,449
I didn't know...

259
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:52,020
you cared about who we hired and how.

260
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,659
Don't you know how things are
between her family and mine?

261
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,459
I heard you argued a lot
over the car accident.

262
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,329
Then you shouldn't have done this.

263
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:05,529
Members of her family disrupted business
at my salon many times.

264
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,240
You don't know...

265
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,370
how far back we go
and what happened in the past.

266
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,549
What happened in the past?

267
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:17,949
You did something...

268
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:20,449
you really shouldn't have.

269
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:22,720
Even if you must pay her to quit,

270
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:25,850
you brought her here,
so you must make her leave.

271
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:39,840
I did enough. She can't complain
that her office is dirty.

272
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,740
She called her mom to get me to quit?

273
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,110
She asked if I was
hiding behind my big sister.

274
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,250
She's even worse.

275
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,549
(Head of Interior, Jin Sang Ah)

276
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,189
Hello.

277
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,829
Do you like your clean office?

278
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:10,270
The cleaning lady really did clean
every office but this one.

279
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,870
Ever heard of this proverb?

280
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,370
If you forget about the person
you want to get back at,

281
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,539
one day you'll find their corpse
floating by you in the river.

282
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,439
Could you not find a way other than...

283
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:24,209
this crass, cheap method?

284
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,279
That's right.
I'm not the type to just sit and wait.

285
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:32,289
What if I wait and no corpse floats by?

286
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:34,990
I should face my enemies,

287
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,890
taunt them as best as I can,
and infuriate them.

288
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,699
It's not revenge
to wait and hope I get lucky.

289
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,329
The fun of getting revenge
is all in the act.

290
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:47,640
That's what I think, Ms. Jin.

291
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,709
Although I'm not here
to get revenge, Ms. Jin.

292
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,279
She seemed skilled.
That was why I recommended her.

293
00:16:58,549 --> 00:16:59,980
Is that what you think?

294
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,179
Yes.

295
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,720
So before your dad is discharged
and returns to work,

296
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,159
do whatever it takes to get her fired.

297
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:30,580
This isn't revenge either.

298
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,650
I'm teaching you systematically.

299
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:35,979
Those are samples
of the finishing materials we used.

300
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,290
Take photos, organize them,
and put them in a file.

301
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:41,459
Can you do that before you clock off?

302
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,530
Since you're skilled.

303
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,300
Pick those up and put them back too.

304
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,540
Tell me whenever the work
becomes too much.

305
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,640
I'd appreciate it even more
if you quit without a word.

306
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,189
I just heard something huge.

307
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:13,759
What is it?

308
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,320
Pi Seon Ju, the new hire.

309
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,360
She's Mr. Jeon's wife.

310
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,530
- For real?
- Only we didn't know.

311
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,830
The whole company knew.

312
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,429
Mr. Song from HR...

313
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:28,499
saw Ms. Jin and Ms. Pi fight,
and it was really serious.

314
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:31,439
Then Pi Seon Ju is
the wife in the clip we saw?

315
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,810
Yes.

316
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,979
What's even more shocking...

317
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,749
is that Mr. Kim...

318
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:38,880
Mr. Kim recommended Ms. Pi.

319
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,949
No way. What's going on?

320
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:42,120
Isn't it shocking?

321
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,689
An ex-wife, ex-husband,
and male and female cheating spouses.

322
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:47,390
Aren't we living
too quiet and ordinary a life?

323
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,630
Should we be cheating too?

324
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,429
If you want to cheat with someone,

325
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,729
you need to get married first.

326
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,060
You'll marry me?

327
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:11,509
My gosh. Is this the start of a war?

328
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,080
(Hospital)

329
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,489
Mom.

330
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,169
Where were you at? Why the long face?

331
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,669
Your sister's school friend.

332
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:32,699
Choon Hyang?

333
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,709
I met with her to ask
why she joined the company.

334
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,269
What did she say?

335
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,679
When I asked if she needed money,
she said she'd think of an amount.

336
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,979
My gosh. She's weird.

337
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,150
Let's go upstairs.

338
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,659
See? I'm fine.

339
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,989
You worry too much.

340
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,759
I feel good when I hear
the doctor say regularly that you're fine.

341
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,330
Shall we eat something nice
for dinner since I'm in a good mood?

342
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,969
It's not about your mood.
It's because we don't have a helper.

343
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:12,640
Isn't that Chu Ah and Director Shim?

344
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,739
- Let's go. Don't say hi.
- Why not?

345
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
Hey.

346
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:17,949
What is it?

347
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:19,949
I saw someone
who looked a lot like Woo Sang.

348
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,620
Dad.

349
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,689
Why are you so happy these days?

350
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,090
I'm not happy.

351
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,259
I'm so sad you're in hospital.

352
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,929
I heard you went to the office.

353
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:40,669
Director Jo saw you.

354
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,209
- Did he?
- Why were you there?

355
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,209
- I went to...
- She saw Choon Hyang.

356
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,880
Who's Choon Hyang?

357
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:54,120
Sang Ah's old school friend
whom we argued with about the accident.

358
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,689
What was she doing at the company?

359
00:20:57,949 --> 00:20:59,189
Was I not supposed to tell?

360
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:00,560
What's going on?

361
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:02,989
You don't have to worry about it.

362
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,659
I'm trying to get
So Woo and Sang Ah to reconcile.

363
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,429
I went to talk to So Woo.

364
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:11,769
I'm all for that.

365
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,769
It's a matter of taste,
but I prefer So Woo a bit more.

366
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,239
I don't see what Sang Ah sees in Mr. Jeon.

367
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,580
They're practically living together
in the studio apartment.

368
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:24,550
- What?
- They're what?

369
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:26,350
The studio apartment?

370
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:30,290
What on earth is going on?

371
00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:31,689
Neither of you knew?

372
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,959
How far has she decided to go?

373
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:37,130
Call Sang Ah right now!

374
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:39,800
My gosh.

375
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,400
Yes, Director.

376
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:45,800
I'll set up a meeting and call you back.

377
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,400
Bye.

378
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,449
It's Dad?

379
00:21:58,249 --> 00:21:59,310
Okay.

380
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,249
Ms. Jin.

381
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:04,790
Hansung wants to
bring the meeting forward.

382
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,759
Okay. I'm in a rush.

383
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,429
My goodness.

384
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:21,939
- My gosh.
- What were you doing over there?

385
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:24,840
I was picking something up
that got spilled.

386
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:27,009
Oh, this?

387
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,449
I got the feeling
I'd be doing odd jobs for a while.

388
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,219
So I decided to...

389
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,890
wear something comfortable to work in.

390
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,959
Weren't you hired as a design assistant?

391
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,489
I think...

392
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:47,429
Ms. Jin was shocked to see me here.

393
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,900
She'll torment me for a while
until the emotions die down.

394
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,100
Isn't it funny?

395
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:55,969
If she thinks their love is so special,

396
00:22:55,969 --> 00:23:00,280
she should be open to the stress
of working with her lover's ex.

397
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,650
Why is she so shocked? Am I wrong?

398
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,820
I'm sure I'll get to do...

399
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,890
some design work soon.

400
00:23:11,449 --> 00:23:12,550
You can go.

401
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:16,159
I have to start working on
turning this into data.

402
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,659
Or I can't go home.

403
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,669
You asked to see me?

404
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:30,840
Sit down.

405
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:33,780
You.

406
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,150
Is it true there's a studio apartment
you're sharing with Mr. Jeon?

407
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:43,150
Sell it immediately.

408
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:46,820
Even if you and So Woo are at odds,
you're still a married woman.

409
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:48,590
What are you doing?

410
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,830
What about you, Dad?
How could you ask So Woo to return?

411
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,360
That's even worse.

412
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,199
What? How dare you...

413
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:57,630
Do you know
what So Woo did to the company?

414
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:00,370
Mr. Jeon's ex-wife who owned the car
that drove into mine.

415
00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:02,169
He gave that woman a job.

416
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:04,909
- What?
- Why do you think he did that?

417
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,780
It was to torment me.

418
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:09,880
While you're here,
the son-in-law you favor so much...

419
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,009
is turning the company into a circus!

420
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:21,090
Mr. Song.

421
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:24,759
Suspend Jin Sang Ah
from her duties for now.

422
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,530
Yes. Effective immediately.

423
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,600
Dad!

424
00:24:27,729 --> 00:24:29,060
Honey.

425
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:31,570
You can't do something like that.

426
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:34,070
You said every company had a process.

427
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,239
Why can't I suspend my own daughter?

428
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,370
Report me if you object.

429
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,479
You humiliated us by being filmed,
and you still haven't grown up?

430
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,409
Did you think I was joking
when I said I'd empty your office?

431
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:55,959
Honey. I'll take care of it.

432
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,590
Don't be so angry.

433
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,130
Did you tell him
about the studio apartment?

434
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,269
- What?
- No one else knows.

435
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:08,140
- Who else could've told him?
- Well...

436
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,840
Maybe it was Choon Hyang.

437
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:13,409
- What?
- She knows about it, doesn't she?

438
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,909
She works at your company.
Maybe she went and told everyone.

439
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:19,509
Dad was on the phone with Director Jo.

440
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,449
That must be how he heard.

441
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,749
She must be determined to drag you down.

442
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:27,560
Mom went to see her today,

443
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,959
and she asked how much Mom would pay her.

444
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:30,959
What?

445
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,130
That crazy...

446
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:43,739
Can I help you?

447
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,810
I'd like to see a few detached houses.

448
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,009
A detached house?

449
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:50,650
How much is your budget?

450
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:51,909
Well...

451
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,189
I heard there were
some great restaurants here.

452
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,229
I'll be right back!

454
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,810
What is it?

455
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:19,209
It's nothing.

456
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:20,880
Let's go that way.

457
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,580
What shall we eat?

458
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:27,479
We almost came face-to-face.

460
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,030
The crab is here.

461
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,759
It looks so good.

462
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,130
My gosh. It looks delicious.

463
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,400
I should give Nam Jin some.

464
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,810
Nam Jin. I ordered some marinated crab.

465
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,709
I'll give you some to try.

466
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,479
Where's your dorm?

467
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,580
Don't do that, Mom. I don't eat at home.

468
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,150
I won't visit.

469
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,120
Give me the address. I'll send it to you.

470
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,489
I'll text you, then.

471
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:25,370
I knew we'd have a file already,

472
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,439
so I asked someone
at the reference library.

- Sure.
