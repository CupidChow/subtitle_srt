00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,089
(Episode 24)

2
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:11,120
What do we do?

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,730
- Shall we both try?
- Yes.

4
00:00:16,659 --> 00:00:18,030
- It's really locked.
- It won't budge.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,300
- Oh, dear.
- Darn it.

6
00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:22,839
- Hang on.
- Okay.

7
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:26,410
Why won't it...

8
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:38,579
Why won't it open?

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,290
Goodness.

10
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:51,229
Hey.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
My phone. Where on earth...

12
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:02,479
Do you have your phone?

13
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,680
- My phone?
- Yes.

14
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,110
Hey. Where is it?

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,979
- Can I get out now?
- Yes, of course.

16
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,889
- Let me help you.
- Okay.

17
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:15,490
- My arm aches.
- Ready?

18
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,389
Oh, gosh.

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,100
Did I leave it in the car?

20
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,669
Don't they have an office phone?

21
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:28,100
- They don't.
- What?

22
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:31,070
What office doesn't have a landline?

23
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,309
- Darn it.
- What...

24
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:34,770
My gosh.

25
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,020
What were you there for when we met?

26
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,919
You were all dressed up.

27
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,259
It looked pretty serious.

28
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,589
I was there...

29
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:56,499
for a job interview.

30
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:58,029
You went to an interview
looking like that?

31
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,130
Well...

32
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,369
On the way there,
I saw my husband and his affair partner.

33
00:02:04,669 --> 00:02:06,540
What? Did you really?

34
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,910
It turned out...

35
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,580
she and I went to high school together.

36
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,609
We got into a fight,

37
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,950
and my husband took her side.

38
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:21,020
They walked off...

39
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,689
hand in hand, leaving me behind.

40
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,760
I have no idea what I should do...

41
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,629
to crush them.

42
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,999
But I do know I messed up the interview.

43
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,339
I was out of my mind today.

44
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:45,080
I'm sorry to tell you this.

45
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:48,950
My wife...

46
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,450
is seeing someone else too.

47
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,890
They work at the same company,

48
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,189
and I know the guy.

49
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,129
If we can hire someone to get revenge,

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,869
do you want to come with me
and ask them to kill them both?

51
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,800
- Yes.
- Goodness.

52
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,869
Good grief.

53
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,539
I'd heard people cheated on spouses
with their colleagues,

54
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,710
but are there this many cheaters?

55
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,379
Is that all they go around and do
while they work for a paycheck?

56
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,230
Shall I cook ramyeon?

57
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,400
Ramyeon?

58
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,499
(Cup Noodles)

59
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:42,539
Two?

60
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,740
- Two.
- Okay.

61
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,010
- Hello?
- Son.

62
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:57,249
Shouldn't you visit Mom at her new home?

63
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,349
I'll drop by later.

64
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,119
Bye.

65
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:01,849
Who was that?

66
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
My mom.

67
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:06,059
- She wants me to drop by later.
- I see.

68
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,890
I think it's dry. Try it on.

69
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,760
It doesn't show at all. Thanks.

70
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,339
It's done.

71
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,869
You go first.

72
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,210
Thanks.

73
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,719
It's spicy.

74
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,750
I enjoyed that.

75
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,529
Do you know
what my husband's mistress said?

76
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:50,169
She said my life was like a muddy bog.

77
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:53,370
If I can't better my husband's future,
I should let him be with her.

78
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,609
My wife said...

79
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,380
we never burned with passion.

80
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,950
They had the affair
but called me out for not feeling ashamed.

81
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,979
My wife wants to pretend
everything is fine.

82
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:05,080
That crazy...

83
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,950
Oh, dear. Sorry.

84
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,190
Compared to that,

85
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,000
am I better off since my husband
asked me for a divorce?

86
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,000
My wife hates every face I make.

87
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:23,440
My husband hates how vulgar I am.

88
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,239
Is the woman he's seeing now
classy and elegant?

89
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:30,380
As if she is.

90
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,210
She's a nutcase.

91
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,810
She's not even that better than me.

92
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,750
She's a bit rich,
she has a fancier degree,

93
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,919
and she's a bit pretty...

94
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:41,320
Darn it.

95
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,560
It's annoying just to talk about her.

96
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:53,299
What?

97
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:56,370
Do you want some?

98
00:05:57,969 --> 00:05:59,000
Why not?

99
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:09,979
Cheers.

100
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,330
Why her of all people?

101
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,330
Yes.

102
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:24,330
Why him of all people?

103
00:06:24,429 --> 00:06:26,299
Just so he could be successful,

104
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:30,299
I supported him with my heart and soul,
and I worked so hard too.

105
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,710
Yes, I did that because I wanted to,

106
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:38,710
but do you think it was easy?

107
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,380
It was such hard work.

108
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,320
But what?

109
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,489
I'm not even to say I supported him.

110
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,320
I sincerely wished...

111
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,630
that my wife would succeed.

112
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
It's possible I never expressed it,

113
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,229
but I loved my wife...

114
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,870
and trusted her.

115
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,940
She thought so much of her career,

116
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:09,609
and I wanted her to be at ease
while she built it up.

117
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:12,679
I thought we were both focusing on
what we each valued.

118
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:15,409
I thought we were being efficient.

119
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,020
I thought she'd understand how I felt.

120
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:26,630
I focused too much on our child.

121
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:30,560
Maybe I did make her feel lonely.

122
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:33,929
Was it all my fault?

123
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:39,310
I don't know what I should do.

124
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,310
Oh, dear.

125
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,279
Here.

126
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:52,080
Thanks.

127
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,919
I don't need it, though.

128
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:56,320
Goodness.

129
00:07:57,989 --> 00:08:00,760
I'm not the type to cry around others.
What got into me?

130
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,659
I really...

131
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,400
am not the type to cry like this.

132
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,510
I wonder...

133
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,880
when they met and how,

134
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,049
and how far...

135
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,089
they went and felt.

136
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,419
Do they really love each other?

137
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,000
My head is full of questions, but...

138
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,000
I hate him...

139
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,840
I feel wronged, and it's so unfair.

140
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,539
But I really loved him so much.

141
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:55,579
We have Ji Hyun too, so...

142
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,850
I can't just give up on us.

143
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:08,630
My child loves his mother a lot.

144
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,230
So even though she told me how she felt,

145
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:14,730
I wonder if pretending we're okay...

146
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,970
will turn us back...

147
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,939
into one of those ordinary families.

148
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,809
I can't give up on that hope.

149
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:46,770
Why bring it over?
What if your husband were to see?

150
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,770
Give it to your mother.

151
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,470
You'll visit her today.
I'd bought it in advance.

152
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:58,240
How nice. She'll love it.

153
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,150
Thank you.

154
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,860
- Hello.
- Oh, no.

155
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,260
Let me get that for you.

156
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,929
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

157
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,829
What are you doing here again?

158
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:21,400
Don't you know? I work here now.

159
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,039
I take on small roles and run errands.

160
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:27,270
- What? Director!
- No, don't. Where are you going?

161
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,939
Where do you think?

162
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:32,140
I should tell the director
to fire a threat like you.

163
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:36,819
I don't know why
you keep calling me a threat or a fraud,

164
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:39,720
but I don't know what fraud is.

165
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,850
You what?

166
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,720
I really need the work.

167
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:46,189
- That's none of my business. Direct...
- That I saw you in the car.

168
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,829
I won't say that ever again.

169
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
It's a secret.

170
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,500
I forgot all about it.
I don't remember a thing.

171
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,809
But if you talk to the director
and get me fired,

172
00:11:00,809 --> 00:11:03,939
the memories will resurface,

173
00:11:03,939 --> 00:11:05,679
- and I'll go around...
- Watch it.

174
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,650
How can I trust you?

175
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,150
"I won't talk about
seeing you in the car..."

176
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,890
"that day to anyone
or mention it anywhere."

177
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,559
"I won't bring up that incident..."

178
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,630
"to Jeong Woo Sang or Jin Chu Ah..."

179
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,329
"to blackmail anyone."

180
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't do that kind of stuff.

181
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:28,799
Then sign it.

182
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,799
I just don't have to mention that?

183
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,610
Then you'll let me work here?

187
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:01,429
She and I go way back in a bad way.

188
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,100
My husband is cheating on me with her.

189
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,669
My sister...

190
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,279
might go to prison if she can't settle
out of court over an accident.

191
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,579
After my old job went bankrupt,

192
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,049
I happened to get an interview
at her company of all places.

193
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:17,319
We'd even applied to the same university,

194
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,179
but she got in and I didn't.

195
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,289
Even though I had better grades
and art scores.

196
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,789
How did that happen?

197
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,490
I got a serious stomach ache
during the practical exam.

198
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,230
I actually wondered...

199
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,760
if it was because of the drink...

200
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,000
she'd offered me right before the exam.

201
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,000
I hope not.

202
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,770
But I just don't get...

203
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,439
why she treats me the way she does.
It's so weird.

204
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:44,380
They say evil people
don't act out for a reason.

205
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,309
It's either that...

206
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:49,980
or the reason is so nonsensical
that ordinary people don't get it.

207
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,090
Exactly. That's what she's like.

208
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,890
And right before my interview,

209
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,419
I realized she was the woman
my husband was seeing.

210
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:59,260
I all but lost my mind.

211
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,990
Could I have done well in the interview?

212
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,090
Of course not.

213
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,199
You really do go way back in a bad way.

214
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,270
She's just crazy.

215
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:12,100
Hello.

216
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,610
I just interviewed a strange woman.

217
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,650
Yes. She was driving
her big sister's car too.

218
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,220
And that big sister
went to school with Sang Ah.

219
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,350
Her sister was obstinate back in school.

220
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,049
They grew up poor.

221
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,760
I was there for a job interview.

222
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:35,559
On the way there,
I saw my husband and his affair partner.

223
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,159
It turned out
she and I went to high school together.

224
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,409
Darn it.

225
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,750
I think something is stuck,
keeping the door shut.

226
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,689
I'll crawl out the window
and try to open the door from the outside.

227
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:02,860
You should get home.

228
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:04,959
Can you manage?

229
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
Yes.

230
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:08,689
- Can you hold this still for me?
- Of course.

231
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:13,470
Hey.

232
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,100
What are you going to do?

233
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,909
Something I'm used to doing.

234
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:24,110
Oh, my gosh.

235
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,850
- Is your hand okay?
- It hurts, of course.

236
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,480
It would.

237
00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:32,480
Perfect.

238
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,429
Be careful.

239
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:46,770
- I made it.
- Yes.

240
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,870
One, two, and jump.

241
00:14:51,169 --> 00:14:52,270
My goodness.

242
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,610
What the heck?

243
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,480
No wonder.

244
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,250
It was a darn pole.

245
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,720
Come on out.

246
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:40,850
So...

247
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,459
Did you have an interview
at Jin Architecture today?

248
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,559
How did you figure that out?

249
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,730
Then the high school friend
whom your husband is seeing...

250
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,270
She's the CEO's daughter.

251
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:58,669
It would be pretty weird...

252
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,169
if I were to get a job
at the same company.

253
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,110
I guess I'm just blaming her
for my ruined job interview.

254
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:10,620
They wouldn't have hired me anyway.

255
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:12,449
Why is that?

256
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,919
People who worked at large companies
or studied abroad...

257
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:17,890
are lining up for interviews.

258
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,459
Still, don't you think a firm like that...

259
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:24,100
could do with people like me too?

260
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,730
Oh, right. You haven't worked, have you?

261
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:30,640
Sorry.

262
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,909
You helped me get my car to the garage.

263
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,309
Thank you so much for your help.

264
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,779
You're struggling to find a job,

265
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:44,549
and your wife is cheating on you
with her colleague.

266
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,750
You must be way more upset than I am,

267
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,890
and yet you let me vent my woes.

268
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,029
Sure.

269
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,010
The main road is a short walk that way.

270
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,169
Okay.

271
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,809
- I go this way.
- Okay.

273
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,209

- Hello.
- Hello.

282
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,739
How was Ji Hyun today?

283
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,610
She did okay, but...

284
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:21,080
This is what she drew in art class today.

285
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,249
She seems to be worried about something.

286
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,150
We had them
draw their families as a fairy tale.

287
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,189
She drew the fairy and the woodcutter.

288
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,890
But she drew her dad as the fairy...

289
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,890
and said he would go somewhere.
Are you having problems at home?

290
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,499
She'd bragged about her dad
returning from abroad.

291
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:40,600
- What?
- Hey.

292
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:41,999
Hi, Ji Hyun.

293
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:44,269
Say goodbye.

294
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,570
- Goodbye, miss.
- Okay, bye.

295
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:50,179
- Thank you.
- Sure. Goodbye.

297
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,860
Oh, hey.

298
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:17,999
When did someone stack it this high?

299
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:21,009
Mom. Shall we add one to the pile?

300
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,439
Shall we?

301
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,479
- What will you wish for?
- It's a secret.

302
00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:42,790
Let's see.

303
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,630
This must be it.

304
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,340
Put everything away, please.

305
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:53,209
Sure.

306
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,340
My goodness. The house is massive.

307
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,280
How does she expect me to do everything?

308
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:03,150
She said there wouldn't be much to do.

309
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:05,949
My darling son.

310
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:09,150
You haven't eaten, have you?
What shall I order?

311
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,090
Mom.

312
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,729
Why didn't you buy some nice furniture?

313
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,429
Why? Don't you like it?

314
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,159
You told me to decorate it
like a rich person's home, so I tried.

315
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:20,330
Isn't it nice enough?

316
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,269
What's that?

317
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:24,499
It's for you.

318
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,400
Who is it from? Is it from that woman?

319
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:28,370
My goodness.

320
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:31,509
Am I allowed to accept
whatever she gives me?

321
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,610
If I say you can,

322
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:34,949
you can.

323
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,919
I can't wait to see what she's like.

324
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,759
Ji Hyun, can you eat on your own
for a while?

325
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,729
- Yes.
- I'll be right back.

326
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:49,729
Okay.

327
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,140
- Goodness. Mother, it's me.
- This place...

328
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,439
doesn't require extra heating
even in the winter.

329
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:10,919
And you can last the summer
with just an electric fan.

330
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,080
Excuse me.

331
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,890
Did the lady here move out?

332
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:18,090
This unit?
It has been empty for a million years.

333
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:19,360
Let's go.

334
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:31,439
She moved? How come?

335
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,110
Son. Open wide.

336
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,350
It's Seon Ju.

337
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,719
Don't say I'm here.

338
00:21:47,449 --> 00:21:48,449
Hello.

339
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:50,560
Mother. Did you move elsewhere?

340
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,159
What? Oh, yes.

341
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,929
- Where to?
- I didn't pay my rent on time,

342
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,560
so I'm staying with a friend.

343
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,999
A friend?

344
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,699
Yes. What do you want? I'm a bit busy.

345
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,999
Mother. Have you seen Nam Jin recently?

346
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,909
Did he say anything to you?

347
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:08,040
About what?

348
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,540
He has been...

349
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,509
distracted lately.

350
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:15,909
Oh, has he?

351
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:18,280
So he wants to...

352
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,090
leave me.

353
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,650
Oh, poor you.

354
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,689
But that's between you and him.
I can't force a grown man, can I?

355
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,300
- Mother.
- Okay. I'll talk to him one day.

356
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,729
But the wife should be the one
to win back her husband, not his mom.

357
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,169
Don't expect too much.

358
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,850
The girl you're seeing. What's she like?

359
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,479
I can't favor someone
I know nothing about.

360
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:53,320
She's the daughter...

361
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:55,790
of the CEO of the company I work at.

362
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,259
Have some fruit.

363
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,390
Thanks.

364
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,759
What is Mr. Jeon like at work?

365
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:07,499
Why do you ask?

366
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,669
He seems quite smart and well-mannered.

367
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:12,340
I liked him the moment we met.

368
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,370
How is he at work?

369
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:15,909
Why? Do you like him?

370
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:19,040
Yes. I'd love him as a son-in-law
if he weren't already married.

371
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,949
Why would you say that
about a married man?

372
00:23:21,949 --> 00:23:23,350
You never know.

373
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,580
- People cheat and get divorced...
- What?

374
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:30,519
She's just joking.
You know she doesn't have a filter.

375
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,459
Praising him too much could offend So Woo.

376
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:34,959
Be cautious.

377
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:48,140
Did you have an interview
at Jin Architecture today?

378
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:50,439
How did you figure that out?

379
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:54,150
Then the high school friend
whom your husband is seeing...

380
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,580
She's the CEO's daughter.

381
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:08,890
- You just got back?
- Yes.

382
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,429
Let's talk.

383
00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:23,269
The friend you were in the accident with.

384
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,580
Is it Mr. Jeon's wife?

385
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:27,850
What?

386
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,150
How did you find out?

387
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,979
It turns out they were married.

388
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,820
Don't you feel bad for her?

389
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,259
Are you worried about someone else's wife?

390
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:43,060
I really don't get it.

391
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,130
How could you date a married man...

392
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:49,669
who is also the husband
of someone you know?

393
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:53,739
You acted like you didn't care so far.
Are you slowly getting angry now?

394
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,040
Do you want to fight like other couples...

395
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:59,909
and say "how dare this"
and "how dare that?"

396
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,919
I'm preparing to sort things out
and go back.

397
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
Okay.

398
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,120
I don't mean to fight.

399
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,659
If you thought I cared only for Tae Ri,

400
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,890
I'm sorry.

401
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,999
I'll try to think
you were stressed out and frustrated.

402
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:21,800
End it with Mr. Jeon.

403
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:25,340
Let's figure out what we should do...

404
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,810
to get back on track.

405
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:32,409
Then...

406
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,550
back me up so I get promoted
before the coming season.

407
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:42,790
Will you come back if I do that?

408
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:46,560
Once I get promoted,
I'll delegate more of my work...

409
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:47,959
and reduce my load.

410
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,459
And I'll pay more attention to Tae Ri.

411
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:56,429
I'll help with the Hansung project.

412
00:25:57,769 --> 00:25:59,939
- Will you really?
- If you prove yourself,

413
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:04,479
Father will trust you more,
and he'll be pleased too.

414
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,780
My last project ends soon.
I'll help as best as I can.

415
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:12,150
Okay, then. I'll take a day off...

416
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,489
and take Tae Ri on an outing.

417
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:15,820
Thanks.

418
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,860
Tae Ri will love it.

419
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:34,739
My goodness.

420
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,870
This bag is too full.

421
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,340
I'll take this out.

422
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:40,350
You come upstairs soon, okay?

423
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:41,479
Okay.

424
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,679
I thought I could stay here until I died.

425
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,909
I went to the park with Mom today
and saw the stone pile was back up.

426
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,620
I was sad it fell down
the day before Dad came home,

427
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:52,479
but I'm happy again.

428
00:27:56,189 --> 00:27:59,019
Mom said she didn't fight Dad,

429
00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:00,790
but I can tell.

430
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,360
That was why I wished hard...

431
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,659
for Dad to come back to us.

432
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,340
She drew the fairy and the woodcutter.

433
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,280
But she drew her dad as the fairy...

434
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,880
and said he would go somewhere.

435
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:41,400
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

436
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,519
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

437
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:00,489
They called us to their secret hideout?

438
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,449
Are you hiding behind your big sister?

439
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,919
Is all you have to hide behind
the fact that you seduced a married man?

440
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,790
Things freeze and thaw repeatedly
in a marriage.

441
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:12,229
Mom wants to take Tae Ri somewhere.
Is there a place you'd like to go?

442
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:15,269
You'll pay for this in spades one day.

443
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:16,499
Hey, you!

444
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,640
