00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,220
(Episode 37)

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,559
(Han Hair Line)

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,530
Tell the kids to join us.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,060
Kids, come on over.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,330
Did Mi Ju go somewhere?

6
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:22,069
I haven't seen her all morning.

7
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:23,899
Didn't she go out at night to have fun?

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,340
Seon Ju. Give your sister a call.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,640
Okay.

10
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:33,309
(22-hour Charcoal Sauna)

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,260
Hey. Where are you?

12
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:45,330
Hi. I'm on a business trip.

13
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,830
Out of the blue?
You didn't mention that yesterday.

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,730
I got the call and left around dawn.

15
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:52,830
Where will you be and for how long?

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,440
I'm on Jeju Island.
I'll be away for about a month?

17
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,309
I might be too busy to even take calls.

18
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,910
I have to board my flight. Bye.

19
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,159
Go to sleep, will you?

20
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:27,169
Sleep in the living room
if you're going to be like this.

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,799
My gosh. How will we three
manage to sleep like this?

22
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:32,469
Darn it.

23
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,779
It's so noisy.

24
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:57,159
I won't go home until I'm successful...

25
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:01,200
and buy back that house.

26
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:11,480
"Room and board
with 3,800 dollars a month?"

27
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:12,809
Okay.

28
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:17,820
Hi. I'm calling about the advertisement.

29
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,290
Right now?

30
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,320
Yes, I can be right there.

31
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,220
Okay.

32
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,970
Woo Sang. Here's the revised script.

33
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,500
- Let's hurry over and read it through.
- It was revised?

34
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,299
It's because they had to
write out Kkot Ja.

35
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,600
Come on outside.

36
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,179
Chu Ah won't hold you responsible...

37
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,280
if you leave the team.

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,019
- Chu Ah.
- Yes, Woo Sang?

39
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,220
Your watch.

40
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,619
Didn't you put it in her bag by mistake?

41
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:54,820
What do you mean?

42
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:57,160
I mean...

43
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,530
you could've mistaken
her bag for yours and put it in there.

44
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,359
Why would I make that kind of mistake?

45
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,030
Let's empty our glasses
and move to another place.

46
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:08,769
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,209
Goodness.

48
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,839
Chu Ah...

49
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,450
Woo Sang. Come and sit down.

50
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:57,179
Woo Sang.

51
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,200
Are you leaving?

52
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,440
What are you doing?

53
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,940
Chu Ah's watch thing.

54
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,110
Something is off.

55
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,110
I agree. She didn't seem like a thief.

56
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,180
If only the restaurant had CCTV cameras...

57
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,519
Mom. The dashcam memory card
Chu Ah left with me.

58
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:36,420
- Where is it?
- That thing?

59
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,329
I left it on this table.

60
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,700
It's not in here.

61
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:50,969
Where is it?

62
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,610
The helper must've put it away.

63
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,839
I'll ask her later.

64
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,909
Okay. Mom.

65
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,110
I must find it.

66
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,180
Okay.

67
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,659
Why did she go on a business trip
without telling anyone?

68
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:13,690
Do you think she's locked up somewhere?

69
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,560
No. I think
it's a real business trip this time.

70
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,969
She answered her phone.

71
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:21,430
She wouldn't be able to
if she were locked up.

72
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,010
Would she get into more trouble?
She should know not to by now.

73
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,209
Yes, Mom.

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,810
She might get slapped around,
but she seems to be earning too.

75
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,510
- Really?
- Yes.

76
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,680
- Eat your food.
- Okay.

77
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,649
I worry about her all the time.

78
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:45,089
Seon Ju. Shouldn't we invite
the homeowner to eat with us?

79
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,130
I doubt he'd cook anything for his kid.

80
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,130
That would make him feel uncomfortable.

81
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,170
He let us stay with him.

82
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,829
We should show our gratitude.

83
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,700
He blocked the indoor staircase,
so it'll be a hassle to come downstairs.

84
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,010
What should we do, then?

85
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:04,310
Seon Ju. Get a tray of food
and take it to them.

86
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,810
With lots of side dishes.

87
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,209
Yes, madam.

88
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:09,380
- Do it now.
- Okay.

89
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:11,649
- Finish your meal later.
- Okay.

90
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,120
Have some fish.

91
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,019
Hey.

92
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,729
You're up.

93
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:22,459
Yes. Are you going somewhere?

94
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,700
This is your breakfast.

95
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:26,670
Mom told me to bring it to you.

96
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:27,829
Thanks.

97
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:30,570
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

98
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,680
(We'll hire you as an assistant designer.)

99
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,139
(Contact Jin Architecture's HR Team.
Congratulations.)

100
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,849
I got in.

101
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:42,719
Into what?

102
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,789
I got into Jin Architecture.

103
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:47,320
Oh, did you?

104
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,459
That's weird. It can't be.

105
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:53,659
Was he mistaken?

106
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,430
Why don't you call that number?

107
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:03,969
Hello. This is Pi Seon Ju.

108
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:08,039
I just got a text
saying I got a job at Jin Architecture.

109
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,839
Yes, that's right.

110
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:11,940
Is it true? How come...

111
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,649
You said there would be another interview.

112
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:16,579
That only applies
to the full-time designer position.

113
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:19,320
You got the assistant job
on a temporary basis.

114
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,889
- If you're not interested...
- No, I am interested.

115
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:23,719
Bye.

116
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:27,630
What did they say?

117
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,959
It's for real. They weren't mistaken.

118
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:34,170
I'm to contact the HR Team.

119
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:42,839
What's that noise?

120
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:45,310
Did she see a mouse?

121
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,110
- What happened?
- I don't know.

122
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:48,579
Let's go and see.

123
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,719
What's going on?

124
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,880
What's the matter?

125
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,620
Why did you scream?

126
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,450
- What did you see?
- What is it?

127
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,719
What is it?

128
00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:00,360
Mom, I got into Jin Architecture.
I got a job there.

129
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,829
Read this.

130
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,459
"Pi Seon Ju, you applied as a designer."

131
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,469
"We'll hire you as an assistant..."

132
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:09,969
My gosh. It's for real.

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,039
You're now a designer at Jin Architecture.

134
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,779
It's not a full-time regular position.

135
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:18,139
I'm just an assistant to a designer.

136
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,779
Why did they take so long to call you?

137
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,450
I bet they looked far and wide
and couldn't find someone like me.

138
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,589
Is that company that great?

139
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:32,120
It's where her mad friend
from school works.

140
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,459
What? You mean...

141
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:40,370
Yes. It's the company that belongs to
the nasty Grace woman's husband.

142
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,239
Will you be below or above
that mean witch?

143
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:45,499
Below her.

144
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:48,570
But it's okay. I really don't mind.

145
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,310
Why should I mind?
Did I do something wrong?

146
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:54,249
You're right.

147
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:58,020
Hold your head high.
Why shouldn't you?

148
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:00,989
Come by the salon
before you head in to work.

149
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:03,320
I'll wash and set your hair for you.

150
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,989
You should buy some clothes too.

151
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:10,930
You don't want to look shabby
when you work with them.

152
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,229
- Yes.
- Let's go shopping later, okay?

153
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,239
- I'm off to work now.
- Okay.

154
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:19,310
Yes!

155
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Are you pleased?

156
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:26,310
I'm sorry I got a job before you did.

157
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,249
No, it's fine.

158
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:31,780
By the way, that company...

159
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,849
Now that I think about it,

160
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,390
I don't think I did that poorly
in the interview.

161
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:44,530
Jin Architecture is actually
more fair than I thought.

162
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,599
They recognized my skill.

163
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,540
The people there are pretty decent.

164
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,310
What should I wear?

165
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,570
Should I really buy some clothes?

166
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:57,109
Are you that pleased?

167
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,249
Why do you keep asking?

168
00:10:00,609 --> 00:10:03,920
You made a huge profit
by buying our house.

169
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,420
Unearned income
is the best kind of income, you know.

170
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,959
You said you were going to
open an office too.

171
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,229
You said you had no problem
working in an awkward environment.

172
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:23,400
You don't think you were dropped
behind enemy lines, do you?

173
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,239
If you must fight,
the victory is sweeter...

174
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:30,640
when the battle's fought
on enemy territory.

175
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,950
I'm glad to see you're pleased.

176
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,650
I wasn't sure
if deciding to let you stay...

177
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,290
was wise on my part.

178
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,550
I decided to think it was.

179
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,219
Congratulations on your new job.

180
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,420
Thank you.

181
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,560
- Thanks for the breakfast.
- Sure.

182
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,599
- I'll go back upstairs.
- Thanks.

183
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,570
- Enjoy your meal.
- I will.

184
00:10:57,369 --> 00:11:00,310
I have a job now.

185
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,940
I can work.

186
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,780
She once said
the place should go bankrupt.

187
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,249
Are you up?

188
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,259
Yes.

189
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:20,829
The granny downstairs gave us some food.

190
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,599
There are pink sausages too.
They look tasty.

191
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:27,530
Was it uncomfortable
sleeping in an unfamiliar room?

192
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,940
No. I liked sleeping with you.

193
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
Did you?

194
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,469
Let's wash your hands and face first.

195
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:34,739
- Let's go.
- Okay.

196
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,790
You're the worst of all!

197
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,499
You got up to no good
hoping to become an actress...

198
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:00,070
and almost ruined your life.

199
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,640
And now look at you, sitting behind bars!

200
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,670
- Mom!
- Mom.

201
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,140
This wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't gotten into trouble.

202
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:10,479
If we're talking about who's guilty,
most of it falls on you.

203
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:12,410
Rather than get out
and cause more trouble,

204
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,379
stay in there and die of old age.

205
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,079
Yes. They lost the house because of me.

206
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,020
I deserve to struggle a bit.

207
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:22,920
If I can't make enough cleaning grills,

208
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,890
I'll rob a bank for the money
to buy back the house.

209
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:29,930
Mi Ju, are you not done yet?

210
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,900
No, I'm almost done.

211
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:38,670
Camera three, cut.

212
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:43,239
Camera four.

213
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,979
Cut! Nicely done.

214
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,619
Let's move onto the next scene.

215
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,520
Why is there always something to film?

216
00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:01,089
Woo Sang. I have a restaurant coupon.
Shall we eat together later?

217
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,459
No.

218
00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:06,499
You're in an awfully good mood.

219
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,829
- What?
- Did something great happen?

220
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,739
The blackmailer's gone, for example?

221
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:14,440
Oh, her?

222
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:17,339
She did dampen my spirits a bit.

223
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,780
The set's so much brighter
now that she has gone.

224
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,050
Aren't you getting
a bit too much into character?

225
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,589
You actually look and sound evil.

226
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,089
What?

227
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,259
Does the watch work?

228
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,759
Of course it does.

229
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,270
I'm sure I put it right here.

230
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:48,609
Whatever a memory card is,

231
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:50,209
I didn't see it.

232
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:54,050
Are you saying it walked off
out of the room, then?

233
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:56,950
What would I ever do with it?

234
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,520
I'm not saying you took it.

235
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,420
You could've thrown it out
while cleaning the room.

236
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,459
You're the only other person
who comes in here.

237
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:07,190
Who knows where it is if not you?

238
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:09,629
My son said he needed it badly.

239
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,729
It must be important.

240
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:13,599
What the heck?

241
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:15,369
I've had enough.

242
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:16,869
- Darn it.
- My gosh.

243
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:19,670
I was going to stay at least until
my son passed the civil service exam,

244
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:22,310
- but I can't do it anymore.
- What?

245
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,109
"There's nothing to do
because there are no kids or pets?"

246
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:27,550
As if. The house is massive,

247
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,280
and you made me do all sorts of things.

248
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:32,219
And now you say I took something
that's not worth anything...

249
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:33,890
that I can't even sell?

250
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,719
- My goodness.
- I quit!

251
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,390
- I can't stand you.
- Wait. Ma'am.

252
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:39,629
My gosh.

253
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:41,290
Ma'am.

254
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,259
Let go. Wire me what you owe
for my work so far.

255
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:46,030
If not, I'll go online and say...

256
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,770
Jeong Woo Sang's mom
Oh Hye Ran is a bully.

257
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,869
My son is great at making up
malicious comments.

258
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,270
- Darn you.
- My gosh.

259
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,910
- I'm off.
- What the...

260
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,440
No... But I just...

261
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,979
Can't I even ask?

262
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:03,150
Oh, dear. My head aches.

263
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,390
Poor me. Oh, my gosh.

264
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,550
(Local Jobs)

265
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,599
You're always looking at that
instead of finding work.

266
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:21,530
Hey, when did you come home?

267
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:23,670
Don't sneak up on people.

268
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,640
Aunt Seon Ju got a job.

269
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,209
Shouldn't you too?

270
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:29,839
You can save up
and help buy back Granny's house.

271
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:33,509
I can't make that much
even if I did find a job.

272
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:36,920
I'd have a better chance
if I hoped to win the lottery.

273
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,489
That's my dream in life.

274
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:40,849
Did you buy a lottery ticket?

275
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:43,520
No. I'm just saying that's my dream.

276
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,359
Lottery tickets are a waste of money.

277
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,589
Instead of trying to make me get a job,

278
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:50,829
study hard, become successful,

279
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:52,499
and spoil me rotten.

280
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,829
I haven't had a real job in years.

281
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,400
I can't get one now.

282
00:15:57,469 --> 00:15:58,540
Why not?

283
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,640
All my friends' moms work.

284
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,540
They must've worked all along.

285
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:04,280
Why are you so annoyed?

286
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,680
What kind of attitude is this?

287
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:09,979
Am I wrong?

288
00:16:09,979 --> 00:16:12,379
You're too afraid to try something new.

289
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:14,650
Why do you tell me
to study and be successful?

290
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,259
- What?
- If you want to win the lottery,

291
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:18,390
buy a ticket.

292
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,030
If you want to work, apply for jobs.

293
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,459
Don't take your frustration out on me.

294
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:25,900
Hey.

295
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:33,140
How dare he?

296
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,349
"Middle-school supplementary teacher."

297
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,020
"Five-day work week,
flexible times, 1,500 dollars?"

298
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,060
Let's apply.

299
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,749
Hello, So Woo.

300
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,719
You're eating.

301
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,680
No. I just finished eating.

302
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,420
- He's done. I'll let you chat.
- Okay.

303
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,759
So, did you think about my offer?

304
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,660
I'll stay on until the project's complete.

305
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,100
I'm glad you'll do so.

306
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,999
Thank you.

307
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,910
I'd rather you not get your hopes up
about me and Sang Ah.

308
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,309
Of course. I understand.

309
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,580
Your offices are too close, aren't they?

310
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:49,749
If that's uncomfortable,
why don't you move to another floor?

311
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,080
No. It's fine.

312
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,989
I'd like to fill my team
with the people...

313
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:57,120
I want.

314
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,690
Isn't that obvious?
Do whatever you want.

315
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:01,590
I will.

316
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,469
You're here again today?

317
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,640
Yes. He asked me to return to work.

318
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:19,380
- And?
- I might. Would you feel uncomfortable?

319
00:18:19,509 --> 00:18:21,709
That's nonsense.

320
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:24,680
Not everyone does what makes sense.

321
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,090
Hey.

322
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:31,420
You're not going to work, are you?

323
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,890
Darn it.

324
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,930
Ms. Jin. An assistant will start today.

325
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,549
What are you doing?

326
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:04,090
It's my first day
at my ex-husband's workplace.

327
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,959
I'm going to put on my warrior look.

328
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,729
Don't you be silly.
I'll do your hair for you.

329
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:10,160
Goodness.

330
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:13,700
I'll make sure you look prettier
than anyone there.

331
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,930
Wait and see.

332
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,340
Walk in there and do your best.

333
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:22,670
- I will.
- Good.

334
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,080
You just got back?

335
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:30,549
Yes.

336
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,789
My hair? Why?

337
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,620
Does it look weird?

338
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,719
No. It suits you.

339
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,559
- Does it?
- Yes.

340
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,630
I want to make a good first impression.

341
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,930
I told you how my ex-husband...

342
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,900
works there with...

343
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,330
Your nasty friend from school?

344
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:52,100
They'll both be there.

345
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,239
Not everything is about looks,

346
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,309
but how you look can lift you up
or drag you down.

347
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:05,549
- Can it?
- Men don't seem to get that,

348
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,420
but if a man's in a suit
that fits perfectly,

349
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:10,690
it can be really intimidating.

350
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,360
I see.

351
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,759
Keep that in mind
if you ever have a job interview.

352
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,969
There's something I must tell you.

353
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:24,640
Hey! Come in and try this on!

354
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,999
Okay!

355
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,969
I'm busy and must dash.

356
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,640
Okay.

357
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:38,150
My love for you runs deep

358
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,850
- Hello.
- Oh, Mr. Homeowner.

359
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,059
Do you need a haircut?

360
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,259
No. I came to tell you something.

361
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:47,729
What's that?

362
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:50,130
- Your hair salon.
- I must tear it down?

363
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,830
No. You can keep it for a while.

364
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,400
What? Can I really do that?

365
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:56,769
How come?

366
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,170
I found work somewhere.

367
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:02,469
Oh, my goodness.
As soon as you moved in with us...

368
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,380
We're the one's living with you
in your house,

369
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,309
but you found work after a long time.

370
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,920
This house is blessed like that, you know.

371
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,620
- Is it?
- Yes, it is.

372
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,289
When do you start at your new job?

373
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,719
I start today.

374
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,259
That's great.

375
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,229
My daughter starts today and so do you.

376
00:21:23,229 --> 00:21:27,700
That's great news doubled.
It's a double blessing.

377
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,799
What's a double blessing?

378
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,069
You sold your house already.

379
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:35,940
How is it a blessing when you lost money?

380
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,910
Bye, then.

381
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:44,580
Listen. I'll buy everyone fried chicken.

382
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,719
Come home early!

383
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:47,819
I will!

384
00:21:49,249 --> 00:21:51,759
Who was that?
Why do you want him home early?

385
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,059
Is he your new son-in-law?

386
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,690
Did Mi Ju get married?

387
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,700
Who is that guy?

388
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,930
He's the homeowner.

389
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:04,469
What?

390
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:10,009
My gosh.

391
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,779
New apartments these days
are so spacious and well laid out.

392
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,880
There's always more space for something.

393
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:18,120
Shall I put this here?

394
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:19,819
I'll leave it here for now.

395
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,950
I bought it yesterday,
and it arrived today.

396
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,489
It's so convenient.

397
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,759
I hope I get to enjoy it for a long time.

398
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,499
What's this?

399
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,229
Oh, no.

400
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,370
I threw out my back.

401
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,739
I could do with Seon Ju's help right now.

402
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,509
Goodness.

403
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:45,080
Oh, dear.

404
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,180
My gosh.

405
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,219
My goodness. Seon Ju got divorced,

406
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,049
you sold your house,

407
00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:56,450
and your family of four is leeching off
the new homeowner?

408
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,459
Well, I'm not at all surprised
Seon Ju got divorced.

409
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,259
I knew it would happen sooner or later.

410
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,799
- What?
- Your life is full of obstacles.

411
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,969
Is that why you're stuck here?

412
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,309
What's wrong with you?

413
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,840
That young man. The homeowner.

414
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,509
Is he single?

415
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:23,249
Apparently.

416
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,620
He got a job after giving up
studying for some exam?

417
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,450
What about kids?

418
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,759
You're too nosy.

419
00:23:31,219 --> 00:23:32,390
He has a son.

420
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,999
(Jin Architecture)

421
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:43,739
How's your father?

422
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,069
He'll be fine if he rests for a few days
and doesn't get too stressed.

423
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,580
So Woo was at the hospital.

424
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:51,880
What for?

425
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,450
Dad asked him to come back to work.

426
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:56,110
It's driving me insane.

427
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,680
Did he say he would?

428
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,420
He said he was thinking about it.

429
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:03,890
I doubt he will.
I bet he just said that to annoy me.

430
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:07,160
We couldn't work together
when he left asking for a divorce.

431
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,690
Let's do this.

432
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,229
Hello.

433
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,200
Where's the HR Team?

434
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,940
It's that way.
Go straight ahead and turn right.

435
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,469
Thanks.

436
00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:56,539
Here you go.

437
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,950
Write your name and address
in both places.

438
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,950
Okay.

439
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:06,249
I thought you'd sent...

440
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:11,920
the text meant for someone else...

441
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:13,930
to me by mistake.

442
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,330
How could I make that mistake...

443
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,200
when you left such a strong impression?

444
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,430
Right?

445
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,870
I can't believe you actually chose me.

446
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:25,999
Thank you.

447
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,769
Don't thank me.
Thank the person who recommended you.

448
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:30,940
Oh, wait.

449
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:34,749
You need to sign here and here too.

450
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:38,479
That's it.

451
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:42,420
Does this mean
I can't be fired for at least a year?

452
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:43,489
Yes.

453
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,620
- Here.
- Thanks.

454
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:51,559
Do you mind if I use the toilet?

455
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:52,799
That's fine.

456
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,069
Bye.

457
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,509
(Jin Architecture)

458
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:16,759
You can wait here.
Someone in charge will come to train you.

459
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:19,319
- Okay.
- Bye, then.

460
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,390
Bye.

461
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,120
Pi Seon Ju?

462
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:49,049
What?

463
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:53,860
What are you doing here?

464
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:56,729
What the heck are you doing in here?

465
00:26:58,229 --> 00:26:59,299
Why are you here?

466
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:03,739
Hello. This is my first day here.

467
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,870
I'm Pi Seon Ju.

468
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:07,940
It's what?

469
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,049
Didn't HR tell you?

470
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:16,479
I got a job here.

471
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,680
I'm here to work.

472
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,390
To do what?

473
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,120
Do I have to tell you?

474
00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:25,289
Are you out of your mind?

475
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:28,830
My gosh.

476
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:18,009
What...

477
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:25,180
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

478
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,130
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

479
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,299
Why didn't you tell me
you were Sang Ah's husband?

480
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,640
If you knew, would it change anything?

481
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,569
This is like "Animal Planet."

482
00:28:49,009 --> 00:28:50,640
So what? Will you quit?

483
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,440
Choon Hyang joined Dad's company?

484
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,680
Don't tell your dad.

485
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,509
Do whatever it takes to get her fired.

486
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,219
So Woo's using you as ammunition.

487
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:02,319
Who cares what an employee is for
as long as they have a use?

488
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
