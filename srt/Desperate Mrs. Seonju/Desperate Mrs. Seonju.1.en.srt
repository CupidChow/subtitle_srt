(Wallpaper)

2
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,959
(Slowly)

3
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
Shoot.

4
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:48,389
Just a bit further.

5
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:51,359
Goodness.

6
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,100
Come on. Give it a bit more.

7
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,270
Darn it.

8
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,740
Seriously?

9
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:05,649
Oh, no.

10
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,420
Crap.

11
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,160
Let's do this.

12
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,330
Yes!

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,729
Go.

14
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,100
That's it.

15
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,979
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

16
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:41,850
(Episode 1)

17
00:01:45,449 --> 00:01:46,550
Yes.

18
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:48,690
Very nice.

19
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,720
Okay. This is it.

20
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,589
Ms. Pi, the food's here.

21
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:54,759
This line...

22
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,660
What's so profound?

23
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,929
Are you creating art?

24
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,569
No, but...

25
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,270
where you're standing...

26
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,970
and where the light comes from,

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,669
whether it's natural or artificial light.

28
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,069
That changes things.

29
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,440
It's just a paint job.

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,009
It does look good, though.

31
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:15,619
You bet it does.
I've been doing this for years.

32
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:18,720
Yes, to make a living,
and you must eat to live. Eat.

33
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:23,060
- Goodness.
- Looking good.

34
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:24,759
Ms. Pi.

35
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,889
Your husband's coming back?

36
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:29,100
Is that why you're so full of cheer?

37
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:33,030
When was I not full of cheer?

38
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,600
When does he fly in?

39
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,569
I don't know the exact date.

40
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,210
Will he be back for good?

41
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,810
So you can brag about his master's?

42
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,739
You keep skipping the details.

43
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,280
It's not just a master's degree.
It's a master's degree from overseas.

44
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,220
I worked like a dog
to pay for the "overseas" part.

45
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,960
Should you or should you not
keep dropping that word?

46
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,319
That's right.

47
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,759
You did work so hard. Like a dog, yes.

48
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,660
Okay. Your husband now has
an overseas master's degree.

49
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,530
That's it. That's what he has now.

50
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,739
Goodness...

51
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,910
Would he be in bed now?

52
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,410
Did you eat
more than half of that already?

53
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,440
- Just eat the rest.
- Sorry.

54
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,729
(Darling husband)

55
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,840
- Hey.
- Hi.

56
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,979
Honey. You're not working, are you?

57
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,609
No. Why?

58
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:52,449
Why else?

59
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,449
I called to ask if knew your return date.

60
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,419
What?

61
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,190
Tomorrow?

62
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,389
- Yes. Stuff came up.
- Thank you.

63
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,289
Why are you telling me that now?

64
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:05,989
I didn't want to bother you.

65
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:07,130
I must be bothered.

66
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,699
What else would or could I bother about?

67
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:14,169
Okay. I'm grateful that you were
trying to be considerate,

68
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:15,470
but come on.

69
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,970
Do you need me
to come to the airport tomorrow?

70
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,769
No, my flight leaves tomorrow.

71
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:20,940
It'll land the day after.

72
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,910
- At what time?
- It's a way of life...

73
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,479
and also a way of communication.

74
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:27,109
- Well...
- Where are you?

75
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:28,749
I hear some kind of noise.

76
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,080
I stepped out for just a bit.

77
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:32,950
I'm busy. Let's talk again.

78
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:35,289
- Okay.
- Let's enjoy the night, guys. Thank you.

79
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,729
Goodness.

80
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:52,169
What got into you now?

81
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,239
He's coming back. He'll be back tomorrow.

82
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,609
My husband.

83
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:59,549
The long-distance couple reunites at last.

84
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,549
You should treat us.

85
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:02,150
- To meat.
- Pork belly.

86
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,650
Pork belly's...

87
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,280
a great idea. Let's go.

88
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,489
- Yes.
- Really?

89
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:19,229
Now, it's time to announce the winner...

90
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,669
of the coveted Grand Prize.

91
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:24,739
And the award goes to...

92
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:27,140
And the winner is...

93
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:29,239
Nam Jin Jeon!

94
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,450
From Columbia University's
Graduate School of Architecture,

95
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,150
he incorporated
the cold look of metallic material...

96
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,689
to be a part of the natural
surrounding landscape in his design.

97
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:47,090
The award will be presented
by our chairman Michael Fox.

98
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:03,780
Thank you.

99
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,189
Please share a few words.

100
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:19,129
In architecture,

101
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,229
talent and effort are all necessary.

102
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,600
But the most important thing is...

103
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,900
a relationship based on trust.

104
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:33,470
Those relationships will connect
materials to materials,

105
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:35,210
space to space,

106
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,039
and let them harmonize
with the environment.

107
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:40,780
I just want to say to everyone...

108
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:44,479
to cherish relationships based on trust.

109
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,520
It was an honor to meet
and work as a team...

110
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,660
with Professor Albert.

111
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:54,989
Thank you.

112
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:26,260
Congratulations, Nam Jin.

113
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:27,890
Thank you.

114
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,400
You're going to be in the top 0.1 percent
of the architecture field.

115
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,640
I wish you could come under my wing.

116
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,609
I'm sorry to part ways with you,
my professor.

117
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:44,080
I know. You must miss your family.

118
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,609
I understand.

119
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,150
I do.

120
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,379
Oh, Sang Ah.

121
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,489
You haven't met Nam Jin, have you?

122
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:55,189
Say hello.

123
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:56,859
I know you...

124
00:07:56,859 --> 00:08:00,129
because Jin Architecture just scouted you.

125
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:02,760
I recommended you.

126
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,570
Thank you.

127
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,439
So I came in second after Sang Ah?

128
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,600
Is that so?

129
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,039
I've heard.

130
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:16,910
So glad to meet you.

131
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:18,809
Nice to meet you.

132
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,109
- Let's do well together.
- Sure.

133
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,950
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

134
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,670
Gosh. Is that our family?

135
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:49,310
You did a great job.

136
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,680
Mom's pretty.

137
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,320
She'll be back soon.

138
00:08:56,979 --> 00:09:00,649
We can go on outings together
and go out to eat nice things.

139
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:02,190
Let's show this to her too.

140
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:06,129
Didn't you make just Mom look pretty?

141
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,489
No.

142
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:10,029
You did. She's the only pretty one.

143
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:11,200
Let's see Dad.

144
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:12,830
Hey.

145
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,899
Do a better job drawing me next.

146
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
(Mom, Me, Dad)

147
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:22,639
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

148
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,409
(Beef tripe, Salt-grill)

149
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,680
After a long day,

150
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,879
nothing washes away the dust
like pork belly.

151
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:35,320
Yes. You really had a rough time, Ms. Pi.

152
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,519
You even got locked on a rooftop...

153
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,889
and had to stay there until the next day.

154
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:43,129
She once got stabbed
by a nail this long...

155
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,560
and almost died of tetanus.

156
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:47,330
She's been through a whole lot of things.

157
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:49,899
Oh, right. That time,

158
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:52,769
you massaged my wound
and got all the dirty blood out.

159
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,909
- Yes.
- I bet your husband...

160
00:09:54,909 --> 00:09:57,139
will appreciate all you suffered for him.

161
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,550
I wouldn't call it suffering.

162
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,820
I'd have quit long ago
if I considered it suffering.

163
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:06,749
I had a part in creating lovely spaces...

164
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:08,350
people could be happy in,

165
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,290
and with the money I earned,
I raised my Ji Hyun.

166
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,430
And I put my husband through grad school.

167
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,859
You don't ask for much at all.

168
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:21,830
Did your husband find a job here?

169
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,040
He's negotiating with a company.

170
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,509
He said his professor begged him to stay,

171
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:30,080
but he insisted on returning.

172
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:34,310
And the only reason for that is us.
He misses us, his family.

173
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,249
You brag about him too much. Show-off.

174
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,489
Let's have another drink.

175
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:44,119
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

176
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,759

177
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,859
(Won Jung Min)

178
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,269
Darn it.

179
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,529
Why isn't the brat here yet?

180
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,840
Oh, my poor shoulders, back, and legs.

181
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,239
I was on my feet all day
and now I ache all over.

182
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:05,340
My goodness.

183
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,649
How dare she leave her kid with me?

184
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:09,779
Am I her kid's nanny?

185
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,200
Mom.

186
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:28,330
I'm back.

187
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:29,570
Are you drunk?

188
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,639
I was in such a good mood,

189
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:33,639
I had just one drink.

190
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,609
My gosh.

191
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:38,639
This is just one drink?

192
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,180
Was that one shot the size of a bucket?

193
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,119
I'm sick and tired of this.

194
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,249
Get up!

195
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:50,889
At least you do as you're told.

196
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,759
You're lying back down?
I told you to get up.

197
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,629
You're dreadful when you're drunk.

198
00:11:57,229 --> 00:11:58,629
Darn you.

199
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:01,430
My goodness.

200
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:04,999
Where did you go to drink so much?

201
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:08,269
Gain control of yourself.
You're embarrassing me.

202
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,509
You silly...

203
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,109
- You might fall.
- Get a grip.

204
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:14,909
Is it your second daughter? Seon Ju?

205
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,420
She stinks. She's dreadfully drunk.

206
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,050
Stay awake, you brat.

207
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,859
I'm really sorry. I'm sorry about this.

208
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,830
Why would you apologize, Mom?
I should be feeling sorry.

209
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,790
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, dear...

210
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,930
- Here's my ID.
- Are you out of your mind?

211
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,200
Why would you show them your ID?

212
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:36,239
If you don't mind,
could you please walk on?

213
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:38,800
- Yes, sure.
- She must be stressed out.

214
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,540
Is it true that she's divorced?

215
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,940
Why else would she be in that state?

216
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,479
Darn you.

217
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,609
Oh, I don't care anymore.
You're such an embarrassment.

218
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,550
Mom.

219
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:54,790
Mom.

220
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:57,259
(Hair Line)

221
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:07,800
Wake up. It's time to wake up.

222
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:10,139
- What the...
- Get up.

223
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:13,940
- Wake up. It's time to wake up.
- My goodness.

224
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,680
Come on out and eat!

225
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,810
You should rush to the table
in your pajamas if you smell food.

226
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,879
Mom.

227
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,850
Pi Seon Ju! Wake up!

228
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,420
Do I have to cook hangover soup...

229
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,359
for my married daughter?

230
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:32,930
Why did you drink so much?

231
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,430
I'm home.

232
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:40,899
Hey, it's dried pollack soup.

233
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:43,700
Goodness. Let's eat.

234
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:46,540
Wash your hands first.
Where did you learn to be so gross?

235
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,239
Do we have to be like someone?

236
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,440
Auntie Mi Ju's
not like any of our relatives.

237
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,149
We're alike. I'm gross just like you.

238
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:54,879
- Your eye boogers...
- Darn it.

239
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,019
Why do you always speak
so hatefully about each other?

240
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,450
Seon Ju. Why do you always sleep here?

241
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,389
She'll be the death of me.

242
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,159
You nuisance.

243
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,830
My goodness.

244
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:13,269
Where am I?

245
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:15,300
Oh, food?

246
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,639
My gosh.

247
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:19,040
You're all such troublemakers.

248
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,369
You look perfectly fine and normal.

249
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,639
I sent you to college,

250
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:24,340
and even married you off!

251
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,489
Why is Mom so grumpy?

252
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:38,320
- I don't know.
- As if you don't know.

253
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,159
You're the problem.

254
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,430
The eldest should be a good example.

255
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,100
What would the others pick up?

256
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,369
I married you off.
Why did you end up coming back?

257
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:51,600
Yes. I'm Han Man Eun's eldest daughter.

258
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:53,810
I nursed my sick husband...

259
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,180
and came back looking much older.

260
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:58,009
I'm a widow.

261
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,479
- Mom.
- You need to wake up.

262
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:05,350
If you're going to waste away
then come back,

263
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:07,690
don't get married in the first place.

264
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,389
Why do I even bother?

265
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:11,259
As if anyone would marry you now.

266
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:13,359
Don't say that. I will get married.

267
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,960
Women these days can't marry
if they don't have a job.

268
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,560
What's yours?

269
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,470
It can't be explained in one word.

270
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,629
Goodness.

271
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,700
You're always out and about
doing something that makes nothing.

272
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,769
Come to my salon and sweep the floor.

273
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:28,570
Why do you crush
your daughter's self-esteem?

274
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,840
I thought my youngest
would do the family some good.

275
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,149
How did you end up
messing up so catastrophically?

276
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,180
What would people think of us?

277
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,649
Yes.

278
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,550
I'm Han Man Eun's youngest daughter
who ruined her reputation as a mom.

279
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,790
I'm sick of being single...

280
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,229
and I want to live with a guy like crazy.

281
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,330
Regardless of my age,
you can call me a spinster.

282
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,430
We don't have a reputation.

283
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,540
Be quiet.

284
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,269
You're the worst of all.

285
00:15:58,269 --> 00:15:59,869
You're the stupidest.

286
00:15:59,869 --> 00:16:03,409
You let your husband bleed you dry
just so he could study abroad.

287
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:06,479
Who sacrifices that much
for their husbands these days?

288
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:07,710
Mom.

289
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,379
Don't go too far in front of the kids.

290
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:11,920
Do you mind that she hears?

291
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,590
I mind that the whole neighborhood knows.

292
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:15,249
Do you know what they say?

293
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:17,690
They say you'll get divorced soon.

294
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,830
They say we're lying
about Nam Jin being abroad.

295
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,590
They say you already got divorced
in secret.

296
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,930
They call this house Widow Plaza.

297
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,499
Yes.

298
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:31,040
I'm Han Man Eun's
second daughter Pi Seon Ju.

299
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,310
A dead tired long-distance wife
who supports her student husband.

300
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,340
I'm half a widow because we spent
over half our married life apart.

301
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:41,810
Why would you think or say
I'd get divorced?

302
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:46,119
Yes. There's still me
who never even got to get married yet.

303
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,690
Why would they call this Widow Plaza?
That's harsh.

304
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:50,590
Mom, what's "Widow Plaza?"

305
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:54,190
It's a nickname
for something like a folk village.

306
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:56,600
If you're done eating, go to your room.

307
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,560
- I'm done.
- I'm done.

308
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,300
My goodness...

309
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,269
Grandma's at it again.

310
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,580
She always starts with my mom.

311
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,850
That's better for her.

312
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:15,449
She ends with my mom
who gets scolded the worst.

313
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,179
It's time for the bear comment.

314
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,050
You look so normal,
so why are you as slow as a bear?

315
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,560
You pay for devotion with desertion.
You should be smarter.

316
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,859
- Mom.
- Why do you give people...

317
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,389
a reason to gossip?

318
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:31,830
Don't you dare come here drunk again.

319
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,129
If you do drink, go to your place.

320
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,699
- Mom.
- You need to stop...

321
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:38,840
sleeping at other people's homes
when you're drunk.

322
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,240
- Mom!
- What?

323
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,980
Don't be so harsh.

324
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,280
You won't get to see me
this often anymore.

325
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:49,480
Are you going somewhere to die?

326
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,219
I'm your daughter, okay?

327
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,290
It's not like that.

328
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:57,459
Ji Hyun's dad is flying back tomorrow.

329
00:17:57,889 --> 00:17:59,959
- What?
- For real?

330
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:02,060
Yes, for real.

331
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,780
Why are you telling me this now?

332
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,550
He thinks he found a place to work too.

333
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:27,419
I think that's why he'll be back so soon.

334
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,050
I found out just yesterday.

335
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,359
Where will he work at?

336
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,859
He didn't tell me,
but I think it's a great company.

337
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:40,730
Mom. Studying abroad was hard on him too.

338
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,969
He said he didn't want to waste
the money I sent on bottled water,

339
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,570
so he filled an old bottle with tap water.

340
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:51,310
He shared a tiny apartment
with four others.

341
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,209
The bedroom was so small,

342
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,750
they couldn't even lie straight.

343
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,879
(Hair Line)

344
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,590
You told me off for being dull as a bear,

345
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,659
but now you'll get to see
how fancy a life this bear lives.

346
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:05,659
The stress is over and happiness is mine.

347
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:07,659
My life will be so rosy.

348
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:09,730
Not just mine but all of yours too.

349
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,899
Do you mean that?
Things will get better now?

350
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,570
My gosh...

351
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,840
Good for you. I'm so pleased.

352
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:21,469
When Nam Jin gets his first paycheck,

353
00:19:21,469 --> 00:19:24,010
I'll buy you a designer bag.

354
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,280
- Me too.
- Nam Jin's stingy.

355
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,709
He won't be that generous to us.

356
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,719
Mom. He had a hard time
living and studying abroad,

357
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,750
so when he comes back,
welcome him and treat him nicely.

358
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:37,219
When did I not treat him nicely?

359
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,520
He was never sweet to me.

360
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,629
Okay. I'll tell him to be sweet to you.

361
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:44,500
I don't expect that.
Tell him to be sweet to you.

362
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,369
You sacrificed so much for him.

363
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,240
Don't worry.
He said he'd make it up to me.

364
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,139
Did he really say that?

365
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:55,669
Yes. Aren't you happy
you have such a great son-in-law?

366
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:58,080
You said
he didn't look trustworthy enough,

367
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,010
but I bet you didn't expect this.
You feel bad, don't you?

368
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,980
Well, I didn't
disapprove of him that much.

369
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,149
I just didn't like his first impression.

370
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:08,619
Anyway, aren't you pleased?

371
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:11,359
I am. I'm pleased.

372
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,760
Will you go to the airport to pick him up?

373
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:17,500
Yes. I'll take Ji Hyun too.

374
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,030
He likes young radish kimchi, doesn't he?

375
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:21,330
Take a box.

376
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,270
This is so exciting.

377
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:32,709
Drop by on the way home from the airport.

378
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:34,379
I'll cook you dinner.

379
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,859
- Mom, look.
- What?

380
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:47,790
Let's check it out.

381
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,300
I'll be the first one there!

382
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,030
- Mom's faster.
- Not by much.

383
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,869
Let's add another stone to the pile.

384
00:20:58,869 --> 00:20:59,909
Okay.

385
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:02,939
We made quite a big pile.

386
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,209
Okay, thanks.

387
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,379
It looked unstable at first,

388
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:09,949
but now it looks like it's pretty sturdy.

389
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,290
Happy signal.

390
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:15,449
- Signal.
- Signal.

391
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,030
What did you wish for?

392
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,399
Well,

393
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:29,840
I wished our family
would stick together...

394
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,869
and live healthy and happy lives.

395
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:33,540
- What about you?
- It's a secret.

396
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,639
What? Tell me.

397
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,510
- It's a secret.
- Tell me.

398
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,449
- It's a secret!
- What is it?

399
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:42,310
That's it. Keep going.

400
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,719
Look straight ahead and pedal hard.

401
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,949
There you go. You're doing great.

402
00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:48,090
- Tell me.
- Keep going.

403
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,490
- I'm behind you.
- It's a secret!

404
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,719
- Go on.
- Tell me.

405
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:51,889
- It's a secret.
- Tell me.

406
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:53,730
There you go. You're doing great.

407
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,889
- Tell me.
- Yes.

408
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:56,230
I don't want to tell.

409
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Ji Hyun!

410
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,230
- Oh, no.
- Tae Ri!

411
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:02,169
Tae Ri.

412
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,169
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

413
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,939
Good boy. You didn't cry.

414
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,480
I'm glad you were padded up.

415
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,209
Oh, no...

416
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:16,480
- Why did you topple this?
- Hang on.

417
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:19,820
What now?

418
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,750
I'm sorry.

419
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,189
Tae Ri, let's clear these away.

420
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,730
No. These rocks. We...

421
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:29,899
You can't just sweep them all up.

422
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:33,800
We'd stacked them in a pretty cone.

423
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,869
A cone.

424
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:36,939
Tae Ri. A cone.

425
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,469
- Let's make it tall with a pointed tip.
- Okay.

426
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,770
It's not something
you can slap together...

427
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,709
like with concrete and steel rods.

428
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:46,550
It takes time.

429
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,580
Did you and your daughter stack it?

430
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,689
I'm sure other passers by
added a rock or two.

431
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:56,619
But we were the ones who got it started.

432
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:58,490
About 50... No.

433
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,929
We're responsible
for about 70 percent of it.

434
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:03,060
Yes. We made a wish each time.

435
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,800
It stayed upright for so long,

436
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,899
and you smashed it down
when tomorrow is our D-day.

437
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,340
Now I feel horrible. It's like I'm jinxed.

438
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,810
It's a park made for public use.

439
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,310
Taking up space
so you can make private wishes...

440
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:20,480
could come across as being selfish.

441
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:22,649
- What?
- Well,

442
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:26,280
making wishes to a stack of rocks
isn't exactly scientific.

443
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,449
My goodness. Hey, you. Listen.

444
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,590
And concrete isn't just "slapped on."

445
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,189
It should never be "slapped on"
in a short amount of time.

446
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,889
That's shoddy work.

447
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:38,060
- Why you...
- What I'm saying is,

448
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,240
something like this
won't jinx you or your future.

449
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,340
You can relax.

450
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:46,810
What?

451
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,139
Tae Ri. Say you're sorry.

452
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,310
I'm sorry.

453
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,280
My son didn't crash into it on purpose
and he apologized.

454
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:56,379
Forgive him now.

455
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,689
It's okay. Don't cry.

456
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,929
It's okay. Stop crying.

457
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:08,060
Fine.

458
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,600
Kid, don't cry.

459
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,060
Are you okay?

460
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,030
Okay, then...

461
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:22,540
Let's go.

462
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,050
Are you really okay?

463
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:33,919
It's fine.

464
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,859
How mean.

465
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,300
Using space for personal use is selfish?

466
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:46,330
What a joke. It's not like I live there.

467
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,369
I don't believe it.

468
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:49,899
Hang on.

469
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,169
What did he say
about me not being scientific?

470
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:56,409
He wasn't exactly wrong.

471
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,840
Hey. The pile of stones
meant so much to us.

472
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,580
- It did.
- We wished our family well.

473
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,280
We were going to bring Dad over
and surprise him with it.

474
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,060
That's why we put so much effort
into it while he was away.

475
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,919
Every rock came with a prayer.

476
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,990
- It did.
- That's why I'm angry.

477
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,730
But when the kid cried, I felt...

478
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,669
I felt like a mean adult
who made kids cry.

479
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,100
What can we do?

480
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,100
As he said,
the kid didn't crash into it on purpose.

481
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,840
If you'd kept yelling at them,
you'd have made a fool of yourself.

482
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,350
Hey. Whose side are you on?

483
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,679
I'm on no one's side.

484
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:36,719
What?

485
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,389
Ladies and gentlemen.
Our flight will take off soon.

486
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:49,389
- Excuse me.
- For your safety,

487
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:51,629
please put your luggage under the seat...

488
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:53,830
in front of you
or in the overhead cabinets.

489
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,570
Ladies and gentlemen.
We will be departing shortly.

490
00:25:58,939 --> 00:26:00,510
- Please...
- When do you take off?

491
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:02,169
Tell me the flight number...

492
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:03,939
and Tae Ri and I will meet you.

493
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,109
Or under the seat in front of you.

494
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:08,810
- Hello.
- I'll help find your seat.

495
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,619
Hello.

496
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,619
It's a real shame
the pile of stones is gone. Right?

497
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,790
Yes.

498
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,060
Come in.

499
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,399
Here we go.

500
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,040
It's so heavy.

501
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,669
This goes in here.

502
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:38,209
It's Dad.

503
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
Honey.

504
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:43,480
Of course, we'll be at the airport.

505
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,179
No, I'm not tired at all.

506
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:47,619
Yes.

507
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,060
Really?

508
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,689
Okay.

509
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,859
Dad seems to want to take
the limousine bus.

510
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:00,530
He wants to meet us at home.

511
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:02,929
We won't pick him up, then?

512
00:27:04,869 --> 00:27:07,169
We will. He'll have lots of luggage.

513
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:09,139
Wouldn't he prefer a private ride?

514
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:10,709
Yes. Let's go in secret.

515
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:13,010
Okay. Let's give him a huge shock.

516
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,149
Okay!

517
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,750
- Let's shower and go to bed.
- Okay.

518
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,429
We meet again.

519
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,070
- Ms. Jin.
- Yes.

520
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:43,040
Why did you scout me
to work at your father's company?

521
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,449
We can't lose out
on hiring talent like you.

522
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,820
No one's looking.

523
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,219
We booked separate seats
just to be extra careful.

524
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:58,820
Isn't that a bit much?

525
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:01,889
It's a direct flight to Korea.

526
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,699
Someone we know could be on board.

527
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:07,869
It never hurts to be cautious.

528
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:10,770
Then how will you manage
to work with me...

529
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,439
in the same company?

530
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:51,810
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

531
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,830
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

532
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,929
We can't meet as freely as before
once we exit the gate.

533
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:14,429
Darling honey, we're on our way.

534
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,070
- Let's go!
- Okay.

535
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,000
Shall we not enter Korea?

536
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,740
Ms. Pi, there's bad news.

537
00:29:19,939 --> 00:29:21,240
