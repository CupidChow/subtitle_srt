00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,460
(Episode 47)

2
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,230
I'll take you to the Cloud Hotel.

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,460
Okay.

4
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:35,879
When will he come home?

5
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:40,620
What if he's with Chu Ah
and another scandal breaks out?

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,990
If it's a team dinner,
Mi Ju will be there too.

7
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:48,090
I'm sure he'll be fine.

8
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,439
What are you looking at?

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,409
Yes. I'm an actress.

10
00:01:07,179 --> 00:01:08,509
Have you never met a celebrity before?

11
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:11,979
The guy who's half passed out
is actor Jeong Woo Sang.

12
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,950
You can post about us online if you want.

13
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,709
What?

14
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:38,510
Oh, my gosh.

15
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,950
Goodness.

16
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,849
Oh, dear.

17
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,549
You could've woken me up.

18
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:50,819
You were too fast asleep.

19
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:52,489
I was afraid you'd punch me.

20
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,530
I do pack a serious punch.

21
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,700
Shall we race home again?

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,739
The loser has to
wait outside for five minutes?

23
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,840
No. Let's walk home together today.

24
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,010
It's cold.

25
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:09,939
- Shall we, then?
- Yes.

26
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:11,439
- Give me a moment.
- Sure.

27
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,659
Why does Seon Ju
come home so late all the time?

28
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:28,930
The homeowner too.

29
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,870
I noticed how they always come home
around the same time.

30
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,469
Yes.

31
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,669
The economy is not exactly great.
I guess all companies are struggling.

32
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,439
I'll wait outside for a bit.

33
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:44,979
Why would you do that? They're not kids.

34
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:53,250
My mom is usually in bed by now.

35
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,919
I'm not in bed.

36
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,919
You came in together again?

37
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,099
Yes. What a coincidence.

38
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,599
Are you two dating?

39
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,270
Why would you say that, Mom?

40
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,210
Don't be silly.
Do you know who he's married to?

41
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:16,240
This has been happening too often.

42
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,310
How do you always come home together?

43
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,110
There's something between you,
isn't there?

44
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,419
There isn't.
We just work at the same company.

45
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:26,449
What?

46
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,689
How come...

47
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:31,219
Why didn't you tell me so?

48
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,360
Well...

49
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,900
Saying we live in the same house
and work together too.

50
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,030
It sounds a bit weird.

51
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:41,729
We didn't want people,

52
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:43,439
especially the neighbors,
to misunderstand.

53
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,509
Mr. Homeowner.
Do you really work at the same place?

54
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,479
- Yes.
- Then do you know...

55
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:52,680
the CEO's daughter called Jin Sang Ah?

56
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,050
Yes, I do.

57
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,849
Okay. Then do you know Jeon Nam Jin
who recently joined the company?

58
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,750
I do.

59
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:04,460
Are you higher up than those two?

60
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,759
He's way higher.

61
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,129
He's way more competent too.

62
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,629
Hey...

63
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,270
I didn't think so,
but you're a pretty great man.

64
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,669
Not really.

65
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:20,569
I don't need to see to know...

66
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:24,180
how nasty Jin Sang Ah will be
and how much she'll brag.

67
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,250
If she bothers my Seon Ju, can you...

68
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,980
put her in her place?

69
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,189
And if they fight,
can you side with Seon Ju?

70
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,620
Yes. I can do that.

71
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,620
I don't know if you know,

72
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,629
but the fool Jeon Nam Jin
is her ex-husband.

73
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:43,160
If you come across him,

74
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,230
give him a death glare every now and then.

75
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,870
Okay. I'll do that.

76
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:50,699
Good. I feel so reassured.

77
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,839
Take Tae Ri upstairs with you.

78
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:53,939
I will.

79
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:17,360
Woo Sang. Do you know where we're going?

80
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:19,529
We're going somewhere nice.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,269
You grew to like me too, right?

82
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,970
Were you looking forward to this?

83
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,310
Pi Mi Ju. You didn't go home?

84
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:38,680
What are you saying? I'm Jin Chu Ah.

85
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,350
You're not Pi Mi Ju?

86
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,290
Why are you looking for her
when we're headed to a hotel?

87
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,089
Why do you hate her so much
when she's trying to get through life?

88
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:49,089
She's adorable.

89
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,129
What? She's adorable?

90
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,629
Pi Mi Ju is?

91
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:53,930
Yes.

92
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,870
She's pretty.

93
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,540
Woo Sang. Don't you have eyes?

94
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,740
I do.

95
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:01,970
Don't you think...

96
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,379
she looks like a cross between
Jun Ji Hyun and Kim Tae Hee?

97
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,350
She what?

98
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:10,579
Take that back or I'll get out of the car.

99
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:13,449
You won't take it back?

100
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,019
Hey. Pull over.

101
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,329
- Over here?
- Do it now.

102
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,970
I'm leaving!

103
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,670
Don't look for me!

104
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:37,540
Okay, bye.

105
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,350
Can we really leave her out here?

106
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,879
Leave. Get out of here!

107
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:47,089
Let's go. Drive on right now.

108
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:07,069
Pi Mi Ju looks like whom?

109
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:09,509
That jolted me sober.

110
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:13,779
Where am I? Why am I here?

111
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,420
Why did I get out of my car?

112
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,389
Taxi.

113
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,620
My bag.

114
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:26,290
My phone.

115
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,629
We're here.

116
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,139
Jin Chu Ah isn't here.
Do you still want to go inside?

117
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,870
Shall I take you home?

118
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,949
But this is her car. What should I do?

119
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:50,480
Not here. Let's go inside.

120
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,220
Hang in there while I park.

121
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,389
I'll take you to the toilet.

122
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,819
We'll go inside.

123
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,069
Get up.

124
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,009
We're at the hotel. Go to the men's room.

125
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,850
Will you get up?

126
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,019
Watch your feet. Plant them on the ground.

127
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,889
He needs to go to the toilet.
We won't be long.

128
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,759
Welcome.

129
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,060
Come this way.

130
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:36,629
What? Okay.

131
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:37,759
(Parking Lot)

132
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,769
Come on.

133
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,899
My gosh. I can barely walk.

134
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:50,539
Not out here. Swallow it.

135
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:54,649
Watch your step.

136
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,850
My goodness.

137
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,820
What is it?

138
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,120
No. Swallow whatever it is.

139
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:07,690
Yes. That's it.

140
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,259
Go to Suite 614.

141
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,200
Enjoy your stay.

142
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:22,470
Swallow it.

143
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,049
My gosh.

144
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:34,389
Are stars given a key card
to a secret location...

145
00:09:34,789 --> 00:09:36,690
just for showing up?

146
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:39,090
That's impressive.

147
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,860
Will you wake up? You're so darn heavy.

148
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,370
You're so heavy.

149
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:02,049
Goodness. Take off your shoes.

150
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,789
What's all this?

151
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:19,669
My gosh. Jin Chu Ah.

152
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,830
She planned this.

153
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,539
What weird taste.

154
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,870
Do you feel better now?

155
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:31,840
Don't you need to throw up?

156
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:38,750
Are you sure you're okay?

157
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,389
I drove you here
because I was your driver for hire.

158
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,129
I'd love my services to be for free,

159
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:48,929
but we need to honor the transaction.

160
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:51,700
If you don't mind too much,

161
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,570
I'll pay myself.

162
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,710
- Who are you?
- My gosh.

163
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:04,840
Darn you.

164
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:06,850
What are you? A pickpocket?

165
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,350
No, I'm...

166
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:11,649
It's me, Mi Ju.

167
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,919
I'm Mi Ju.

168
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:17,019
- Mi Ju?
- Yes.

169
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,490
Let go. You're hurting me.

170
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,360
What are you doing?

171
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,230
You almost sprained my wrist!

172
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,929
What is this place?

173
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:30,000
Why are you here with me?

174
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:34,769
You and me... Here...

175
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:38,110
What did you do?

176
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:42,779
I didn't do anything here or to you.

177
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:47,120
It looks like the doings of the person
who wanted to bring you here.

178
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,250
Who's that?

179
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:50,960
Darn it.

180
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Lady.

181
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,399
I saw you somewhere.

182
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,529
How about a drink with me?

183
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,769
Miss. Let's get a drink somewhere.

184
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:04,440
Darn you.

185
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,269
I was driving you both,

186
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:10,539
and then she got really angry
and asked to be let out, so I let her out.

187
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,110
Why did she get angry?

188
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:13,850
Well...

189
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:17,580
It was because you said...

190
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,350
I was pretty.

191
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,460
I said you were pretty?

192
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,519
You said I was a cross...

193
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:28,059
between Jun Ji Hyun and Kim Tae Hee.

194
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:30,360
- I couldn't have.
- You did.

195
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,460
My gosh.

196
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:37,269
Drunk me could get into serious trouble.

197
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,799
I lose my mind.

198
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,110
What? I think
you don't look too bad yourself.

199
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,350
What? Don't say things like that.

200
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:48,649
Are you a hater?

201
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:51,419
No. You're way more handsome.

202
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,590
With looks and a figure like this,

203
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,990
I think you should pay a handsome tax.

204
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:00,429
You think?

205
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:03,059
Maybe?

206
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:04,529
I'm right.

207
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:06,600
You're pretty famous now,

208
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,899
but you must become way more successful.

209
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,440
Right now, you're a weekend drama star,

210
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:16,610
but you should become an OTT star next.

211
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,110
Really?

212
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,750
Yes.

213
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,419
Can you bring that over?

214
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,100
Shall we drink?

215
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,799
You and me?

216
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
Yes.

217
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,909
She set all this up.

218
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,679
We might as well.

219
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:54,580
Hey.

220
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,179
This looks really expensive.

221
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:08,659
Here.

222
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,629
Cheers.

223
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,509
Cheers.

224
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,850
Hi, what?

225
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,289
Hey. How about a drink?

226
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,159
What? At this time?

227
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:41,460
Yes. It's on me.

228
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:43,659
It's too late.

229
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,700
Even if the drinks are on you,

230
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,639
I can't go out with a face
this shiny with sebum.

231
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,240
I might if he were to buy a house.

232
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,850
Where can't you go with a shiny face?

233
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:03,850
What? It's nothing.

234
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,620
Who wants to see you? Is it a guy?

235
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,220
So what if it is?

236
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:09,759
Then you should go see him.

237
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,490
Even if it's late at night.

238
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:14,929
You're patting that in really hard.

239
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,899
Do you want to become pretty?

240
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:20,330
I was pretty and I still am.

241
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,370
What got into everyone today?

242
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes, sure you are.

243
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,100
Drink the milk out here.

244
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,240
Don't leave the empty pack in your room.

245
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:40,690
You're home?

246
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,059
What are all those papers for?

247
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:45,559
Can you make me a coffee?

248
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,889
Shouldn't you be going to bed?

249
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,230
Get me a coffee.

250
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,259
What a nuisance.

251
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:52,000
I preferred it when I lived alone.

252
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:26,730
My losing Dad's favor.
Isn't that what you want?

253
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:28,230
- What?
- Why do you...

254
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,570
keep acting like you're my mom?

255
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,539
Do you have a stepmom complex?

256
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,210
You've done enough.

257
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,179
Sang Ah. Let's talk.

258
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:43,419
I'm tired.

259
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:55,860
Sit down.

260
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:58,730
Didn't you hear me say I was tired?

261
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,070
- If this is about Nam Jin...
- Sit down!

262
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,009
Get to it. What's this about?

263
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:12,440
You.

264
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:16,150
You are my birth daughter.

265
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,119
What?

266
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,089
You are my birth daughter.

267
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,460
Mother.

268
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,099
Do you think this is fun?

269
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,500
Why are you doing this to me?

270
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,299
Because it's the truth.

271
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,190
You said I wasn't.

272
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,259
You said Dad's first wife was my mom.

273
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,259
I didn't even know...

274
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:05,660
I was pregnant with you.

275
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:10,240
I barely showed even when I was full-term.

276
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:36,190
What do you mean?

277
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,930
You weren't the one
who saved my father-in-law's life?

278
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:44,670
Ms. Shim.

279
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,170
Help me.

280
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,539
Ms. Shim.

281
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,240
You're pregnant too?

282
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,680
Ms. Shim.

283
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,690
I was a single woman...

284
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,789
and I couldn't tell anyone
I was having a baby.

285
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,559
That was when the accident happened.

286
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:10,829
So why am I my dad's daughter?

287
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Ma'am.

288
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,170
Wake up.

289
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,369
Wake up!

290
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:19,339
What should we do?

291
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,210
- Get the doctor.
- Okay.

292
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:26,849
Nurse. I want to...

293
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,309
have my baby.

294
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,920
- Do a C-section.
- What?

295
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,589
I worked hard through my pregnancy,
so my stomach isn't that big,

296
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,259
but I'm nine months pregnant.

297
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:40,990
I think my stomach
took a hit in the accident.

298
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:43,460
I should have the baby now.

299
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,430
I'll ask the doctor.

300
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,430
Okay.

301
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,750
So what?

302
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:09,519
Did you swap me
with the baby Dad's first wife had?

303
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:12,289
What happened to that baby?

304
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,289
That baby...

305
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,289
died.

306
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,500
The C-section went well.

307
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:26,099
Your baby is slightly on the small side,

308
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,670
but not enough to go into an incubator.

309
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:33,079
I'm sorry to give you the news,

310
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:36,180
but your friend passed away.

311
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,950
Oh, no.

312
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,200
Both Seol Hee...

313
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,769
and her baby...

314
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:56,269
died back then.

315
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,349
Where did she go?

316
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,589
I felt sorry for your dad
who'd lost his wife and child.

317
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:22,829
I couldn't tell him they were both dead,

318
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,829
so I told him
that you were his wife's baby.

319
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,269
You toyed with my life?

320
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:34,970
I thought that was the best for everyone.

321
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,440
First, you said you weren't my birth mom.

322
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,549
Now you're telling me
Dad isn't my real dad?

323
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:44,519
Who is my dad, then?

324
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:50,359
Tell me. If this is true,
I must have another dad.

325
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:55,130
I get that you have a grudge
because I'm seeing Nam Jin,

326
00:21:55,859 --> 00:21:57,900
but you can't come up with
a story like this out of anger.

327
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,200
Now you're struggling
to do damage control.

328
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,500
Does my birth father actually exist?

329
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,200
It's a lie, isn't it?

330
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,269
He's dead.

331
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,640
He died too.

332
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,269
Darn it.

333
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,490
We'd agreed to marry,

334
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,119
but he just died.

335
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,759
I don't know what's true and what's a lie.

336
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,029
I can't believe you.

337
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,930
Must we go to a lab to get our DNA tested?

338
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,430
Let's do that, then.

339
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,470
Luckily for us, your blood type
is a combination of mine and your dad's.

340
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:42,269
That's why no one caught on.

341
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:43,880
If you don't believe me,

342
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:46,680
get some of your dad's hair and test them.

343
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,180
See if he's your real dad
or if I'm telling the truth.

344
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:08,569
Why are you telling me this?

345
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:11,470
What if your dad
were to realize the truth?

346
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,539
He'll bury us both
in private and in public...

347
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,440
for deceiving him
for as long as you lived.

348
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,049
Who can say that day won't come?

349
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:24,579
I've had enough of you acting out.

350
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:26,579
We might lose everything.

351
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:30,660
Do you think I lived a life-long lie
just to let it crumble like this?

352
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,430
This is a really important project.

353
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,099
My dad said he'd accept the result,

354
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:17,670
so we must win at all costs.

355
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,910
Only then can we
get rid of Seon Ju and So Woo...

356
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:23,779
and make Jin Architecture ours
in the future.

357
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,480
I think we can get the necessary height...

358
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:09,720
if we lower this by just 1 or 2 steps.

359
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,059
Yes. I agree.

360
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,859
- Have a look.
- Okay.

361
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,599
Cheers.

362
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,319
Just because...

363
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,950
we shared a drink,

364
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:43,349
you can't fall for me, okay?

365
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,519
I know that.

366
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,690
Good.

367
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:54,069
You're just a nice little sister to me.
Do you know that?

368
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:55,829
I do.

369
00:25:57,069 --> 00:25:59,740
Isn't that much better
than an evil little sister?

370
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,240
It is.

371
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,019
Hey.

372
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,990
How come you're so pretty?

373
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,500
What?

374
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:27,970
Why are you so pretty?

375
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,740
Because I'm an angel?

376
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,410
Hey.

377
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,509
Come here.

378
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:43,950
What?

379
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,819
Come closer.

380
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,750
Darn it.

381
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,269
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

382
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,220
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

383
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,390
Woo Sang.

384
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,259
Get out here!

385
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:33,519
Why are you such a mess?

386
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,730
Did I arrange
their first night together myself?

387
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:39,329
Don't you think
your design is right on point?

388
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,299
We need to take them seriously.

389
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:42,769
We have to do something.

390
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,799
Sorry. I didn't see you.

391
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,869
This is how you use a foot.

392
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:47,869
Darn you!

393
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
