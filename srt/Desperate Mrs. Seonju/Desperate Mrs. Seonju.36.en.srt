1
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,220
For real?

2
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:13,460
I mean...

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,129
we can think about it.

4
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:18,799
Think about it? Can we really?

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,969
Okay. Let's think about it.

6
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:25,470
Sir. No, Mr. Homeowner.

7
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:30,479
If you spent all your savings
to pay for half the house,

8
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:31,709
you must have a loan.

9
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:33,409
The interest rate might go up.

10
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,880
We'll put down a long-term deposit.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,819
You can repay the loan with it.

12
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:39,089
- I didn't take out a loan.
- I see.

13
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,520
Still, my mom.

14
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,520
She'll pay you rent for the salon.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,789
That will help you pay your bills.

16
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:48,759
I need that space for my office.

17
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:50,259
Okay, then.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,999
Then...

19
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,300
My big sister. She's a great cook,

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,039
and she has a son, so she knows boys.

21
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,370
She was a private tutor,
so she can teach your son.

22
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:02,139
And there's me.

23
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:05,109
I'm pretty good at any kind of odd job.

24
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,249
And my Ji Hyun. She and Tae Ri.

25
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:11,350
If they go to the same kindergarten,
we can share pick-up and drop-off duties.

26
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,490
How great would that be?

27
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,830
My younger sister Mi Ju.

28
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:23,860
She's a bit of a troublemaker,
but she's not a bad person.

29
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:26,869
She thinks pretty much like our kids do,

30
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:28,569
so they can all be friends.

31
00:01:28,669 --> 00:01:32,339
My mom doesn't want to move
or work far away,

32
00:01:32,339 --> 00:01:33,970
so if she finds work nearby,

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,539
she can do your hair for free.

34
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,979
And you needn't worry about the housework.

35
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,580
This could be a great opportunity.

36
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,979
Think about it.

37
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:45,520
A single dad's given all the help
he could possibly need.

38
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,289
You must've been good to others.

39
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,319
Has anyone told you...

40
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:54,660
you're like a snake oil merchant?

41
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,830
What?

42
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,229
You're talking utter nonsense,

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,640
but the more I listen,
the more intrigued I get.

44
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,699
I see.

45
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:06,770
I know very well it's not right,

46
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,410
but...

47
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,539
I'm wavering.

48
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:14,809
Good. Let's not think about it out here.

49
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:17,319
- Let's think about it inside.
- What?

50
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,049
- Where?
- Come inside.

51
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:20,919
- I don't mean...
- Tae Ri.

52
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,489
- What?
- Come here, Tae Ri.

53
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,660
- Come in. You must.
- Okay, then.

54
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,030
- Let's go inside.
- Come along.

55
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,190
- Is it this way?
- Yes. Come inside.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,840
He's considering and wondering
if we could live together?

57
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,139
Yes.

58
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,769
I think we could help him consider.

59
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:43,180
Come on.

60
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:46,710
We'll put down a long-term deposit
at the low end of the scale.

61
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,579
I'll look after your son
as if he were my own...

62
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,049
Oh, dear.
I mean as if he were my grandson.

63
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,819
I'll care for him when I can.

64
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:58,259
Kids love having lots of people around.

65
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:00,359
I'll do for him what I do for Ji Hyun.

66
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,729
We'll cook for you and wash your clothes.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,130
Can you do that?

68
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,600
No. You don't have to do that.

69
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,840
If we live together,

70
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,310
we just have to throw everything
in the machine in one go.

71
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,079
Don't say no.

72
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,340
Then...

73
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,780
every now and then,
can you feed Tae Ri a snack?

74
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,180
Don't you worry about that.

75
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,190
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

76
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,389
Then if we end up living together,

77
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:32,389
how should we allocate the bedrooms?

78
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:35,060
How about one room per household?

79
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,299
How should we define a household?

80
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:40,829
A parent and child is a household.

81
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,229
Okay. Then...

82
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,940
One, two, three, four.

83
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,109
Is that the four households?

84
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:50,609
You grasp things so quickly.

85
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,150
You must've done well in school.

86
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,180
Since there are four rooms...

87
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,690
No. Dong Won is a boy,
and he'll be a teenager soon.

88
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,519
He should have his own room.

89
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:04,389
- Jin Ju.
- Let's give Dong Won a room,

90
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,759
- and I'll sleep with Mom. Will that do?
- Hey.

91
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,970
Then it's one, two, three, and four.

92
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,100
Deal?

93
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:17,169
Yes.

94
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,310
Did you just nod "okay?"

95
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,109
My gosh.

96
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,580
Yes.

97
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,059
Are you sure?
We don't have to move out?

98
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:38,859
Right.

99
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:41,059
- Yes.
- That's great!

100
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:44,200
We have two years to get back on our feet!

101
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:47,299
I love my country!

102
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:50,470
Quack, quack!

103
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:54,340
- Then I'll go...
- We're saved.

104
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,239
chirp, chirp.

105
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,439
I have to make a noise too?

106
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,410
Moo.

107
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,850
Thank you so much.

108
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,760
Okay, then. Let's see.

109
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:16,499
Since you're the homeowner,
you should take the master bedroom.

110
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:18,059
Mom and Jin Ju can sleep in there.

111
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:21,270
- Okay. I'm okay with anything.
- That room's too small for three...

112
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,340
No. We're okay with anything.

113
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:29,479
No. You can take the master bedroom.

114
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,679
- Gosh, no.
- Wait. Can I do that?

115
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,510
Yes, you can.

116
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,179
Then where will you sleep?

117
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:43,220
He can't take the room by the entrance
when he owns the house.

118
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,760
The room next to the kitchen
is just as bad.

119
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,700
Your family can take
the whole of this floor.

120
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:52,570
We'll go upstairs.

121
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,700
My gosh. Will you really?

122
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,499
Will you be okay with that?

123
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,200
- Yes. That's fine with us.
- Oh, gosh.

124
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,210
Our spaces will be somewhat separated,

125
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,410
and we'd be more comfortable with that.

126
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,109
Oh, my gosh.

127
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:07,979
Thank you.

128
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:11,419
We should put everything in writing, then.

129
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:12,650
Wait.

130
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:15,850
You're so quick, Mom.

131
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,689
Here. Write all that down.

132
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,929
How long should we live like this?

133
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,030
A long-term lease usually lasts two years.

134
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:29,400
Two years?

135
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,109
My family's really lost right now.

136
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,809
How about until we get our bearings
and have a plan?

137
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:37,910
Let's make it two years.

138
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:39,309
Okay!

139
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,549
I don't know what kind of office
you'll open downstairs,

140
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:48,789
but how about we each use half the space?

141
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:51,260
My hair salon's way bigger than you think.

142
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,590
I can't do that.

143
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:56,760
- Mom.
- Okay, forget it.

144
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,400
Pretend you didn't hear that.

145
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,330
Everyone. Jump up
and start moving your stuff.

146
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,570
- Get up and get moving.
- Okay. Tae Ri, stand up.

147
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,869
Get to it. Move, everyone.

148
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,010
Sit down here and wait.

149
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,210
Let's see...

150
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,820
What can I help you move and where?

151
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:21,289
We'll take care of this room.

152
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:23,960
Could you go up to Dong Won's room?

153
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:25,619
Oh, okay.

154
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,059
See you later.

155
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:32,799
My gosh. What a relief.

156
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,729
He saved our lives.

157
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,379
Hey.

158
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:46,609
Can I help you?

159
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,609
Well,

160
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,720
this desk and chair need to go downstairs.

161
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,689
Okay. Shall we move the desk first?

162
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,359
Yes.

163
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,059
I'm glad you're moving in.

164
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,960
Are you? Why?

165
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:03,260
I'm moving downstairs thanks to you.

166
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:07,169
This room's so old, everything creaks,

167
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,070
and it's freezing cold in the winter.

168
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:14,270
I'm glad you're glad we'll move in.

169
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:20,179
Will this thing fit through the staircase?

170
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,379
Seon Ju.

171
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:26,919
I think I can finally ask.

172
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,749
What does the house owner do?

173
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,359
Didn't you say he was jobless?

174
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,590
He doesn't work at all?

175
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,660
I don't think he has a regular job.

176
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,530
When we met at the secondhand bookstore,

177
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:38,999
I got the impression he'd been
studying for an exam for a long time.

178
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:40,299
I'm not surprised.

179
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,300
How could he pass
if he takes his kid camping?

180
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,840
I bet his kid would have a better chance
of passing the exam.

181
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,570
- Don't.
- Hey.

182
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,940
Why would someone like him need an office?

183
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,340
I don't know.

184
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,649
But I think it would be best
if we don't pry for details.

185
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:56,080
You're right.

186
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,590
I'm grateful he decided to put up with us,

187
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,220
but we just let a strange man move in.

188
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:06,930
I'm scared to think
what the neighbors will say.

189
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,729
Darn it.

190
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,029
Oh, well.

191
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:28,649
My gosh.

192
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,019
Goodness.

193
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:35,619
Taking a desk apart and then putting it
back together is a lot of work.

194
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:39,159
I'm sorry we put you to work
when you own the house now.

195
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,359
It's fine.

196
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:41,859
It feels like...

197
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,960
I signed the lease pretty impulsively.

198
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,430
I'm not sure if that was wise.

199
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,239
Important life decisions
are usually made impulsively.

200
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:55,909
Consider it a good thing
and go and get your stuff.

201
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,379
Is having a roof over your head...

202
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:01,180
the most important problem
to solve right now?

203
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:04,649
You bet. Food, clothing, shelter.

204
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:07,389
What's more important in life than that?

205
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,960
You say that
because you don't know who I am.

206
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:13,290
- What?
- If you knew,

207
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:17,930
you'd never have entertained
the idea to live with me.

208
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:23,470
Our relationship could be quite awkward.

209
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:27,239
You're right.

210
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:29,879
I did tell you all sorts of things.

211
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,909
We told each other
that our spouses cheated on us,

212
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:35,350
and we shed tears too.

213
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,080
What's wrong with that?

214
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,619
It's not like your wife
and my ex-husband are seeing each other.

215
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:44,119
Why would it be awkward?

216
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,430
- Well...
- The world is a rough place.

217
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:49,190
If you were to live with
a complete stranger,

218
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,200
you could and would wonder and worry
if they were a bad person.

219
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:56,200
I saw how you were with your son.

220
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,940
You're not a bad person, are you?

221
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:01,040
No.

222
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,479
Get going.

223
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:06,080
You should hurry if you're going to
the camping grounds and back.

224
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,779
Right.

225
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,550
Wait.

226
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,759
We promise to move out
before the two years are up.

227
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,560
Okay.

228
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,859
The kids didn't say anything,
but I guess they were worried.

229
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,759
Seeing how relieved they were...

230
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:26,769
and how pleased my mom was
made me feel...

231
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,570
Thanks so much.

232
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:35,609
Sure.

233
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,310
Thank you.

234
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:46,690
Your husband and my wife...

235
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,690
are seeing each other.

236
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,729
I mentioned Mr. Jeon to a friend of mine.

237
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,899
This is the best way to keep it quiet.

238
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,139
Tell him to go in for a meeting.

239
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:08,670
Letting him go for personal reasons
makes this a wrongful dismissal.

240
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:10,680
What?

241
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,009
He turned down much better offers
to come here.

242
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:17,080
You insist on working together
even after everyone knows what you did?

243
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:20,149
Where can he go now that everyone knows?

244
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:23,389
You honestly...
Do you have any sense of reason?

245
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,330
I'll decide
whether to fire him or keep him on.

246
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,430
This is my life and my problem.

247
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,700
I'd like you to respect my decision.

248
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,800
How dare you?

249
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,029
You'll go against me, then?

250
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:37,269
Honey.

251
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:40,239
Have some tea. I made you some.

252
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,109
So Woo.

253
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,180
He helped out ever since
our company's first struggle.

254
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,379
You don't get it.

255
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:49,580
You're right. I don't get it.

256
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,090
You have me
and many other capable employees.

257
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,290
- You don't get that, do you?
- What?

258
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,619
You ran the place as you wished so far.

259
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,460
If things aren't doing as well,

260
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,960
shouldn't you look back and wonder
if your management is the cause?

261
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:04,029
So what?

262
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,159
Are you saying you'll run the company?

263
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,899
Prove yourself first!

264
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:09,940
Give me a chance, then!

265
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,070
To be honest,
you're not that enterprising a leader.

266
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,269
You're old-fashioned.

267
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:15,940
I'm what?

268
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,080
You never let me do anything,
and I never got to voice my opinion.

269
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,409
I can't believe you're complaining...

270
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,580
That goes for my divorce too.

271
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,479
I was so hurt and upset
that I found myself doubting...

272
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,220
if I were even your daughter!

273
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,450
You...

274
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,090
Honey. Try to relax.

275
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,190
Oh, no.

276
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:36,159
Sit back down.

277
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:47,940
She's a wife and a mom,
but she's still a child.

278
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,180
Don't push her too far...

279
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,040
or she'll only go astray.

280
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:11,259
Hello?

281
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:13,470
Where are you?

282
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,399
I'm away from Seoul.

283
00:14:16,229 --> 00:14:19,440
I need you to come over so we can talk.

284
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,710
I believe I said all I needed to.
I'm sorry, sir.

285
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,810
Wait, So Woo. My company...

286
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:27,879
The company...

287
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,119
- Oh, no. Honey.
- Hello? Father.

288
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,649
So Woo. My husband fainted.

289
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:36,119
Get over here!

290
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,489
- What?
- Come over right now.

291
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,790
- Goodness.
- Okay.

292
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,350
Is that you?

293
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:04,379
You didn't say you'd be coming.

294
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,820
I'm so annoyed.

295
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,389
What's wrong?

296
00:15:09,489 --> 00:15:12,119
I don't like how Mom and Dad are reacting.

297
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,889
No one's on my side.

298
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,790
What happened?

299
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:19,629
(Mom)

300
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,999
She'll only nag even more.

301
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,139
Tell me what happened.

302
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:29,979
I'm tired. I want to rest a bit.

303
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,739
Get some sleep.

304
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:41,749
What's wrong with her?

305
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,659
Place an order now.

306
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,659
What you're looking at now...

307
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:50,430
- is a white pearl.
- That's pretty.

308
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,899
- Look at the size of it.
- Hang on.

309
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:54,300
What's so surprising...

310
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:56,570
is that it's not a small one.

311
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,540
This can't be a real pearl, can it?

312
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,170
- Nam Jin.
- Hi, Mom.

313
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,940
Your girlfriend...

314
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,580
bought me an apartment and a handbag.

315
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:06,340
What about it?

316
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,879
Shouldn't I get her something?

317
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:10,649
A home shopping channel is
selling pearl necklaces.

318
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:13,550
No, Mom.
Don't buy anything on your own.

319
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,790
Everyone has a different taste.

320
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,060
Right?

321
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,560
I must like her a lot.

322
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,229
I never wanted to buy Seon Ju anything.

323
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:25,930
But I want to shop for her.

324
00:16:26,229 --> 00:16:27,229
Okay, then.

325
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:31,639
It's 11mm wide,
and if you buy it from us today,

326
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,670
it'll be the best deal ever.

327
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:36,310
Hey. That looks nice too.

328
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:39,239
Who was that?

329
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:41,180
My mom.

330
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,420
Are you and your mother very close?

331
00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:49,090
Is it your mother again?

332
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,859
It's your mother.

333
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,060
What?

334
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:58,100
- Hello?
- Where are you?

335
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,129
Are you with Sang Ah?

336
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,369
Her father passed out.

337
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,369
If she's there, tell her to come over.

338
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:05,369
What?

339
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,570
What's wrong?

340
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,040
Hello, So Woo.

341
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:13,449
Hello.

342
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,379
What did the doctor say?

343
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,990
It was an acute shock due to
high blood pressure and hypoglycemia.

344
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,020
His blood test results weren't great,

345
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,090
and his veins are constricted.

346
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:27,459
He has to stay for a while to recover.

347
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,330
He had been under a lot of stress.

348
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,730
Hello. You're here.

349
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,770
Yes.

350
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,139
Will you just agree to whatever he says?

351
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:43,310
Why do you think he passed out
while on the phone to you?

352
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,080
Can you excuse us?

353
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,280
Okay.

354
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:49,750
It's fine. Stay lying in bed.

355
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:52,550
No.

356
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:57,889
Where are you staying these days?

357
00:17:58,159 --> 00:17:59,820
I moved into a new place today.

358
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,889
Where?

359
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,990
Did you find a nice place?

360
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,899
Yes, I think so.

361
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,800
Okay.

362
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:12,040
I wasn't able to tell Sang Ah,

363
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,139
but the Hansung project...

364
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:17,409
They'll hire us to do the job
if you're in charge.

365
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,080
- Is that so?
- This company.

366
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:23,250
We worked so hard to keep it going.

367
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,919
You prevented us
from closing down by winning...

368
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,750
the Anseong project
when you were just a rookie.

369
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:33,389
You never took the credit
because you knew I would look bad,

370
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:34,929
and I kept my mouth shut.

371
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,300
I was embarrassed that I'd almost
run the company into the ground.

372
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:41,100
If Sang Ah had known,

373
00:18:42,129 --> 00:18:44,340
she'd have treated you better
out of gratitude at least.

374
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,240
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:48,709
Don't be.

376
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:51,010
I'm stuck in a hospital
during this important time,

377
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:53,879
leaving you with a heavy burden.

378
00:18:55,209 --> 00:18:57,449
Can't you return to the company...

379
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,389
at least until the Hansung project's over?

380
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,990
I know it won't be easy for you,

381
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,219
but regardless of
your relationship with Sang Ah,

382
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,129
I must ask you a favor.

383
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:27,609
Did you talk to him?

384
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:29,780
Yes. I should leave now.

385
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,330
What did you tell him?

386
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,230
To come back to work.

387
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:46,899
- What did he say?
- It looks like he'll think about it.

388
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,429
Pretend you don't know
and don't say a word.

389
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,199
Okay.

390
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:55,770
I hope So Woo softens by then.

391
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,609
Sang Ah is not the comforting type.

392
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:02,379
I doubt things will go as I wish.

393
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:05,679
I don't think they'll part so easily.

394
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,419
Let's wait.

395
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:09,990
- Mom!
- Hi, Chu Ah.

396
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,490
Dad, are you okay?

397
00:20:11,689 --> 00:20:13,159
What happened?

398
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:14,859
So Woo's in the hallway.

399
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:17,129
Why are you here when I need to rest?

400
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:19,699
You'd have sulked if I didn't visit.

401
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:21,399
How did this happen?

402
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:23,129
This is why you shouldn't work too hard.

403
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,939
Go home and take her with you.

404
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,810
Sang Ah's on her way.
I'll go home with her after she sees you.

405
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,149
You're here too?

406
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,659
Who called you? Dad?

407
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,060
You left home and yet
you rushed right over when he fainted.

408
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,570
Do you think you'll get something
because he's in a hospital?

409
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:55,369
How can you say that
when your father is...

410
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:58,139
You ignored me completely
when I wanted to delay our divorce.

411
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,740
That's the reason he fainted.

412
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,109
And now you're worried?

413
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:05,179
What about you?
Are you so worried about him...

414
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,449
that you brought Mr. Jeon with you?

415
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,219
I drove her, that's all.

416
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,520
You left her with the divorce papers.

417
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,020
It's none of your business
whom she comes with to the hospital.

418
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,760
Not everyone acts like you two.

419
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:22,090
Lots of people out there
care about their families and kids.

420
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:25,199
That might go for Mr. Jeon's family
that you broke up.

421
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,669
You're worried about his family now too?

422
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,469
You're way too caring.

423
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,869
You just don't care about me.

424
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:32,939
Do you...

425
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:36,810
not feel bad at all
about what you did to his family?

426
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,879
Why should I feel bad
when I didn't break them up?

427
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:40,879
They weren't a good match.

428
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:44,250
How would you feel if you were to see
Mr. Jeon's ex-wife?

429
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,419
Mr. Kim. That's not for you to wonder.

430
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,290
If you don't feel bad about what you did,
you wouldn't mind seeing her.

431
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,659
Why should I mind?
She might feel embarrassed, though.

432
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,300
It's good to know...

433
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:00,369
I don't have to be considerate.

434
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,040
She'll think she was given a way out.

435
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,699
What are you talking about?

436
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:10,209
I'm saying I'll be shameless too.

437
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,070
I'm glad he'll be fine in a few days.

438
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,840
I was scared to death
thinking Dad might die.

439
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,540
- Don't say that.
- So Woo was there too.

440
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:47,649
- Did Dad call him?
- Yes.

441
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:50,550
He fainted while on the phone with So Woo.

442
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:52,280
That's how he heard and rushed over.

443
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,790
You really don't know
what they talked about?

444
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,290
Couldn't it have been
about reconciling with you?

445
00:22:59,389 --> 00:23:02,389
Even I think So Woo is
much better a guy than Mr. Jeon.

446
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:05,830
Mom. You said Nam Jin
was great son-in-law material.

447
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,699
That was when I didn't know
who his ex-wife was.

448
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,510
Mom. I'm hungry.
Let's order some food.

449
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,409
I left during a team dinner.

450
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:18,409
Malatang? Fried chicken?

451
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,840
What should we eat?

452
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,550
Why are you in such a good mood
when your dad's in hospital?

453
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:27,350
Oh, I got rid of a thorn in my side today.

454
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:31,689
Goodness.

455
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:46,969
Can you stop tossing and turning?

456
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:52,179
I've never slept with anyone
since my husband died.

457
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:54,379
This is so uncomfortable.

458
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,139
It wasn't me.

459
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:22,740
I didn't take it.

460
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,810
It wasn't me.

461
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,879
I really didn't do anything.

462
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,810
Explain this, then.

463
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,419
Are there any CCTV cameras here?

464
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,750
There aren't.

465
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,189
I'll call the police.

466
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,689
No, don't. Wait, Chu Ah.

467
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,330
- Did she take it?
- I don't know.

468
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:45,859
- What do you think happened?
- Why is she even here?

469
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,469
- Is she a thief?
- She isn't on the team.

470
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,139
Getting the police involved
won't do the drama any good.

471
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:56,740
Let's wrap this up
by you leaving the team.

472
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:58,740
That's what Chu Ah and I agreed to do.

473
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,649
I'm innocent and this is unfair.

474
00:25:01,109 --> 00:25:03,550
There's no proof that I stole it,

475
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,649
and there are no cameras here.

476
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,090
All you have is Ms. Jin's accusation.

477
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,350
The fact is
that her watch was in your bag.

478
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,560
I really did not take it.

479
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,030
The watch
wouldn't have walked in on its own.

480
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,590
If someone planted it there,

481
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,459
we'll never know who it was.

482
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:19,560
Exactly.

483
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,570
If one of you must leave the team
it has to be you.

484
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,300
- What?
- Should I fire a core character?

485
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,439
Chu Ah won't hold you responsible
if you leave the team.

486
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:31,280
Bye.

487
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,909
Let's empty our glasses
and move to another place.

488
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:37,520
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

489
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,169
Will you go to sleep?

490
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,639
The director must really hate going home.

491
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:04,409
He drinks too much.

492
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:06,980
Chu Ah's watch.

493
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,149
What do you think happened?

494
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:12,080
Should I not have suggested
we eat together?

495
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,520
I feel bad about it now.

496
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,949
I'm going downstairs. Good night.

497
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,550
Hello. I'm sorry to call so late.

498
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:50,790
Did you call to ask
about hiring Pi Seon Ju?

499
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:53,459
I had a lot to take care of recently.

500
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,929
I'll make the call tomorrow.
I apologize for the delay.

501
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:58,300
Okay. Do that for me.

502
00:26:58,429 --> 00:26:59,500
Bye.

503
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,199
Goodness.

504
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:52,550
(Han Hair Line)

505
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,090
Hey.

506
00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:57,990
You're up.

507
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,689
Yes. Are you going somewhere?

508
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,790
This is your breakfast.

509
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,830
Mom told me to bring it to you.

510
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,030
Thanks.

511
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Goodness.

512
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,270
(We'll hire you as an assistant designer.)

513
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,699
(Contact Jin Architecture's HR Team.
Congratulations.)

514
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:17,409
I got in.

515
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,409
Into what?

516
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,649
I got into Jin Architecture.

517
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:25,020
I'm to contact the HR Team.

518
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,859
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

519
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,810
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

520
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,580
I'll stay on until the project's complete.

521
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,580
Thank you.

522
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,280
You're not going to work here, are you?

523
00:28:57,379 --> 00:28:59,280
They lost the house because of me.

524
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:01,090
I deserve to struggle a bit.

525
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,820
You're in an awfully good mood.

526
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,859
The dashcam memory card
Chu Ah left with me. Where is it?

527
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,760
I fill my team with the people I want.

528
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,629
Pi Seon Ju?

529
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
