(Head of Planning, Kim So Woo)

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,399
I'd sit around with middle-aged guys
on concrete floors to eat delivery food...

3
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:24,799
and go home reeking of sweat and dust.

4
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:28,669
I like...

5
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,279
what I do a great deal.

(Head of Planning, Kim So Woo)

7
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,230
Let's do all we can
for the sake of our children,

8
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,540
and if our spouses don't change,
we should change to protect them.

(Episode 27)

11
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:39,550
- Mom, shall I wear this?
- What?

12
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:42,880
Yes, you'd look adorable.

13
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,389
Will you redo my hair too?

14
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:47,949
Okay.

15
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,630
Let's go...

16
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:57,300
and slice some steaks
and eat some nice pasta.

17
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,330
Okay. Let's act all cute too.

18
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,499
- What?
- To be honest,

19
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:06,169
you're not a coy or foxy kind of wife.

20
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,080
So you need to look and act sexy,

21
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,139
and I'll look cute.

22
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:20,749
Okay.

23
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,360
Do you want me to do this? "Honey."

24
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,059
Yes. Do your best.

25
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,960
And roll some pasta around your fork
and feed Dad too.

26
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,800
Can you do that?

27
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,069
Yes.

28
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:38,499
You look pretty.

29
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:07,529
You offered to take Tae Ri somewhere.

30
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:10,869
I asked,
and he wanted to go to the seaside.

31
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,869
- Did he?
- We'll be stuck in the car...

32
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:14,140
for a long time,

33
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,309
so why not stay there overnight?

34
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,110
Okay.

35
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,680
We can stay at...

36
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,050
Here it is.

37
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:27,089
Kids like the children's pool here.
Shall I make the booking?

38
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:30,420
Will you do it?

39
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,460
I'll do it.

40
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,260
Okay, then.

41
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:40,770
I'll text you the link to a few places.
Pick and book the one you like.

(Head of Interior, Jin Sang Ah)

43
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:08,689
Stay with your mom as long as you want
after you have the baby.

44
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:11,529
Joong Bae said he'd come back soon.
I should be here for him.

45
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,770
Is it a boy or a girl?

46
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,869
I didn't ask.

47
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,200
Joong Bae wants a girl, but I want a boy.

48
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,409
You should have a pretty girl
and enter her into pageants.

49
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:23,110
Do you want a boy to give the company to?

50
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,109
We can't force that on him.
He should do what he wants.

51
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,380
I want my child to be a comedian.

52
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,120
I love funny guys.

53
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:33,750
You're so silly.

54
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,390
My father-in-law was witty as well.

55
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:40,760
He'd have been overjoyed
if he got to see his first grandchild.

56
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,900
Exactly. We had no idea he was so rich.

57
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,859
My father-in-law was so frugal.

58
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,169
He was.

59
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:49,200
To think my friend did mouth-to-mouth...

60
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,539
on that shabby-looking old man
to save him...

61
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:53,210
It was such an embarrassing sight.

62
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,770
What do you mean?

63
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,140
You weren't the one
who saved my father-in-law's life?

64
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:01,979
Look ahead!

65
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:12,560
Why does he have a photo of a dead woman?

66
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,669
Hello, darling.

67
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,839
Where are the papers?

68
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,900
Did you give them to my driver?

69
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,510
I did. Is he not there yet?

70
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,640
He should arrive soon.

71
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,510
Bye.

72
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:41,450
My goodness.

73
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:43,520
What are you doing there?

74
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,359
You startled me.

75
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,810
You look adorable.

76
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,609
You look pretty too, Mom.

77
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:08,580
Do I?

78
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,120
We might get there a bit early.

79
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:13,750
Shall we take some photos?

80
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,919
Yes.

81
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:16,390
Let's go.

82
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,989
Hang on.

83
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:22,289
Hello, boss.

84
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,299
Today?

85
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,400
No, there's no room in my car.

86
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,839
Help me out.

87
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,909
The guy is here, and we need transport.

88
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:36,409
I'll pay you extra. You're free anyway.

89
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:38,779
I have dinner plans today.

90
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,810
Drop them off on the way.

91
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:42,919
I've been asking everyone for favors...

92
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,679
to get you extra work...

93
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:47,450
because I felt sorry for you.

94
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,849
Can't you do this for me?

95
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:50,219
Shall we just lose the job?

96
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,359
Okay, then.

97
00:06:57,299 --> 00:06:58,500
It looks like...

98
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:03,239
I need to drop by a supplier
to deliver some material to a site.

99
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,270
What if we end up being late for dinner?

100
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,609
Dad got angry last time
because you were late.

101
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,239
I had a good reason that time.

102
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:16,620
Don't worry. We have enough time.
Let's make a quick drop before dinner.

103
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:22,960
We made the gut-wrenching decision
to sell the house, and what?

104
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,159
It's old and not nice enough?

105
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,429
How could they say that to our faces?

106
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:28,929
Exactly.

107
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,260
Our house is a little old, though.

108
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,669
Should we have wallpapered it?

109
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:38,270
You want to spend money when we're selling
because we have nothing?

110
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,370
You lot should be trying to earn more.

111
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,039
Relax your shoulders and neck.

112
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,609
This is nice and warm.

113
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,219
Is he the CEO?

114
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:55,349
Hey, her dad is pretty handsome.

115
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,719
He's my type.

116
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,760
She should be quite pretty
if her dad looks like this.

117
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,000
Is this her?

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,870
Who's the CEO's daughter
who fell head over heels for my Nam Jin?

119
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,940
Mr. Jeon.

120
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:20,210
Let's talk.

121
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,460
What are you doing exactly?

122
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,630
- What do you mean?
- You wanted us both to get divorced.

123
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,870
We had a huge argument
with her and her sister,

124
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,640
and you want to take her
to that fancy place?

125
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,909
If you're going to end it one day,
bite the bullet and cut her loose.

126
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:53,209
You visit her mom
and run to see your sick kid.

127
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:56,079
And now you're running over
to buy her dinner?

128
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,079
It won't be just us.
Our daughter will be there too.

129
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:02,120
We were married for years.

130
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,919
It's too cruel to break up just like that.

131
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,260
So what? You'll take her
to a nice restaurant...

132
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:12,699
and break up with her
over an elegant meal without being cruel?

133
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,130
Finding out I was seeing you
would've shocked her a great deal.

134
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,640
I want to give them some time.

135
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,539
Give them time?

136
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,610
You said it wasn't fun...

137
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,779
being a candy
I was weighing out in either hand.

138
00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:31,419
Are you saying you want to drag it on
as you weigh out Seon Ju and me?

139
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:34,949
I don't mean that.
The best way to a smooth breakup...

140
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,689
is to talk to her so she gets it.

141
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:38,360
Isn't that...

142
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:40,829
what you're doing too?

143
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,789
What does that mean?

144
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,900
You're going on a family trip.

145
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,130
Your husband was looking up resorts.

146
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,770
It's not a family trip.
It'll be just me and my son.

147
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,770
You said Seon Ju was using our kid
to cling to me.

148
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:56,779
Why do you think Kim is letting you
travel with your son?

149
00:09:56,939 --> 00:10:00,049
He's trying to use him to get you to stay.

150
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:01,679
- What's the difference?
- It's different.

151
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:05,220
I don't let my kid dictate my feelings.

152
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,720
That's what you think.

153
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,120
You and Kim act like
you're cool and indifferent,

154
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,459
but you never know.

155
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,390
Things could get way dirtier
and way more dragged out.

156
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,000
Here we go.

157
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:31,039
Oh, this one is heavy.

158
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,549
My gosh.

159
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:39,079
Let's hurry, Mom.

160
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,789
We might be late.

161
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,220
I think your car sunk a bit.

162
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,529
It's because the tiles are heavy,
but I dispersed the weight evenly.

163
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,299
Look. The car is still level.

164
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,870
Are you sure it'll be okay?

165
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,439
Don't worry.
This is how it has always been.

166
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,500
Hop in.

167
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,520
Oh, dear.

168
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,559
What if Dad says
he doesn't want to live with us?

169
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,299
I'll beg until he agrees to.

170
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,740
Don't you know I'm like a bulldozer
that keeps plowing ahead?

171
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:36,240
I know.

172
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:38,480
Darn it.

173
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:43,419
You saw how the stone pile
got put back up.

174
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,779
It will happen.

175
00:11:46,049 --> 00:11:50,360
Everything we wished for will be granted
including interest, so don't worry.

176
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,090
Okay. Start the car already.

177
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,360
I think I smell something burning.

178
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:00,829
What?

179
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,799
Are the tires burning?

180
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:07,809
We're not far off, so it'll be okay.

181
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:09,240
Okay.

182
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:11,909
The engine is giving me a hard time today.

183
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:13,709
Hey.

184
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,309
- Hey.
- It's back on!

185
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:17,620
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

186
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,419
Where did I put it? Earlier on...

187
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:26,689
Here it is.

188
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,860
Here it was.

189
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:30,159
Are you leaving?

190
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:33,400
Yes. You were a great help today.

191
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,799
You were awesome in your scene today.

192
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,939
Was I?

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,069
I haven't acted in a while,

194
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:43,169
- and so many...
- That's enough, Mom. Let's go.

195
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:45,640
- I forgot so many...
- Goodbye.

196
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:53,650
Why are you trying to suck up to Ms. Oh?

197
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:55,650
What the heck is...

198
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,220
Are you trying to earn some points
because she is Woo Sang's mother?

199
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,360
Can we not do this? I'm tired.

200
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:04,900
If you think about it,
our family ties go way back,

201
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,870
so can't we try to get along?

202
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,100
What ties do you mean?

203
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,669
Our moms were good friends...

204
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:12,900
My mom doesn't remember your mom.
She has no memories of her.

205
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,909
My mom has clear memories.

206
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:17,539
My mom said
she let your mom stay with her.

207
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,380
And our older sisters met in high school.

208
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:21,110
I used to be your stylist,

209
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,079
and now I'm a fellow actor.

210
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,750
That means something.

211
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,850
Yes.

212
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:29,250
It means we have bad blood.

213
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,390
You're a lowlive that takes out the trash.

214
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,760
How dare you act like
you're my family's equal?

215
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,159
Hey.

216
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,329
Were you that special since birth?

217
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:42,130
Your mom used to work for my mom,

218
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:44,770
and your sister did poorer in school...

219
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,569
and in art compared to my sister.

220
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:48,970
When they were in school,

221
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,909
my sister was so pretty
your sister couldn't even look at her.

222
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:53,750
What? Are you done?

223
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,220
People freak out when they feel inferior.

224
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,220
Do you feel inferior to me?

225
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,459
Look at us now.
You came all the way here to see me.

226
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,289
I must be getting on your nerves.

227
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:09,689
- Darn you.
- Also,

228
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,370
it's "lowlife," not "lowlive."

229
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,699
All this trash... My gosh.

230
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,709
You made me spill it, so you clean it up.

231
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,779
Hey!

232
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,740
I hear barking.

233
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,350
Hey!

234
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:30,380
Darn her.

235
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:09,150
We're here.

236
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:13,689
This way?

237
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,240
- Mom. We weren't late.
- What?

238
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,569
See? I said we'd be on time.

239
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,539
You worry too much.

240
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,779
Would you like to order?

241
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,949
We're waiting for someone.

242
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,929
Yes, Jin Sang Ah. Let's fight.

243
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:57,270
Let's go all the way and see...

244
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,400
who gives in first.

245
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,949
- What?
- Hey.

246
00:16:08,949 --> 00:16:11,919
Did you do worse in high school
and art than Choon Hyang?

247
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,689
- What?
- Apparently,

248
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:15,590
Choon Hyang was better than you
in every way.

249
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,650
Says who?

250
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,990
Is that true or not?

251
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,689
That's nonsense.

252
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,329
You were beneath Choon Hyang in school...

253
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,299
that you didn't even dare look at her.

254
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,730
Pi Mi Ju said so.

255
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,870
The crazy witch.

256
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,539
You were madly jealous
of that Choon Hyang girl,

257
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:33,640
and when you met again,
your inferiority complex resurfaced.

258
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:36,510
That was what Choon Hyang told her sister.

259
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,880
Let's find out.

260
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,689
Are you hungry? Shall we order first?

261
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:52,390
Dad can order when he arrives.

262
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:55,090
No. Let's wait a bit longer.

263
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,019
Honey.

264
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:22,419
Why didn't you order?

265
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:25,259
Ji Hyun wanted to wait.

266
00:17:27,989 --> 00:17:30,030
We're ready to order now.

267
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,860
Scheduling a dinner with you
was as hard as...

268
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:09,630
booking to eat out with a famous star.

269
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,570
We're your biggest fans.

270
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:28,419
Offer Dad some of your pasta.

271
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:29,719
Okay.

272
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,989
Dad, taste this. Open wide.

273
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,830
No, thanks. You eat that.

274
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,100
Come on.

275
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,679
Honey.

276
00:18:57,979 --> 00:18:59,019
Do you want to try this?

277
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:06,659
What a coincidence.

278
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,489
Why are you here?

279
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,630
Can't I be here? I'm here to eat.

280
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,769
What are you doing?

281
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,669
You must be Ji Hyun.
I'm your dad's friend.

282
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:26,179
Nice to meet you.

283
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,080
What are you doing around our kid?

284
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,150
I thought I should befriend her too.

285
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,820
This is a good opportunity.

286
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,830
Come with me.

287
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:49,330
Let go.

288
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,179
My gosh.

289
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:06,650
How dare you show up here?

290
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:10,120
Mr. Jeon said
he was going to break up with you,

291
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,219
but I thought
he'd never manage on his own.

292
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:13,790
What?

293
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,860
You're pathetic.

294
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,630
You're using your kid to be clingy
to win back a man who doesn't want you.

295
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,499
Don't you agree?

296
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:24,100
Are you out of your mind?

297
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:27,169
Does your husband know
you're acting like this?

298
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:28,239
He knows.

299
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,040
My husband isn't as clingy as you are.

300
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:32,780
I just need you to get lost.

301
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,310
What if I do that? Will you marry Nam Jin?

302
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,380
Who knows?

303
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:41,189
We could marry
or just date to our hearts' content.

304
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:44,459
My goodness.

305
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:49,759
Aren't you...

306
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,229
going this far
just because he's my husband?

307
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:55,429
Am I better than you somehow?

308
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:56,429
What?

309
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,199
I'm right.

310
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,739
Yes. You were always like this.

311
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:06,409
I wasn't sure that was it, but it was.

312
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,209
What were you so jealous of?

313
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:10,620
What did you say?

314
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,790
You spiked the drink you gave me
before the art exam.

315
00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:16,120
Did you feel better
after you made me fail?

316
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:19,620
Did the trauma explode
when you saw me again?

317
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,489
Come on. Seriously?

318
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,400
Do you think you can beat me
if we have an actual fight?

319
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,229
What on earth are you doing?

320
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,340
Why come here only to be humiliated?

321
00:21:33,969 --> 00:21:35,370
Wait in the car. I'll be right down.

322
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,409
Honey.

323
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,939
Hey, you!

324
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,409
We need to talk.

325
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,530
Why take it out on her and not me?

326
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,630
She grabbed me by the collar first.

327
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,840
Let's be honest.
Who should assault whom right now?

328
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,370
I should beat her up!

329
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,810
I should slap her silly!

330
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,610
But she grabbed my clothes first!

331
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,810
I wanted us to break up nicely
over a decent chat.

332
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,679
So that we'd all hurt less.

333
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:21,620
- What?
- Did you have to ruin everything?

334
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:27,090
Pi Seon Ju.

335
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,330
Let's break up.

336
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,030
No. Will you please let me go?

337
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,840
Mom.

338
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,469
What are you doing here?
Did you finish your food?

339
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,040
I asked them to pack the leftovers.

340
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,650
Okay. Good for you.

341
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:51,749
I'll go and pay.

342
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:53,249
Honey.

343
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:55,290
Wait here, Ji Hyun.

344
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:56,489
Honey.

345
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:01,959
Honey.

346
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,860
Jeon Nam Jin.

347
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,429
Honey.

348
00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:12,900
Seeing that witch
made things much clearer for me.

349
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,070
I can't divorce you.

350
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,939
Honey. I'll be the bigger person
and forgive you.

351
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:22,350
I thought about ending it all,

352
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,479
but what about Ji Hyun?

353
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,019
What about when she's ready to marry?

354
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,949
Would her future in-laws like it...

355
00:23:26,949 --> 00:23:28,489
if her parents were divorced?

356
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:32,320
You should walk her down the aisle
and then sit next to me.

357
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:36,429
I'll be so pretty
in special makeup and a hanbok.

358
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:37,499
Wouldn't you like to see?

359
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,199
Get in. You can drive.

360
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,669
Don't do as she says.

361
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:46,870
This is just a game to her.

362
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:49,739
She got all competitive
because you were my husband.

363
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:52,979
She has some kind of inferiority complex.

364
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,150
We're a family.

365
00:23:57,249 --> 00:24:00,890
We should be with Ji Hyun
on her first and last days of school.

366
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:03,919
And we could travel as a family sometimes.

367
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,790
What more do you want to do?

368
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,330
Let's go home.

369
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,459
Come home with us.

370
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,199
You might dislike some stuff about me,
but what about Ji Hyun?

371
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:18,300
You don't dislike her, do you?

372
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,269
What are you doing? Get in.

373
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,570
You won't?

374
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,610
Honey.

375
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,140
Dad.

376
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:31,280
Don't you remember
the day Ji Hyun was born?

377
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:35,320
You bought her a children's book
even before she'd opened her eyes.

378
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,120
What did you say when we got married?

379
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:40,019
You said you'd build
a pretty house I liked.

380
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,860
We went to Mokpo on our honeymoon,

381
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,659
but you promised to take me to Hawaii
every ten years.

382
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,570
- Is this the top?
- What?

383
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,439
My goodness.

384
00:24:57,739 --> 00:24:59,080
Is this where you live?

385
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,509
Yes. It's a shanty town.

386
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,650
It's slippery in the winter.

387
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,790
You could sled down the stairs
on a strip of linoleum.

388
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,650
Some kids really do that.

389
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,120
Right? I'm not the only one
with that idea, am I?

390
00:25:13,489 --> 00:25:14,489
Do you want this?

391
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,070
I'd like you to marry me, Seon Ju.

392
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:31,810
So that you'll be happy
for the rest of your life,

393
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,810
I'll do my best.

394
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:35,780
I too...

395
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,519
will give you my all and love you more.

396
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,659
I said be careful.

397
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,729
- I'm over here!
- Will you stay still?

398
00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:55,999
- I'm over here.
- My goodness.

399
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,800
Pi Seon Ju. You're so fast.

400
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,239
My gosh.

401
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:05,040
You're so cute.

402
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:07,949
We were more than happy with just that.

403
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:11,749
- How's this?
- Didn't the time we shared...

404
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:14,820
mean anything to you?

405
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,330
Why did you make those promises?

406
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:27,469
Why did you give Ji Hyun that book
out of joy and pleasure?

407
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,570
Why did you buy me the nightdress?

408
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:33,400
What? The nightdress?

409
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:50,219
She's a lunatic.

410
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:54,060
You don't see her for what she is
because you're in love.

411
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,959
Let's go home.

412
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,499
Honey.

413
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:05,340
Honey.

414
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:17,050
Jeon Nam Jin!

415
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:26,390
Seon Ju.

416
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,390
I'm sorry.

417
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,699
I'll do my duty as a dad.

418
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,870
I'm...

419
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:36,769
really sorry.

420
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,110
Ji Hyun.

421
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,810
I'll see you next time.

422
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:47,140
Jeon Nam Jin.

423
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,320
I'm sorry too.

424
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,090
To get dirt on you.

425
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,719
This is how I feel right now.

426
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,630
So what?

427
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:09,630
Do you feel better now?

428
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:11,840
Darn it.

429
00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:32,259
The car exploded.

430
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,229
This is insane.

431
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:48,070
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

432
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:04,120
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

433
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:06,320
Her big sister will get divorced soon.

434
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,130
I was serious
when I said we should break up.

435
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:12,929
If it's too hard on you, Mom,
it's okay to give up.

436
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:15,370
Are you leaving on a trip with Tae Ri?

437
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:17,370
It's tasty food. Eat.

438
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,800
Mom.

439
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,999
I'll be back soon.

440
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:21,870
I'm really curious.

441
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,509
What did you like about her?

442
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,780
