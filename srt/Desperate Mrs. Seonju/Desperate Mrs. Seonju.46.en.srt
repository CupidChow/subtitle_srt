00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,740
(Episode 46)

2
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,290
You're now a man with a clean slate.

3
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,819
Yes.

4
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,659
How does it feel to be free of Seon Ju?

5
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:32,499
See,

6
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:36,800
I once trekked over and around Mount Jiri.

7
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,769
After safely completing
the 4-day 3-night trek...

8
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,099
and returning to the hotel,

9
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,070
I showered and had a cold beer.

10
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,040
This reminds me of that.

11
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:50,510
How do you feel?

12
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:51,909
Well,

13
00:00:52,849 --> 00:00:54,120
until now,

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,150
it felt as if Seon Ju and I
were sharing you.

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,159
But now it feels like
you're completely mine.

16
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,190
Pi Seon Ju...

17
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,599
has become a divorcee at last.

18
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,629
Why do you...

19
00:01:10,699 --> 00:01:13,170
dislike her so much?

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,610
She's delusional.

21
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:19,709
She thinks she's better than me
at everything...

22
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:22,379
and that everyone likes her.

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,849
She went to a worse university than me.

24
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:29,819
She blames a stomachache
for ruining her practical exam,

25
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:31,319
but that's her for you.

26
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:33,759
What a lame excuse is that?

27
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:36,659
I'm done with Seon Ju now.

28
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:38,959
Let's forget all that...

29
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,159
and focus on us.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,269
Okay.

31
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,000
We'll be more successful than anyone.

32
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,610
At both work and love.

33
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:53,840
Very good.

34
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:07,489
I think that's enough research for now.

35
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:10,360
Shall we go home?

36
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,000
Gosh. Look at the time.

37
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,099
Shall we go?

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,269
You look tired. Let me drive you.

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,469
I'll park by the playground.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,369
We can split up there.

41
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,640
Okay.

42
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,809
By the way.

43
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,850
You took a half day off.
Did you handle what you had to?

44
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:37,850
Yes. It's over now.

45
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:41,019
You don't have regrets. Are you all right?

46
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:46,100
I have a lot of memories with him.

47
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,100
Happiness. Sadness.

48
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,230
Hope and love.
There was a bit of everything.

49
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
Everything had meaning...

50
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:58,739
whether it was hard
or whether we were lacking.

51
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,410
I still loved it all.

52
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,179
This form.

53
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:06,880
- I lost...
- Take good care of Ji Hyun.

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,480
- a large chunk of my life...
- Bye.

55
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,850
that I'd thought was precious.

56
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:14,390
But I didn't feel as if
my heart was broken.

57
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,730
When I see the torn scars,

58
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,630
I say to myself,
"Yes. That was what I once had."

59
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,369
That's about it.

60
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,769
But that's a part of me,
and I want to send it off.

61
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:32,269
Do you?

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,910
When things first started to fall apart,

63
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,679
I thought my life was crumbling.

64
00:03:39,749 --> 00:03:41,820
But that was just a few pages.

65
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,820
Those were what got torn out.

66
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:46,320
I can fill in...

67
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,230
the remaining pages as pretty as can be.

68
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,260
Yes.

69
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,529
Don't think you were betrayed.

70
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,200
Think you turned a dark corner...

71
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:00,269
and are now at a new starting line.

72
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,939
- Let's go.
- Okay.

73
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Well,

74
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,199
to signify a new day,

75
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:31,829
- how about we run home from here?
- What?

76
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,239
You and I both turned a dark corner...

77
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,009
to stand at a new starting line.

78
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,239
You want to start running
from that new starting line?

79
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,350
The first to arrive goes in first.

80
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,079
The second to arrive
must wait five minutes before going in.

81
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,150
- Deal?
- Deal.

82
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,319
Ready, go!

83
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,989
You can't start first. It's not fair.

84
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,059
Wait up.

85
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:21,150
It must've cost a lot.

86
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,660
What was that? Wasn't it a ring?

87
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,900
Was it from Mr. Jeon?

88
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,239
That darn fool.

89
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,509
Why do you like him?

90
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:47,210
Mom. Watch what you say about him.

91
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:50,710
Why do you keep retaliating
when I'm trying to look out for you?

92
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,650
Do you think your dad
will let you date Mr. Jeon?

93
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,650
What if you really lose your dad's favor?

94
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,520
Who are you to worry about that?

95
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,189
My losing Dad's favor.
Isn't that what you want?

96
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:05,660
- What?
- Why do you...

97
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,960
keep acting like you're my mom?

98
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,059
Do you have a stepmom complex?

99
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,670
You've done enough.

100
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:11,929
Sang Ah.

101
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,900
Hey.

102
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,009
Think of a way
to get Pi Mi Ju away from Woo Sang.

103
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:22,509
Why are you always asking for help?
Can't you solve your own problems?

104
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,980
I want some quiet. Can you both leave?

105
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,550
My gosh.

106
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:34,860
Darn it.

107
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:38,629
Why is she so on edge these days?

108
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,329
She's a whole different person.

109
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:42,929
Is she hitting puberty now?
It's so annoying.

110
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,530
Shoot.

111
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,040
I need her help
if I'm to harass the Pi sisters.

112
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,850
How long are you going to
put up with Mr. Jeon?

113
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,590
Sang Ah asked me to see how she does
on the Hansung deal.

114
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,800
I'll put up with him only until then.

115
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,730
If Sang Ah loses out,
will you accept the decision?

116
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
What else can I do?

117
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,069
She's your daughter.

118
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:24,110
If Sang Ah loses the deal,

119
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,079
she'll lose her standing at work.

120
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,579
Hansung is the client
and the decision is up to them.

121
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:33,249
Do you want me to ask them
to favor my daughter?

122
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:35,749
There must be something you can do.

123
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:39,050
I'm letting her work on the project
when I wanted to suspend her.

124
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,489
That suspension?

125
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:43,489
You meant that? Wasn't it just a threat?

126
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:44,530
How can you say that...

127
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,960
when you saw for yourself
how she has been?

128
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,699
She thinks she rules the place.

129
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,329
If she doesn't grow up soon,
I can do something much worse.

130
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:56,069
If you consider her your real child,
instead of coddling her,

131
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,610
try to help her change her attitude.

132
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:21,559
I sensed something.

133
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,900
Something will happen if I let it.

134
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,300
It can't have happened already, can it?

135
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,869
No.

136
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,710
I must do something.

137
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,040
What do I do?

138
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:01,439
Reporter Heo.

139
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:03,270
I'll get you a scoop soon.

140
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:05,870
I'll be in touch. Be on standby.

141
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,849
- Seon Ju.
- Yes?

142
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:20,819
Have you ended it with Nam Jin completely?

143
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,160
Yes.

144
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,429
Look at him. He's hilarious.

145
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:30,300
I heard he was pretty funny.

146
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:33,599
He is funny.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,469
My goodness.

148
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,809
Either way I look,
I can do nothing but sigh.

149
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,839
I'm sighing every day now.

150
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:43,750
What's the matter now?

151
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,880
Did word get out that this house
shelters abandoned singletons?

152
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,189
Even the stray cats and dogs
I see nearby are female.

153
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,859
My gosh...

154
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,660
Why would you say that? There's Dong Won.

155
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:59,229
Can you tell...

156
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,099
if a cat or dog is female just by looking?

157
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:04,400
I can.

158
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,540
Don't you think this is convenient?

159
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:08,300
If one of us had a husband,

160
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,339
we couldn't live like this.
Don't you agree?

161
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:11,640
I do.

162
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,579
Don't sigh, Mom.

163
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,579
Should I dance, then?

164
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:17,449
- Mom.
- Hi.

165
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,449
Ji Hyun.

166
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:24,750
Don't you follow in our footsteps.

167
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:26,390
What?

168
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,089
Okay.

169
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,359
Isn't that funny?

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,469
Laugh, Mom.

171
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,199
You loved this product for a full year.

172
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:45,109
That's proof of reliance and trust.

173
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:48,209
- Its competitors didn't last.
- That's right.

174
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:52,849
Mother. No, wait.

175
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,120
You're no longer my mother-in-law.

176
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,150
Ms. Wang.

177
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:00,189
I wanted to live in peace and quiet.

178
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,030
I didn't want to
remain in everyone's memory.

179
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,459
All this happened
because of what your son did,

180
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,630
so go and complain to him.

181
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,770
I even got
the CEO's clearance to work here.

182
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,740
I have a job here...

183
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,569
and I'm treated as an equal to your son.

184
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:23,050
Is what she said true?

185
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:31,250
What does this say?

186
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,760
Why is the writing so tiny?

187
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,000
Hey.

188
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:42,329
- You're home?
- Yes.

189
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,069
Nam Jin. Come and sit down.

190
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,069
Take a look at this.

191
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,740
It's Seon Ju's business card.

192
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:54,380
- Is this real?
- My gosh.

193
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:58,910
She bragged to me...

194
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,349
that she got the CEO's clearance.

195
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:02,579
Is that true?

196
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,219
Why did you even go there?

197
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:08,719
She kept following you around,
so I went over there...

198
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,459
to talk her out of bothering you.

199
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:13,099
The divorce was finalized today.

200
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:16,569
Seon Ju and I are strangers now,
so don't see her again.

201
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:19,839
Okay.

202
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,270
Darn it.

203
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,309
This form.

204
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:34,750
Only one of us has to submit it.

205
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,150
I'll do it. I don't trust you.

206
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:40,790
I'll hand it in right now.

207
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,150
I can't remember a thing.

208
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,660
How am I to get revenge?

209
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,160
Cut. Okay.

210
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,329
We're done for the day.

211
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,500
Good job.

212
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,740
- Well done.
- Thanks.

213
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,000
- Thank you.
- Good work.

214
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:35,579
- Good job, director.
- Thanks.

215
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:38,280
You were incredible today.

216
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:40,150
If you have bread,
buy money on the way home.

217
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,390
Woo Sang. Director.

218
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,290
I'll treat you to dinner today.

219
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,859
- You will.
- Food will be unlimited.

220
00:13:51,859 --> 00:13:53,300
Be prepared to stuff yourselves.

221
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:56,469
Did you hear that?
Don't think of going home today.

222
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,780
Traveling with a book under your arm.

223
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,849
The idea...

224
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,650
was broken from the start.

225
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,750
Why read on a trip when you should play?

226
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,420
If you want to read, go to a library!

227
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,459
Why would you travel?

228
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:25,189
You said you liked the idea
when I first came up with...

229
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:26,189
No!

230
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:28,699
You went on and on...

231
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:31,469
about classy entertainment
that moved the soul.

232
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:34,140
I nodded and let you talk.

233
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,709
I knew this program would flop.

234
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,939
It has been on for months
and no one knows about it!

235
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:44,309
People need time to warm to it
because of the subject matter.

236
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:45,550
What?

237
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,920
Are you blaming the viewers
for the low ratings?

238
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,949
- No, I'm not.
- Then whose fault is it?

239
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,420
Is it mine for green-lighting it?

240
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,390
- When did I say...
- It's your fault!

241
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:00,530
They axed the show.

242
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,630
- Take some time off.
- Chief.

243
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,640
Watch what other producers are producing!

244
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,339
We need something sensational
and provocative.

245
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:12,609
Don't you have any crazy ideas?

246
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,479
You don't, do you? You don't.

247
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:18,780
You direct variety shows
when you don't even have ideas.

248
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,780
Get out!

249
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:22,819
Chief.

250
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,890
- Your hair.
- What about it?

251
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,260
- Get it back on straight.
- What?

252
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:34,160
What... What the...

253
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:35,900
Oh, no.

254
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,969
Kim, do you have double-sided tape?

255
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:41,000
- What is it for?
- You know what it's for. You saw.

256
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,870
Did our show get canceled?

257
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,609
Yes. Go in.

258
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,050
Director Jeong.

259
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:53,550
Shall we have a drink later?

260
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,719
No.

261
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,949
Director Jeong.

262
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,290
The ceiling is a bit low
to hang the chandelier.

263
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,459
Right? We can't hang it as is.

264
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:09,829
Still,
that's the most representative piece.

265
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,510
The chairman really wants to show it off.

266
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:21,910
Wouldn't it be nice
if we could merge a few floors?

267
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,079
That would be such a cool sight.

268
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:27,219
It would be.
Like a completely new building.

269
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,620
But we can't do that
because of the total load.

270
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,089
- It was just an idea.
- I know.

271
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,250
The first-floor showroom.

272
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,280
How about merging two or three floors?

273
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,920
That's too big a structural change.

274
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,349
Find a way to do it.

275
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,189
You must be able to
reinforce the pillars or something.

276
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,589
We could take down the existing pillars...

277
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,200
and put up
a completely different structure.

278
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,800
Isn't that too drastic?

279
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,000
Give it a try.

280
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,800
This is a really important project.

281
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:25,440
My dad said he'd accept the result,

282
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,079
so we must win at all costs.

283
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:30,349
Only then can we
get rid of Seon Ju and So Woo...

284
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,109
and make Jin Architecture ours
in the future.

285
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:53,339
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

286
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:03,609
- My gosh.
- Have another one, director.

287
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:05,349
- Yes, sure.
- I'll pour you one.

288
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:06,819
You did great today.

289
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,149
- Let's drink, everyone.
- Cheers.

290
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,589
Are you trying to go slow?

291
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:14,389
- Drink up.
- Thanks.

292
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,859
- My glass is full.
- Okay.

293
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,530
- It's nice and cold.
- Right?

294
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,829
Keep drinking.

295
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,230
My gosh.

296
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,369
Pi Mi Ju?

297
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,839
Yes?

298
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:31,839
Oh, right. You're here as his manager.

299
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:36,139
You're so tenacious.

300
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,250
You're like a leech that never dies.

301
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,180
Who'd have thought
you'd be back as a manager?

302
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,020
I'm a bit determined.

303
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,059
You're a familiar face.

304
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,829
- Have a drink.
- No, I can't.

305
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:54,200
- I have to drive later.
- I see.

306
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,300
Director.

307
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,000
Can you give our star another drink?

308
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,700
- What?
- Can you manage?

309
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:01,940
You can drink, right?

310
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,909
I think he had enough.

311
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,909
Shouldn't we send him home?

312
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:07,309
Look at this.

313
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,079
My gosh. That's cognac.

314
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:11,879
I can't say no to that.

315
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:16,119
- Pour!
- Drink!

316
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:18,790
One for you.

317
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,530
This is great.

318
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,059
You go home.

319
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:27,359
Why? I'm here as a driver and manager.

320
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,859
We'll stay for a while. You go ahead.

321
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,329
I'll take Woo Sang home.

322
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:34,099
What if something else goes missing?

323
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,540
What?

324
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,540
Yes. We'll make sure Woo Sang gets home.

325
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,250
It must be boring sitting there
when you can't drink.

326
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,510
Go home.

327
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,750
Woo Sang. Mr. Jeong?

328
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,020
Woo Sang. Is that cognac?

329
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,460
Let's have some.

330
00:19:57,089 --> 00:19:58,129
Goodness.

331
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,700
I'll head out then, director.

332
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,300
- Yes, go. Leave.
- Bye.

333
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,030
- Take care.
- Bye.

334
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,300
- I'm off.
- Have another drink.

335
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,540
I've had enough.

336
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,079
- Oh, dear.
- Hey.

337
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,440
He must feel ill.

338
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,349
- You didn't drink much.
- Shouldn't he go home?

339
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:19,379
Is he ill?

340
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:20,649
Mr. Jang.

341
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,220
Mr. Jeong is at a team dinner,
and I think he drank too much.

342
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,159
Jin Chu Ah told me to leave
saying she'd get him home.

343
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,960
Is it okay to leave him with her?

344
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:32,260
If that's what she said, go on home.

345
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,530
Okay.

346
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,430
- Oh, dear.
- Don't do that.

347
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,569
- Don't drink anymore.
- That's enough.

348
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:43,000
Excuse me.

349
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:47,839
I don't know.

350
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,309
He's an adult and can fend for himself.

351
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,879
Don't give him any more.

352
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:54,819
- Should we call someone?
- I got off early.

353
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:56,889
Shall I drive part-time for a few hours?

354
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,020
Hey!

355
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,760
They didn't say
I couldn't have a side job.

356
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:04,260
- Chu Ah. Watch that.
- Let's see.

357
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,690
- This?
- Yes.

358
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:11,569
Woo Sang has a team dinner
and will be home late.

359
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,440
Does he? How late will he be?

360
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:15,069
Pretty late?

361
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,669
He can't drink too much.

362
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,510
When can the cast come off?

363
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,809
Are you keeping it on
when you don't need it?

364
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:25,579
No. I'll see the doctor tomorrow.

365
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,319
Oh, dear.

366
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,919
I called you to do some chores
since Mi Ju was out with Woo Sang,

367
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:34,919
but you're no good at all.

368
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,809
You're tired, aren't you?

369
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,520
I'm a bit hungry. Shall we have ramyeon?

370
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:04,490
That sounds good.

371
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,059
Ramyeon is good whenever you have it.

372
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:16,970
But doesn't it taste best
at around midnight?

373
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Nothing beats that taste.

374
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,599
When you finally give in
and boil the water to make some.

375
00:22:23,339 --> 00:22:24,409
Right.

376
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,180
I grew up in an orphanage.

377
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,950
Did you?

378
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,349
Was it around 3 p.m. then?

379
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,319
I was playing with some older boys
in the stream.

380
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,149
They made me ramyeon
cooked in its own plastic packaging.

381
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:42,690
You have no idea how good that was.

382
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,990
Gosh. I'd love to try it.

383
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:46,559
Shall we make it in our yard?

384
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,559
We can pretend we're by a stream.

385
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,230
Sure.

386
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,500
After my first day at work
since I moved in with you,

387
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:59,010
your mother greeted me
from the bench she was sitting on.

388
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:02,210
And your sister the manager
brought a huge plate of fried chicken.

389
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,349
It felt like I was home.

390
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:08,619
There's this formula.

391
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,990
When it was just Tae Ri and I,
we were connected with one line.

392
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:16,990
But the more people there are,
the more lines are formed,

393
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,760
and they grow exponentially.

394
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:21,829
What about it?

395
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,359
It's like...

396
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:27,740
You mean it's nice to have more family?

397
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,970
Yes. It's like that.

398
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:34,680
You phrase it so oddly hard.

399
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,780
To summarize my point,

400
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,849
I'm able to work late
without any concern...

401
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:42,079
because Tae Ri is well looked after.

402
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,089
Rather than saying
your family is intruding...

403
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,919
and that you owe me,

404
00:23:46,589 --> 00:23:48,419
Tae Ri and I joined your family,

405
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,129
and we should be grateful, actually.

406
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,300
I'm grateful that you think so.

407
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,899
Is it because I'm getting old?

408
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:01,700
My nose runs whenever I eat something hot.

409
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,240
Hey.

410
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:08,379
- It's a nosebleed.
- What?

411
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:10,710
- Here.
- My gosh.

412
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,309
Darn it.

413
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:16,280
Let's call it a day and go home.

414
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,020
I'll drop you off by the playground.

415
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:21,260
No. Let's stay a bit longer.

416
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,819
Things might get worse.

417
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,059
Our kids are waiting at home.
Let's work at home if we must.

418
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,000
But...

419
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,270
I think...

420
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:34,770
it's because you had a lot going on
in your personal life,

421
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:37,409
and you worked too hard on top of that.

422
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:42,280
I can bear that because I have my work.

423
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,550
It would've been harder on me
if I had no job.

424
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,480
I really want to do well and win.

425
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:52,550
Let's discuss the project on the way home.

426
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:53,790
- Okay.
- Okay?

427
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:55,760
- Let's go.
- Yes.

428
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,490
Guys. Let's have another round.

429
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,829
- My gosh.
- I want every one of you there.

430
00:25:33,629 --> 00:25:36,059
Woo Sang. Wake up.

431
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,230
You can't wake up?

432
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,470
Excuse me. Can you call us a driver?

433
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:44,740
Sure.

434
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:54,720
Reporter Heo.

435
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,220
It's so cold.

436
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,599
My gosh.

437
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:13,899
Hey.

438
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,300
They're nearby.

439
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:21,809
Do you need a driver?

440
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,210
Marugol?

441
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,379
Where to?

442
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,550
Cloud Hotel?

443
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,389
Yes. I'm right outside.

444
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,059
Okay.

445
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,000
Hello? Where's the driver?

446
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:48,599
I'm over here.

447
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,139
Is the parking lot this way?

448
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:18,730
I'll take you to the Cloud Hotel.

449
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:19,970
Okay.

450
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,490
Ms. Pi. We're here.

451
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:45,190
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

452
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,200
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

453
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:05,369
How do you always come home together?

454
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:07,010
Are you two dating?

455
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,240
Don't be silly.

456
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,780
Do you know who he's married to?

457
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:12,109
Will you wake up?

458
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:13,480
What are you? A pickpocket?

459
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:14,919
It's me, Mi Ju.

460
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,190
You are my birth daughter.

461
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:19,389
Do you think this is fun?

462
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:21,119
Why are you doing this to me?

463
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,059
Because it's the truth.

464
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,260
