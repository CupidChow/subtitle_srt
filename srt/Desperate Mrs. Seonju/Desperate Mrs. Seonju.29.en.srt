(Indian Ocean Law Firm)

4
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,140
What is this?

5
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:12,550
"The deadline to settle out of court
is ten days away."

6
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,250
"This is your final notice."

7
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,060
How dare they?

8
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:24,500
- What's that?
- Hi, Mom.

9
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,769
- Did your customer leave?
- What is that?

10
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:29,399
It's my credit card bill.

11
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,300
It's bigger than I thought.

12
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,140
I was going to call them to complain.

13
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:35,509
Don't use it too much.

14
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:37,310
It's all debt if you think about it.

15
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:40,250
You don't teach anymore.
Leave your credit card with me.

16
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,050
I can't do that.

17
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:43,679
What's this?

18
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:47,950
Corn. The lady from the junction store
gave it to me for the haircut.

19
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,890
Why are they paying you
with sweet potatoes and chicken?

20
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,360
Don't let them from now on.

21
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,489
Seon Ju loves corn on the cob.

22
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:56,929
Steam a few and give them to her.

23
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:59,670
Steam them all. We can freeze the rest.

24
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,330
That must be another customer.

25
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,039
Oh, dear.

26
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:28,890
(Usell Restaurant)

27
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,300
Hi.

28
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,529
They sent a so-called "final notice..."

29
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:10,100
that looks more like a legal reminder.

30
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:14,809
The witch seems to have forgotten
what she's doing to you.

31
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:16,140
Is she a psychopath?

32
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,709
Hey. Let's sue her
for cheating with your husband...

33
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,050
and take her to court.

34
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,480
Jin Ju.

35
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,320
I'm a bit tired today.

36
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,589
I get it. It looks like it'll rain.

37
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,959
Go home and rest.

38
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,230
We're not exactly young ourselves,

39
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,330
so we should warm ourselves
in a toasty bed and relax.

40
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
Yes.

41
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,300
Why do you sound so down?

42
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,040
Seon Ju. They say you must learn...

43
00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:49,339
to dance in the rain...

44
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,010
when you're facing a storm
instead of waiting for it to pass.

45
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,350
Why should I do that?

46
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,050
I guess it means you should
stand and fight instead of giving up.

47
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,860
Because nothing gets better
if you don't do anything.

48
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,230
Let's stay strong, even though it's tough.

49
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:14,029
I'm about to meet with the realtor
and bug him about selling our house.

50
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,889
(Jungang Real Estate Agency)

51
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:41,929
Mister. Why won't our house sell?

52
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,499
Are you trying to sell it or not?

53
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:46,329
Why is no one interested?

54
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,300
Detached houses are hard to sell.

55
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,470
It's like a marriage.
You must find the right buyer.

56
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:55,470
Are you sure
you contacted your realtor network?

57
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,610
Yes.

58
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,710
They're funneling all buyers my way,
so don't worry.

59
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,509
Pi Seon Ju acted like
she had the upper hand,

60
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:32,679
but she gave up first.

61
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:36,650
Did you see the look on her face?

62
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,920
She was hurt, I guess,

63
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,749
so she said a lot of hurtful things.

64
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,259
Did she curse us out or something?

65
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,629
What a joke.

66
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,960
It's your turn now.

67
00:05:51,499 --> 00:05:52,800
Sign the divorce papers.

68
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,710
Mom!

69
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,210
Mom!

70
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:09,520
I'll divorce So Woo
once my promotion is final.

71
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:12,319
It won't take long.

72
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,090
Don't worry.

73
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,550
Let's talk more later.

74
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:21,960
No!

75
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:29,400
Mom!

76
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,809
Mom!

77
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,710
Oh, no.

78
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,550
Oh, dear.

79
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,910
It's a matter of cost,

80
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:11,710
but you can do what the chairman wants
and solve your problems.

81
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,449
On top of that,
if you were to become a local landmark,

82
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,280
it would benefit your brand as well.

83
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,119
Gosh, you came prepared.

84
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,220
Our team leader is a perfectionist.

85

86
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,889
Excuse me.

(Jin Sang Ah)

88
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:35,100
Hi. I'm in a meeting
with a Hansung executive.

89
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:36,540
Are you at the resort?

90
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:41,540
What?

(Emergency Medical Center)

96
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:08,929
What happened?

97
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,100
The child was alone in a car
that rolled into the Han River.

98
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,270
- The Han River?
- We got him out pretty fast,

99
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,340
so he's fine, but he's in shock.

100
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,340
Was the child in the car alone?

101
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:20,610
His mother called for help
from outside the car.

102
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:22,110
Ask her for details.

103
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,489
Didn't you go to Sokcho?

104
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,369
Tae Ri said he preferred a river
to the seaside.

105
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:43,199
How did the car roll down the slope?

106
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,870
Why are you shouting at her?

107
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,609
She took Tae Ri on the trip
despite being as tired as she was.

108
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:50,780
She'd had no time to rest
since she got back from the US.

109
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,479
Why did you force her on a trip?

110
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,179
Yes. Sang Ah is in shock too,
so don't be hard on her.

111
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,280
You should be careful too.

112
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,880
It could've been worse.

113
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,219
You're right. The doctor said...

114
00:09:01,219 --> 00:09:04,160
he could come home
once he woke up from his nap.

115
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,490
Okay.

116
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:09,130
You two stay here and bring him home
when he's well enough.

117
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,599
Yes.

118
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,929
You don't have to both be here.

119
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,969
Come home with us and rest.

120
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,740
Come along.

121
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,140
- Are you Kim Tae Ri's guardian?
- Yes.

122
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:25,979
Will you hear what the doctor has to say?

123
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:27,209
Yes.

(Emergency Medical Center)

125
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,559
I knew he would become a headache.

126
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:41,929
What did I tell you?

127
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,300
It's hard enough to raise your own.
Why would you raise a stranger's kid?

128
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:46,829
I didn't know it would be like this.

129
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,729
Lots of people cancel adoptions.

130
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,300
Did you talk to him
about the boarding school?

131
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,800
Did So Woo object?

132
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,270
Would he cancel the adoption
when he was against the boarding school?

133
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:57,510
A divorce would be a quicker...

134
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:00,250
- Let's go.
- Okay.

(I Lost My Memory but I Want Revenge)

137
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:20,099
Hi, Mom.

138
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:23,170
Why do you never call when you're away?

139
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,770
I haven't moved out. You see me every day.

140
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,270
Why should I call you too?

141
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,709
My friends' kids call
and talk for at least an hour...

142
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:35,709
about what they had
for lunch and then dinner.

143
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:39,949
Why are grown sons so boring?

144
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:44,160
I'm about to get dinner with my manager.

145
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,020
Will that do? Bye.

146
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,459
No, wait.

147
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,000
How is it that...

148
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,270
I don't have anyone
to even eat kalguksu with?

149
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,410
If only...

150
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,510
I had a sweet daughter.

151
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:10,979
That would be nice.

152
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:15,490
Good job today.

153
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,089
Do you do this too?

154
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:24,229
Yes.

155
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:26,800
- Woo Sang!
- My goodness.

156
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,969
You startled me.

157
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:29,839
The lead actress
will treat us to Korean beef. Let's go.

158
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,839
- Who's invited?
- The actors.

159
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,939
It's Korean beef. Let's go.

160
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:35,209
Shall I?

161
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,209
Blackmailer.

162
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,740
What about you? Do you want in?

163
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:41,550
- What?
- No way.

164
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,849
Why should she eat with the major actors?

165
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,079
Right. I don't mind being left out.

166
00:11:46,849 --> 00:11:48,150
Let's go, Woo Sang.

167
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,290
So this place called Jin Architecture...

168
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,130
practically begged Nam Jin
to join their team.

169
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,260
They picked him up from the airport
and spirited him away...

170
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,099
in case he went to another company.

171
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:04,240
He's still just a salaried worker.

172
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:06,670
It's odd how he suddenly got so rich.

173
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,870
- What do you mean?
- He just started there.

174
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,540
How could he afford
a place like this already?

175
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,280
If Nam Jin had married well
in the first place,

176
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,880
he'd have gotten this successful long ago.

177
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:26,790
You're awake.

178
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,530
Where's Mom?

179
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,900
She was here all along,
but she left just now.

180
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:37,640
To see the other guy?

181
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,939
What other guy?

182
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:41,569
The other guy.

183
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:44,179
He's getting divorced.

184
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,150
- What?
- I heard Mom say that...

185
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,150
on the phone.

186
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,219
Will Mom...

187
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,089
go to be with that other man?

188
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,229
What about us, then, Dad? What about us?

189
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,229
Why would you say that?

190
00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:06,359
- You're wrong. Why would Mom...
- No!

191
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,829
What is it, Tae Ri?

192
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,410
Mom told me not to tell you.

193
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,569
When he came to our home,

194
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,809
I saw that man and Mom...

195
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:21,109
kiss each other.

196
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:22,179
What?

197
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:48,740
(Mr. Song)

198
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:53,209
Hello, boss.

199
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,349
- Right now isn't...
- Did you get divorced?

200
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,550
Yes, it looks like it.

201
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,520
You went ahead with it, then.

202
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:02,949
Today...

203
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:05,420
Take the day off.
You can't think about work right now.

204
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,290
I'll keep your spot
until you feel like working again.

205
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,760
Don't worry and rest up.
Call me when you're ready.

206
00:14:12,229 --> 00:14:14,229
Okay. I'm sorry.

207
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,630
Why would you apologize?

208
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,770
Forget about that fool
and improve your life.

209
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,219
You darn scumbag!

210
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,929
You piece of dirt!

211
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:42,990
You are...

212
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:45,530
nothing but a lowlife!

213
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,010
Is he home?

214
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,209
Wait.

215
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:32,910
- Let's talk.
- Not now.

216
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,650
I need time to think first.

217
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,990
Darn him.

218
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:54,000
Wait, miss.

219
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,870
What are you doing out here?

220
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,410
You're not having
any destructive thoughts, are you?

221
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:06,179
I'm not.

222
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,679
Oh, dear.

223
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:17,760
Would you like an umbrella?

224
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:22,229
No, I'm fine.

225
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,800
(Umbrellas for sale)

226
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:23,720
The other guy. He's getting divorced.

227
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:28,609
What are you doing?

228
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,680
What?

229
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,450
You shouldn't do this.

230
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,720
You can't do this, however bad things are.

231
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:41,859
Let's go.

232
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:48,599
Why does everyone think...

233
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,899
I'm about to self-destruct or something?

234
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,210
Someone famous said...

235
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:00,450
when you were facing a storm,
instead of just standing there,

236
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,919
you must learn to dance or do something.

237
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,849
So...

238
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,950
I tried to dance a bit.

239
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:11,990
I see. Was that a dance?

240
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:17,629
I've had a really rough day today.

241
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:20,200
Did you?

242
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,109
I ended things...

243
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:29,540
with my husband.

244
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:33,309
I guess I'd known this would happen.

245
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:38,950
Until now,
my brain wasn't functioning properly,

246
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,050
so subconsciously,

247
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,389
I didn't want to believe
what was happening.

248
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,730
Not long ago, her car and mine
were parked close by,

249
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,869
and there was this situation
where I needed my husband to choose me.

250
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:58,200
In the end, though,

251
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,669
he got into her car.

252
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,339
Leaving our kid and I standing there.

253
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,550
Seeing that...

254
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,079
made me realize he was no longer
my husband or our daughter's dad.

255
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,260
He belonged to the other woman.

256
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,419
So...

257
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,730
I signed the divorce form.

258
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:23,960
Good for you.

259
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,260
I think I did the right thing too.

260
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:30,740
People say getting divorced
is as easy as getting over a cold,

261
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:34,809
so why do I feel so sad and exhausted?

262
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:39,139
Life can turn against you
when you least expect it.

263
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,750
My daughter will be waiting. I should go.

264
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:48,319
Just a moment.

265
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,250
Yes.

266
00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:56,359
How did the trip to the ER go?

267
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:57,859
The kid is fine,

268
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,930
but So Woo is really angry.

269
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:02,000
It's fine if the kid is.

270
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,099
See you tomorrow.

271
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:14,550
Did you interview at that company
knowing your husband...

272
00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:16,579
and his lover worked there?

273
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:20,690
- Yes.
- Then...

274
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,919
does that mean you can handle...

275
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:28,059
seeing them every day?

276
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,460
You bet it does.

277
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:32,230
It won't be hard on just me.
It'll be hard on them too.

278
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,470
I'd dance to work every day if I could...

279
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:37,440
torment them just a little.

280
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,569
Seeing them every day at work...

281
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,010
could be harder than you think.

282
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,240
- Are you sure you'll be okay?
- Yes.

283
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,609
But that will never happen.

284
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,879
They won't hire me.

285
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,690
I really have to go now.

286
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,720
Wait.

287
00:22:56,389 --> 00:22:59,690
Take this umbrella.

288
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,430
What about you, then?

289
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,490
I'll wait until it stops raining.

290
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,559
Thank you.

291
00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:08,470
Thank you.

292
00:23:35,629 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm sorry I picked you up so late.

293
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,899
It's okay.

294
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,800
Your face is red.

295
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,899
Is it?

296
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:48,909
Do you have a fever?

297
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:51,609
No. You know me.

298
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,780
I'm as tough as steel.

299
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,579
I need a shower.

300
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:01,450
Okay.

301
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,930
My head aches.

302
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Oh, dear.

303
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
Goodness...

304
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,609
Did you get your thoughts in order?

305
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:04,250
I'll move out with Tae Ri.

306
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,419
Let's split up.

307
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,359
What happened to Tae Ri was an accident.

308
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:56,270
But I get why you're angry.

309
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,069
I should've watched him.

310
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:01,710
Maybe you were
too distracted with something else.

311
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:07,510
Yes. You'd want to blame me.

312
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,280
But it was an accident
that could've happened to anyone.

313
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,950
Tae Ri heard you on the phone.

314
00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:14,319
You got out of the car to take a call.

315
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,159
Were you so excited
about Jeon's divorce...

316
00:26:19,389 --> 00:26:20,889
that you forgot the side brake?

317
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:23,530
- What?
- When he came over,

318
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,730
did you kiss him up here?

319
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,770
Tae Ri was mistaken that time.

320
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,240
You shouldn't have done that...

321
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,010
in front of our kid, at least not at home.

322
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:38,510
It wasn't like that.

323
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,339
Tae Ri was mistaken.

324
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,609
We kissed?

325
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,919
Do you believe what that kid says?
You know what he's like.

326
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:47,079
Did I cause the accident on purpose?

327
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,020
I was trying, and it happened anyway.

328
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:51,159
I was scared too. I was...

329
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,690
Why don't you even care about me?

330
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,359
You don't care about us.

331
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,829
Why should I care about you?

332
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,869
You and Mother talked about
canceling the adoption.

333
00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:04,069
I see how Tae Ri found out...

334
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,369
he was adopted.

335
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:07,839
Don't jump to conclusions.

336
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,409
I told you not to hurt Tae Ri.

337
00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:11,980
Even if it came to the worst
and we split up,

338
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:15,609
I asked you not to hurt him at least.

339
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,680
It looks like...

340
00:27:18,349 --> 00:27:20,079
he was hurt too much already.

341
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,190
That goes for me too.

342
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,319
I wanted to believe you...

343
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,089
when you said pretending things were fine
could make things fine.

344
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,730
But I keep confirming that's not true.

345
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,099
You got up to no good with Jeon
when Tae Ri was home,

346
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,770
and then you caused this accident,

347
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,109
and you still act so shamelessly.

348
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,980
You're not worth protecting
at the cost of us getting hurt.

349
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:55,589
That's the conclusion I reached.

350
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:21,349
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

351
00:28:35,629 --> 00:28:37,359
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

352
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,700
So Woo wants a divorce.

353
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:41,770
I believe I gave Sang Ah many chances.

354
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:44,339
- Excuse us for intruding.
- What do you think?

355
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,899
You don't like it?

356
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,099
Do you think he'll buy the house?

357
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:49,540
He doesn't seem like a complete pushover.

358
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:51,639
Are you seeing a married man?

359
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,349
They say the affair partner
is right under your nose.

360
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:56,349
Is it Mr. Jeon?

361
