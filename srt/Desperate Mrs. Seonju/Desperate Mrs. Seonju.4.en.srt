1
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:11,570
Okay. You can show them and brag.

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,810
That's fine.

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,310
Dad's back and with us
and that's what's important.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,010
Who cares about anything else?

5
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:19,350
Brag about it all you want.

6
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,920
Good.

7
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,590
Will you get up?

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,000
You said you had plans
and needed to leave with me.

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,969
I want to sleep a bit longer.

10
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:38,000
What?

11
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,770
Madam Oh has a reservation today.

12
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,410
Really?

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,580
Will Woo Sang be there too?

14
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:47,980
Look at you jump right up.

15
00:00:48,139 --> 00:00:49,679
Do you like him that much?

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,819
You didn't even greet your sister
who came back from so far away.

17
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:55,650
You could've joined us for breakfast.

18
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,889
You act as if she saved our country.

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,090
I checked her social media.
All she did was travel and shop.

20
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,889
That's what her degree is for.

21
00:01:02,889 --> 00:01:05,800
She must see and experience a lot
and get a good sense of the world.

22
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,059
Get ready quick.

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,169
- Okay, fine.
- Hurry up.

24
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:22,950
- Hello, Madam Grace.
- Hello, Madam Grace.

25
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:25,680
Good morning.

26
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,919
Get back to work.

27
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:29,290
- Where's Madam Oh?
- She arrived early.

28
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,620
Ms. Kim's with her.

29
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,320
You can go in and finish up for her.

30
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,460
Okay.

31
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,260
(Grace Shim)

32
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,999
Madam.

33
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:46,370
- It has been so long.
- Has it?

34
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:49,169
- I'll finish up.
- Sure.

35
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:50,510
Hello.

36
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,909
Goodness. You're even prettier, Chu Ah.

37
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:55,380
Am I really? Thank you.

38
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,049
You should've called to say
you arrived early.

39
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:00,480
I didn't see the need to make a fuss.

40
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,150
Why haven't you been by?

41
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,290
Are you going somewhere nice today?

42
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,090
I'm just meeting friends.

43
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,059
I want to get my hair done sometimes
to cheer myself up.

44
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,600
But since I left Seoul
to live in a mansion with a garden,

45
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,200
it takes a lot of time and effort
just to come into town.

46
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,500
I see.

47
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,070
Do you like your new home?

48
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:25,010
It's crazy hard to hire decent help.

49
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,109
What is Woo Sang up to?

50
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:29,950
He's busy with a new project.

51
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,720
I know. He's so successful.

52
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,079
I wish he'd help me out.

53
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,549
Can't you put in a good word for me?

54
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,760
Ask him to get me a role
in one of his dramas.

55
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:43,859
Don't say that.
It'll make her uncomfortable.

56
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:46,030
Ask him yourself.

57
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,070
He won't see me.
He rarely takes my calls.

58
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,540
One photo taken at the wrong time
could cause such trouble.

59
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,399
He wouldn't want to see you in private.

60
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:55,839
Wait.

61
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,709
- Isn't Sang Ah back?
- She is.

62
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,209
Then arrange something
for the three of you.

63
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:03,350
I'll do that.

64
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,079
Thanks so much, madam.

65
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:07,720
Not at all.

66
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,359
A master's degree with honors...

67
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:14,919
and you won
an international competition too?

68
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,530
- Yes.
- His professor wanted him to stay,

69
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,200
but he decided to join our firm.

70
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,230
I became successful
not just because I had a competitive edge,

71
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:27,000
but because
I was a good judge of character.

72
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,940
I trust Sang Ah chose well.

73
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,579
Ms. Jin strongly recommended you,
so I have high expectations.

74
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,709
It's all about securing talent.

75
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,220
We should move fast and do just that.

76
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,720
Start immediately.
I hope we all benefit.

77
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,389
Yes, sir. Thank you.

78
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,429
Haven't we...

79
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:51,429
met somewhere before?

80
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:55,000
I can't say.

81
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,929
Why don't you show him around?

82
00:03:58,399 --> 00:03:59,399
I will.

83
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:24,930
You'll work here
until you get your own office.

84
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:26,729
Okay.

85
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,099
Come this way.

86
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,599
This is Team Leader Kim So Woo's office.

87
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,019
This is my office.

88
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,589
Hey.

89
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,260
It's nicer than I thought.

90
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,630
Is it?

91
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:02,969
Shall we go out?

92
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,029
What?

93
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,099
Where to?

94
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,110
Goodbye.

95
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,279
Thank you.

96
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,450
- Goodbye.
- See you soon.

97
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,550
Sure. You're always so elegant.

98
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,450
- You're just...
- Beautiful.

99
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:25,149
Sit down.

100
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,529
- I'll get Woo Sang to meet up with us.
- Yes.

101
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
Then I'll ask Sang Ah to leave first.

102
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,930
Won't that make it a date?

103
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,800
That kind of trickery
needs to be pulled off perfectly.

104
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,639
- What are you doing today?
- A scene for a web drama.

105
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,639
Really?

106
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,039
Then let's go with a natural look
that doesn't show too much.

107
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,550
What will you wear?

108
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:50,750
It should arrive soon.

109
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,680
Can't I borrow Sang Ah's car?

110
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,550
You can't. She treasures it so much.

111
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,450
It's bad for the car
if you don't drive it at all.

112
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,360
We let the engine run every now and then,

113
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,430
and it's well-maintained, so don't worry.

114
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,289
Letting the engine run
is different from actually driving it.

115
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:06,459
What?

116
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:08,229
Yes?

117
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,370
Hello, Ms. Jin.

118
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,839
What are you doing here?

119
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,779
The manager is styling Ha Dong Soo
for his new movie.

120
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:24,450
She asked me to dress you
for just a while.

121
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,950
Who is she?

122
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,120
The lowest of the low.
The rookie stylist.

123
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:30,519
I am the lowest rookie,

124
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,920
but I sent all the outfit photos
to the manager who okayed them for me.

125
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,789
Let's have a look, then.

126
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,959
Okay.

127
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,070
No.

128
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,539
No.

129
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,670
It's dreadful. It's so not pretty.

130
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,769
Don't you study
what top stars wear and carry?

131
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,940
You should.

132
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,649
They have so many labels
willing to clothe them.

133
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,120
Are you saying it's my fault
that not many labels want to clothe me?

134
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,420
No, that's not what I'm saying.

135
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,120
I was up all night last night
in Namdaemun, Dongdaemun,

136
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,360
Hongdae, and even Gangnam.
I checked every corner...

137
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,229
- to find items...
- No, wait.

138
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:13,700
This is so annoying.

139
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,599
Manager, who's this fill-in?

140
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,610
She got my clothes from some night market.

141
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,440
Sorry, Chu Ah, but it's Ha Dong Soo
we're talking about.

142
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,579
I heard your shoot
was pushed to this evening.

143
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:32,719
Darn it.

144
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,279
Okay, fine.

145
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,420
- Get something else later.
- What?

146
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:42,190
- A bit later...
- Get something else.

147
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:45,789
Do a better job this time.
I'll see how you do.

148
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:47,729
Okay. Got it.

149
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,450
Excuse me.

150
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,979
Goodness.

151
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:10,719
What?

152
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:14,459
I was too embarrassed
to mention it around Ji Hyun,

153
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:16,289
but he shouldn't have called it a gift.

154
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,889
Who gifts a hotel bathroom set?

155
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:21,029
- Mom.
- What?

156
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,670
Look.

157
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,269
Why did you prepare so much food?

158
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:26,570
Did he get you something?

159
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,769
Yes. He'd bought me something.

160
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:29,870
What?

161
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,709
Something you don't need to know about.

162
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,539
As if he got you something.

163
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:36,849
Did he give you
a pair of slippers from the plane?

164
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,909
- Mom.
- A man who loves his wife...

165
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,649
will bow to his in-laws' septic tank.

166
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:42,749
That's gross. Who does that?

167
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,849
He'd make time to visit
if he cared about us.

168
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,660
Yesterday the foal missed his flight.

169
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,989
And today he backed up for an interview?

170
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,459
Mom. The word is "fool."

171
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,200
And he backed "out," not "up."

172
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,129
- Be quiet!
- It's a job interview.

173
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:00,369
That's a really important deal.

174
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:02,910
Do interviews last all day long?
Into the night?

175
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,239
Can't be drop by for a while afterward?

176
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:08,410
He came back
with a master's degree from abroad.

177
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:11,450
Shouldn't you be pleased
he didn't abandon his wife?

178
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,550
What human being would abandon his wife?

179
00:09:14,849 --> 00:09:17,320
This looks so good. Open up.

180
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,920
- Is it good?
- Don't stuff it in like that. It's hot.

181
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,829
The three of us can host
a welcome party without him.

182
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:28,030
Does the guest of honor need to attend?

183
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,900
That's just a bias.

184
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:32,400
That's not right, though.

185
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:36,310
I cooked it,
but I must say the short ribs are good.

186
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,070
Anyway, be sure
to bring him over this weekend.

187
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,180
Okay.

188
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,650
Kids, come and eat.

189
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,550
Okay.

190
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,619
See you later.

191
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,719
Where did she put it?

192
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:01,729
Who wears this kind of stuff?

193
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,709
Yes, I found it!

194
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:22,890
Darn it.

195
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,560
I should get a ratty car or something.

196
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:28,619
I need to go back out later.

197
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:31,790
This is madness.

198
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,170
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.

199
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,300
Seon Ju.

200
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:45,839
Did you drive here?

201
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:49,479
- Yes.
- Can I borrow it later?

202
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:53,920
Your one and only younger sister
might die in the middle of a street.

203
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,119
Goodness...

204
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,489
Be sure to treat it well.

205
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,229
It's banged up already.

206
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,200
Don't.

207
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,629
Yes, sir. I'll treat it well.

208
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,209
My gosh. Short ribs?

209
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,579
I could smell it since yesterday.

210
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,479
I get to eat it at last.

211
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,719
Where's Nam Jin?

212
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,619
Isn't this a welcome lunch?

213
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,290
Today...

214
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:35,089
is a pre-welcome party.

215
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,690
We're doing a rehearsal
for the actual welcome party?

216
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:41,859
Why is Mom so down?

217
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,829
She cooked so much,
but Uncle couldn't come.

218
00:11:45,099 --> 00:11:46,369
Oh, dear.

219
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:48,570
Is that why it's like someone died?

220
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,670
If you can't stand it,
liven things up for us.

221
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,739
Shall I?

222
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,680
I know exactly what to do
to cheer up Ms. Han Man Eun.

223
00:11:57,979 --> 00:12:00,849
I know what to do as well.

224
00:12:00,849 --> 00:12:03,450
Let's liven up the party.

225
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:04,950
Look at us.

226
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,859
- Mom. Cheer up.
- My gosh.

227
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:44,089
I thought we should have a hangout
close to the office.

228
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:46,599
I bought the place
in case I needed somewhere to unwind.

229
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:47,999
I see.

230
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,999
- What?
- You, me, and Woo Sang.

231
00:12:54,999 --> 00:12:56,270
We're eating out.

232
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,640
No. Just know that was the plan.

233
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,310
What do you mean?

234
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,950
We had plans,
but you were too busy to come, okay?

235
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,089
That was my sister.

236
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,989
What's your wife like?

237
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,430
Why do you ask?

238
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,530
I suddenly want to know.
I'd never asked about her.

239
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,999
She's pretty ordinary.

240
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,499
The dock is fraught with farewells

241
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:34,239
Did we hold hands tight with regret?

242
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:38,950
The sea is our excuse for parting ways

243
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,420
But a man is a ship, a woman a harbor

244
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,359
The person who leaves
does so without a word

245
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:52,930
What could a man
possibly say as he leaves?

246
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:59,599
Please don't sound the foghorn

247
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:04,839
The woman spends each day
looking out at sea

248
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:09,509
And turns away dejectedly
with tears flowing

249
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:11,910
All men

250
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,950
They are the same

251
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,320
They shed tears as they part

252
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,160
But forget as soon as they turn away

253
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,790
Men are all the same

254
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,030
Ta-da!

255
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,530
Come on.

256
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,469
Applause!

257
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,239
You're awesome.

258
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,879
I saw the video she sent.
She's not ordinary at all.

259
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,349
What does she do?

260
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,579
She does interior.

261
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:46,719
Interior design?

262
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,719
We do the same thing.

263
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,550
Your silk slip nightdress.

264
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,520
It was in my suitcase.

265
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
Was it really?

266
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,530
She kept asking what it was.

267
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,160
I had the worst shock ever.

268
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,999
Did you put it there on purpose?

269
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:07,770
Did I leave it in there
so you'd think of me sometimes?

270
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,239
Don't do things like that.

271
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,040
I really don't like it.

272
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:16,849
You're really sexy
when you get all gruff and serious.

273
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:18,050
What?

274
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,050
- Sexy?
- Yes.

275
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:22,020
How sexy?

276
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:26,190
Am I really that sexy?

277
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,489
I need to be gruff and serious.
Gruff, serious.

278
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:32,999
Fill me up with your love

279
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,170
My battery of love must have gone flat

280
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,540
I can't live without you
I really can't do without you

281
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,839
You are my battery

282
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:49,579
You're my only love
There can be no one else

283
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,650
You are the best

284
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,680
- Mom's the best!
- Mom's the best!

285
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,520
You are the best

286
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,729
Your grandma is who?

287
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,829
- Manjang-dong Shim Su Bong!
- Manjang-dong Shim Su Bong!

288
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,060
That's right.

289
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,030
She was too busy perming hair to debut.

290
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,270
You grumble,
but you must be so pleased...

291
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,800
that Nam Jin came back with a master's.

292
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:19,440
Mom. If the neighbors say
this is Widow Plaza again,

293
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,440
then get Nam Jin
to walk the neighborhood with you.

294
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:25,450
Yes, you brat.
I'll walk the block ten times.

295
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,589
What's your husband like?

296
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,690
- He seemed quite gentle.
- Him?

297
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:40,300
He was naive,
but I think he's becoming more awkward.

298
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:45,099
He's the type who'd do well
in a one-man studio.

299
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,739
Why did you marry him?

300
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:49,369
Dad liked him.

301
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,709
I thought life would be great
if I married the guy Dad liked.

302
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:58,079
What did your father like about him?

303
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,420
Exactly. The older I get,
the more I don't get it.

304
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,459
What did you think of the guy?

305
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,890
He seemed pretty talented.

306
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,400
Ms. Jin rarely recommends staff,
but she was insistent this time.

307
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,330
Doesn't that mean he's verified?

308
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,670
Put him on your team for the new project.

309
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,309
- Okay.
- Good luck with the new guy.

310
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,610
Thanks.

311
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,090
Jeon Nam Jin,
Jin Architecture's new guy.

312
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:38,420
Do your best for us.

313
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,920
I will, Team Leader Jin.

314
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:49,700
Dad said he'd trust my judgment,
so don't let us down.

315
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:56,870
Hi.

316
00:17:57,469 --> 00:17:58,509
Where are you?

317
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,539
I'm outside taking care of something. Why?

318
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:04,610
If you're free,
shall we eat out with Tae Ri?

319
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,719
I have dinner plans. Sorry.

320
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:08,880
Do you?

321
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:11,920
That's too bad. Bye.

322
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,360
He wanted to have dinner.
I said I had plans.

323
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,170
Hey. Do you want to stay here?

324
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:28,400
We can meet up whenever.
You should move in.

325
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,670
What if someone were to notice?

326
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,380
We can be careful.

327
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,509
It's much closer to the office
than your place.

328
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,610
Why don't you bring a small suitcase?

329
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,690
I can't tell my wife I'll move out
when I just got back.

330
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,850
Blame it on your job.

331
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,390
What can she say if you say
you need time to settle in?

332
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,700
There weren't that many people inside.

333
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:00,870
Can't we sit in the cafe?

334
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,569
No way.

335
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:04,069
What if someone were
to photograph us together?

336
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:07,110
I'd love it if a photo of us
were to get out.

337
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,779
I'll say this again.

338
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:12,410
You're a family acquaintance.
We can never date.

339
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,350
You never know what will happen.

340
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:17,319
You shouldn't say "never."

341
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,450
Don't you have any work?

342
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,019
I do. My stylist will be here soon.

343
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:29,360
You have reached your destination.

344
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,069
You went off-route.

345
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:35,069
You said I reached my destination.

346
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:36,640
Redirecting.

347
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,769
What the heck?

348
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,610
Where is she that my GPS can't find her?

349
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:45,749
I'm so sleepy.

350
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,459
What?

351
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,489
I can't let anyone see me.

352
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,360
Where's Sang Ah?

353
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,370
I guess her work is
keeping her back.

354
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:05,170
Are you sure she wanted to see me?

355
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,769
I'm sure. She's just running late.

356
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,739
She even lent me her car.

357
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:13,539
We can't stay here.
Let's park somewhere else.

358
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:15,309
The car stands out too much.

359
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:17,180
They can't see us
through the tinted windows.

360
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,009
They can see through the front.
Let's get out of here.

361
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,249
I told my stylist to meet me here.

362
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,749
You went off-route.

363
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,670
Your destination is up ahead.

364
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,600
Oh, that must be the place.

365
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,709
I circled the block for nothing.

366
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,840
Stay awake.

367
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,729
Isn't that your stylist's car?

368
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,999
It's not. She doesn't even have
a ratty car like that.

369
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:15,299
And it's not yet time.

370
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,340
Don't.

371
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,709
Is she not here yet?

372
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,319
Let's park somewhere else.

373
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,289
Tell her to meet us there.

374
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:38,259
Let's stay just a bit longer.

375
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:40,100
I don't want to.

376
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,559
- Put the car in reverse.
- Okay.

377
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,900
Let's get out of here.

378
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,130
Be quick.

379
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,299
Okay, fine.

380
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:16,830
Darn it.

381
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:27,809
Hey.

382
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:30,180
Will you lower the window?

383
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,910
- Hello?
- Hey. It's my stylist.

384
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:34,150
Lower the window.

385
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,180
Darn it.

386
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,150
- Hey.
- Woo Sang.

387
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,920
- Don't look at me.
- What do I do?

388
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,519
You drove into her car
while trying to reverse.

389
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,319
- I did?
- Yes.

390
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,630
You drove into a parked car,
so this is on you.

391
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,160
Shoot. This is so darn annoying.

392
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Goodness.

393
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,920
Sorry. I think I should vanish quietly.

394
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,019
- Call the insurance provider.
- Stay with me.

395
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,330
Things will get crazy
if I say I was with you.

396
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,130
You posted our selfie online
"by mistake" and caused a fuss before.

397
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,430
Yes, right.

398
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,940
I'll take the memory card
to preserve my privacy.

399
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,739
I wasn't in this car.

400
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:36,539
- Woo Sang.
- Bye.

401
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:39,309
A million dollars?

402
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,819
What car costs more than our house?

403
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,590
Hey.

404
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,299
Excuse me.

405
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,039
Go home and pack your stuff right away.

406
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,950
What?

407
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,420
What? An accident?

408
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,390
Did you take my car?

409
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,249
You crazy...

410
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,719
Who's at fault? Is it you or them?

411
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:23,830
Well...

412
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,890
I need you to get over here.

413
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,700
Stay right where you are.

414
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
Darn it.

415
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,769
- What?
- Seon Ju.

416
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,239
It's me.

417
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:43,080
Is your car insured?

418
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,549
It is. Why?

419
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:47,319
Well... There was an accident.

420
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,920
What? An accident.

421
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,890
There was a fender-bender.

422
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,059
Who drove into whom? You or them?

423
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,259
I don't know.

424
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,029
Was I trying to reverse?

425
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,299
I was a bit distracted.

426
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:05,900
What's the other car?

427
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,039
Don't be too shocked.

428
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,640
I don't know exactly,

429
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,539
but it costs about a million dollars.

430
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,309
Just you wait.

431
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,410
I need to go out.

432
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,209
Why? Was Mi Ju in an accident?

433
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:23,890
What happened?

434
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:27,459
Where is she going?

435
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:29,860
What? I don't know.

436
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:34,529
I guess she must've been called
to take care of something.

437
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,989
I'm sorry.

438
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,620
I don't know exactly what happened.

439
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:10,330
Ms. Jin.

440
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,630
Yes, it's me.

441
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,799
- What will you do?
- What?

442
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:19,739
Oh, a dashcam...

443
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:22,380
You have one. Let's check the video.

444
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,049
I'm pretty sure I parked.

445
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,680
No, you drove into me.

446
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:27,180
You reversed.

447
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,049
Let's watch the video
and figure out how I did that.

448
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:32,850
It doesn't work. It's broken.

449
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,459
What will you do?

450
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,559
This car is one
of only four of its kind in Korea.

451
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,860
Do you know how much it's worth?

452
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:44,170
- A million dollars.
- Right. Now what?

453
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,989
Say something. What will you do?

454
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,930
I'm sorry.

455
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,130
Hey!

456
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,759
Darn you.

457
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:23,499
What happened?

458
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:24,739
Are you the car owner?

459
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:29,779
There's the owner of this car.

460
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:30,809
What?

461
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,549
Darn you.

462
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,289
Pi Seon Ju?

463
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:46,590
Sang Ah?

464
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,229
Jin Sang Ah?

465
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,569
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

466
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,620
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

467
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,219
What did you do?

468
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:17,660
So this is how we meet again.

469
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,660
You went to school together?
Were you close?

470
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,660
I doubt it.

471
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,499
The repair will cost 55,000 dollars.

472
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:23,999
Fifty-five grand?

473
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:26,600
Do you have any extra cash?

474
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,640
What?

475
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,299
What happens
if we run off without paying?

476
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:33,509
I happened to record you two talk.

477
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:36,209
Do you even have a brain?
What's wrong with you?

478
00:28:37,979 --> 00:28:39,979
