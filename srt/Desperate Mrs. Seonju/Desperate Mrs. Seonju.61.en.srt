1
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,860
(Episode 61)

2
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:15,500
This is the room...

3
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,330
I share with my mom and big sister Jin Ju.

4
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,130
I see.

5
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,510
No, it's okay. You can sit.

6
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,910
We're still setting the table.

7
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,350
Make yourself at home.

8
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,780
We're tenants,
so this isn't exactly our house.

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,820
Mom. You don't have to share
too much information.

10
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:47,329
Why not? You're going to get married,
so we should be open.

11
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:51,929
Right. Your marriage isn't wholly honest.

12
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:53,700
- Mom.
- Okay.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,929
Come on out.

14
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:57,640
Let's join the others outside.

15
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,909
Come along.

16
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,290
- Hi.
- Woo Sang. Where are you?

17
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,189
Me? I'm away from home
taking care of something.

18
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,530
Let's meet up.

19
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,260
I'll come to where you are.

20
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,299
What?

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,469
Come on out. My family is waiting.

22
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,799
Okay.

23
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:33,939
See you another time.

24
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,879
"My family is waiting?"

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,620
Is he meeting Pi Mi Ju's family?

26
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:00,430
I thought we spoiled
my overseas-educated brother-in-law.

27
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:02,700
It looks like my star brother-in-law
is getting fed even better.

28
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,469
This is an actual banquet.

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,340
Take a seat.

30
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,609
Yes. Take off your coat and sit.

31
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,209
No way. It's actually Jeong Woo Sang.

32
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,409
Is it weird?

33
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:15,079
You know you can't tell anyone, right?

34
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,819
Is everyone here?

35
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,289
Then I'll introduce
the people you haven't met yet.

36
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:21,590
This is my eldest sister's son Dong Won.

37
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,990
Ji Hyun is my other sister's daughter.

38
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,789
Hi, kids.

40
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,900
And this is Jeong Woo Sang who, for you,

41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,729
will go from Korea's stop star
to third uncle.

42
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:34,800
Applause.

43
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,870
What a joke.

44
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:44,310
The short ribs came out nicely. Try it.

45
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,750
You're so tall and handsome.

46
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,349
You look reliable too.

47
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,520
Are you perfectly healthy?

48
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,949
- What?
- Mom.

49
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:57,289
Look at these muscles.
They're so firm. He's healthy and well.

50
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,629
Don't worry about a thing.

51
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:03,500
We can't introduce our family as is
before the wedding.

52
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,030
Isn't that wrong?

53
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,129
- I apologize.
- Jin Ju.

54
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,900
Drop it.

55
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,169
So, what did you see in Mi Ju
that you liked?

56
00:03:14,509 --> 00:03:15,740
Well,

57
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,180
she's pretty, sweet, and pretty too?

58
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:23,479
Hey.

59
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,319
Are you the one in pink?

60
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:30,189
You were really pretty as a baby too.

61
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,759
I was. I was pretty
from the moment I was born.

62
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,460
I probably will be forever.

63
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:37,199
Me too.

64
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,099
We found something we have in common.

65
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,900
We did.

66
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:48,710
Are there any more photos
of Mi Ju as a child?

67
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:52,349
What? Photos of her as a child...

68
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,509
Oh, there was a flash flood.

69
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:58,550
We lost the childhood photos.
Not just Mi Ju's but her sisters' too.

70
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,289
But stories of their childhoods
are up here...

71
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:04,020
in my head.

72
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,129
Tell me some of them.

73
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,699
Mi Ju got into trouble a few times
when she got older,

74
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,669
but as a child, she was so docile.

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
She didn't whine at all.

76
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,639
You know the apple core...

77
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,810
where the seeds are, don't you?

78
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,979
If I gave her that,
she'd suck and gnaw on it all day long.

79
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:26,980
She played with it without making a fuss.

80
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:30,949
I see. So she loved her food
since she was a baby.

81
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,389
That's right.

82
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,790
She even ate sundae, the blood sausage,
before she could even walk.

83
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,490
- My gosh.
- Really? I never heard that.

84
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,629
Why didn't you tell me so before?

85
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,660
You ate braised pig feet
when you were one.

86
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:47,399
I remember that.

87
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:49,939
We'd give you tiny pieces from the bone,

88
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:51,569
and even though you had no teeth,

89
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,410
you chewed and swallowed.

90
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,870
That's right.

91
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,839
I was a gifted eater.

92
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,110
My gosh.

93
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,649
Thanks for preparing dinner.

94
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:02,720
Who would come at this hour?

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,350
Have dinner and chat a bit more.

96
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Okay?

97
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,519
Who is being such a nuisance?

98
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,399
Dad, this is for you.

99
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,800
What?

100
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:27,110
Dad. What's a notice of new court date?

101
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,110
(Notice of New Court Date)

102
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,680
Oh, that?

103
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:37,050
You know Mom and Dad
are breaking up, right?

104
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,250
Adults have to go through
a process to break up.

105
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,459
Part of it is...

106
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:48,129
to go before a judge
and say we're breaking up.

107
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,699
This says we'll do that on a new date.

108
00:05:50,829 --> 00:05:55,199
If you do that, will you and Mom
be broken up forever?

109
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,439
Yes.

110
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,339
Does that upset you?

111
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,209
I have you, so it's okay.

112
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Okay.

113
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,509
Here you go.

114
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,180
Me too.

115
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,120
Okay, so...

116
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:15,860
your mother is actress Oh Hye Ran.
Do you have other family members?

117
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:17,560
I have an older brother.

118
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,790
What does he do?

119
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,230
He directs TV shows.

120
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:23,399
Hey. I know someone who directs TV shows.

121
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:27,000
Your guy friend?
The one who'll pretend to be your husband?

122
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,170
Is he good-looking?

123
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,800
You dared to ask me
to bring a fake husband,

124
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,339
and he has to be good-looking too?

125
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,170
Not really.

126
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,839
I might skip the wedding altogether.

127
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,550
I thought Mi Ju was the prettiest sister,

128
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,949
but her looks are nothing
compared to yours.

129
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:45,819
That's true.

130
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,290
Especially the middle sister.

131
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,889
You look much nicer in real life.

132
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,459
"In real life?"

133
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:54,629
I saw a few clips of you.

134
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,930
From the hair salon...

135
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,769
and from when you saved a guy
from a falling rock.

136
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:02,540
How did you see that?

137
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,470
I bragged that you were in the news.

138
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,209
Why would you
brag about something like that?

139
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:10,339
When we were getting to know each other,
he asked if I had anything to brag about.

140
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:11,939
You were on the public TV channel.

141
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,079
Darn you.

142
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,449
What?

143
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,149
I got something for Dong Won and Ji Hyun.

144
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,990
You did?

145
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,129
My gosh. This is a really expensive brand.

146
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,829
Is this for me?

147
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:31,660
Why did you buy something so expensive?

148
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,730
I felt bad for asking you two
to put on a show for us.

149
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,500
I'm not participating in...

150
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,040
Seon Ju. Woo Sang is so very grateful.

151
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,610
He'll treat you both so well.

152
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,509
Mom. This is so pretty.

153
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:49,110
If that's why you bought these,
then we deserve to accept them.

154
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,990
I have nothing but honesty and conscience,

155
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,089
and I went against that to help you.

156
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:56,519
Point taken.

157
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,560
We started off by telling a lie.

158
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:02,629
If we were to come clean now,

159
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,959
my mom would be disappointed,

160
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,199
and Mi Ju would have a hard time.
I'm so sorry to ask this of you.

161
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,839
If the wedding concludes well,
it'll be because I helped,

162
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,300
so make it up to me.

163
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:13,810
- Okay.
- Okay.

164
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,649
- Have more fruit.
- That's so cool.

165
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:23,620
What do you think?

166
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:30,319
Let's call it a day. My brain is stuck.

167
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,959
We can't. We have to iron out the details.

168
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,029
Let's eat something and come back to it.

169
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:39,670
A jjamppong place opened nearby.
Shall we eat there?

170
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,399
No. I'll get some more ideas from my muse.

171
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,169
Your muse? Who's that?

172
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:51,240
Do you have a shadow writer
working for you?

173
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,279
No.

174
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,909
See you.

175
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:05,159
Where were you all this while?

176
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,990
Chu Ah knows.

177
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,990
Knows what?

178
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:10,330
That you're marrying Mi Ju.

179
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,870
Didn't she call you?

180
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:14,470
So that was why she called.

181
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,070
What if she does something?

182
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,740
I'm scared.

183
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,870
What would she do at my wedding?
It'll be fine.

184
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,309
Don't you know what she's like?

185
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,580
She's capable of posting about it online.

186
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,480
Where did you go today?

187
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,850
I visited Mi Ju's family.

188
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,220
I should meet them at least once
before the wedding.

189
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,820
I can't go into the wedding hall and ask,
"Are you my mother-in-law?"

190
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,830
They packed some food for you.

191
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,759
They didn't have to.

192
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,899
I'm home.

193
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,470
- Hello.
- Hi.

194
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,399
What's this?

195
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,100
Hey, it's fried shrimp.

196
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,009
How are the preparations going?

197
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,809
There's not much to prepare, actually.

198
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,309
Did her family complain
your older brother was divorced?

199
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:05,379
Should I find a fake wife
to sit beside me?

200
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,720
Why would you...

201
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,090
No, that's fraud.
Why would you even think of doing that?

202
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,889
Is getting married a thing these days?

203
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:13,590
I know of a few already.

204
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,669
What was it like to meet Woo Sang?

205
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:22,269
Now that I've seen him in person,

206
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:24,870
he seems to be a decent guy.

207
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,570
- You think so?
- Why do you ask...

208
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,909
when you can't even say
you're marrying him?

209
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,710
I call him by his name when we're alone.

210
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,549
You're grinning from ear to ear.

211
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,350
Wait until you're actually married.

212
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,120
Seon Ju.

213
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:45,190
You'll find a guy to sit with you, right?

214
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,230
I told you that...

215
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:51,929
I didn't have any guy friends to ask.

216
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,470
You're backing out
when he got Ji Hyun a padded jacket?

217
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,940
Hey. Keep in mind
that I'm doing you a great favor...

218
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,269
by sitting there in silence
when I could...

219
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:02,340
go around yelling
that the wedding was a sham.

220
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,779
Okay?

221
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,509
One more thing.

222
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:10,419
Here. Take this.

223
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,350
It wouldn't be right
to accept such an expensive gift...

224
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,960
and not give anything back.

225
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,990
What's this?

226
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:23,230
Isn't this what you got Mom recently?

227
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,500
She takes it every day.

228
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,500
Mom liked it a lot.

229
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,370
I bought a few more when she asked me...

230
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,269
to get some for her friends
with sore knees.

231
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,110
Tell Woo Sang to give it to his mother.

232
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:36,409
Thanks, Seon Ju.

233
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:39,309
She'll love it. She's been feeling achy.

234
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,379
(Jin Architecture)

235
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,860
I was quite impressed that day.

236
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,029
- About what?
- You can't drink,

237
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:58,700
and yet you drank Seon Ju's beer.

238
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,769
I see it only now that we're splitting up.

239
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,769
You don't know me at all.

240
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,470
I can drink.

241
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,070
You see it only now
that we're splitting up?

242
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,950
I'm not playing games with you,
but we're still married.

243
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,750
We're a legal couple.

244
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:18,980
Did you get the notice from the court?
We got a new date.

245
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,419
Be sure to show up.

246
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:24,460
What's going on between you and Seon Ju?

247
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,120
What is she to you
that you're so bothered?

248
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,429
I don't know. I wonder too.

249
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,159
Why, whenever I see Ms. Pi,

250
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,129
do I want to stop and help her?

251
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,299
Maybe I want to shield her...

252
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:41,409
from your blatant and childish attacks.

253
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:44,409
Are you saying it's because of me?

254
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,039
Because you care what I think?

255
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,480
Then there's nothing
between you and Seon Ju.

256
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,379
Even if it's because I'm wary of you,

257
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:55,250
the feelings of wanting to
help and shield someone.

258
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:57,190
Can you say that's nothing?

259
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,159
Ms. Pi gives out
the warmth of a human being.

260
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:02,389
What?

261
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:05,600
Are you saying
you'll do something with her?

262
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,769
Why are you complaining about that now?

263
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,070
I'd really like to know.

264
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,370
I never imagined
you wouldn't show up in court.

265
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,970
What do you actually want?

266
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,809
Do you not want us to get divorced?

267
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,750
As if that's what I want.

268
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,350
Why would you...

269
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,820
not come to court if you wanted a divorce?

270
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,720
You're always like that.

271
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,929
Are you wary of Seon Ju and what she does?

272
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,590
Why would I care about her?

273
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:37,899
I almost feel sorry for you.

274
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,500
Weren't you a shrewd and cunning person?

275
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,100
Maybe I was mistaken.

276
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,230
Let's have a look.

277
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,000
My son got promoted,
so what do the cards say?

278
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,769
What's this?

279
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,509
An October maple leaf card?
That means worry and strife.

280
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,350
Will Sang Ah refuse to divorce
and string Nam Jin along?

281
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,980
Darn it.

282
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,850
He said he'd put
this apartment in his name...

283
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:37,320
if I go see Sang Ah, so I can't.
That's frustrating.

284
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,799
You said you knew a good fortune teller.
Give me their number.

285
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,970
Hello.

286
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,019
What do they say?

287
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,889
That's why your daughter-in-law left.

288
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:17,600
My daughter-in-law didn't leave.
My son left her.

289
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,799
She left him.

290
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,269
You're wrong.

291
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,740
My son begged his wife
to give him a divorce,

292
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,799
but his mistress isn't divorced yet.

293
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,870
I want to ask if she will be soon.

294
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,909
I thought her husband
was refusing to divorce her,

295
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,409
but he denied
that he was dragging things out.

296
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:35,809
Don't you see what's going on?

297
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:39,580
No. Your daughter-in-law left.

298
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:41,990
This fortune teller is useless.

299
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:45,559
Whatever. What should I do?

300
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:49,059
Steal your son's ex-wife's underwear...

301
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,899
- and put it where your son puts his.
- What for?

302
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:54,370
That will help release
his ex's grudge and set him free.

303
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,899
Once you do that can your son
get remarried or whatever.

304
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,070
If you don't do that,
everything will stay stuck.

305
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,080
He can't go back or move forward.

306
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,740
That's almost a curse.

307
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,750
How can I steal
my ex-daughter-in-law's underwear?

308
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:10,279
I was told you were good,
but you talk nonsense.

309
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,120
Why would you make me steal? Darn it.

310
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,190
The older the underwear, the better.

311
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,059
That's disgusting.

312
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,429
Chu Ah.

313
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Chu Ah.

314
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,639
What's with the red lips and suit?

315
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,139
Are you off to bully someone?

316
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,409
This isn't a good look.

317
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:40,750
It's not that.
I must do something important.

318
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,250
Bye.

319
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,379
What on earth...

320
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:47,220
The girls are taking turns to...

321
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,330
Could you come over...

322
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,899
and sit with Seon Ju and pretend
to be her husband for a short while?

323
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,470
My gosh.

324
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,470
What's so funny?

325
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,379
It's nothing.

326
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:12,139
What's up?

327
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:16,210
At our team dinner.
They looked really annoyed, didn't they?

328
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,420
We bothered them, right?

329
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,519
Who? Pi Seon Ju?

330
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,960
Or Kim So Woo?

331
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,920
Both of them.

332
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,529
You seemed to care more about Seon Ju.

333
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,269
But now, you seem to care
more about Mr. Kim.

334
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,339
Don't you think so
because you mind Seon Ju more?

335
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:41,309
And your mother.
Why did she talk to So Woo?

336
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:43,579
She keeps going further and further.

337
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:45,480
Why would she visit my husband?

338
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:49,880
She got involved
because you haven't made up your mind.

339
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:53,690
When's your court date?

340
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,220
The divorce will be finalized then, right?

341
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,819
I'm too tired to talk about that now.

342
00:18:04,829 --> 00:18:05,900
Didn't we...

343
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,599
agree to try to get along?

344
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,569
Let's not do this when we're
just starting to gain recognition.

345
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,509
I wonder too.

346
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,119
Why, whenever I see Ms. Pi,

347
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,119
do I want to stop and help her?

348
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,019
Maybe I want to shield her.

349
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:34,690
Then there's nothing
between you and Seon Ju.

350
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:36,430
Even if it's because I'm wary of you,

351
00:18:36,529 --> 00:18:39,130
the feelings of wanting to
help and shield someone.

352
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:41,299
Can you say that's nothing?

353
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,940
Where are you going?

354
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,250
I was going to...

355
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,349
get a coffee.

356
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:58,250
Were you? Let's go together, then.

357
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,430
- Block it.
- You block it.

358
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,960
- I'll block it.
- Okay.

359
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
- Oh, no.
- I scored a goal.

360
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,369
Why are you kicking a ball indoors?

361
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:16,269
Dong Won. Let's say they're too young
to tell right from wrong.

362
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:18,599
You're grown up.
Why are you playing with them?

363
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,509
Go outside if you want to play soccer. Go.

364
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,769
- Let's go.
- My goodness.

365
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:27,380
Why are there no customers today?

366
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,410
Shoot.

367
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,890
She was Soon Ae's best friend,

368
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,059
but they lost contact?

369
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,230
Where on earth is she hiding?

370
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,099
(Han Hair Line)

371
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:50,599
Come in.

372
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,710
What are you doing here?

373
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,410
I was passing by.

374
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,809
I'm glad you did.

375
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:02,349
I was going to get off work soon.

376
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,250
- Let's leave together.
- Sure.

377
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,220
How is Sang Ah doing since the promotion?

378
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,890
Is she working hard and well?

379
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,960
She seems to be getting
lots of interview requests,

380
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,690
but her private life is a mess,

381
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:14,960
so I told Admin to refuse them.

382
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,460
Why would you do that?

383
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,960
If she wants to step into the public eye,
she must end one of her relationships.

384
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,700
What do you mean "end one of them?"

385
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,000
Are you saying you can accept Mr. Jeon?

386
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,339
I want her to reconcile with So Woo,
but that looks unlikely.

387
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,250
If that's the case, she should divorce him
and remarry Mr. Jeon soon.

388
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:39,349
We should get her
to reconcile with So Woo.

389
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,349
I'll talk to him and see what he thinks.

390
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,769
Is something bothering you?

391
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,670
I get it.

392
00:20:58,069 --> 00:20:59,640
Your sister's wedding?

393
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,170
There's this and that.

394
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,079
I find myself thinking,
"I was that excited..."

395
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,779
"about my wedding."

396
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,750
And I also worry
if it'll be okay to marry them like this.

397
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,390
They did seem happy, though.

398
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:17,960
They should be.

399
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,960
What I said at the team dinner.

400
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,960
I didn't say that just to annoy them.

401
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:27,670
Sang Ah and Nam Jin. Those two.

402
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Don't you think they don't look happy?

403
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,569
I'd have to agree.

404
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:37,509
They say they're together
because they're so much in love,

405
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,180
but they don't look like
they're madly in love.

406
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,720
I just don't get...

407
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,750
what their relationship is.

408
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:50,690
You're right.

409
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:54,289
They're not running parallel.

410
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:56,960
Don't they look like they're fanning out?

411
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,859
What do you mean?

412
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,230
They were on top of each other
at the beginning,

413
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,940
but as time goes on, they fan outward...

414
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,210
Oh, dear.

415
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,849
It's fine. I'll wash it off in a restroom.

416
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,650
You got coffee on you too.

417
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,690
That's a big splash.

418
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,559
No. Most of it is on your coat.

419
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:30,130
Let's cover it up with this.

420
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,500
No. You'll get coffee on the inside too.

421
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,799
No. Put it on.

422
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,769
- I don't need...
- Let's go back to the office...

423
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:38,369
and see if we have a change of clothes.

424
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,509
Hang on.

425
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:45,380
I'll take this.

426
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,309
You're drenched. Let's go.

427
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:49,779
- Okay.
- Come along.

428
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,390
So what? Will you steal a pair?

429
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,420
Will you steal it for me?

430
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,960
It's your business. It won't have
the same effect if I were to steal it.

431
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,700
It would be easier
if I were to rob a stranger.

432
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:07,369
It'd be so embarrassing
if I were to get caught.

433
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:08,700
What's this about?

434
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,839
Is your son having issues
with his new love?

435
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,339
No.

436
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:16,210
I just want Nam Jin to be successful.

437
00:23:17,509 --> 00:23:18,539
Goodness...

438
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,819
What's going on?

439
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:31,160
Let's talk.

440
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,859
Mr. Jang. Once the room is empty,

441
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,430
will you stand guard by the door?

442
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,559
Okay.

443
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:52,380
Talk now.

444
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,150
That you're marrying Pi Mi Ju.

445
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,779
I misheard that, right?

446
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,720
It's not true, is it?

447
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:01,990
It's true.

448
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,289
Are you lashing out
because Ms. Oh told you off...

449
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,160
for the hotel scandal?

450
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:13,829
You shouldn't get married
for something like that.

451
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:16,000
Please change your mind.

452
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:19,200
- It's not that.
- What is it, then?

453
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,710
Do you really like her or something?

454
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:27,650
- I think I do.
- You're insane.

455
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,779
What about me?

456
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,049
What am I, then?

457
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,920
If you really disliked me,
you should've ignored my calls!

458
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:38,519
You shouldn't have come to see me
when I asked you to!

459
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,630
You shouldn't have let me
come to your home.

460
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,059
You put up with everything.

461
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,160
You kept me by your side.

462
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,730
When you knew how I felt about you.

463
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,839
That was wrong and bad.

464
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,410
You were a junior and friend...

465
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,880
What's Pi Mi Ju, then?

466
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:02,779
She's not your junior or friend.

467
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,480
Is she a woman to you?

468
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,230
- Hey.
- Hi.

469
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:24,769
I couldn't find a shop
that sold anything suitable,

470
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,339
so I got you this.

471
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:28,170
- Thank you.
- Sure.

472
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:29,339
How much was it?

473
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:31,380
It's fine. Get changed first.

474
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,809
- Thank you.
- Okay.

475
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,519
The interview I taped last time.

476
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,289
- It airs today. Let's watch it.
- Okay.

477
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,140
I was in this field for 30 years
and I became successful.

478
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,299
You might think I had a tough life,

479
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,470
(Successful Women Special)

480
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,880
but it's a blessing
to be able to do what you love.

481
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:07,809
The path I took...

482
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:10,650
wasn't full of thorns.
Rather, it was paved with silk.

483
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:12,349
I enjoyed the stroll.

484
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,819
That comment will energize
a great many young hairdressers.

485
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,559
What would you say to the youngsters
who call you their role model?

486
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:25,000
If you put in your hard work and passion,

487
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,200
strive ahead without any distractions,

488
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,700
and think of nothing but your occupation,

489
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:33,970
before you know it,
you will be successful.

490
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:35,509
Good luck.

491
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,309
I found you.

492
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,089
Do you think you stand out too much?

493
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:52,160
Do I?

494
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,259
No.

495
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,559
What's this?

496
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,769
I bought it because
I got coffee all over me.

497
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:02,069
Ms. Pi.

498
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:04,440
Yellow suits you.

499
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,269
You look like Bruce Lee.

500
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,079
Should I wear something
that fits my fighter character?

501
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,849
My gosh.

502
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,950
I knew you were a good boxer,

503
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,390
- but you can kick too.
- You think so?

504
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:30,960
My word.

505
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,460
Why did Mr. Kim...

506
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,099
get you these clothes?

507
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:36,730
He's way better than the fool...

508
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,640
who ran off with his lover
saying I didn't have...

509
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,910
that important a job anyway
when I got coffee all over me.

510
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,849
Do you write down
everything I say and memorize it?

511
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:52,380
You say things that leave a huge impact.

512
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,750
How could I forget anything?

513
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,750
Whenever I was stuck or struggling,

514
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:01,230
you never wanted to
stop to help or shield me, did you?

515
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,500
I could help
if there was something I could do.

516
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,400
Do you have a favor to ask?

517
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Something like,
"Could you sit next to me at a wedding?"

518
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,509
- What?
- Mi Ju called.

519
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,180
Is my sister-in-law getting married?

520
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,250
Get the titles right.
Who's your sister-in-law?

521
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,420
I can help you out with that.

522
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,250
I'll be your husband if you want.

523
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,960
What did you just say?

524
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:35,990
You'll be whose husband?

525
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,440
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

526
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,430
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

527
00:29:07,589 --> 00:29:09,890
Just so you can
make your wedding a success,

528
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,029
how dare you throw salt
onto my painful divorce?

529
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:13,630
Don't even talk to Seon Ju anymore!

530
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,630
What's this?

531
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:16,500
Your old in-laws.

532
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:19,170
Was one of the three girls
born out of wedlock?

533
00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:22,069
