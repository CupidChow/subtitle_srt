What's this?

7
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,769
- So these two...
- It's me.

8
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:43,240
- had an affair.
- Will you stop it?

9
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,280
- It's fine. Let her say...
- Hey.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,640
- what she wants.
- Did you see... It's here.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,250
Have you heard of
"defamation based on facts?"

12
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:51,680
If there's going to be another suit,

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,379
- let's get the facts straight.
- Why do I hear your voice?

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,250
Let me tell you their names.

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,420
- Stop it.
- Why should I?

16
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,860
- You even introduced her to your mother.
- This is madness.

17
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,089
- It's you.
- Are you planning a wedding...

18
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:05,699
when our divorce isn't yet final?

19
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,329
- I was going to do this in your office.
- Will we be on the news?

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,500
Who cares?

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,169
Their dirty laundry should be aired.

22
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,300
We did nothing wrong.

23
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:17,809
Still, how would Ji Hyun feel
knowing a video of her cheating dad's...

24
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,479
going around?

25
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,350
Who would know whose dad he is?

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,509
The post's anonymous.

27
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:25,779
No one will find out
unless they look it up.

28
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:26,880
Right?

29
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:28,790
Yes.

30
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:31,960
Those two deserve to be humiliated.

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,790
I have so many other things
to take care of.

32
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,830
Let's forget about this.

33
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,900
What other things must you take care of?

34
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:53,109
It looks like you scraped together
the money to settle.

35
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:55,410
Do what you want
if you want another lawsuit!

36
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,150
Fine. If there's going to be another suit,

- Hi.
- Was Mr. Jeon married to...

40
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:12,400
one of the girls from the family
involved in the car accident?

41
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,669
- Yes.
- Are you out of your mind?

42
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,599
Why would you date someone
married to that family?

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,110
It's his wife's family that's weird.
Mr. Jeon's a good man.

44
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,510
Give me his number.

45
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:26,740
Just give it to me!

46
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,059

00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:13,059
You can tell a lot about a woman
from her mom.

49
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:16,230
I can't wait to see
just how elegant her mom is.

50
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,099
I might as well meet her mom today...

The buyer said
he can't let us keep the salon?

58
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,390
No. I couldn't tell Mom
in case she got too disappointed.

59
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,230
What should we do?

60
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,400
I went to see a few realtors today.

for cheap for nothing?

Do you know how badly
she mistreated and humiliated me?

70
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:38,469
I apologize.

71
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,010
I'll make sure it won't happen again.

72
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,409
It had better not.

73
00:04:43,109 --> 00:04:44,779
This shouldn't have happened either.

What will you and Sang Ah do?

76
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,089
I'm serious about Ms. Jin.

77

you'll remarry or something?

I'm disgusted by the thought...

81
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,370
of being involved with them.

82
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:11,339
I submitted the divorce papers.
My ex and I are legal strangers.

83

You fathered her grandchild.

I thought highly of and approved of you...

87
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,020
because you were
a competent colleague of Sang Ah's.

88
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,289
I liked you as her acquaintance.

I never wanted what wasn't mine.

I lived an honest law-abiding life.

My husband won't accept this,

93
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,599
and it'll only harm Sang Ah's standing.

94
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,070
So that no harm comes to Ms. Jin... No.

95
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:45,710

and make it even stronger.

I said something was up with them.

107
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,549

because they'd studied abroad together.

Mr. Jeon's not like that.

152

If he's not like that, why would he
date you when he was married?

Why are you so negative, Dad?

156
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,299
Mr. Jeon got divorced
so he could be with me.

How can I like someone
who leaves his family for a married woman?

didn't like me for my money?

the more I want to retaliate.

- He volunteered.
- This link.

He liked So Woo, your husband,
who gave the presentation instead.

He asked if the rumor's true

before the government announces them.

178
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,740
They move faster than any realtor.

179
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,709
There had been
some suspicious movements lately.

180
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:52,520
You sold your house recently.

181
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,220
Didn't that realtor say anything?

182
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,850
I heard the house prices here soared.

183
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,520
Which estate agent should we go to?

184
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,220
Lucky Real Estate Agent.

185
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,360
Hey.

186
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,959
What should we do?

187
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,159
First...

188
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,329
Let's think about it over a meal.

189
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:12,329
Let's go.

190
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:18,970
What is a "future-oriented
specialized school?"

191
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,039
I don't know.

192
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,449
Who'd have thought that crummy school
would end up like that?

193
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,949
What should we do?

194
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,919
We need to move out soon.

195
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,890
If we don't find a house
or a store space...

196
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,929
What happens to us then?

197
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,559
This is still
the cheapest neighborhood around.

198
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,100
Not just that,

199
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:47,039
but Mom doesn't want to move far.

200
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,779
I'm sure we'll find something
if we look hard enough.

201
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,779
Whether it's a semi-basement
or on a roof, a three-room...

202
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:04,449
Do develop rundown areas
and provide more housing,

203
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:06,990
the government announced
a new urban development project.

204
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,789
Manjang-dong was selected...

205
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:11,789
and a surprise announcement made.

206
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,059
Seoul Metropolitan City...

207
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:15,630
Manjang-dong was what?

208
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,100
- This project...
- What's that about?

209
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,640
There was no bid
and the residents were not polled.

210
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,970
The city selected an area
and suggested a blueprint.

211
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,579
The announcement was sudden
to prevent property speculation.

212
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,110
As a result of this project,
Manjang-dong will become...

213
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,579
a 5,000-household complex
worth investing in.

214
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:33,750
Seon Ju.

215
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,020
Are we done for?

216
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,929
Are you having fun?

217
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,230
(Extreme Measures to Provide Housing)

218
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,230
(Manjang-dong Selected
for Development Project)

219
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:54,439
Sir. There's great news
about the house you bought.

220
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,510
You got really lucky.

221
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,809
The Manjang-dong residents got a windfall.

222
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,020
You could sell now and make
at least 100,000 to 200,000 dollars.

223
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,220
Is the person who bought our house
a speculator?

224
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:12,590
No.

225
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:17,429
He looked like a naive loser
we could take advantage of.

226
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,360
This is driving me crazy.

227
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,069
Let's go to the real estate agent...

228
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:26,740
and see what he has to say.

229
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,569
- Come with me.
- Okay.

230
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,279
There had been some suspicious movement.

231
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,850
People asked if no one said anything
when we sold the house.

232
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,390
Did you really have no idea?

233
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,650
I did not.

234
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:47,319
Everyone's making a fuss
now that it was announced.

235
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:48,959
Why are you complaining?

236
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,689
Property policies
aren't made or announced...

237
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:54,000
like they're a top-secret mission.

238
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:56,569
What government policy
is announced so suddenly?

239
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,069
Has this ever happened before?

240
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:00,939
- No.
- That's right.

241
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:05,370
You're in the business
and you knew nothing about it?

242
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,279
You're an expert.

243
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,480
An expert's not a fortune teller.

244
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,380
I'd have bought a house if I'd known.

245
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,150
I'm dead jealous of the people
who bought a property here.

246
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,850
Go away.

247
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:20,789
Goodness.

248
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,230
Hello, Jungang Real...

249
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,959
What? Houses for sale?

250
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,900
(Jungang Real Estate Agency)

251
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,429
The moms are way ahead of you.

252
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,470
We're out of long-term
and short-term rentals.

253
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,610
What's available is more expensive
than it was a month ago.

254
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:41,610
Your budget will only get you a studio
or two rooms in a semi-basement,

255
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,010
but you'd be lucky
to find one that's available now.

256
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,120
What should we do?

257
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,590
My hair's standing on end.

258
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,890
What if it falls out?

259
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,029
Oh, dear.

260
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,529
I talked Mom into selling the house.

261
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,429
What if she finds out?

262
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Goodness.

263
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:08,340
It's Mom.

264
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,679
Hi, Mom.

265
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,309
Hey! All of you, get over here now!

266
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:28,990
What does this say? What is this about?

267
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:35,400
Our neighbors are celebrating.

268
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,199
What will happen to us?

269
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,069
- Mom...
- Forget it.

270
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,340
I'm sad we couldn't get more
for the house,

271
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,939
but can we move into the place
you said you'd found?

272
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:46,840
The school nearby is going to become...

273
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,809
some fancy global school.

274
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,949
It's popular with the students now.

275
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,679
- So what?
- The price to rent went up.

276
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,150
You said the housing price here
would never go up.

277
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,390
It hasn't been that long
since we sold the house.

278
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,559
The ink on the contract
we signed is barely dry.

279
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,789
It would smudge if I were
to run my finger over the seal.

280
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,860
Say something!

281
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,600
The prices hadn't gone up in years.

282
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,100
Even when the prices elsewhere went up,

283
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,900
- it even went down here, right?
- Darn you.

284
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,970
Not even experts can predict
how housing prices...

285
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,610
You!

286
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,949
- Oh, dear.
- Mom!

287
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,980
If not even experts know,

288
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,150
why did you act like you knew something?

289
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:31,250
The population's dwindling...

290
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,890
and houses are being built, so what?

291
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,329
- I thought...
- You two! You're both frauds!

292
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,959
You're the worst accomplice ever!

293
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,600
What now? Oh, dear. What happens now?

294
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,039
Jin Ju, go and close the salon.

295
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,770
I can't work today.

296
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,140
Oh, dear. I need some rest.

297
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,579
Oh, my gosh...

298
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,380
I'm home...

299
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,150
What's this?

300
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:06,720
This place is getting redeveloped?

301
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,959
I did say we shouldn't sell the house.

302
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,800
You be quiet.

303
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,729
This wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't gotten into trouble.

304
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:21,969
If we're talking about who's guilty,
most of it falls on you.

305
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:26,209
It's so darn annoying.

306
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,439
How could this happen now?

307
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,009
The speculator scored big
by buying our house,

308
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,320
and we stupidly gave him
a 5,000-dollar discount.

309
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,390
Jin Ju. Give me his number.

310
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,390
Okay.

311
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:03,080
I'm going to call So Woo...

312
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,519
- to the office tomorrow.
- What for?

313
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:09,749
You and Jeon are to face him
in my presence.

314
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,320
You both can get on your knees.

315
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,159
What if word were to spread
within the company?

316
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,229
Who wouldn't know by now
when the video was everywhere?

317
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,530
You shouldn't have done that
if you didn't want to be embarrassed.

318
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,300
Darn it.

319
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,479
Hey, Woo Sang.

320
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:37,479
- Look at this.
- Darn it, Mom.

321
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:39,150
Can you stop doing that?

322
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,219
I won't look. You look at this.

323
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:42,519
Come here.

324
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:45,090
- Look.
- Do what you want...

325
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,489
- if you want another lawsuit!
- What's this?

326
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:47,919
It's Sang Ah.

327
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:51,330
I was there when it happened and I saw...

328
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:54,729
No. I didn't see it,
but I heard everything.

329
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,800
Sang Ah had an affair.
Do you believe that?

330
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,300
- Why did she do that?
- I don't know.

331
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,769
The fraudster family came by
and threw cash in the air...

332
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,280
and there was a huge ruckus.

333
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,280
She had the affair
with someone from that family.

334
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,979
- From that family?
- Yes.

335
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,979
That family scares me too.

336
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:17,689
They're messed up as well.

337
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,320
Should I switch salons?

338
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,830
Will they refund
what's left of my membership?

339
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:27,130
Will they?

340
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,199
What will you say?

341
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,499
I'm annoyed.

342
00:19:33,499 --> 00:19:35,370
I'll ask him to go back on the deal.

343
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,840
Would you do that if you were him?

344
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,209
We took half the going price
and paid the settlement.

345
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,110
We can't cough up the money
even if he agrees to annul the deal.

346
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,449
Then I'll get him to hand over
the extra 5,000 dollars.

347
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,850
The person is unable to answer the phone.

348
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,590
Why won't he pick up?

349
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,590
What could be wrong?

350
00:19:58,459 --> 00:19:59,900
- Dad.
- Yes?

351
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,300
Why can't we catch anything?

352
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:03,499
I don't know.

353
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,699
Are the fish hiding because it's too cold?

354
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,370
Come on out, fish.

355
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,709
Come on out, fish.

356
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,880
It's not usually this bad.

357
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,550
What's wrong?

358
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:25,719
Do you think he saved your number
to avoid picking up?

359
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,060
I'll try calling from my phone.

360
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,489
What will you say?

361
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:33,600
I'd rather say something
than shut up and do nothing.

362
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,769
We have nothing more to lose.

363
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,570
What could be the matter?

364
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,509
I'm not this bad at fishing.

365
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Goodness.

366
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,409
Oh, well.

367
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,310
Wait here for a bit, Tae Ri.

368
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,350
Okay.

369
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:05,989
Hello?

370
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:08,560
Hello. Are you...

371
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,100
Are you Mr. Kim So Woo?

372
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,699
Yes. Who's this?

373
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:15,739
You bought the house in Manjang-dong.

374
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:18,909
We talked yesterday on my sister's phone.

375
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:22,979
Oh. I already told you
you can't keep the salon.

376
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:25,050
No, it's not about that.

377
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:27,050
Can we meet for a chat?

378
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:29,479
What for?

379
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:32,390
There's a really important issue.

380
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,019
You could come over
or we could meet in the middle.

381
00:21:36,019 --> 00:21:39,060
I'm not in Seoul,
so I don't think we can meet.

382
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,499
I'll come to you, then.

383
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,229
It's too late today.

384
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:46,870
I'll leave early tomorrow morning
and call when I'm nearby.

385
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,040
Hello?

386
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:50,769
Hello?

387
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,009
Will he see you?

388
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,249
How big is his family?

389
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,919
He came to see the house with his son.

390
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,189
I got the impression he was alone.
Like a single dad raising his kid?

391
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,330
He looked like real easy prey.

392
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,060
He didn't look like a speculator.

393
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,100
Speculators don't go around with a sign.

394
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,769
Naive-looking people are the worst.

395
00:22:21,469 --> 00:22:23,840
(Han Hair Line)

396
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,110
Hello. I'm here.

397
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,280
I said I'd come, so here I am.

398
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:34,580
Yes. I turned left from the sign.

399
00:22:36,249 --> 00:22:37,519
Okay.

400
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,360
- Was that good?
- Yes.

401
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,300
Someone's here.
I'll go and chat with them.

402
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,530
Okay.

403
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,640
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

404
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,949
Are you out camping with your son?

405
00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:05,550
Yes.

406
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:08,880
Have fun.

407
00:23:10,949 --> 00:23:13,419
I'm here on an errand.

408
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:14,489
I see.

409
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,140
Hello?

410
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,239
It's me.

411
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:36,439
You...

412
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,390
I think it's me.

413
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,659
You bought the house?

414
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,499
Weren't you a jobless dad?

415
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:58,330
I had some savings.

416
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:00,939
That's good to hear.

417
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,340
I really should worry less about others.

418
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:07,140
I thought you were penniless and jobless.

419
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:13,519
You got a really good deal on the house.

420
00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:17,519
Yes. Why did you want to see me?

421
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,019
Oh, that.

422
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,790
Well...

423
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,300
Did you buy our house because
you heard the area would be redeveloped?

424
00:24:31,229 --> 00:24:33,269
- What?
- Did you hear rumors...

425
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:34,600
and decide to make a profit?

426
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:35,870
No way.

427
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:38,409
I did not.

428
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:42,840
How did you decide to buy
at just the right time?

429
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,449
The area's not that well-known.

430
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:47,449
Did you get the feel...

431
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:49,679
to buy a house there
right before the huge announcement?

432
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,219
If that were the case,

433
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,620
will you report me to someone?

434
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,290
Goodness.

435
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:58,390
No, I wouldn't do that.

436
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,600
Do you want me to go back on the deal?

437
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,030
Well...

438
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,439
Could you give us one year?

439
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:13,840
It would be even better
if you could give us two years.

440
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,350
Can you let us stay there
while we pay you back?

441
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,019
No.

442
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:26,620
If you didn't speculate,
you didn't know the price would go up.

443
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:30,229
Will you let us sign
a long-term lease with you...

444
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,659
at the price we agreed on?

445
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,360
I can't do that.

446
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,870
I'm not asking you to annul the deal.

447
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,870
You must be pleased to make a profit.
It'll be just two years.

448
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,009
We'll keep the house clean.

449
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:52,679
I promise to... Please. Mr. Kim.

450
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:55,519
You know I'm an interior designer.

451
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,150
I'll fix up the house while we live there.

452
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,790
Why are you chasing me?

453
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,459
I heard you were in urgent need of money,

454
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,130
so I paid you half the going price
which you'd usually get a few weeks later.

455
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:10,800
I know that.

456
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,070
You're rich enough
to be able to afford paying us...

457
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,540
half the price in one go.

458
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,509
You must be living somewhere right now.

459
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,909
That's called speculation!

460
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,909
I'm not living anywhere right now.

461
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:27,479
I'm out camping, as you can see.

462
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,989
I closed all my savings accounts...

463
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:33,249
to buy a house to live in with my son.

464
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:34,719
How is that speculation?

465
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,060
Wait.

466
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:43,530
If you'll move in with your son...

467
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,469
You didn't reconcile with your wife?

468
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,209
No.

469
00:26:57,709 --> 00:27:00,850
I'm really sorry you didn't.

470
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:06,320
That house is too big
for one adult and one kid.

471
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,360
Why do you need four rooms?

472
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:11,390
Let my family stay there
on a long-term lease...

473
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,100
and move into
a clean two-room apartment with...

474
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,560
No, thanks. That's enough.

475
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:18,499
Wait.

476
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,969
I'm really sorry but...

477
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,669
my mom's salon at least...

478
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,909
I plan to turn that space into my office.

479
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,949
What jobless guy needs an office?

480
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,679
Shouldn't you look for work?

481
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:38,519
I'd like to make an office
because I need one.

482
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,860
I chose that house
because it would be easier...

483
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,429
to raise my son
if my office and home were adjoined.

484
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,689
I don't even know
why I'm explaining this to you.

485
00:27:46,689 --> 00:27:48,600
What I decide to do...

486
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:51,570
with the leftover rooms is up to me.

487
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,239
Goodbye.

489
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,840
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

490
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,070
You didn't drive here?

491
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,610
My car exploded, so I scrapped it.

492
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,679
It exploded?

493
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,310
Come on. You made me
sign a contract so I wouldn't tell.

494
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,880
My watch is missing.

495
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,479
I want to see what's in all your bags.

496
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:43,620
How dare you let
a video like that get out?

497
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:45,689
Did we kill someone?

498
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:47,259
How far are you going to go?

499
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,189
I might as well marry Mr. Jeon.
