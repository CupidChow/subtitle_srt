00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,960
(Episode 21)

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,030
If I get you a loan, will you divorce me?

3
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:15,960
How could you...

4
00:00:17,829 --> 00:00:20,030
I came here
with a one-in-a-million hope...

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,540
that I'd won the lottery.

6
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:24,970
I'm grasping at straws here.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,210
How desperate do you think I am?

8
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,339
You can settle for the accident
with the alimony.

9
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,479
You have money to pay alimony, then?

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,249
I'm saying I'll make the money somehow.

11
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:42,120
If you can make the money somehow,
can't you make some to help me now?

12
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:45,930
Who loans that much money for free?

13
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,300
I was serious,
so call if you change your mind.

14
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:51,830
And I'll shop around for a loan.

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,930
I'm going to the toilet.

16
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:56,169
That's your plan?

17
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:57,669
Get me a loan first!

18
00:00:57,669 --> 00:01:00,140
Then I'll think about the divorce!

19
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:10,120
Why did she tell me to get out
as soon as I'd gotten in?

20
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:21,030
Hey.

21
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:22,700
Aren't you Ms. Han's daughter?

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,500
- What are you doing?
- Hello.

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,300
Stick that up there,
and it'll get taken down.

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,869
(Jungang Real Estate Agency)

25
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:29,899
Post it over here.

26
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:31,170
- Can I do that?
- Yes.

27
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,269
Thank you.

28
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,759
His phone is ringing.

29
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,230
Hello?

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,830
You need a two-room apartment?

31
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,810
Leave your number
and someone will call you right back.

32
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,179
Okay.

33
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,940
Sure, bye.

34
00:02:19,619 --> 00:02:24,189
Someone just called to ask about renting
a two-room apartment.

35
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:26,429
They'll come by this weekend.

36
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:27,790
Here's their number.

37
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,600
Thanks so much.

38
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,630
They say they'll come by but never do.

39
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,040
If there are properties,
there are no takers,

40
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,110
and if there are customers,
there are no properties.

41
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:43,110
Apartments and such
can't be made to order,

42
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:46,080
and I can't force people to sell either.

43
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:48,209
Right.

44
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,320
Are you interested in selling the house?

45
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,550
What?

46
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:00,589
No.

47
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,070
I can't just sit around.

48
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,369
I must go and beg somehow.

49
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:30,160
No way.

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,989
Why would we sell the house?
Then we'd have nowhere to live.

51
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:34,290
That's not true.

52
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,100
Add a little to the money from the sale,

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,570
and you can buy
a newly-built apartment nearby.

54
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:42,939
We don't have money to add.

55
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,570
We can barely...

56
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:50,239
How much...

57
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,649
do you think we could get for it?

58
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:56,580
Between 350,000 and 360,000 dollars?

59
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,589
I'll get you 380,000 dollars for it.

60
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,119
Talk to your mother.

61
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,890
Then I'll waive your commission...

62
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:10,760
and give you ten percent
of the commission I get from the buyer.

63
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,399
Do you have photos of the place?

64
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,600
What I'm saying is,
is there any way I can take the blame...

65
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,530
for what my daughter did
and go to prison instead?

66
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,369
You can't do that. That's preposterous.

67
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:51,170
Why is it preposterous?

68
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,939
Parents pay for their children...

69
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:55,309
and even pay fines
if their kids break the law.

70
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:58,179
Why can't I do time in her place?

71
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,879
It's better for the country to lock up...

72
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,220
old people like me
instead of young people.

73
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,619
Ma'am, we're not here
to listen to your sob stories.

74
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:10,889
Will you please stop whining...

75
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:13,530
and go find the money instead?

76
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,199
I'm here because
I can't get the money elsewhere!

77
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:21,129
We can't help you either!

78
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:23,670
I have work to do,

79
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,610
so please, go home.

80
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,480
Will you get out of here?
Please, leave us alone!

81
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,739
- Stop pushing me!
- Go home!

82
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,879
We have no young messy kids or pets.

83
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,819
There's really nothing much to do.

84
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,819
- I'm home.
- That's right.

85
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:41,119
I'll come and pick you up.

86
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:44,389
Okay. Bye.

87
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:47,460
Did you find a helper?

88
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,230
Yes. She starts on Monday.

89
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,900
I'm so pleased. I'm free at last.

90
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,999
Be nice to her so she doesn't quit.

91
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:59,710
You bet. When am I not nice?

92
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,509
All the helpers quit for personal reasons.

93
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:05,439
Those personal reasons
arose because of you.

94
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,280
Why would you say that?

95
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:10,550
I'm in a great mood. I'm free at last.

96
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,819
I told you to each think of a way
to get the money.

97
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,329
Do any of you not have one?

98
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,329
- No.
- You go first, then.

99
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:28,629
So, what I did was,

100
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,499
I didn't get any money,

101
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,509
but to figure out
how the accident happened,

102
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,439
- the person who was with Jin Chu Ah...
- You mean to say...

103
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,809
you didn't get a cent?

104
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:41,379
Right.

105
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:45,749
What about you two?

106
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,119
You.

107
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:49,160
Did you talk to your boss?

108
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,319
Well...

109
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,489
My boss is tied up too.

110
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:57,360
He treated you like his personal slave.

111
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:59,129
Why are you so lenient on him?

112
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,069
You're the only one here
who gets a regular salary.

113
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:04,600
My boss...

114
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,809
He went bankrupt.

115
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:11,179
He ran away.

116
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:12,350
What?

117
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:13,509
- What?
- For real?

118
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:15,050
My gosh.

119
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,179
What about you?

120
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,520
Do you know anyone who can lend you money?

121
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:23,220
You taught a lot of kids over the years.

122
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,230
Can't you call a few of their moms?

123
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:29,600
Mom. Actually...

124
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:32,129
I lost all my students.

125
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,270
How come?

126
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:37,139
One of the moms
saw me leave the police station.

127
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,300
Oh, no...

128
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:41,540
So all three of you lost your jobs,

129
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,239
and no one has an income right now?

130
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,249
My goodness. Why are you all such losers?

131
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:53,020
I went to the police station
to ask if there was a way...

132
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,619
I could go to prison instead.

133
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,489
The detective said no.

134
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:57,619
Mom.

135
00:07:57,619 --> 00:07:59,929
Why would you
think of something so drastic?

136
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,489
What else can I do?

137
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,929
What have you done so far?

138
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,230
You did nothing but lose your jobs.

139
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,030
I asked around for a loan.

140
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,929
My credit isn't good enough.

141
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,170
Do you think...

142
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:15,470
we could get a mortgage on the house...

143
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,540
What?

144
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,710
I thought you at least
would have a decent plan.

145
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,650
All you can think of
is to get a mortgage on the house?

146
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:25,079
What are we to do, then?

147
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,590
If we don't settle,

148
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:29,189
the two of us will get off
with a fine or probation,

149
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:31,660
but she might be detained.

150
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,759
Should we let her go to prison, then?

151
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,900
The hourly rate if she were to go away
instead of paying the money to settle...

152
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,870
isn't that bad a deal, apparently.

153
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:46,540
How could you say such a thing, you brat?

154
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,640
What mom would let her child
go to prison and say...

155
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,809
it's a better deal
than coughing up tens of thousands?

156
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,179
Would either of you do that
to your son or your daughter?

157
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,349
Why would you bring our kids into this?

158
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,020
That's how you get the point across.

159
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:07,729
You darn wenches. You're horrible sisters.

160
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:10,099
Is this how I raised and taught you?

161
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:13,270
No. You always scolded all three of us...

162
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:15,270
and beat all three of us.

163
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:20,069
There's nothing else we can do.

164
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:21,109
Goodness.

165
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,979
I wouldn't say
there was nothing we could do.

166
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,250
Well...

167
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:44,329
Here's your order.

168
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,729
This liquor here. Get me another bottle.

169
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,170
Yes, sir.

170
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:04,219
(1,138th Lottery Draw)

171
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,199
What? You want to sell the house?

172
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,599
Why you...

173
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:21,469
One wants to
get a mortgage on the house...

174
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,599
while the other wants to sell it outright?

175
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:26,969
Jin Ju. Why would you go that far?

176
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:28,939
Yes. That's a bit too much.

177
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:30,939
We have no other option.

178
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:34,349
We all need to take a rational approach.

179
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,650
Should we let Mi Ju go to prison?

180
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,050
Yes. I'll do time.

181
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,390
Seon Ju said if we did the math,
it would be a good deal.

182
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,660
What will that make you?

183
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,729
It'll make you a convicted criminal.

184
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:51,229
Not just a convict,
but a convict who did time.

185
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,270
What butterfly effect will that have?

186
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,670
A deserted wife, a widow, and a convict.

187
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,170
There will be an uproar.

188
00:10:57,469 --> 00:10:59,199
Do you think you'll ever get married?

189
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,670
Do you think it won't affect
your niece and nephew?

190
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,579
This might...

191
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,150
actually be cheaper and easier on us all.

192
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:10,650
Jin Ju. I get what you're thinking,

193
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:13,020
but we can't sell the house.

194
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,890
Tell me if we have another option.

195
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,290
Mom. You know the house prices here
will never go up.

196
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,160
Let's handle the most pressing issue.

197
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,530
We can save up
and buy the house back later.

198
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,670
Forget it.

199
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,640
We're not selling the house.

200
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,709
Think of something else
and reconvene tomorrow.

201
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:49,420
Why did you say that, Jin Ju?

202
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:03,900
I can't give a hefty position
to someone who can't even...

203
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,740
handle a household.

204
00:12:06,109 --> 00:12:08,410
Not even my own blood is an exception.

205
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,689
Where's Tae Ri? Is he asleep?

206
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:22,990
What? Well, yes.

207
00:12:23,219 --> 00:12:24,760
I was going to say goodnight.

208
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,229
I'll go to our room.

209
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,689
Okay.

211
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:42,709
Mr. Kim.

212
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:45,910
Mr. Jeon ordered that they take down
the dance studio in Mr. Hwang's mansion.

213
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:47,609
Really?

214
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,280
You're pulling down the dance studio?

215
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,490
Yes. We plan to work fast
so we don't disrupt the schedule.

216
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,130
Why rush when the family
hasn't yet made the final decision?

217
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:04,660
I believe Mr. Hwang put me in charge.

218
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:08,530
I want to do as he wishes
in as little time as possible.

219
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:13,809
I have an external meeting to attend.

220
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,229
I heard...

221
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,829
one of you sisters might end up in prison.

222
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,170
You heard?

223
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,910
- Could you...
- Lend you money?

224
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,309
No.

225
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:49,939
Right?

226
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,040
Naturally.

227
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,380
You shouldn't borrow from people you know.

228
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,179
Go to them and beg.

229
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:00,050
If you can't afford to pay up,
begging is all you can do.

230
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:01,449
There's nothing else.

232
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,260
Hello?

233
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,599
Mom.

234
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:14,670
I'll meet you there.

235
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,870
See you. Bye.

239
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,349
My gosh.

240
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,550
You'll buy me an apartment
in this neighborhood?

241
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:06,120
A 100m² apartment?

242
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:07,449
Yes.

243
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:12,260
Where did you get the money from? Wait.

244
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,699
Is the woman you're seeing
buying it for me?

245
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,170
- Yes.
- Goodness.

246
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,300
You nailed a rich one.

247
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,510
Do you like the area?
It's clean, isn't it?

248
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,069
Yes.

249
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,109
Can she move right in
if the place is vacant?

250
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:33,780
- Of course.
- For real?

251
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,280
I'm so pleased.

252
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,949
Will you look at that? It's awesome.

253
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,620
This complex even provides breakfast.

254
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:43,020
I love it.

255
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,319
I hate to cook.

256
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,920
It's perfect.

257
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,559
Let's take a look.

258
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,599
Bye, then.

259
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,300
Thanks for the help. Bye.

260
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,540
I thought you at least
would have a decent plan.

261
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,469
All you can think of
is to get a mortgage on the house?

262
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,040
If you can't afford to pay up,
begging is all you can do.

263
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,579
There's nothing else.

264
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:18,120
- Don't wash your hair tomorrow.
- Okay.

265
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,490
- Bye.
- Thank you.

266
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,800
Should we let Mi Ju go to prison?

267
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,000
It'll make her a convicted criminal.

268
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,839
A deserted wife, a widow, and a convict.
There's no other option.

269
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:33,640
Let's sell the house.

270
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,510
Let's sell the house, Mom!

271
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:39,140
Oh, dear.

272
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:49,319
Goodness.

273
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,620
I gave your hometown friends...

274
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,160
our address so you could find us.

275
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,660
I can't move away.

276
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,160
I just can't.

277
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,710
Thanks.

278
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,720
What's the occasion?

279
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,919
I wanted to earn some points.

280
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:22,649
Your wife is going crazy
trying to get the money to settle.

281
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,990
Can you do this?

282
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,690
She doesn't know about this money.
It's fine.

283
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,730
Is it really?

284
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,559
I'm impressed.

285
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,159
Why were you so frugal in the US, then?

286
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,569
My mother finally sold...

287
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:35,800
the land that was in her name.

288
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,869
Really?

289
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:45,980
I showed up because you invited me,

290
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,309
but you didn't have to include me too.

291
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:51,520
I didn't get to thank you properly
since I got the job.

292
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,919
Oh, stop it.

293
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,419
You're too well-mannered.

294
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,690
This handbag.
Wasn't it what you were going to get?

295
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,329
- Yes.
- Is that true?

296
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,869
You and I have the same taste.

297
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:11,200
- Do you like the bag?
- Of course I do.

298
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,569
Wouldn't it be nice
if your dad were like him?

299
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,339
My husband is too frugal.

300
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:22,349
He doesn't like it
when we buy things like this often.

301
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,950
Then you can go shopping with me.

302
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,790
- Okay. Let's meet often.
- Sure.

303
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:32,589
- Let's eat, then.
- After you.

304
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,990
When will she come in?

305
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,629
Let me check.

306
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,629
The file says 10 a.m.
the day after tomorrow.

307
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,099
- Is that confirmed?
- Yes, I think so.

308
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:47,839
I think that will do.

Goodness.

00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:55,809
We were told to call the police
if we saw you again.

312
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:59,919
Please don't. I came here alone,
and I won't make a fuss.

313
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,619
I'll just have a short conversation.

314
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,790
I'll stand in this corner and wait.

315
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,369
Soon Ae. No, Director Shim.

316
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,639
Department stores have bargain sales
and markets allow haggling.

317
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,540
Why can't you settle with us
at a discounted price?

318
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,240
We go a long way back, don't we?

323
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,190
Did you drop off Mr. Jeon?

324
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,329
I didn't get to thank him.

325
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,659
Are you nearby?

326
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:43,829
Okay. Come on inside.

327
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:45,930
Excuse me.

328
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:49,970
Why are you blocking my way?

330
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,510
Director Shim. How is your back?

331
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,780
Let's talk for a bit.

332
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,639
We're sorry.

333
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:01,010
We're in the wrong.

334
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,250
I have nothing more to say.

335
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,550
Get lost before I call the police!

336
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,619
Why that...

337
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:12,960
It was stupid of me to come here!

338
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,200
My mom wanted me to say thank you.

339
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,639
You earned lots of brownie points today.

340
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,109

Hello.

342
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,419
Director. Will you please hear me out?

343
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:50,530
I'm sorry for the accident, coming here...

344
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,399
and causing a scene, and hurting you too.

345
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,369
I promise to pay you back for everything.

346
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:58,599
Please give us some time
to sort things out.

347

Can you please
talk to your daughters for me?

348
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:05,440
You came back?

349
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,180
Hi, Sang Ah.

350
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:13,149
I thought about it.

351
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,419
I could've offended you...

352
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:17,960
unknowingly and unintentionally.

353
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,790
It was so long ago
that I possibly forgot too.

354
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:24,359
If you're angry about anything,

355
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,030
I hope you can understand.

356
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,399
I'm really... I'm so sorry.

357
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,639
My husband told me not to see you again.

358
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,780
But I came to ask one last time.

359
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,149
- Just like that?
- What?

360
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,149
Shouldn't you go on your knees at least?

361
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:01,629
No.

362
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,770
I can't leave like this.

363
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,710
I picked up a hair clipper,
and I must at least clip off some hair.

364
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:10,379
Yes.

365
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,780
If you're that desperate,
go on your knees.

366
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,520
Can you do that?

367
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:27,730
If I do that, will you help me out?

368
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:32,730
If you can afford to name a condition,
you're not that desperate.

369
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,040
Yes. This is what you were like.

370
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:43,309
You were so stiff and proud
when you had nothing.

371
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,780
You haven't changed.

372
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,859
Seon Ju.

373
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:05,730
What are you doing? Get up.

374
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:09,500
What are you doing to my daughter?

375
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,369
We didn't do anything.

376
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,540
She came to beg,
and we're letting her do what she wants.

377
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,339
Is that all you can say?

378
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,940
What's wrong with you?

379
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,710
Aren't you here to plead?

380
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,649
I wonder. She should be on her knees too
if she was in her right mind.

381
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,190
Let's go home.

382
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,260
They won't help us out
no matter what we do.

383
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:35,190
Humans speak with words.

384
00:23:35,629 --> 00:23:38,500
- We're leaving.
- It was just what we wanted.

385
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,930
If you got the message,
don't come here again.

386
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:45,669
Fine.

387
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:47,839
I hope we never meet again.

388
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,079
You ungrateful thing.

389
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,680
Is this how you return a favor?

390
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,649
Let's go.

391
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,550
Mom, wait.

392
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:04,859
They ruined my lovely day.

393
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,609
Mom.

394
00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:24,139
Why did you drag me out like that?

395
00:24:24,139 --> 00:24:25,609
Where's your pride?

396
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,250
Why were you there on your knees?

397
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:29,649
What about you?

398
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,119
What were you doing there?

399
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:36,819
Weren't you there
hoping to negotiate something?

400
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:45,030
I don't care now. Let's go home.

401
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:48,530
Let's talk about what we can do.

402
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:51,440
Whatever we decide to do...

403
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,470
will be way better
than pleading with them.

404
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:00,079
Let's talk upstairs.

405
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,909
That's what a home...

406
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,149
and a family is for.

407
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,040
Oh, my gosh.

408
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:29,369
What are you doing, Tae Ri?

409
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,180
Looking at houses.

410
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:34,280
I like looking at the three bears' house.

411
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,780
Are you going to be
an architect like your dad?

412
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:44,960
Hey, this is a pretty house.

413
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:46,619
- Dad.
- Yes?

414
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,329
Can you buy this one?

415
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:51,329
I can.

416
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,270
I've been working hard and saving up.

417
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,069
Then...

418
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,639
What about this one?

419
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:01,869
Which one?

420
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,940
This is a bit expensive.

421
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:07,550
I don't want such a large house.

422
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,220
It's not because I can't afford it.

423
00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:12,950
You know,

424
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,490
a small, cozy house?

425
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,290
I'd like a house
connected to a store space...

426
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,129
where we can grow flowers outside
and I can work close to home.

427
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,960
- Shall we see the other post?
- This one?

428
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,369
How about this?

429
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,369
- Something like this?
- I like it.

430
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:31,639
I see.

431
00:26:32,639 --> 00:26:34,010
This is nice too.

432
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,569
- It is, right?
- Yes.

433
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,710
(Han Hair Line)

434
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:43,280
Is everyone here?

435
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,050
- Yes.
- Yes.

436
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,119
This house...

437
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:49,950
Let's sell it.

438
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,960
- What?
- What?

439
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,389
Are you all deaf?

440
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,790
We'll sell the house.

441
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,159
Mom.

442
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,129
You wanted a discussion.

443
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,899
This isn't a discussion.
It's a notification.

444
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,700
Mom. So...

445
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,899
I thought about it some more.

446
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,010
I think I was out of my mind.

447
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,169
How much can we get?

448
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,339
Did you ask around?

449
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:11,409
Mom.

450
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,409
Will you really sell the house?

451
00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:16,180
Will it sell if we put it up?

452
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,119
The real estate agent
on the main road said...

453
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:24,960
some people asked for houses like ours.

454
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,190
Doesn't that mean we have good prospects?

455
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,159
What if we sell...

456
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:31,359
and the prices here soar?

457
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,030
They won't. House prices have peaked.

458
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,700
Especially in this neighborhood.

459
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:40,339
My gut says prices will fall from now on.

460
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:43,540
Still, we can't sell the house.

461
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,909
You keep quiet.

462
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,379
Mom. You made the right call.

463
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,879
This is our only option.

464
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:53,819
Yes.

465
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,220
What do you think?

466
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,089
Do you agree?

467
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,790
You're in the interior business,
and that's tied to the property market.

468
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,559
Well...

469
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,930
It does look like house prices
have peaked and are going down.

470
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,500
People are having fewer kids now,

471
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:15,909
so the population is dwindling,

472
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,980
and houses will continue to be built.

473
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,879
Right.

474
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:23,250
Seon Ju has a point.

475
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,050
How much can we get?

476
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,790
He said he'd get us 380,000 dollars.

477
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:30,859
I see.

478
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,359
Call the real estate agent...

479
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:36,930
to put up the house tomorrow.

480
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,440
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

481
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,419
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

482
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:04,819
He asked for a divorce?

483
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:06,089
Let's see who he's seeing.

484
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,389
Is your husband
having an affair or something?

485
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,559
I'm sick of this situation.

486
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,700
Sort it out as soon as possible.

487
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,770
Did you invite Mr. Jeon to dinner?

488
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:15,800
Treat him like an ordinary guest.

489
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,240
Is this the room you share with Mr. Kim?

490
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,639
Does it feel strange?

491
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,470
Are you sure we're pretending
to have no problems?

492
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,210
