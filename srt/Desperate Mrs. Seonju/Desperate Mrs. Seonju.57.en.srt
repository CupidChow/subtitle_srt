1
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,340
I'm getting married.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,009
Mom. Auntie Mi Ju is going to get married.

3
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:19,010
With whom? When?

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,149
You don't mean to say right now,

5
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:24,750
but that you'll get married someday
with some guy, right?

6
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:27,759
No. I want to get married right away.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,759
Did you borrow money from someone...

8
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,930
and agree to get married instead?

9
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:33,230
No.

10
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:35,829
You left home to work.

11
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,169
Why are you suddenly getting married?

12
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:40,939
Did you get in trouble with someone?

13
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:44,609
No. They said it wasn't trouble.

14
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,580
Talk to us, then.

15
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,379
You must've found a guy
if you want to get married.

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,080
Who is it?

17
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,580
Jeong Woo Sang.

18
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,849
What? Who's Jeong Woo Sang?

19
00:00:57,249 --> 00:00:59,859
Yes. Who's Jeong Woo Sang?

20
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,389
It can't be the actor Jeong Woo Sang.

21
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:04,090
It is the actor Jeong Woo Sang.

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,359
"I Lost My Memory but I Want Revenge."

23
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,929
He's the male lead.

24
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:13,069
My gosh.

25
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,370
Are you talking about...

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,510
an imaginary wedding you do on your own?

27
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,109
No.

28
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:24,980
Then did a lookalike seduce you saying...

29
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:26,620
he was Jeong Woo Sang...

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,650
No.

31
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,090
The woman in the news
he was at the hotel with.

32
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,490
It was me.

33
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,130
What?

34
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,359
Wait.

35
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,200
(Top Star J with Mysterious Woman)

36
00:01:42,529 --> 00:01:43,529
No way.

37
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,299
Why would Jeong Woo Sang
the actor date you?

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,769
Hey. Is Jeong Woo Sang famous?

39
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:52,409
He's really famous.

40
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,109
Auntie. Did you party with him all night?

41
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:59,919
Why didn't you invite us?

42
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:01,549
Let me see your phone.

43
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,189
(Top Star J with Mysterious Woman)

44
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:05,219
What is this?

45
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,290
Is it you in this embarrassing state?

46
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:09,389
You two, go to your rooms.

47
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,659
Dong Won. Take Ji Hyun to Tae Ri's.

48
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:12,930
I'm not finished eating yet.

49
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,100
Take this upstairs with you.

50
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,469
Go now!

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,399
Let's eat.

52
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,070
Do you think...

53
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:26,179
we're missing a main dish?

54
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:27,679
No. It's okay.

55
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:28,679
Is it?

56
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,950
Who is it?

57
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,480
It's Dong Won and Ji Hyun.

58
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:33,919
It's unlocked. Come in.

59
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,619
Hey. What's this?

60
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,519
It's kimchi jjigae.

61
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,030
We were to bring it up here.

62
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,790
It looks delicious.

63
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,130
But it's too much.

64
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,570
Can we eat with you, then?

65
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,470
You haven't eaten?

66
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:54,769
Okay, then. We can share the jjigae.

67
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:56,109
- Sit down.
- Okay.

68
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,540
What?

69
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,910
So you want us two...

70
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,149
to find someone
to pretend to be our husbands...

71
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,549
and bring them to the wedding
and sit with us as if we're family?

72
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:10,750
What are you thinking?

73
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,119
I can't tell her now
that everything was a lie.

74
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:17,329
Because you don't want to become a liar,
you want to turn...

75
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,459
our whole family into frauds?

76
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,429
Don't think of it as fraud.

77
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,070
Call it a sweet real-life play...

78
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,470
we're putting on to put Ms. Oh at ease.

79
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,540
Hey!

80
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:32,810
How can you say that?

81
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:36,149
If the truth comes out later on,
we'll end up in handcuffs.

82
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,850
Do you want to get locked up again?

83
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,450
That would happen if I did this
to dupe my future husband.

84
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,119
But this was Woo Sang's idea.

85
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:44,820
I only added some details.

86
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,320
Do you want to go to such lengths
just to get married?

87
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:49,589
Yes. Totally.

88
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:53,459
Why did you...

89
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,070
come upstairs with the whole pot
instead of eating downstairs?

90
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,130
We got thrown out mid-meal.

91
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,869
Why?

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,239
Our youngest auntie said
she'd get married.

93
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:07,579
Why would you get thrown out
if she wants to get married?

94
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,750
I don't know. She's in trouble.

95
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:12,679
I see.

96
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,919
Okay. Let's all eat.

97
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,350
To be honest,

98
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,429
neither of you was a great deal of help.

99
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,930
Can't you do this for me?

100
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,500
Let's be frank.
None of us turned out great.

101
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,670
I want to marry well at least
and live happily.

102
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:36,510
I'll spoil Mom since you can't.

103
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,240
Neither of you
have the time or money to do so.

104
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,979
You have a way of
worsening your punishment.

105
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,849
Marrying well and being happy.

106
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:49,750
Do you think you'll get that
by marrying Jeong Woo Sung?

107
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,990
It's Jeong Woo Sang, not Jeong Woo Sung.

108
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,389
It's the same thing.

109
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:56,430
It's not the same thing.
Woo Sang is way more handsome.

110
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,260
I'll marry him and live happily.

111
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,729
I really don't want to end up
like either of you.

112
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:08,039
- What did you say?
- Can you not hit me?

113
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,740
You deserve a beating.

114
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,240
You evil witch.

115
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,839
You don't need to bring a guy.

116
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:14,880
Just tell people...

117
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,409
Dad is abroad and living just fine.

118
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:20,579
To be honest,

119
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,589
if you three were to
sit around a table at the wedding,

120
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:26,320
it would be embarrassing.

121
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,860
You can't just say what you want.

122
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,889
- Mom.
- Mom, don't.

123
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:33,029
Must you hurt us so deeply?

124
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,099
How happy do you think you'll be...

125
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:37,599
if you get married like this?

126
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:39,399
Let go of me.

127
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,240
Forget it, you brat.

128
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,209
You evil thing. Come here.

129
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,909
You're the worst I've ever seen.

130
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,139
Get back here.

131
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,579
My goodness.

132
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,589
Hey. Let's talk.

133
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:05,829
Since Mom is here, let's go out...

134
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,500
You're all out here?

135
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,469
I heard you're getting married.
Congratulations.

136
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,310
Are you going somewhere, Mr. Kim?

137
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,250
The kids are feeling restless,

138
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,320
so we'll walk around the block.

139
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:31,050
Would it be okay
for us to have a meeting...

140
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:33,260
at your place upstairs?

141
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:37,659
- What?
- For a bit while you're out.

142
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,630
Jin Ju.

143
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,459
Do you mind?

144
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:48,769
We can't fight freely because Mom is home.

145
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,310
And we're too embarrassed to go to a cafe.

146
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,139
Okay, then. Go ahead.

147
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,950
Behind me, you can see the work
done by average people.

148
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:00,880
It's quite easy...

149
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,589
Did something good happen?
Why are you laughing?

150
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:07,420
I should do as Mom says
when it comes to dating.

151
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,360
How did you feel when Mom
showed up at your doorstep?

152
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,529
Don't be silly.

153
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:19,599
Do you know why my eyesight is so poor?

154
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,940
It's because I was struck
by your mom's dazzling beauty.

155
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,409
What? That's so corny.

156
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:28,479
I can't believe you said that, honey.

157
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,409
I'm home.

158
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,519
You're late.

159
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,019
Did you have dinner?

160
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,420
Yes. I'll go upstairs.

161
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:40,360
Why is she in a bad mood?

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,930
I'm not used to you being like this.

163
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:53,599
Why do you suddenly...

164
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,969
care so much about Seon Ju and I?

165
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,570
- What?
- Are you worried our tracks will cross?

166
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,779
Why would you worry?

167
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,940
It's unbelievable.

168
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,149
He could never talk back at me,
so how could he and Seon Ju...

169
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,149
Who is it?

170
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,219
Are you in a bad mood?

171
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:14,959
Why are you so on edge?

172
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,659
How could I be in a good mood?

173
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,899
So Woo and Seon Ju
are taking turns aggravating me.

174
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,700
Those two...

175
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,139
I'm sick of saying this,

176
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,469
but Mom went through a lot
to raise us three.

177
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,579
We feel this bad about it.

178
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,479
How do you think Mom feels?

179
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,820
How could you ask us to put on a show?

180
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,119
Do you want to get married that badly?

181
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,790
Why? Are you possessed by a ghost
that died a virgin?

182
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,690
I used to wonder...

183
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,160
if I was adopted or something.

184
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,229
What's she on about?

185
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Mi Ju.

186
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:01,170
Think about it.

187
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,570
If you were adopted, would we have...

188
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,070
kept you around
after all the trouble you caused?

189
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,280
Mom would've kicked you out long ago.

190
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:11,450
Exactly.

191
00:09:11,609 --> 00:09:14,650
Would she have scolded us three
exactly the same?

192
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,219
When you were the troublemaker?

193
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:17,950
We got chewed out way more.

194
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,060
That's what I used to think. At one time.

195
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,930
You two were smart
and got all the attention.

196
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,729
No one cared what I did.

197
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,900
But recently I learned
what it was like to be loved.

198
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:33,900
It was like I was special to someone.

199
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:36,400
Don't we love you?

200
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,940
You didn't. Not much anyway.

201
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,239
Especially you, Jin Ju.

202
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,950
Seon Ju at least brought me gimbap
when I was locked up.

203
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,849
It was the worst time in my life
and you didn't even visit.

204
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:55,190
Pay for all the food I cooked for you.

205
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:58,530
Forget that. Let's hear the truth.

206
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,300
Does Jeong Woo Sang love you lots?

207
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,729
Yes. And he's good-looking.

208
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,540
Do good looks put food on the table?

209
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,869
Maybe not,

210
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,570
but it makes it easier to digest food.

211
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,540
You worry about digestion?

212
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,509
No, but...

213
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:17,479
I really want to marry him.

214
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:20,079
If you want to marry him,
pull off the fraud on your own.

215
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,849
Why drag us all into it?

216
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:25,719
If you're that ashamed of us,
none of us will be there.

217
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,920
I'd have done it on my own if I could.

218
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,459
Ms. Oh says the only thing she cares about
is that I'm from a normal, happy family.

219
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:36,259
How can I appear to be normal and happy
if none of you are there?

220
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:39,499
Mi Ju. Enough with the nonsense.

221
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,200
Come clean to her right now.

222
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:44,609
If she objects, break things off.

223
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:48,209
Or find people
to pretend to be your sisters...

224
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:50,150
and seat a whole family of fakes!

225
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,020
Are you...

226
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,859
Yes.

227
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:06,390
I'm pregnant.

228
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:09,700
Are you sure?

229
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,800
I used a pregnancy test
and it was positive.

230
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,339
- Oh, save me.
- I used two and...

231
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,339
Get up, Seon Ju.

232
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,209
I need a drink.

233
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,849
- My gosh.
- Me too.

234
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,030
Hi. Is the meeting over?

235
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,430
Dong Won. Don't wait up for us.

236
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,400
You too, Ji Hyun.

237
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,200
- Watch your step.
- Take the snacks.

238
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,700
Ji Hyun, you too.

239
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,509
See you.

240
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:55,310
Nam Jin. Join me for a drink.

241
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:56,680
I'm tired.

242
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,849
Show some appreciation for my effort.

243
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:00,979
Goodness.

244
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:05,619
You're stressed out, aren't you?

245
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,290
Drink up.

246
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,999
Sang Ah is not divorced yet,

247
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,469
and Seon Ju is up in your face at work.

248
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:19,329
And Sang Ah's not-yet-ex.

249
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:22,369
Her future ex lives upstairs from Seon Ju,

250
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:23,739
and they seem to be having fun.

251
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,709
That's what you're stressed about.

252
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,609
- No.
- Nam Jin.

253
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,550
Shall I buy a talisman
that'll get rid of Sang Ah's husband?

254
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,320
Don't do that.

255
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,050
Good night.

256
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Goodness.

257
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,890
There's no way it's easy dating a woman
who's not yet divorced.

258
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:47,660
I should meet her husband soon.

259
00:12:58,609 --> 00:12:59,709
The witch.

260
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:02,739
What should we do with her?

261
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,410
What can we do?

262
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:07,820
As a boy's mom and a future mom-in-law,

263
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:10,550
I can't take part in
a fraudulent marriage.

264
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:13,820
That's right.
I'm a girl's mom and I feel the same.

265
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,560
How could she?

266
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,890
Do you remember what she said?

267
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:22,160
She said we were no help to her.

268
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,670
She doesn't want to be like us.

269
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,869
My own sister said that to my face.

270
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,800
I'm still in shock.

271
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,509
Why would you be so shocked?

272
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,810
To be honest, like she said,

273
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,709
we don't have anything
to show for ourselves.

274
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,349
Why don't we?

275
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,609
You graduated from
a prestigious university.

276
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:40,719
So what if I did?

277
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:42,979
Ever heard of the term
"intellectual loser?"

278
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,060
You might be a loser,
but at least you're an intellectual one.

279
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,890
And I have a decent job now.

280
00:13:51,859 --> 00:13:53,430
We can be proud of ourselves.

281
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,430
Your decent job.

282
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,170
Your ex's mistress' dad's company?

283
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,369
Darn it.

284
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,700
Goodness.

285
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,410
- My glass is empty.
- My gosh.

286
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:07,509
Here you are.

287
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:10,450
Why are you here?

288
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,079
I just came looking. Can I join you?

289
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:14,879
- Yes, take a seat.
- Thanks.

290
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,050
When I saw you...

291
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:20,390
leave home earlier,

292
00:14:21,219 --> 00:14:23,190
I noticed you looked upset.

293
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,160
Is something wrong?

294
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,400
Mr. Kim.

295
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,369
Could you be honest about something?

296
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,640
- What?
- Objectively speaking,

297
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,839
are we an embarrassment?

298
00:14:38,469 --> 00:14:40,839
- What?
- If we happened to be...

299
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,540
your own family,

300
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,709
would you be ashamed to be seen with us?

301
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:49,020
- Why would you say that?
- Jin Ju.

302
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,520
Of course not.

303
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,089
Apparently, that's us.

304
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:56,719
I should've had a husband
or done something with my life.

305
00:14:56,989 --> 00:14:58,359
It's neither.

306
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:05,430
What does she mean?

307
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,070
She asked you to bring
fake husbands to the wedding?

308
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:51,709
I'm so flabbergasted
that I can't even get drunk.

309
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,920
How great is the guy
that she'd demand that?

310
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,550
I don't know.

311
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,489
What should we do with her?

312
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,530
We can't blame just her.

313
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,190
She said it was the guy's idea.

314
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:09,430
The fool who wants to hoodwink his mom...

315
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:13,229
and the girl who went along with it
and asked her sisters to lie.

316
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,200
They're perfect for each other.

317
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,780
But...

318
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,680
since she's pregnant,

319
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,420
you might have to do as she asks.

320
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,890
But I also think you shouldn't
take part in something like that.

321
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,290
Are you playing a neutral politician?

322
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:39,489
What?

323
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,530
No. What I mean is...

324
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:07,390
Jeon Ji Heon, Kim Tae Hwi, Son Ae Jin.
Just you wait.

325
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,629
Pi Mi Ju will be your equal one day.

326
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,700
What are you grinning about?

327
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:17,200
- What?
- Are you that pleased?

328
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,729
No.

329
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:21,469
As if you're not pleased.

330
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:24,170
This is why sons are useless.

331
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:26,870
Pretend you're gaining a daughter.

332
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,279
I might need you to move out.

333
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,580
How am I to watch this
for the rest of my life?

334
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,680
Darn you.

335
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,420
I know you don't mean that.

336
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,519
You're such an idiot.

337
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,459
What are you two doing?

338
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,989
Tae Sang. Put him in his place.

339
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,029
Sit down.

340
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,700
Goodness.

341
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,140
Woo Sang.

342
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,680
I'm a bit concerned.

343
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:06,150
This is from a guy who was married before.

344
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,620
Are you sure about this?

345
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,249
What do you mean?

346
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,319
You saw Mi Ju too. She's a great girl.

347
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,390
Even so.

348
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:21,330
They say you should spend four seasons
with someone before tying the knot.

349
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,130
Aren't you rushing into it?

350
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,670
I'm grateful for the advice,

351
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:27,799
but let me live my own life.

352
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
Yes.

353
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:44,150
I can barely fend for myself.

354
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:57,069
Mom will freak out...

355
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,999
if she hears Mi Ju is pregnant.

356
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:00,469
Yes.

357
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:02,370
Let's think about...

358
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,610
how we should break the news to her.

359
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:10,080
Until then, let's keep it to ourselves.

360
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,380
Yes.

361
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:14,180
Wait out here. I'll get Tae Ri for you.

362
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,219
Thanks.

363
00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:16,650
Good night, then.

364
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,420
Wait.

365
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,989
Forget being a neutral politician.

366
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:24,390
Let's think about what's right.

367
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,630
Don't you think
your mother's solution is right?

368
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,529
What? You think we should cause a scene?

369
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:33,029
No, not like that.

370
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,569
Meet the guy's family and tell the truth.

371
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:38,910
"I'm sorry about the lie,"

372
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,840
"but they're pregnant and in love.
Let's marry them off."

373
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:45,979
Shouldn't you persuade her?

374
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,789
- Maybe.
- If you all lie and they get married,

375
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:54,059
it would be infuriating for them.

376
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,729
- Hi.
- Dad. I'm sleepy.

377
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,229
Come here, Tae Ri.

378
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,200
Let's go to bed.

379
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,640
- Go on inside.
- You too.

380
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,969
Say goodbye.

381
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:11,309
Let's go.

382
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:32,430
I was kind enough to accept you.

383
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,529
No one from your family
will object or complain, will they?

384
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:37,670
- Of course not.
- They're not like that.

385
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:10,900
You.

386
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:13,330
Do you really love him?

387
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:16,600
Forget the want to marry well.

388
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:19,840
Do you really like him?

389
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:21,739
Yes.

390
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:24,549
Does he like you too?

391
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,549
I think so.

392
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,080
When did you fall for him?

393
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:34,660
That's a bit fuzzy.

394
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:37,660
It's Korean beef. Let's go.

395
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:38,729
Shall I?

396
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,700
Blackmailer.

397
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
What about you?

398
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:44,170
- Do you want in?
- What?

399
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,700
It's Korean beef. Let's go.

400
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,499
Was it since then?

401
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:53,110
Hey. That must've been about the beef.

402
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:55,009
Wasn't that why you got excited?

403
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:56,209
No.

404
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,610
He asked me to share his packed lunch...

405
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:02,650
which he'd never done with Jin Chu Ah.

406
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:04,190
He gave me a sausage too.

407
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,120
Guys don't share with just anyone, right?

408
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,519
Why did you fall for him
when it involved food?

409
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:13,330
Not all the time.
It wasn't just about food.

410
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:15,660
He's really...

411
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,630
quite cool.

412
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,239
Oh, my gosh.

413
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,850
The darn thing.

414
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,080
Is Jeong Woo Sang that great
that we must put on a show?

415
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,150
I never got to see
if he was worthy to be my son-in-law.

416
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,519
If I don't like him,
I might lie in bed and object.

417
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,229
Where are you going? Go to sleep.

418
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,729
But...

419
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,569
having and raising a kid
is a huge undertaking.

420
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,140
It's like having to juggle
a whole other life.

421
00:23:00,069 --> 00:23:02,979
You'll have so many things to worry about.

422
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:04,049
What did you just say?

423
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,450
Mom.

424
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,450
"Having and raising a kid?"
What was that about?

425
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,719
Mom.

426
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,190
Are you pregnant?

427
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,749
Are you pregnant?

428
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,559
Mom.

429
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:19,430
Oh, no...

430
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,969
Tell me what happened.

431
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
Yes.

432
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,549
I'm pregnant.

433
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:40,549
What?

434
00:23:41,749 --> 00:23:44,350
Then the nasty dream I had...

435
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,489
with the squawking crow...

436
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:50,930
was a conception dream for you?

437
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:52,130
I guess?

438
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:55,330
Mom. Jin Ju, Seon Ju.

439
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,469
She said she'd accept me
if I were from a normal family.

440
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,799
Let's do what we can.

441
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,610
If we must break it off,

442
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,979
instead of telling the truth to do that,

443
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,950
let's use the dowry or something
as an excuse instead.

444
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,420
Are you serious?

445
00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:18,390
Lost of couples break up over that
and that's not embarrassing at all.

446
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:21,459
But I don't want to break things off
by becoming a fraud.

447
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,360
It's my first and last request.

448
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,390
Did I ever ask for something
this desperately?

449
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,860
Mom.

450
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,870
Let's marry her off.

451
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,930
What?

452
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:35,640
Marry her off.

453
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:39,009
You want to commit fraud with her?

454
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,340
If you like Jeong Woo Sang that much,
marry him.

455
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,940
You can marry him, but that play...

456
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,049
Do it.

457
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,249
That's most important.
It's that or I can't marry him.

458
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:49,549
Why not?

459
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:52,420
Explain our situation to his mom.

460
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,259
Tell her that though
we couldn't stay married,

461
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:56,819
we're not bad people and...

462
00:24:56,819 --> 00:24:58,759
How can I explain that?

463
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:01,299
The more I try,
the worse she'll think of me.

464
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,900
That's like making excuses...

465
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:05,930
about all the lies I told.

466
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:09,269
How long do you think you'll last
if you marry on lies?

467
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,809
Woo Sang said it would be fine.

468
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,610
Won't it be okay if we stay apart
for a while after the wedding?

469
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,279
Then maybe she won't find out.

470
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,920
What?

471
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,289
I know I can't
get married like this, but...

472
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,219
I really...

473
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,789
like him a lot.

474
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:42,700
That's it.

475
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:45,110
We're done.

476
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,749
I wonder
if the downstairs people are okay.

477
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,049
Did they fight again?

478
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,850
No, they didn't fight.

479
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,549
No. They always fight.

480
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,620
But they always make up.

481
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,330
You're right. It looks like
they're always fighting,

482
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,090
but then they work together. Don't they?

483
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,430
Yes.

484
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,569
Okay. Take part in the play.

485
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,999
Mom.

486
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:18,340
Do that just to marry her off.

487
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:20,209
She said she'd be happy.

488
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:22,610
Mom. Even if it's for her,

489
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,680
you want to play along too?

490
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,180
I don't like it either.

491
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,319
But what can we do? She's pregnant.

492
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,090
She likes the guy.

493
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,590
Do you want to ruin her life too?

494
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,860
Do you really want us
to find a fake husband?

495
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,830
Get some random guy
to sit with you for two hours.

496
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,759
Do it and save your sister's life.

497
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:44,769
Mom.

498
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,969
Yes.

499
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,870
I get how you feel.

500
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:53,340
She's pregnant and pleading
and tugging at your heartstrings.

501
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,239
You want to give in to her
because you're her mom.

502
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,420
But still, since you're her mom,

503
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:07,719
shouldn't you tell her not to do this?

504
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:10,789
Do you think I'm giving in...

505
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,860
because I don't have a conscience?

506
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,660
I don't want to do this either.

507
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:19,229
But I want at least one of my girls...

508
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,700
to be happily married.

509
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:24,410
Don't you think...

510
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:29,080
one of us four deserves to have
a happy family with a husband?

511
00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:32,580
Mom, even so. This isn't something...

512
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:36,120
that'll go away if we somehow
get through the wedding.

513
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,150
Yes.

514
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:40,850
It might be a landmine now,
but it could become nuclear later.

515
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,319
You're a widow and you're divorced.

516
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:46,259
Do you want her to be a single mom?

517
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,330
Three of us four are already single.
If she were to end up a single mom,

518
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:51,769
then I...

519
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,200
I really don't think...

520
00:27:55,269 --> 00:28:00,069
I'll be able to live anymore.

521
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:10,779
Mom.

522
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:13,819
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

523
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:31,840
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

524
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,340
Where am I to suddenly find a husband?

525
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,779
- Can you do a part-time job?
- A part-time job?

526
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,950
Do you know you've changed a bit?

527
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:41,650
You left Seon Ju. Do you regret it?

528
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,620
Finalize your divorce first.

529
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,120
What's wrong with you?
You're so embarrassing.

530
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,350
I'm embarrassing?

531
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,620
You're divorced.

532
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,690
What?

533
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,559
