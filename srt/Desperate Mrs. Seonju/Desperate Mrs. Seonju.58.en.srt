00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,360
(Episode 58)

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,129
Okay. Take part in the play.

3
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:15,599
Mom.

4
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,599
Do that just to marry her off.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,630
She said she'd be happy.

6
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,029
Mom. We can't do that.

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,400
You two.

8
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:27,140
You chose your spouses carefully
and look at how that turned out.

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,239
Who knows marrying her off like this
might work out in the end?

10
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,649
It's what she wants. Do as she asks!

11
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:38,519
Mom. You're not saying that
because you're angry, are you?

12
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:41,789
Did you two...

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,820
end up like this because
I didn't really like your husbands?

14
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:48,590
I have that guilt and regret.

15
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:52,299
It's her wish.

16
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,770
If we must marry her off,

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,039
let's do as she asks
and see how it turns out.

18
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,810
Mom.

19
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:04,409
Thank you.

20
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:08,049
Jin Ju, Seon Ju. I'm sorry.

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,950
If you help me out this once,

22
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:16,659
I'll become someone you're proud of...

23
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,790
and live well and happily.

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,859
I promise.

25
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:00,900
Can I sleep here?

26
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,670
If you want.

27
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:06,670
How did we end up like this?

28
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,640
It's like I got in my sister's way.

29
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,879
You came here to sleep, so go to sleep.

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,510
Where am I to suddenly find a husband?

31
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,879
Should I ask online
if anyone has a spare husband?

32
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,189
I won't find someone.

33
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:23,319
Why should I
when I barely just got rid of my ex?

34
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,710
Live happily.

35
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:43,539
You were so small...

36
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,909
when you were little.

37
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,819
When did you grow up, get pregnant,

38
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,120
and say you want to marry?

39
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,319
I'll be...

40
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,090
the happiest of us three girls...

41
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,300
and spoil you enough for everyone.

42
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay.

43
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,000
Now go to sleep.

44
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,050
(Han Hair Line)

45
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,580
Here.

46
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,250
It's doenjang jjigae.

47
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:29,360
I made it this morning.

48
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,389
Being a mom made you an early riser.

49
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,759
Auntie Mi Ju is a mom?

50
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:36,830
Wait, no.

51
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:39,099
She will be once she gets married.

52
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,330
Auntie Mi Ju is going to get married?

53
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,599
Yes. Lucky you will soon have
a handsome uncle.

54
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,840
How much money will we need?

55
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:52,909
We should prepare something.

56
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,419
How much do we have left after paying
the deposit for the long-term lease?

57
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,780
Will that be enough?

58
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:59,650
It won't cost us much.

59
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,990
It will cost a bit.

60
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,719
You're marrying Jeong Woo Sang.

61
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,229
Even if we can only pay for
a couple of things,

62
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:07,889
it'll have to be on his level.

63
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,830
We have everything already.

64
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,159
Everything we need, including furniture.

65
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,729
All that's left are the studio photos,

66
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:16,539
wedding dress, and makeup.

67
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:18,599
Woo Sang's manager will take the photos.

68
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:22,069
Mom and I can handle the hair and makeup.

69
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,110
And I'll buy the dress online.

70
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,750
There are lots of cheap options.

71
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:30,379
Still, it's your first-ever wedding.

72
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:32,420
Should it be done as if it's a secret?

73
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,120
What do you mean by "first wedding?"

74
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:35,959
How dare you?

75
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,160
Bring the guy over before the wedding.

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,990
I should meet him at least once.

77
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,230
Okay.

78
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:47,970
Don't be too mean to him
when you meet him.

79
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:50,170
You're covering for him already?

80
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,899
It's hard to stand already.

81
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:54,339
Don't you be snarky when he visits.

82
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,189
(Jin Architecture)

83
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:09,860
How did it play out yesterday?

84
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,060
Did your sister survive
your mother's wrath?

85
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:17,800
Yes. We decided to let her get married.

86
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,600
She's pregnant and we can't ignore that.

87
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,699
Then what about...

88
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,839
the play?

89
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,970
Mom said...

90
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:31,410
we should do it.

91
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:32,709
My gosh.

92
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,709
Then...

93
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,519
do you need a husband?

94
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,649
No.

95
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:41,889
Don't you joke about it too.

96
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,060
Darn it.

97
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,839
If you two are done, can you leave?

98
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,240
I'd like some coffee too.

99
00:05:58,069 --> 00:05:59,069
Sure.

100
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,110
- Shall we?
- Yes.

101
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,610
- Do you feel butterflies?
- What?

102
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,480
Just because it's easier...

103
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,649
to get divorced these days,

104
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:13,720
do you think it's a hip trend?

105
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:15,490
You're just a divorcee.

106
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,720
Are you out of your mind?

107
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,730
I didn't divorce some stranger.
I divorced you.

108
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,360
Who are you mocking?

109
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,699
My gosh.

110
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,040
Darn it.

111
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,410
Don't.

112
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,350
Yes. You divorced me,

113
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,550
but cavorting with Mr. Kim in my presence?

114
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,149
That's not right.

115
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,189
What are you saying I did?

116
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:49,720
Are you...

117
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,759
jealous of us?

118
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,129
My gosh. Why would I be jealous?

119
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:56,060
Then why are you like this?

120
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,430
Ignore me. That's what you used to do.

121
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:00,970
Why are you suddenly so bothered?

122
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,970
You fought hard to divorce me.
Enjoy your new life.

123
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,810
Your online profile
clearly shows you're single.

124
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,939
Did you look it up?

125
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:14,079
You're in our company's group chat.

126
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,420
How can I not see what's in my face?

127
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,720
Still, you'd only notice if you cared.

128
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:27,889
(Ex-husband)

129
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,089
What are you doing?

130
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,029
I wanted to see what you'd saved me as.

131
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,529
It's not a curse word...

132
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:37,269
and you didn't block me.

133
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,839
Are you out of your mind?

134
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,810
I really don't want to follow him.

135
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,439
If you were here,

136
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,310
could we have gotten away with
having to find one less fake husband?

137
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,480
- Woo Sang.
- How did it go?

138
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:26,889
We can set a date.

139
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,420
Mom said we can do the play.

140
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:30,019
Really?

141
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,819
That's great. I was worried.

142
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,689
The wedding date...

143
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:37,899
Mom told us to hurry
before she changed her mind.

144
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,060
Let's hurry.

145
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,830
I don't know when my mom
will change her mind too.

146
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,340
Then let's get it done within the month.

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,039
How about the last day?

148
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,870
It's a weekend.

149
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,940
Sounds good.

150
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:53,080
One more thing. My mom said...

151
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,509
she wanted you to visit.

152
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,049
- She wants me to visit?
- That it would be weird...

153
00:08:58,049 --> 00:08:59,789
to never meet once before the wedding.

154
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,850
Okay. I'll check my schedule
and get back to you.

155
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,889
Okay.

156
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,190
"Everyone."

157
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:10,259
(Jungang Real Estate Agency)

158
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,070
We set a date for the wedding.

159
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,009
It was a lot of work
and stress to get here,

160
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,840
but do congratulate me.

161
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,509
Look at her.

162
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:28,750
She made us all feel horrible
and now she's excited.

163
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,259
- Hi.
- Hey.

164
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,690
I told my chief exactly what you said...

165
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,100
and almost had to resign today.

166
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:44,259
What did you say?

167
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:46,529
"You fail to recognize
ideas that have potential."

168
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:49,539
"Can you continue to manage
the entertainment department?"

169
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:54,870
You said that to his face?
You have some guts.

170
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:59,549
Anyway, I could get fired soon,
so I'm your responsibility now.

171
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,149
Why are you my responsibility?

172
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,350
Hey. You said you were divorced, right?

173
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,620
What? Yes.

174
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,490
What do you do
on the last day of the month?

175
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:12,120
If you're free,
can you do a part-time job?

176
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,230
A part-time job?

177
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,200
What does that have to do
with me being divorced?

178
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,870
Do you need me to fill in for a date
with a matchmaking company?

179
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,399
No way.

180
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,970
Why would I participate in a scam
when I don't want to remarry?

181
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,340
That's for people with zero conscience.

182
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,809
What? Forget it, then.

183
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:33,279
Don't call me
unless you have business. Bye.

184
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:37,379
Why is she so annoyed?

185
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,320
- Jeong Tae Sang!
- Yes?

186
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,750
Sit down.

187
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,289
Okay.

188
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:46,889
Come closer.

189
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,029
- A bit more.
- Okay.

190
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:53,000
Yesterday,

191
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,200
I did some thinking
after hearing what you said.

192
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,870
I'm sorry, sir. I was...

193
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,639
No.

194
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,740
I'm not that close-minded.

195
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,179
I hear my juniors' ideas
with an open mind.

196
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,919
That's what I'm like.

197
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,450
Your idea...

198
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,320
- about divorced couples switching up.
- Yes.

199
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,389
It does have some issues with morality,

200
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:23,960
but it could appeal to the masses.

201
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:28,070
It's not at all like
your old boring ideas.

202
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,100
The gray area...

203
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,539
between provocative mass appeal
and morality.

204
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:37,840
- Yes.
- See if you can find a balance.

205
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:39,909
What?

206
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,720
Other networks air
all sorts of crazy stuff.

207
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,389
Why can't we?

208
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,659
Work on it.

209
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,230
- Can I really?
- Yes.

210
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,759
Thank you.

211
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,799
Mr. Jeong. We're green-lit for a new show?

212
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:04,799
Congratulations.

213
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,970
Am I the head writer?

214
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,379
I am, right?

215
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:13,179
I didn't mishear him, did I?

216
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:14,350
You didn't.

217
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,620
I told you it was a good idea.

218
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,360
Yes!

219
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,100
My gosh.

220
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,500
You look incredible when you're alone.

221
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:41,070
Why are you here?

222
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,940
I brought this in case you were hungry.

223
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,049
Can I visit you at home when I'm free?

224
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,580
Ms. Oh must be struggling
now that Mi Ju is gone.

225
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,259
Thanks for the concern,
but my mom is not struggling.

226
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:08,269
The heater in the next room isn't working.

227
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,399
Do you mind if we join you?

228
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,600
That's fine.

229
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:16,039
My gosh.

230
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:18,379
Aren't you the actress Oh Hye Ran?

231
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,580
Well, yes. Hello.

232
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,350
I'd heard lots of celebrities come here.

233
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,389
There's no way to know who they are...

234
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,250
since we're kept in separate rooms.

235
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:33,090
We miss out on the fun of gathering...

236
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,190
and chatting in neighborhood salons.

237
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:39,730
Well, I guess so.

238
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:42,669
I was going to get a refund,

239
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:45,370
but they begged me not to, so I came back,

240
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,470
and I got to meet you.

241
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,980
You're not that well-known anymore,

242
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,710
but it's nice to meet you.

243
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,210
What?

244
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,720
Hello?

245
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,620
The 30th?

246
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,889
I must check the wedding halls.

247
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,529
Okay. Bye.

248
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,929
Is someone getting married?

249
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:11,860
Your son? Jeong Woo Sang?

250
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,330
Gosh, no. The kid of a distant relative.

251
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:20,139
You look out for
your distant relatives too?

252
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,179
My son will get married soon as well.

253
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,879
How about we exchange information?

254
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,309
Give me your number.

255
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,120
No. I don't have information to share.

256
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,590
No, thank you.

257
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:37,059
It's hard to get a celebrity's number.

258
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,960
I'm from a pretty decent family too.

259
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,629
My son studied abroad, you see.

260
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,570
Is that so?

261
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,299
He'll marry a girl he met over there.

262
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:59,309
You'd be shocked to hear
whose daughter she is.

263
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:04,019
She's cold and unfriendly,
so I don't like her that much,

264
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:05,950
but they love each other.

265
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,389
I'll let them get married.

266
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:08,720
My goodness.

267
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,960
I see.

268
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,759
Come in.

269
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:22,669
Professor Albert sent some material.

270
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,700
Take a look.

271
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
(Ex-husband)

272
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,009
I wanted to see what you'd saved me as.

273
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,350
It's not a curse word...

274
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,110
and you didn't block me.

275
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:39,850
What?

276
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:44,190
Do you know you've changed a bit?

277
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:47,460
- How so?
- You asked me...

278
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,259
if I still had feelings for So Woo.

279
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,100
Aren't you the one
who still has feelings for Seon Ju?

280
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,529
What are you on about?

281
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:57,440
You left Seon Ju. Do you regret it?

282
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,769
My gosh.

283
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:03,409
I don't know why you're saying that,

284
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,039
but you're not in the position to.

285
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,110
Why not?

286
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:11,779
You were jealous
of Seon Ju and So Woo. Weren't you?

287
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,090
Weren't you the one who was jealous?

288
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,250
What the... Goodness.

289
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:20,429
Do you think I've forgotten...

290
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,029
because I haven't said anything?

291
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:26,159
You missed your court date
to finalize your divorce.

292
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,730
If you want to nitpick like this,

293
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,070
finalize your divorce first.

294
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,769
When's your next court date?

295
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:37,480
I don't know what happens
because I never missed mine,

296
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,210
but if you miss the next one,
don't you have to file the papers again?

297
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:48,450
Darn it.

298
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,159
I heard from HR that...

299
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,659
the announcement will be made tomorrow.

300
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,659
Really? At last.

301
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,730
Who do you think will get promoted?

302
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,559
Will it be me?

303
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,399
Shall we get back to work?

304
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,980
You mentioned...

305
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,210
an actor called Jeong Woo Sang.

306
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,819
Is he really a good match for Chu Ah?

307
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,190
- Why?
- He's in the news.

308
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,660
Did you read it too?

309
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,359
He's that big a star.

310
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,059
There wouldn't be a scandal
if he wasn't popular.

311
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm going to ask Chu Ah about it
when she comes home.

312
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,400
I'm home.

313
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:34,529
Hello.

314
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,500
You made chives japchae?

315
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,640
I need to lose weight.

316
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,309
Wash your hands first.

317
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,440
Did the shoot go well?

318
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,779
Yes.

319
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:45,740
That guy you like.

320
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:48,349
Is he really single?

321
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,950
Who's the girl from the hotel?

322
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,220
A crew member
who got fired after a few days.

323
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,420
You don't have to mind that.
Don't get the wrong idea about him.

324
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,930
Do you mean to say
smoke came out of a chimney...

325
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,730
when there was no fire?

326
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,759
Totally.

327
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:07,299
His agency even issued a statement.

328
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,829
Chu Ah must know better than anyone.

329
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,539
She sees him every day.

330
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,170
The press doesn't leave
people like Woo Sang alone.

331
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,210
That's how some rumors start.

332
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:19,609
That's right. And since...

333
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,109
the scandal died down,
Woo Sang has been nicer to me.

334
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,450
I asked if I could visit sometimes...

335
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,190
to keep Ms. Oh company.

336
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,220
He thanked me for my concern.

337
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,089
He didn't talk like that to me before.

338
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:34,690
- Really?
- Really.

339
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,460
You really do have to approach men
when they're at their weakest.

340
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,930
Wait and see. Within a month,

341
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,200
Woo Sang and I will be engaged.

342
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,569
Goodness.

343
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:14,529
Hey, it's me.

344
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:16,839
I have something to say.

345
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:19,470
Then shall we meet up now?

346
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,809
I'm going out.

347
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:28,809
Late in the evening?

348
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,180
Help with the dishes.

349
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:32,380
See you later.

350
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:34,450
Are you off on a date?

351
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,859
Would an engaged couple
just talk on the phone?

352
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:42,089
Even a top star
with a secret girlfriend...

353
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:44,130
would want to go on dates.

354
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,000
Don't you get cranky with her.

355
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,569
Darn it.

356
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,450
(Team Leader's Office, Jin Sang Ah)

357
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,619
You're getting off late.

358
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,920
I'll drive you home.

359
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:14,059
Take a taxi in the morning.

360
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:17,299
- Why?
- You don't like to drive at night.

361
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:22,700
You care that much about me
and you complained like that?

362
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,940
Come along.

363
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,940
Let's go.

364
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:34,049
Shall we?

365
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:42,119
When I was single,

366
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,619
she'd threatened to break my legs
if I went out at this time of night.

367
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:53,230
Jin Ju. Are you taking out the trash?

368
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes. You just got back?

369
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,140
Hey. Shall we have another drink?

370
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,309
- Again?
- Yes.

371
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,839
I'm craving a drink every day these days.

372
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,579
Let's go.

373
00:21:08,849 --> 00:21:09,849
Give me that.

374
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,160
I'd put up with a lot
from many people for being a widow,

375
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,329
but I never expected
my own family to look down on me.

376
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,240
Mi Ju is the troublemaker,
but Mom told me not to be snarky.

377
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,640
Exactly.

378
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,940
Where am I to find a husband?

379
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,140
Don't find one. Don't bother.

380
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,880
Mom told me to get someone.

381
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,980
What about the aftermath?

382
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,880
Mi Ju said her fiance would handle it.

383
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,650
There are people we know.
Let's go somewhere else.

384
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,119
Hey, detective. How are you?

385
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:54,630
Hello. How are you?

386
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,130
I see you had another long day
keeping us locals safe.

387
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,329
- Yes.
- Thank you.

388
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:02,430
You haven't been to
the police station in a while.

389
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,769
No.

390
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:07,369
It's really nice to see you
as an innocent member...

391
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:09,369
of the public.

392
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:12,680
Yes. It's good to see you too.

393
00:22:13,009 --> 00:22:14,210
Wait, detective.

394
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,279
What are you doing on the 30th?

395
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,720
Jin Ju.

396
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,950
My sister is getting married...

397
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,519
and I don't have a husband.

398
00:22:39,339 --> 00:22:43,210
That's why you need a fake husband.

399
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,839
Don't you protect and serve?

400
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:48,079
We're pretty close.

401
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,420
Jin Ju.

402
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,619
Yes. You're a regular at our station,

403
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:55,589
and we know all you've been through.

404
00:22:55,589 --> 00:22:58,089
I'd really love to help you.

405
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,859
But we're civil servants.

406
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:04,400
Yes. If we get caught doing that,
we could get in serious trouble.

407
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:06,359
Sorry.

408
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,869
It looks like you came to eat.
Eat and drink.

409
00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:10,970
No, we'll go somewhere else.

410
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,039
Don't drink too much. Go home soon.

411
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,109
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Bye.

412
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:16,140
Goodbye.

413
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:18,880
- Bye.
- Bye.

414
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:23,009
What's wrong with you?
You're so embarrassing.

415
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:25,779
You think I'm embarrassing?

416
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,750
Hey. You can't say that to me.

417
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,789
That's not what I mean.

418
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:34,329
Let's tell Mom we can't do it.

419
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:37,299
Let's say our husbands
are on business trips.

420
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,430
I'm hurt and upset.

421
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:43,740
Why are you hurt and upset?

422
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,299
You don't know anything.

423
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,769
- You're divorced.
- So what?

424
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:49,640
You got rid of a living husband.

425
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,079
Mine is dead.

426
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,380
Do you know what death is?

427
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,250
It's something you can't take back.

428
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:01,250
The good...

429
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,490
and the bad...

430
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:07,960
are in the past,
and you're only left with regret.

431
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,400
Have you lost a husband?

432
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,569
Jin Ju.

433
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:17,569
Let's be honest.
Why are you even fighting?

434
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:19,400
You married for love.

435
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,109
You're spoiled.

436
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,539
What are you on about?

437
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:24,940
Affairs and personality clashes.

438
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,210
All that is just stupid nonsense.

439
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:30,549
So what if someone cheats?

440
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:33,480
Couldn't they show remorse and come back?

441
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:39,359
If he shows remorse and comes back,
should I take him back?

442
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,230
Whatever the outcome,
it's better than having a dead husband.

443
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,500
You might hate each other,

444
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,630
but if something happens,
you have someone to rely on.

445
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,670
I don't.

446
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,609
Whatever I had to lean on just vanished.

447
00:24:57,339 --> 00:25:00,880
You're great at upsetting others...

448
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,680
in a different way from Mom.

449
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,849
It's like you have a degree
in ridiculing others.

450
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:08,420
What do you miss so much...

451
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,890
that you keep talking about a dead guy?

452
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,420
I think that's stupid.

453
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,190
If you want a husband that badly,

454
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,789
find one among the living.

455
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,200
There are lots out there.
Are all the men dead?

456
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,730
How could you say that to me?

457
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,630
Why did you talk like that to me, then?

458
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:28,140
Do you only see your pain
and think it's the greatest in the world?

459
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:33,609
I'm spoiled?

460
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,049
You speak way too easily.

461
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,890
I won't drink with you anymore.

462
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,990
Darn you.

463
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,589
Bye.

464
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:50,089
Don't drink with me, then.

465
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,970
No one ever called her a widow.

466
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,109
Shall I do it?

467
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,950
Be your husband.

468
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:13,079
Shall I do it?

469
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,829
I think I'm almost there.

470
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,559
Toward the end of the track...

471
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,230
opposite the stairs...

472
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,180
You startled me so badly.

473
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:50,759
Meeting you like this
feels like we're in a spy movie.

474
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,759
Let's go.

475
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,869
Why did you want to see me badly enough...

476
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:05,069
that you told me to come out?

477
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,039
What?

478
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:10,109
What is it?

479
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,509
I have something to tell you.

480
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:32,930
Ms. Pi.

481
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,539
Ms. Pi.

482
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,119
What is it? Is something wrong?

483
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,319
What's wrong?

484
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:05,400
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

485
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,380
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

486
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,079
She's so different from me.

487
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,380
She's only like Mom.

488
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,450
Chu Ah!

489
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:29,049
Shut your mouth.

490
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:30,190
Your second daughter.

491
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,920
Tell her to resign from the company.

492
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:35,660
Darn you.
Who are you to tell her to resign?

493
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:39,059
I should've checked his finances
before we got divorced.

494
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,329
You have a lot of money.

495
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:47,069
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
