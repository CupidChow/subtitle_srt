1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,490
Let's make it...

2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,530
a clean break.

3
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,129
You spew nonsense...

4
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:24,739
like it's philosophy.

5
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:26,870
I got duped.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,279
I thought you were smart.

7
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:32,309
This must be gaslighting.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,849
My eyes are slowly being opened.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,550
You really are...

10
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:39,849
so stupid.

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,859
Let him go, then.

12
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:45,120
No. I can't do you a favor.

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,489
I won't let him go.

14
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:49,029
Stupid as he may be, I'll keep him.

15
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:50,999
You two can do whatever you want!

16
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:52,800
I'll do whatever I want!

17
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,900
Pi Seon Ju.

18
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:57,270
Are you challenging me to a fight?

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,040
Yes, Jin Sang Ah. Let's fight.

20
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,580
Let's go all the way
and see who gives in first.

21
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,829
(Episode 26)

22
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:26,669
That psycho Jin Sang Ah won't back down.

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,969
If that was how Nam Jin talked to me,

24
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,070
I bet he said worse to you.

25
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:35,639
Hey.

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,309
Let's go somewhere and drink.

27
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,680
No. I have to get Ji Hyun.

28
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,579
I won't drink during the day.

29
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,159
Should I just...

30
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,930
get a divorce?

31
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,829
Don't you remember
what you said to Sang Ah?

32
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,439
You said you'd go all the way.

33
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:04,040
Why should you get divorced?

34
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,040
I'm exhausted.

35
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,909
Don't say that.

36
00:02:13,809 --> 00:02:14,880
What about Mom?

37
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:17,750
What will you tell Mom?

38
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,750
I can't think that far ahead.

39
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,790
You might think...

40
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,600
Nam Jin is a lowlife
that's less than human.

41
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:33,600
He's a dad. He must miss Ji Hyun a lot.

42
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,609
Don't be weak or give in.

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,010
It's not over
until the ending credits go up.

44
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:49,679
Hang in there just a bit longer.

45
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,519
If you ended up a divorcee too,

46
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,329
Mom's heart would break.

47
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,260
And I'd be so sad.

48
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,899
Let's drink.

49
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,040
You must drink yourself mindless
on a day like this.

50
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,109
If you're worried you'll smell of soju,

51
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:20,950
I'll pick up Ji Hyun for you.

52
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:35,899
(Home-style meals,
Pork belly, Webfoot octopus)

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,239
Nam Jin.

54
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,239
He could've been extra cold and mean...

55
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,480
because Sang Ah was there.

56
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,850
Take Ji Hyun and go see him.

57
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:58,380
Would he treat you the same...

58
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,649
in front of his kid?

59
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,690
I don't want to use Ji Hyun like that.

60
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:07,929
You should be willing to go topless
to take on a psycho like Sang Ah.

61
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,030
Do whatever it takes...

62
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,269
to get through this crisis.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,940
If you think about all the work
you put in to support him,

64
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,709
you need to stay married
until he's old and senile...

65
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,649
and back to wearing diapers.

66
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,849
Yes.

67
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:35,320
I wanted to do just that.

68
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,089
To go hand-in-hand...

69
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,990
and take walks together
and watch our grandkids.

70
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,529
There's...

71
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:47,829
a song about that kind of life.

72
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,269
"A Couple in Their 60s?"

73
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,039
Weren't they in their 70s?

74
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:01,250
In our 70s...

75
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,920
I won't go. I don't want to go home.

76
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,889
Mom will beat me up again
if she sees me like this.

77
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:10,620
Stop crying so we can go home.

78
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,690
That thing called a husband.

79
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:17,760
You wouldn't know if you never had one,

80
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,300
but if you're suddenly without him,
it feels so weird.

81
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:28,409
Your husband
has finally become of some use.

82
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,110
You can't let another woman
snatch him now.

83
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:36,050
What got into you?

84
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,349
I have to get Ji Hyun.
Will you pull yourself together?

85
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:42,159
Yes, right. Ji Hyun.

86
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,019
You must get Ji Hyun.

87
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,329
I will go and get my Dong Won.

88
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:54,269
Whenever I look at Dong Won,

89
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,940
I feel so sorry for him.

90
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,940
Other kids have two parents.

91
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,680
He has just one.

92
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,909
He must feel the absence.

93
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,680
He would feel intimidated...

94
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,219
- and lost...
- Mom.

95
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,089
- What?
- Dong Won.

96
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,159
What's wrong with you? Are you drunk?

97
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,700
My Dong Won.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,599
My handsome son.

99
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:28,200
Shall we go home?

100
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:30,899
Stand up straight.

101
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,610
I don't want to.

102
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,180
Dong Won, can you take your mom home?

103
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,979
- Yes.
- Good.

104
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:40,180
Can you manage?

105
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,719
- Gang Dong Won.
- Oh, gosh.

106
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:44,019
- Mom.
- Oh, dear.

107
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,019
Don't say my full name in public.

108
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:50,560
Why not? You're more handsome
than the actor.

109
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,930
- Just don't do it.
- Give me a kiss.

110
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,490
- Give me a kiss.
- No.

111
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,380
What did you do at kindergarten today?

112
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,920
We made scrambled eggs in a cooking class.

113
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,789
I did the best job.

114
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:23,219
Did you?

115
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,229
I'll make it for Dad one day.

116
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:29,729
Teddy, let's wash your hair.

117
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,800
Hee Young's dad got her
a princess dress on his business trip.

118
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:39,170
But I like this even more.

119
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:42,409
Dad got it for me even though he was busy.

120
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,349
I'll keep this safe
and won't play with it.

121
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,680
Okay.

122
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:51,019
You're clean now. Your hair doesn't smell.

123
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:53,089
It's nice.

124
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,959
Other kids have two parents.
He has just one.

125
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,560
He must feel the absence.

126
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,200
He would feel intimidated...

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,370
and lost.

128
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,959
(Boxing Club, Main Branch)

129
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,089
I got away this time.

130
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,249
- Hello.
- Hi.

131
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,489
- Are you working out?
- Yes.

132
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,060
My gosh...

133
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:09,589
Did you talk to your wife about stuff?

134
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:11,589
Not really.

135
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:14,190
Did you talk to your husband?

136
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,800
He wants a divorce.

137
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,999
He's leaving you for his mistress?

138
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,839
He's out of his mind.
He doesn't see reason.

139
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,310
I feel so embarrassed...

140
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,379
and shabby and humiliated.

141
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,180
Why should you feel humiliated?

142
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,950
They're...

143
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,219
in the wrong.

144
00:10:39,349 --> 00:10:41,119
Hey. You can't...

145
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,560
burst into tears again.

146
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,790
I won't cry.

147
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,469
When my husband returned,

148
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:56,040
I never imagined this would happen.

149
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,770
It's all because of that witch.

150
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,109
What will you do now, then?

151
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,280
I must get him back.

152
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,680
Do you love him that much?

153
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,920
Enough that you want him back?

154
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,089
Part of me wants to just ditch him.

155
00:11:19,729 --> 00:11:20,890
But my mom...

156
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,700
and older sister...

157
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,560
are both widowed.

158
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,629
My sister raises her son alone.

159
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,640
She's sad and worried
her son will feel intimidated and lost,

160
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,070
and that he'll stop dreaming.

161
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,450
If I were to get divorced
and raise Ji Hyun,

162
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:44,219
what if she dreams of
becoming something...

163
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,719
and I can't support her on my own?

164
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:50,520
That's my worry.

165
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:52,320
Goodness.

166
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,030
I'm a useless mom.

167
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,300
Are you still looking for a job?

168
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:05,469
The economy is so slow
that not many places are hiring.

169
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:06,869
Darn it.

170
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,109
I miss Jeil Interior Design.

171
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:14,180
I started there when I was in my mid-20s.

172
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:20,020
I spent more time with that company
than I did with my husband.

173
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,589
I put my heart and soul
into the work while I was there.

174
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:26,690
Did you?

175
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:28,829
My boss wasn't that savvy.

176
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:30,499
I got the fancy title...

177
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,430
of interior designer,

178
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,300
but the work I did was mostly
manual labor at construction sites.

179
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,140
I'd sit around with middle-aged guys
on concrete floors to eat delivery food...

180
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:44,609
and go home reeking of sweat and dust.

181
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:46,849
I imagined...

182
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:52,379
doing that kind of work
with those kinds of guys until I grew old.

183
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,849
At the company that went bankrupt?

184
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,320
I like...

185
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,060
what I do a great deal.

186
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,499
But we went bankrupt.

187
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,640
Shall I tell you something scary?

188
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,670
All the places I worked at...

189
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:16,739
went bankrupt.

190
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,680
Jin Architecture didn't hire me,
so they'll crash and burn.

191
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:25,119
Wait and see.
That witch needs to be ruined.

192
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:28,619
But...

193
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,160
she's not the only one who works there.

194
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:33,390
All the employees are the same.

195
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,030
The HR guy I met...

196
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,329
didn't even open the email
with my portfolio.

197
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,229
They should go down.

198
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,369
Let's go home.

199
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:48,369
Okay.

200
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:51,479
Darn it.

201
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,890
It's nice...

202
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,229
to know someone
who's going through the same thing.

203
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,030
Is it?

204
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,070
It's rare to meet someone who's also...

205
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:15,599
the victim of an affair
at the exact same time.

206
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,070
Talking about it takes a load off my mind.

207
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:24,509
You go ahead.

208
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,079
Okay. Bye.

209
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,619
Oh, hey. Wait.

210
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,320
Still, let's never break up
and give them what they want.

211
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,759

224
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,089
Hello.

225
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,290
- You're back?
- You bet I am.

226
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,829
Do I need a reason to come?

227
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,190
Can I help with anything?

228
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:24,530
Is that the cue sheet?

229
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:28,229
Hey. Is Ms. Oh making
a special appearance?

230
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:29,969
Yoon Gi. Come over here.

231
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,339
Yes, director.

232
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:34,609
Ms. Pi, can you get my phone from my car?

233
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,709
Okay.

234
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:40,509
- Basement Three, Block B!
- Okay!

235
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:44,020
Be careful with that.

236
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,920
And then...

237
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:48,420
That has some sauce,
so take extra care with that.

238
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,420
Okay.

239
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:57,829
I haven't worked in a while,
and I'm so excited.

240
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:01,170
Block B is...

241
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:04,670
Can you manage on your own?

242
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,469
I can push it along.

243
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:10,109
I'll head back to the office
and come for you when you're done.

244
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,709
- Okay, Mr. Jang.
- Bye, then.

245
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:13,279
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

246
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:15,809
It's a bit heavy.

247
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,860
Hello, Ms. Oh.

248
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:30,100
- What?
- How are you?

249
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,799
You have a scene today, right?

250
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,069
Who are you?

251
00:17:33,069 --> 00:17:34,969
I'm a crew member.

252
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:36,069
I see.

253
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:37,539
What's all this?

254
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,309
I brought some homemade yaksik.

255
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,580
I should treat the team
for giving me a role in my son's drama.

256
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,749
People like this more than you think.

257
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:48,650
They love it.

258
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,249
We can't get enough of it. I love yaksik.

259
00:17:51,249 --> 00:17:52,450
- Do you?
- Yes.

260
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,819
(Under maintenance)

261
00:17:57,819 --> 00:18:00,489
Oh, no. Is the elevator out of order?

262
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,989
What about all this, then?

263
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,870
Oh, my gosh.

264
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,910
You must be exhausted.

265
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,979
Stay strong. We're almost there.

266
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:22,180
I'm fine because this is all I'm carrying.

267
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:24,319
You must be dying.

268
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,779
No, I'm fine.

269
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:29,390
I'm not that smart, but I'm pretty strong.

270
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,830
The yaksik will be extra tasty
after this workout.

271
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,890
It would, right? Let's keep going.

272
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,459
My legs are giving way.

273
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,330
Oh, my gosh. Why is it so far up?

274
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:42,900
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, dear.

275
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,279
This is her mom's salon?

276
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,080
My gosh. What a massive building
in this expensive district.

277
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,219
Goodness.

278
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,019
Hello. Do you have an appointment?

279
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,749
How much do you charge?

280
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:04,590
What service do you need?

281
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,959
How much do you charge
for hair or makeup services?

282
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,360
It depends on what you want done...

283
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,259
and who the stylist is.

284
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:14,330
Can the owner service me herself?

285
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,769
She only takes members,
and that requires an appointment.

286
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,370
I need to know how much you charge
if I'm to make an appointment.

287
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,340
You can pay for a fixed time period,

288
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,350
or we have memberships from Silver...

289
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,279
at 5,000 dollars
up to Black at 10,000 dollars.

290
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,549
Can I speak with the owner in person?

291
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,789
She just left to go home, so not today.

292
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:37,890
Really?

293
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,130
(Grace Shim Beauty Studio)

294
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,400
They charge a fortune here.

295
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:51,700
Nam Jin. Guess where I am.

296
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:53,069
What?

297
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,039
Why on earth did you go there?

298
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,840
I was curious.

299
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,309
I can't wait to see what she's like,
but you won't introduce us.

300
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:04,380
I had no choice
but to figure things out myself.

301
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,749
So you went there...

302
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:07,650
We could end up being in-laws.

303
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,959
It would be nice to meet beforehand.

304
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,860
She must make a lot of money.

305
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,959
A membership costs 10,000 dollars.

306
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,259
Can I put that
on the credit card you gave me?

307
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,569
You want to get your hair done there?

308
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:23,900
Don't.

309
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,239
Don't worry. I won't embarrass you.

310
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,840
Is it about the money?

311
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:31,239
If you don't like it,
introduce me to your girl.

312
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,950
Or I'll get a 10,000-dollar membership.

313
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:38,350
Mom, don't do that. Just... Hello?

314
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:43,819
Yes. It should be in the study.

315
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:47,090
In the study? Okay, I'll look.

316
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:53,100
I'm here.

317
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,029
The top drawer?

318
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
I found it.

319
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,469
I'll send my driver. Give it to him.

320
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,509
Okay.

321
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:08,580
Oh, dear.

322
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,080
What's this?

323
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,910
- Hello.
- Come on in.

324
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:42,380
Welcome.

325
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:45,650
The house is pretty old,

326
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,590
but it was built to be sturdy.

327
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,590
It's in such a great spot.

328
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,519
My three children did so well.

329
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,559
My eldest got into the best university...

330
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,090
- so easily...
- What do you think?

331
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,860
It is a bit old.

332
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,499
The interior is old,
but the house was well-built.

333
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,840
Can't we redo the interior?

334
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,539
My sister is an interior expert.

335
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:09,940
- That will cost even more. Let's go.
- Okay, then.

336
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,910
- Why not...
- I'll be in touch.

337
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:15,180
Why don't you take a closer look around?

338
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,719
Oh, dear.

339
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,650
Darn it.

340
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,719
How dare they talk like that
about our perfectly fine house?

341
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:26,160
Selling it won't be that easy after all.

342
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,029
How infuriating.

343
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,499
I'm even more infuriated.

344
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,870
Must we sell our house
to settle with that shameless brat?

345
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,509
I'm watching my weight,
but the food is so good.

346
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,680
You watch your weight all year round.

347
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,890
I didn't know you were such a good cook.

348
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,390
Did you make it yourself?

349
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,630
It wasn't that hard.

350
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,959
Hey, crew girl.

351
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:05,400
Thanks for your help.

352
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,999
Take this.

353
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,729
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

354
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,100
Why would you thank her?

355
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,509
The elevator was out of order
when I got here,

356
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:18,840
so she carried the heavy box
all the way up the stairs.

357
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,880
She's so strong.

358
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:23,719
Since it looks like we've had enough...

359
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:26,749
You can take some more, director.

360
00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:28,920
Thank you.

361
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:31,890
- I'll clean up and take out the trash.
- Okay.

362
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,390
- Bye, sir.
- My gosh.

363
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:37,459
You're such a hard worker. Isn't she?

364
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,759
Yes.

365
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:40,600
Let's eat.

366
00:23:46,469 --> 00:23:47,509
Hey.

367
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,739
I'll go outside for a smoke.

368
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,209
You should take a break too.

369
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,610
I will.

370
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,969
Take Ji Hyun and go see him.

371
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,539
Hang in there just a bit longer.

372
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,670
If you ended up a divorcee too,

373
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:23,110
Mom's heart would break.

374
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:27,249
And I'd be so sad.

375
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,259
(Darling husband)

376
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:56,309
(Jeon Ji Hyun,
The Fairy and the Woodcutter)

377
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,630
Ji Hyun drew this at kindergarten
and said it was our family.

378
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:25,640
She's anxious her dad will leave her.

379
00:25:27,469 --> 00:25:30,180
(Jin Architecture)

380
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,279
(Jin Architecture)

381
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,989
Let's eat out with Ji Hyun as promised.

382
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:43,719
Pretend...

383
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:47,529
you're doing one last thing as a parent.

384
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:51,630
So that Ji Hyun
doesn't feel intimidated or lost,

385
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,630
(So that Ji Hyun
doesn't feel intimidated or lost,)

386
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,370
let's take things a little slowly.

387
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,069
Both I...

388
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,170
and Ji Hyun...

389
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:05,140
need some time.

390
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,799
- Hi.
- Okay.

391
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,430
Make a reservation
and text me the address.

392
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:27,600
What?

393
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:29,569
Okay, I'll do that.

394
00:26:40,209 --> 00:26:41,209
(Ji Hyun's mom)

395
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:42,279
(Click to see map)

396
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,450
- What's that?
- Oh, hi.

397
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:51,519
Isn't that a famous restaurant?

398
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,360
What's going on?

399
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,459
Are you meeting Seon Ju
for dinner or something?

400
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,330
Yes.

401
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,999
My goodness.

402
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,239
- Ji Hyun.
- Mom.

403
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:09,340
- Be quick.
- Mom.

404
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,709
(Manjang Kindergarten)

405
00:27:11,709 --> 00:27:13,009
Let's hurry.

406
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:14,650
Why? What's going on?

407
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,650
We'll go somewhere nice
with Dad for dinner. Let's go get ready.

408
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,350
- For real?
- Yes. Let's go.

409
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,719
(Head of Planning, Kim So Woo)

410
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:34,870
When my husband returned,

411
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,670
I never imagined this would happen.

412
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:43,509
It's all because of that witch.

413
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:02,360
(Resume: Pi Seon Ju)

414
00:28:02,729 --> 00:28:04,430
Are you going to make up with Dad?

415
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,269
No, I mean, you didn't fight, but still.

416
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,069
No, we didn't fight.

417
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,539
But we hadn't been on great terms,

418
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:14,870
so I looked up what to do
to make a family happier.

419
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,739
The tips weren't that special.
We just have to eat something nice...

420
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,840
and spend some good time together.

421
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,809
- Good for you.
- Let's go!

422
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:32,959
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

423
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,009
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

424
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,809
You wanted us both to get divorced.
What are you doing exactly?

425
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,239
I want to give them some time.

426
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:54,249
Honey.

427
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:57,880
You were madly jealous
of that Choon Hyang girl,

428
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,049
and when you met again,
your inferiority complex resurfaced.

429
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,950
Are you out of your mind?

430
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:03,219
You're pathetic.

431
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:04,959
You're using your kid to be clingy.

432
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,660
Am I better than you somehow?

433
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:07,789
What did you say?

434
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,059
