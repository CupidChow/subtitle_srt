00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,060
(Episode 14)

2
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:21,930
Were you envious?

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,299
Well,

4
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:26,210
other kids eat out,

5
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,579
and go out and have fun
with their parents.

6
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:41,349
- What?
- Mom called a meeting.

7
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,859
- Right now?
- Yes. Get over here.

8
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,830
Let's go.

9
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:54,730
(Han Hair Line)

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,300
Where's Ji Hyun?

11
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,239
I dropped her off at home.

12
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:03,410
Seon Ju. You said yesterday
you'd meet your high-school friend.

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,709
You should've called to say what happened,
how much you agreed to pay,

14
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:09,349
or at least keep us updated
because we were dead curious.

15
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:10,919
Yes. How did things go?

16
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:13,650
Well, it was so-so.

17
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,850
Is it 10,000 dollars less?

18
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:16,760
Or 20,000 dollars less?

19
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:19,630
How much did they go down by?

20
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,090
Soon Ae looked well-off enough
to afford to be generous.

21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,400
What did she say?

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,260
Don't ask.

23
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,600
I think she's crazy.

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,340
What? Why?

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,870
She told me to bring an estimate
from my regular garage...

26
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,269
only to mock me for going to such a place.

27
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,710
I said I'd ask at another garage,

28
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,210
- but she wouldn't even listen.
- My gosh.

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,650
What's worse is, it turned out that...

30
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,820
she is Nam Jin's superior.

31
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,249
So I couldn't complain or fight back.

32
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:50,159
Can't you ask Nam Jin
to put in a good word?

33
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:53,329
He freaked out that I got him in trouble.

34
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,900
The evil brat.

35
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,930
Why did she ask to see me, then?

36
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,829
See? I was right.

37
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,900
She called Seon Ju to taunt her.

38
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,600
Are you two sworn enemies?

39
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,570
That's what we are now.

40
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,139
That's nonsense.

41
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:09,710
There must be a reason.

42
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,549
Did you bully her out of jealousy
when you were in school?

43
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:16,549
Why would I be jealous of her
when I was better than her at everything?

44
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,179
Were you really?

45
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,149
I don't think so.

46
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:21,919
You should think so.

47
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,790
I got better grades
and I was the better artist.

48
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:28,790
Why did she do that, then?

49
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,760
The whole family's like that.

50
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,669
Jin Chu Ah is a lunatic too.

51
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:35,429
Some people have it in their DNA.

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,269
They think
they're better than everyone else,

53
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,570
and that they have the right
to upset others.

54
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,510
There are people like that.

55
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,410
We should give up on them
and find a way to get the money.

56
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:49,780
My goodness. Aren't you smart?

57
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,649
You're about to damage us all
and you're all talk.

58
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:56,519
Mom. It's "ruin," not "damage."

59
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:57,919
You be quiet.

60
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:02,160
Mom, you must have a customer.

61
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,500
Oh, dear.

62
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:22,250
Must you go this far?

63
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:24,720
I said my part.

64
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,419
You won't see me again?

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,649
What about work? Will you quit?

66
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,720
If facing each other gets uncomfortable,
I could quit.

67
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:33,630
How could you say that?

68
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,359
I could've gotten this job
without your recommendation,

69
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:38,899
so I don't owe you anything.

70
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:42,799
I'll quit if you feel awkward.

71
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,910
We went from being friends
with benefits to having an affair.

72
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,079
Relationships evolve naturally.

73
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,280
Were we friends with benefits?

74
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,179
According to your definition,

75
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,019
it was always an affair for me.

76
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:58,720
I didn't say anything
to avoid putting pressure on you,

77
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,619
but I was serious from the start.

78
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:03,690
And now I need a clear conclusion.

79
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,690
If we can't reach that,
it means we move...

80
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:10,100
at different speeds
and have different senses of timing,

81
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,399
and we're not meant to be.

82
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,479
- Goodbye, sir.
- Bye.

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,029
Why would Soon Ae do that?

84
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,599
Did I offend her somehow?

85
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,969
Should I call her?

86
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,779
Hello?

87
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,880
Is that Grace Beauty Studio?

88
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,279
Can I speak to the owner?

89
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,279
Me? I'm an old friend.

90
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,450
(Grace Shim Beauty Studio)

91
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,920
(Grace Shim)

92
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,329
Ms. Shim. Someone wants to speak with you.

93
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,099
- Who is it?
- An old friend.

94
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,459
An old friend?

95
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,700
Say I'm not here.

96
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:25,200
I just heard you tell the director
an old friend asked for her,

97
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,380
so don't you dare even try
to lie that she's not there!

98
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,339
She heard us just now.

99
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,180
Hello?

100
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,389
It's me, Man Eun.

101
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,659
We didn't get to talk much last time
because our kids were there.

102
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,459
What more could you have to say?

103
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,789
We have lots to talk about.

104
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:51,529
I missed you a great deal.

105
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:55,130
Would you like to come over to my place?

106
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,870
Let's catch up.

107
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:59,370
Oh, do you remember back then?

108
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,070
After I put my girls to sleep,

109
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,779
we drank makgeolli at the levee...

110
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:06,979
Listen. You keep telling weird stories
about the past.

111
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,709
I don't remember that.

112
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,120
Do you have amnesia?

113
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:12,320
Why don't you remember?

114
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:14,550
Why did you call?

115
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:18,260
Oh. I heard your daughter
refused to negotiate with my daughter.

116
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,930
Have you heard?

117
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:23,959
That must be because your daughter
lacked negotiating skills.

118
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,360
What do you mean by that?

119
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,029
You have an odd way of saying things.

120
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,539
The car accident...

121
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sure the police will handle that.

122
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,070
You'll hear from them in due time.

123
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,440
Instead of calling me, sit tight and wait.

124
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,680
Don't put her on from now on.

125
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,180
Okay.

126
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:44,680
Darn it.

127
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,690
What was all that?

128
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:52,389
Did she just hang up on me
because she's successful?

129
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,690
No. It can't be that.

130
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,229
She told me to wait.
That must be the procedure.

131
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:05,200
No. It's not that.

132
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,079
My credit card bill is 1,702 dollars?

133
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,880
I was out of my mind.

134
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,050
You owe the bank 17 hundred...

135
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,349
Not so loud.

136
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:20,889
I see you swiped it like crazy.

137
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:24,659
You scratched an expensive car
and swiped your credit card.

138
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:26,229
You're good at something.

139
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:28,329
I didn't know I'd lose my job.

140
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,360
Even if I'm let go, can't I demand
to be paid for my work so far?

141
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,829
I think so?

142
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:42,639
Hey. Don't mention
the installments until later.

143
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:46,810
Hang on. How much is my credit card bill?

144
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,649
Are you handling the accident?

145
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,719
Yes. Don't worry.

146
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,659
Ms. Jin.

147
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,959
I have something to tell you,

148
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,000
but you told me to stay out of sight,

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,469
so I'm messaging you instead.

150
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,969
I'm so very sorry
for causing the accident,

151
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,010
but regardless of that,

152
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,240
you must still pay me
for the short time I worked for you.

153
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,849
If you refuse, I can lodge a complaint
with the Ministry of Employment and Labor.

154
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:25,779
That's what the law says.

155
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,149
I'd like you to pay me...

156
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,260
as soon as possible,
at your convenience, please.

157
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,060
- How dare she?
- What is it?

158
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,459
She started the fire
and she just poured a can of gas on it.

159
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:44,839
Mr. Lawyer. Is the paperwork done?

160
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,109
Okay.

161
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:52,540
Just you wait.

162
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,509
Did you just say that to your own mom?

163
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,560
The knife's so blunt.

164
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:40,459
Honey.

165
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,400
Ji Hyun's...

166
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,869
really sick.

167
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:53,570
Come home.

168
00:10:04,849 --> 00:10:06,790
If we're done here, let's go.

169
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,920
I don't care if we're meant to be or not.

170
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,290
What's clear is that
I don't want to let you go.

171
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:14,989
Then...

172
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:17,759
do you want me to be a fish in your tank?

173
00:10:23,099 --> 00:10:26,540
Honey. Ji Hyun's really sick. Come home.

174
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:30,280
The phone is turned off. Transferring...

175
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,550
We're not done here.

176
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,479
My kid's sick.

177
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:40,119
You're leaving to see your kid?

178
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,249
So what if your kid's sick?
Are you a doctor?

179
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:43,520
Can you make her better?

180
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,390
How can you say that
when you have a kid too?

181
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,560
- I'm leaving.
- It feels like I'm losing out.

182
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:51,900
You're a fish in my tank?

183
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:55,270
You're not.
A fish in a tank doesn't stab others.

184
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,739
- Don't go.
- Don't throw a tantrum.

185
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:01,239
She could be lying your kid's sick
to get you to come home.

186
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,180
Seon Ju wouldn't lie about that.

187
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:06,650
Her phone's turned off.
Something's definitely up.

188
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,749
I have nothing more to say.

189
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,719
Darn it.

190
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,520
The heck...

191
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:22,290
Gosh. You picked out a lot of books.

192
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:26,060
Her mom has a loud voice...

193
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,829
and she's strong too.

194
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:29,599
That's impressive.

195
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:31,770
Her mom boxes and she will learn too.

196
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,670
Dad. I want to learn how to box too.

197
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:38,180
Do you? You should learn, then.

198
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,079
Where can you learn how to box?

199
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,979
Shall your superhero dad find out?

200
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:45,619
Quack, quack!

201
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:47,650
Let's see.

202
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,390
Darn it.

203
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,759
No one's accepting my apology.

204
00:11:58,499 --> 00:12:01,030
Why do bad things happen at once?

205
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:02,629
It's such a headache.

206
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,109
Mom. Put on some makeup.

207
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:10,079
- What for?
- Dad will be here soon.

208
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,910
Dad? You heard from him?

209
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,910
Yes. Do we still have the cake
we got earlier as a snack?

210
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,150
We do. You pestered me into buying it.

211
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,550
Do we have candles?

212
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,359
Let's light them
and blow them out together.

213
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:28,729
Shall I light it?

214
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:32,900
Ji Hyun.

215
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,770
Is Ji Hyun okay?

216
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,570
What happened? Is she okay?

217
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:42,469
Of course, she's okay.

218
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
Since you're here, honey,

219
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:47,410
let's share the cake...

220
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,950
What's wrong with you?

221
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,479
Isn't using our kid to lure me
stooping too low?

222
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,420
Is this what you're like?

223
00:12:54,489 --> 00:12:55,550
Why...

224
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,359
- What are you...
- Whatever!

225
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:02,329
Let's forget about it.

226
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:04,160
Honey.

227
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,469
Ji Hyun. Did you...

228
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,729
tell a lie to Dad or something?

229
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,209
- Well...
- My goodness.

230
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,469
Wait here.

231
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:17,509
Honey!

232
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:19,540
It's okay. Stay here.

233
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:46,369
Did Ji Hyun text you?

234
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:48,009
Didn't you tell her to?

235
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:50,280
That's nonsense. Why would I do that?

236
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:53,410
She did wrong, so I'll talk to her.

237
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,719
Fine. I'll match your speed.

238
00:13:57,849 --> 00:13:59,219
Let's divorce our spouses.

239
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,320
And for suspecting
you were seeing someone else...

240
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,329
and making the village idiot comment.
I'm sorry about everything.

241
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,759
That wasn't what I thought,

242
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:13,930
but it's what my mom said.

243
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:15,670
Seon Ju.

244
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:18,739
Let's break up.

245
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,839
Why?

246
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,410
What for?

247
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,579
Living with you...

248
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:26,879
is just too tiring.

249
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:28,950
I've made up my mind.

250
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,579
It might be hard to accept right now,

251
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,050
but calm yourself and think about it.

252
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,950
- Mom.
- Yes?

253
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,920
Why did you send Dad that text?

254
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,629
Why?

255
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:19,729
Even dads
who don't get along with their wives...

256
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,640
drop everything to rush home
when their kids are sick.

257
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,239
What dads?

258
00:15:26,739 --> 00:15:28,170
Dads on TV.

259
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:36,619
You should stay away
from TV dramas for a while.

260
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:45,520
Did you miss Dad?

261
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,060
It looked like you missed him.

262
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,469
It would've been okay
if I were really sick.

263
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,379
I ate so much all day long,

264
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,609
and I even drank milk that had expired.

265
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:11,180
But my tummy didn't hurt.

266
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:14,950
- What?
- It's my fault.

267
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,560
I lied to Dad...

268
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,359
and he yelled at you.

269
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,030
What if...

270
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,729
Dad gets really angry...

271
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,440
and leaves?

272
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,369
Don't say that.

273
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,680
It's not your fault.

274
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,050
Don't blame yourself.

275
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,489
Were you worried
Mom and Dad would get divorced?

276
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:53,329
It's okay. Don't cry.

277
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:57,300
I know exactly how you feel, Ji Hyun.

278
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,700
But still, Ji Hyun.
You shouldn't tell lies.

279
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,570
I'm sorry we made you worry.

280
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,479
I'm sorry we're parents
who upset our own kid.

281
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,789
Look at me.

282
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,090
Mom and Dad...

283
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:28,660
won't break up.

284
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,200
We won't get divorced, so relax, okay?

285
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,890
You're really something, Nam Jin.

286
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,789
I give in.

287
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,219
Thank you for giving in.

288
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,759
You get divorced first.

289
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:06,160
Leaving Seon Ju
will be harder than you think.

290
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:08,870
Okay. I'll do that.

291
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,190
- What?
- Your son.

292
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:37,029
Is he in trouble?

293
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,999
How did you know? Are you psychic?

294
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,569
I don't have to be.

295
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:45,999
You've been calling anyone
who'll pick up to complain to them...

296
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,239
about your son.

297
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,469
Oh, did I?

298
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,340
Here. Tonight's drinks are on me.

299
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,150
Really? Thanks a lot, you witch.

300
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,049
- Here.
- This is on you?

301
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:01,090
Yes.

302
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:17,269
Hello, sir.

303
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:19,670
My boss?

304
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,309
He's not here yet.

305
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,279
What problems?

306
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,410
We're fine.

307
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,180
Bye.

308
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:38,690
As if we're fine.
There are problems everywhere.

309
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:45,759
Let's be patient. Time will help.

310
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,430
If I wait, he'll come back.

311
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,469
Yes. At 9 a.m.?

312
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,739
Okay, got it.

313
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,410
Son.

314
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,080
Woo Sang.

315
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:01,279
Is the food ready?
Shall I come downstairs?

316
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:02,950
I'm starving.

317
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,249
The food's not ready.

318
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,219
It won't be ready any time today.

319
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,620
- What's wrong this time?
- We're out of rice.

320
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:11,489
If I go to get rice at the store now,

321
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:13,860
- you'll have to wait two hours.
- Darn it.

322
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:16,390
I told you we need a helper.

323
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,559
Hire someone yourself.

324
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,759
Order jajangmyeon.

325
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,299
I want my sauce extra thick.

326
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,900
What the heck?

327
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,069
(Jin Architecture)

328
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,469
You're not with your wife today?

329
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:31,440
Why ask for her when I'm paying you?

330
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:34,680
You could get the wrong idea...

331
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:36,979
if I were to say this but...

332
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:38,150
Then don't say it.

333
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,090
When you first came to us,

334
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,959
you said you wanted a house to spend
the rest of your life in with your family.

335
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:45,420
A study for yourself,

336
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,860
a garden for your grandsons,
and an attic for your granddaughter.

337
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:51,200
You were willing to go to such lengths
for your grandchildren who only visit.

338
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,700
A studio for your wife...

339
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,170
Hey.

340
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,670
I asked to go over the interior as well
while I was here.

341
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,410
I thought we should
let Mr. Jeon in on the project.

342
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:07,009
This is the issue.

343
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,709
I'm the one paying the bill.

344
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,580
He colluded with my wife
and changed the plans behind my back.

345
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,489
I'm sorry for not confirming with you
because you weren't there.

346
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,559
But you and your wife are the two people
who will spend the most time in the house.

347
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,690
I'm glad you said that.

348
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:24,029
I can stand it even less
because I must watch her dance every day.

349
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:27,700
She could pick a demure hobby
like calligraphy or flower arrangement.

350
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:29,600
She wants a dance hall in the house.

351
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:31,940
Here's what I think.

352
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,709
It would be ideal if you could
satisfy everyone's demands.

353
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,680
But too many opinions can cause strife.

354
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:44,620
In that case, I think the person who pays
should have the final say.

355
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,019
My point exactly.

356
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:48,219
I like you. What's your name?

357
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,890
I'm Manager Jeon Nam Jin.

358
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:54,930
I love to watch TV and they
did away with my home theater.

359
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,330
I'll take this to mean
we're sticking with your original plan.

360
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:01,269
It's great to finally meet someone
who thinks like I do.

361
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:04,370
Manager Jeon?

362
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,769
Yes.

363
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,009
- I hope we get along.
- Same here.

364
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,779
I trust you got my message loud and clear.

365
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,450
- Goodbye, sir.
- I'll see you again.

366
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,920
- Mr. Hwang.
- Mr. Jin.

367
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,489
I see you hired a great employee.

368
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,190
- Is that so?
- Yes.

369
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:28,860
Him over there.

370
00:22:28,989 --> 00:22:30,600
He gets it.

371
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,959
- Does he?
- Yes. Goodbye.

372
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:34,029
Goodbye.

373
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:39,370
Did you sort everything out well?

374
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,709
Yes.

375
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:52,049
(Head of Interior, Jin Sang Ah)

376
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,759
I'd agreed to match your speed,

377
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:04,200
but aren't you getting a bit too brazen?

378
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,469
You came in without knocking...

379
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,769
and sat down as if you owned the space.

380
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:16,209
I knocked. You didn't hear it.

381
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:21,150
I liked how you said
what the client wanted to hear.

382
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,450
You knocked Mr. Kim down a peg.

383
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,150
I didn't knock him down too hard
because he was your husband.

384
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,289
It will be pretty fun
running Jin Architecture with you.

385
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,890
Let's clock off together later.

386
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:37,259
I like that idea.

387
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,999
(Head of Planning, Kim So Woo)

388
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:52,610
It's great to finally meet someone
who thinks like I do.

389
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:57,080
Manager Jeon?

390
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,350
Yes.

391
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,529
(Team Leader's Office, Kim So Woo)

392
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:26,809
Bring your stuff
back to the studio apartment.

393
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:32,080
Mr. Kim.

394
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,219
Do we revise the plan
back to what Mr. Hwang wants?

395
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,390
Yes.

396
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:41,029
Let's do that for now. Excuse me.

397
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:38,319
Hey.

398
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,690
Why hasn't the money come in yet?

399
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,529
Hello. It's Jeil Interior Design.

400
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,600
We haven't received payment yet.

401
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:56,269
We wired the money two weeks ago.
Check again.

402
00:25:56,269 --> 00:25:57,370
You sent the money?

403
00:25:57,499 --> 00:25:59,499
Okay, then. Thank you.

404
00:26:07,209 --> 00:26:08,850
Did you have any plans?

405
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:10,450
No.

406
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,850
How do you connect the Bluetooth?

407
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,789
It's not my car, so I don't know.

408
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,989
Whose car is it?

409
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,660
It's my husband's.

410
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,319
I'm driving his
while mine's in the garage.

411
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,860
It's quite a nice ride.

412
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,059
Should I just sell my car once it's fixed?

413
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,569
Why would you? I was hoping to drive it.

414
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,529
- Were you?
- It's a cool car.

415
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,670
You can be a cutie.

416
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,940
You can drive it when it's repaired.

417
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:36,309
Sounds good.

418
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:00,360
Don't you like
staying at the studio apartment?

419
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,600
- You shouldn't have refused at first.
- No.

420
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:05,299
Having that place as a hangout...

421
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,610
reminds me of when
we lived together in the US.

422
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,580
Yes. What do you want to eat?

423
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:12,680
Order whatever you want.

424
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:23,819
Why are you so deep in thought?

425
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,459
What?

426
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,390
It's our last night in New York.

427
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,999
It is.

428
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,080
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

429
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,090
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

430
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,930
He wants a divorce.
I don't even know what the problem is.

431
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:07,370
You left him alone for too long.

432
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:10,430
If you're physically apart for too long,
your mind drifts apart too.

433
00:28:10,469 --> 00:28:11,469
Tae Ri!

434
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,870
Grandma said
I shouldn't bother Mom and Dad.

435
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,309
I'll act like a nice bottle of wine.

436
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:20,950
Let's talk.

437
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:24,719
