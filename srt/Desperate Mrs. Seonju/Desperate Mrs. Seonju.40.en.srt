00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,520
(Episode 40)

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,529
Did you just slap me?

3
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:15,789
I don't think one slap will be enough.

4
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:17,200
Here's another one!

5
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:19,900
What are you doing?

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,429
Go ahead and hit me.

7
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:25,099
Let's get beaten up so I can demand
compensation from you this time.

8
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:28,040
- Come on. Hit me. Do it.
- What do you think you're doing?

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,779
- Darn you.
- Let go!

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,180
You shameless wench.

11
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,250
When you got a job here,

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,950
I got that it was because
you'd lost your husband and your mind...

13
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:40,250
and you wanted revenge,
and I kind of understood.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,720
- What?
- But...

15
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,860
did you really want to
drag me down so I'd crash and burn?

16
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,629
What are you on about?

17
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,829
Will you stop it?

18
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:49,159
Why should I stop?

19
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,000
Tell your girlfriend to stop.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,900
She hit me. My goodness.

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,829
I won't stand for it.
I'll call the police.

22
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,199
What are you thinking?

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,970
You know what I'm thinking!
I told you she hit me!

24
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,640
Maybe you deserved it.

25
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,909
Would she have hit you for no reason?

26
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:06,579
Mr. Jeon.
Don't you think that's a bit harsh?

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,949
Who deserved to get hit?

28
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:09,850
Do you know what Seon Ju did?

29
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,250
What did I do?

30
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,520
You spread that darn video
so word of my affair would get out.

31
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,460
Now you came here to gossip?

32
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,460
About what?

33
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,889
Didn't you tell people what we were doing
at the studio apartment?

34
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,259
Word reached my father.

35
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:25,160
You even asked my mom for money!

36
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,430
My gosh. What are you talking about?

37
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,440
You just heard some crap
and came here to vent.

38
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,699
Who was it if not you?

39
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:32,809
Was it you?

40
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,570
Don't be stupid.

41
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:36,710
It was you, then!

42
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:37,779
My gosh.

43
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,449
I didn't want to dirty my mouth
by speaking up...

44
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:42,779
about your hideout,
so I never mentioned that.

45
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:44,949
And your mom mentioned money to me first.

46
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,050
She asked if I needed money.
Who doesn't need money these days?

47
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,259
You need to quit immediately!

48
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:53,389
Why should I?

49
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:57,300
The more you do this,
the harder I'll try to stick around.

50
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,430
If you can't stand seeing me,
you can quit!

51
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,400
Give me that!

52
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:02,999
I'll make a report first.

53
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,969
Just...

54
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,139
hit me.

55
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,609
- What?
- Hit me once and let it go.

56
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,350
Here. Hit me.

57
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,920
Why would you say that?
Why should you get hit?

58
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,789
What a joke.

59
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:26,129
Okay, then. I'll hit you once.

60
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,089
And call it quits.

61
00:02:32,029 --> 00:02:33,900
Lower your guard.

62
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:35,270
I won't go lightly on you.

63
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:45,879
Are you all right?

64
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,920
Am I losing a tooth?

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,089
- What?
- I think it's wobbly.

66
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,619
Is it really?

67
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:56,719
Why you...

68
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,830
If you hit her again,
can I hit Mr. Jeon too?

69
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:02,860
Don't do that.

70
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,400
What an amazing couple you are.

71
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,869
Act out just once more...

72
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,499
and my next punch will be aimed at you.

73
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,309
Darn you.

74
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:18,409
You fool.

75
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,200
My goodness.

76
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,839
Where's the tissue?

77
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,539
What a joke.

78
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,450
- Hello?
- So Woo.

79
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,749
Come and see me.

80
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,520
Okay.

81
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,059
Talk to him and make sure he fires her.

82
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,059
Yes. This is utter nonsense.

83
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,129
It's a first.

84
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,629
Oh, my gosh.

85
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,869
I get why you're angry.

86
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:19,809
She caused so much trouble
and she just joined.

87
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,710
She denied it, but who else could it be?

88
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,810
Let's sell the studio apartment
to calm my dad down.

89
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,450
It's that
or I'll be suspended from duties.

90
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,549
We can't allow that.

91
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:37,260
Let's move out of the apartment.

92
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,700
Could we set up your homeowner
with my daughter?

93
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,599
- With Kyung Ae?
- Yes.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,500
She was married,

95
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,839
but the marriage was so short
it almost didn't happen.

96
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,570
She's practically a single woman.

97
00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:00,210
Kids. You're eating everything
as soon as I peel them.

98
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,020
Will you eat slowly?

99
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,719
- Okay.
- Okay.

100
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:10,620
Your homeowner is handsome, owns a house,

101
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,020
and found a job.

102
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,589
He has a kid,

103
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,429
but she doesn't mind. It doesn't matter.

104
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,299
I'm so frustrated
because Kyung Ae is so immature...

105
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:24,870
she still only cares about a guy's looks.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,940
She said she could marry a guy...

107
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,810
with two kids if he was handsome.

108
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,549
Is my homeowner that good-looking?

109
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,380
If so, he should marry my Seon Ju,
not your daughter.

110
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:38,779
My goodness.

111
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,989
You're leeching off your homeowner.

112
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:45,190
What if he were to date Seon Ju
and it didn't work out?

113
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,589
Would you be able to
live under the same roof after that?

114
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,630
Of course not.

115
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:54,130
Man Eun. Will you set him up
with my Kyung Ae?

116
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:59,500
What do you think?

117
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:01,570
I guess...

118
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,409
it's not bad.

119
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,010
If you're buying to invest,
this place isn't bad either.

120
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,849
It's cheaper per square foot...

121
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,679
You're Jin Ju, aren't you?

122
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:15,349
What? Am I?

123
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:17,120
What do you mean "am I?"

124
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:19,830
It's you, Pi Jin Ju.

125
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,289
I'm Jeong Tae Sang.

126
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,159
We went to the same academy
during our high school holidays.

127
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,669
Hey. It's great to see you again.

128
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:30,370
How long has it been?

129
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:33,010
Yes. It's great.

130
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,210
Really great.

131
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:38,539
I thought it was you, but I wasn't sure.

132
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,979
You looked so different.

133
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,349
I see. Did I?

134
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:44,479
Are you married?

135
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,150
What does your husband do?

136
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,250
Well...

137
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,620
Are you a director?

138
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,330
What shows did you direct?

139
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:56,799
This and that.

140
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,260
- Hey.
- What?

141
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,099
Let's not dig too much
into each other's privacy.

142
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,940
Shall we not?

143
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,210
How long have you been doing this here?

144
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,039
Everyone is talking about
the redevelopment.

145
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,609
You must've made a fortune.

146
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,339
You hear everything first.

147
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:16,419
What about the place you saw?
Did you not like it?

148
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,020
Not exactly, but...

149
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:21,419
Jin Ju.

150
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:25,359
Do you have anything
you're keeping a secret?

151
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,830
- What?
- I heard that agents like you...

152
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,560
buy up all the nice properties.

153
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,969
Do you have any of those?

154
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,640
What I showed you was one of them.

155
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:39,000
I was about to buy it myself,
but I showed it to you.

156
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,750
Ms. Pi.

157
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:50,580
Did you call the buyers
who need to pay the balance today?

158
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,750
Yes. They'll be here around 7 p.m.

159
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,450
Then I'll come back then.

160
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,890
- Okay.
- Bye.

161
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,859
You're not the actual agent.

162
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,669
You've changed so much.

163
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:12,400
You did that.

164
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,310
- Did what?
- That.

165
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,169
You know what.

166
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:18,179
Plastic surgery?

167
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:20,909
My gosh.

168
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,710
I don't do such things.

169
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,880
No, not that.

170
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,650
You changed for the worse.

171
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,159
What?

172
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,859
You were so pretty back then.

173
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm not too bad to look at right now.

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
- People still ask me for my...
- Come on.

175
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,900
Don't deny it. I have eyes too.

176
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:47,709
You should go.

177
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:53,449
It was great to see you.

178
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,350
I'll be back, Ms. Pi.

179
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
What?

180
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,059
Why did he have to come here?

181
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,760
I changed for the worse?

182
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,360
What about him?

183
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:13,329
So what if he's still handsome? Darn him.

184
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,970
(Hospital)

185
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:24,439
You're here.

186
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:26,449
- Yes.
- Hello.

187
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:29,610
Honey, leave with Chu Ah.

188
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:31,179
Okay.

189
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:44,760
I hope Dad gets him to fire Choon Hyang.

190
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:47,500
How could she and Sang Ah work together?

191
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:49,130
So Woo is such a weirdo.

192
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,470
I'll go out for a bit.

193
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:52,939
Where to?

194
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:56,340
Did you...

195
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,439
hire someone called Pi Seon Ju?

196
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:02,809
- Yes.
- She is Mr. Jeon's wife,

197
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,250
and they're currently getting a divorce.

198
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,449
Why are you doing this?

199
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,189
Was Sang Ah right?
Was it to torment Sang Ah?

200
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,520
Her portfolio...

201
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,390
was full of effort like a journal
that was kept for a long time.

202
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,459
I thought...

203
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,370
her interpretation of space
matched our vision.

204
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:23,900
Your emotions played no part
when you recommended her for the job?

205
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,100
Of course not.

206
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,010
She's just an assistant now,

207
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:29,569
but she'll benefit the company.

208
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:31,880
This has nothing to do
with my personal feelings.

209
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,679
Okay.

210
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,319
Handle things well
to avoid further trouble.

211
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,250
Yes, sir.

212
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,760
Where will you stay now?

213
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:49,959
I can stay with my mom.

214
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,329
She was feeling lonely, so it works out.

215
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:01,510
It smells great.

216
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,679
Nam Jin, it's me.

217
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,779
- What?
- Let me in.

218
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,850
- It's my mom.
- Your mother? Why is she here?

219
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,659
Hi.

220
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,230
My gosh.

221
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,500
I was going to send it by courier,

222
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,799
but raw seafood should be kept fresh,

223
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,299
so I brought it here myself.

224
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,870
It looks delicious.

225
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,439
Don't open it now, Mom.

226
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:38,809
Hey. You were here too.

227
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,449
- Hello.
- I'm glad we met.

228
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:42,549
Let's sit down.

229
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:47,049
We didn't get to talk much at the cafe...

230
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:48,689
because Seon Ju called you.

231
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:51,289
What did she say? I didn't get to ask.

232
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:53,730
Mom. Why would you bring up the past?

233
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,059
What? Oh, you're right.

234
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,760
Why would I bring up the past?

235
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,370
I should bring up the future.

236
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,770
Does your father...

237
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:07,039
own the company Nam Jin works at?

238
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:10,010
- Yes.
- Is it a listed company?

239
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,250
Mom. Why would you ask
something like that?

240
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,250
What?

241
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:16,250
I was curious, that's all.

242
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,819
Nam Jin hasn't been divorced
for that long,

243
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,689
so it's somewhat embarrassing to say this,

244
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,490
but if he were to remarry,

245
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:28,959
I want there to be a decent wedding.

246
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,159
And a meeting with the parents.

247
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:48,949
I always dreamed of having a meal...

248
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:53,419
with the rich future in-laws
at a really classy restaurant.

249
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,090
Mom.

250
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,090
My gosh. Director Shim.

251
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:05,529
- Who are you?
- I'm Nam Jin's mom.

252
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,270
I went to your salon
a good few times to meet you,

253
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,140
but you were never in.

254
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,610
I even made an appointment with you,
but you had it pushed back a long time...

255
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,380
due to some personal reasons.

256
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:21,010
"Is this darn director
trying to make a living or not?"

257
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,110
"Why is she so darn hard to meet?"

258
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:24,819
But we meet at last.

259
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,549
What are the personal reasons?

260
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:29,319
Do you have family troubles?

261
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:32,189
Did you formally meet Mr. Jeon's mother...

262
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,959
- and are you meeting regularly?
- No. I wanted to...

263
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,799
How can you do this
when your divorce isn't final yet?

264
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,659
What? Miss.

265
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:41,770
You're not a miss?

266
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:45,340
- I was married before too.
- Be quiet.

267
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,370
We're both doing our best
to clean things up.

268
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,610
"Clean things up?"

269
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:52,439
Are your wife and child
things that need to be cleaned up?

270
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:55,179
You two...

271
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,179
are both parents. Aren't you ashamed?

272
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,120
You have a kid?

273
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:03,360
You never mentioned that!

274
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:05,419
I'm a dad too.

275
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:07,789
Mom. You need to leave.

276
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:08,890
No, wait.

277
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:12,000
Since when did you care?
You're being weird, Mom.

278
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:13,329
How am I being weird?

279
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:16,840
What parent would sit around
while their child gets up to no good?

280
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,740
You might have started things
because you wanted to,

281
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,340
but I'll end it for you.

282
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,079
Once you move out of here,
don't dream of dating Sang Ah again.

283
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,880
I came here to get you to promise.

284
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,919
Were you packing to move out?

285
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,949
Mom.

286
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,520
I really don't like
how you mistreat Nam Jin.

287
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,720
Why are you doing this?

288
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,529
Must you defend him
when you saw how angry your dad was?

289
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:43,699
You need to get a hold of yourself!

290
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:44,760
My gosh.

291
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:49,299
I let you do the talking so far,
and I don't like how it sounds.

292
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,470
- What?
- You treat my perfectly fine son...

293
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,299
as if he's flawed goods.

294
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:56,039
Your daughter and my son...

295
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,340
were both married once before.

296
00:14:58,409 --> 00:14:59,939
Other than her being a CEO's daughter,

297
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,179
I say my son is better-looking
and has a better degree.

298
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:07,250
- Will you please leave?
- Am I wrong?

299
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,860
If I'd kept all the love letters
he got since he was a kid,

300
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,429
I could've wallpapered
a 200m² house with them.

301
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,760
How many did your daughter get?

302
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,730
Mom. Go home.

303
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,199
Why are you trying to make me leave?

304
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,100
Do you know how smart my son was?

305
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,799
He was crazy competitive too.

306
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,409
The one decision he made
that caused him a loss...

307
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,279
was marrying Seon Ju.

308
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,179
Other than that,
every decision he made paid off.

309
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,949
Are you proud?

310
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:38,650
Yes. I'm darn proud.

311
00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:41,620
I'm saying he's on equal footing
with your daughter.

312
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,559
Why would you scold my son
when you couldn't control your daughter?

313
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,059
Guess what?

314
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:48,559
Your daughter loved my son so much...

315
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,659
- that she bought an apartment for...
- Mom!

316
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:54,169
- You're leaving. Let's go.
- Let go of me!

317
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:55,529
- Let's...
- Will you stop it?

318
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,600
What a waste of good food.

319
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,470
I paid 100 dollars for 4 kilos
and had it shipped from the factory.

320
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,779
- Mom.
- My goodness.

321
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,539
What a waste. Oh, what a shame.

322
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:10,720
- Will you walk faster?
- Goodness.

323
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,250
What's the matter?

324
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,990
- You're such a nuisance.
- Let go.

325
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,189
Darn you.

326
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,789
- I'm so annoyed.
- Let's go downstairs.

327
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:19,360
My gosh.

328
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:22,029
- Goodness.
- Mom, please.

329
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:23,659
(Jeil Residence Hotel)

330
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,159
Mom. Seriously.

331
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,400
My gosh.

332
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:29,630
I told you not to come.
Why did you come and cause a mess?

333
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,340
Was I to keep quiet after what she said?
I wasn't wrong, was I?

334
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,740
What about the crabs?
Why did you bring that?

335
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,179
She must be so annoyed.

336
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,279
The crabs heard what she said
and got so furious they blew their tops.

337
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:47,120
Seon Ju was a bit slow and immature,

338
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,650
but she never treated me like this.

339
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,289
My gosh. Just thinking about it
is getting me worked up again.

340
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:55,130
I'll go back inside and give her...

341
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,299
No, Mom. Please don't.

342
00:16:57,429 --> 00:16:59,299
Don't get involved.

343
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:01,199
Just go home.

344
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,539
I beg of you. Go home.

345
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,340
Go home, I said.

346
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,970
Don't come this way.
Turn around and go home.

347
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,279
Darn you. You're such a moron.

348
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:20,590
His family is just as vulgar.

349
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,719
You're a poor judge of men.

350
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,689
Didn't you learn anything from me?

351
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,429
I'm sorry, ma'am.

352
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,640
You two. Don't you fear
how you'll pay for this?

353
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,669
However you package it, you had an affair.

354
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:46,439
For as long as I live,
I can't approve of you.

355
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,449
Nam Jin. Take everything
in this darn apartment.

356
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,719
And get your wife to leave the company!

357
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,219
My goodness.

358
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,820
This is such a mess.

359
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,090
What the heck?

360
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:12,040
Your mom is really something.

361
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,439
And what's up with my mom?

362
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,239
She's a complete stranger.

363
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,209
I'll handle my mom. Don't worry.

364
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:21,780
Your mother...

365
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,550
will have a hard time
coming to terms with this.

366
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:27,249
I knew Dad was never on my side.

367
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,150
Now I think Mom is even worse.

368
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,120
I thought she'd side with me
no matter what happened.

369
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,659
Why do I feel so betrayed?

370
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,999
Let's consider it growing pains
we had to go through at least once.

371
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,310
Drop by the hospital
and see your father today.

372
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:56,749
Get rid of it fast. It stinks.

373
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:57,780
Darn it.

374
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,830
When it turns midnight,
the gate comes down

375
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,269
I'm home.

376
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:19,439
- Are you off work?
- Yes.

377
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:23,469
Is the work there doable?

378
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,780
Well,

379
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,280
sometimes I get annoyed,
and sometimes I get upset.

380
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,419
It's not easy to make a living.

381
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,850
It's darn hard.

382
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:36,790
Hey. Do you think
our homeowner is handsome?

383
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:38,019
His looks?

384
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,130
They're above average.

385
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,159
Kyung Ae's mom says he's handsome...

386
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:47,070
and wants him to date Kyung Ae.

387
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,769
Should I do that as a good deed?

388
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:52,699
- No. Don't you dare.
- Why not?

389
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,909
What if Kyung Ae and the homeowner
were to hit it off?

390
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:56,570
She'll move in with him.

391
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:59,439
If she were to move in,
we'd get kicked out.

392
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,409
We signed a deal to stay for two years.

393
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,479
If they were to marry,

394
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:06,179
would she live upstairs with the kid?

395
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,790
Knowing what she's like,
she'll do anything to get us to leave.

396
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:12,159
I heard Kyung Ae was learning how to bake.

397
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,159
She could shut down your salon
to open a bakery.

398
00:20:16,189 --> 00:20:17,830
- Oh, dear.
- The paper we signed...

399
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,699
doesn't mention the salon.

400
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,199
We only put down
how much we'd pay on the last day...

401
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:24,669
of each month for rent.

402
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:26,400
Don't set them up.

403
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,739
Kyung Ae's mom wants Kyung Ae
to marry our homeowner...

404
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:32,880
so she can claim our house too.

405
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:35,780
I had a bad feeling when she asked.

406
00:20:36,449 --> 00:20:37,679
It would've been a disaster.

407
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,249
The sly old hag.

408
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,709
The sample details...

409
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:03,269
Darn it.

410
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,320
It's still red.

411
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,390
Hey. It's...

412
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:29,830
- Welcome.
- Hi.

413
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:37,209
Pork belly cartilage and a soju, please.

414
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:38,209
Okay.

415
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,409
Hello.

416
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,189
Why are you here and not going home?

417
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:52,590
Can I have stir-fried beef tripe
and another glass?

418
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,659
Okay.

419
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:55,790
It's so cold.

420
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,900
(Lid-grilled Pork Belly)

421
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,009
My gosh.

422
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:15,280
Why did you hide earlier?

423
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,360
I'll be right back!

424
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,100
What is it?

425
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
It's nothing.

426
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:35,769
Let's go that way.

427
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,350
Why did I hide? I did nothing wrong.

428
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:07,600
I said I'd climb up...

429
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:10,100
because I'd hit rock bottom.

430
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,469
The uphill trek is pretty hard.

431
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,140
How could she become my direct supervisor?

432
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:21,610
I knew she'd be hard on you,

433
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:24,550
but I didn't think
she'd be so open about it.

434
00:23:25,249 --> 00:23:27,449
Don't you need some kind of ointment?

435
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:29,390
Your family might worry.

436
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:32,719
If I go home reeking of alcohol,

437
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,790
they'll think that's why it's red.

438
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:37,499
Cheers.

439
00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:47,199
(Hospital)

440
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,540
I saw them pack
to move out of the studio apartment.

441
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:53,979
Let it go.

442
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:02,050
I met Mr. Jeon's mother at the apartment.

443
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:04,590
I don't want to see her ever again.

444
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,360
Thinking we could become in-laws...

445
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:11,400
made me think I'd rather have
an orphan son-in-law like So Woo.

446
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,499
You don't know what you have
until you lose it.

447
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:17,469
I'm starting to see
how greedy Mr. Jeon is.

448
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,800
He's not a good person.

449
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,439
We spoiled Sang Ah.

450
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:25,939
You coddled her out of pity...

451
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:27,709
that she'd lost her birth mother.

452
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,449
I just let her be instead of scolding her.

453
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,120
She's too old now
for us to change her ways.

454
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,390
We must still try.

455
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,890
Make it clear to her
that she must break up with Mr. Jeon.

456
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,259
I lost my birth mother?

457
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,860
I'm not her daughter?

458
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,110
(Food and Alcohol)

459
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:58,580
I'd only seen in the news
that people got assaulted at work.

460
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,509
That was me.

461
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,909
Did you see what happened?

462
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,919
He told me to hit him instead of her.

463
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,150
I saw.

464
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:11,620
It was a scene out of a drama.

465
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,060
It was.

466
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:20,199
I wouldn't care
if they did it where I couldn't see.

467
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:23,269
I can't believe I'm watching...

468
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,439
my ex frolic with his mistress
right in front of me.

469
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:30,979
You asked me many times
if I could put up with it.

470
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:36,080
It's way more disgusting and harder
than I thought.

471
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,019
Cinderella had a tough early life,

472
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:42,519
and so did the heroines
in Korean folk tales.

473
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:45,019
"I'm in a fairy tale of my own."

474
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:47,530
"That's why I'm going through this."

475
00:25:48,489 --> 00:25:49,989
I try to keep that mindset,

476
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:54,300
but there's no fairy tale
with a heroine who has to...

477
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,070
watch her husband cheat on her.

478
00:25:57,439 --> 00:26:01,209
It feels like I'm not the heroine
of the story in this lifetime.

479
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,239
What you're saying...

480
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:06,239
makes me feel bad.

481
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:08,679
Why would it?

482
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:13,380
Should I not have gotten you a job?

483
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:14,590
Before that,

484
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,320
if I had been more charming,

485
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,790
perhaps Sang Ah
wouldn't have fallen for Mr. Jeon.

486
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:25,259
And then perhaps
your family wouldn't have broken up.

487
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,630
What does that mean?

488
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:29,130
Your logic is really weird.

489
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,499
Why would you blame yourself?

490
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:34,640
You should watch and learn
from their audacity.

491
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:36,340
That's what I'm going to do.

492
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:39,239
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

493
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,780
See,

494
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:49,090
I wonder if I should just quit...

495
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,459
more than a dozen times a day.

496
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,959
I backed down when he demanded a divorce.

497
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,189
If I were to back down again by quitting,

498
00:26:57,189 --> 00:27:00,199
that would make me a stupid cow
that keeps walking backward...

499
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:02,370
without getting anywhere.

500
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,030
Right.

501
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:06,239
You shouldn't back down.

502
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,310
I'm pretty pathetic too.

503
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:14,580
Even though I tell myself that,

504
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:19,080
when I sneak a glance
at the floor plans on Sang Ah's desk,

505
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:22,419
I think,
"Hey, so this is how she fixes that."

506
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:25,459
"It would be nice to change this to that."

507
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:27,959
I get some ideas,

508
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,030
and I enjoy myself
for as long as I can daydream.

509
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,630
How did you think...

510
00:27:33,199 --> 00:27:36,030
you'd like to change the floor plan?

511
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:40,169
I thought we should give it
a more relaxing feel.

512
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:45,340
If you design a place
to stand out and flaunt something,

513
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,979
it feels less relaxing.

514
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,949
Would you like to...

515
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,790
work with me instead of Ms. Jin
starting tomorrow?

516
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,050
What?

517
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:00,560
Would that be too "Animal Planet?"

518
00:28:02,189 --> 00:28:05,900
You're nothing more to me
than a colleague.

519
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,300
You must feel the same about me.

520
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:12,400
Doesn't that mean
it's not too "Animal Planet?"

521
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,640
Would you like to...

522
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,909
work with me?

523
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:25,120
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

524
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,130
(Desperate Mrs. Seon Ju)

525
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,169
You're Sang Ah's ex-husband.
Wouldn't that be weird?

526
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:48,310
Do you have feelings for me?

527
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:50,439
You came in one after the other
in quick succession.

528
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,739
We met by chance
and had one drink together.

529
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,409
That's how things start. Seduce him.

530
00:28:55,409 --> 00:28:57,509
Is this about letting Mr. Jeon go?

531
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,519
Are you trying to disrupt my happiness?

532
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,749
I am Dad's daughter, aren't I?
