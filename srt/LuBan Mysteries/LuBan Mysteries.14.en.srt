1
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,799
This is a normal physiological reaction

2
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,240
After death, the muscles relax

3
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,079
or rigor mortis sets in

4
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,759
which can keep the eyelids from closing

5
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,880
Time of death

6
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,719
was around ten o'clock last night

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,640
Although the head was severed

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,159
and placed on the puppet's head

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,799
there is a clear incision at the neck

10
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,799
with subcutaneous soft tissue hemorrhage

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,840
Cause of death

12
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,920
was mechanical asphyxia from strangulation

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,480
There is something inside

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,000
As for this puppet right now

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,879
you cannot see anything wrong with it dressed

16
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,040
Can we take it apart and examine it?

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,280
Here is the plan

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,439
We will take all the puppets and props

19
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,480
apart and inspect them one by one

20
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,640
No

21
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,400
Those puppets are for our show

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,079
tomorrow, they are all our stage props

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,439
They absolutely must not be damaged

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,319
Please do not worry

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,400
I am a carpenter

26
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,120
I definitely will not damage them

27
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,200
Detective Yang

28
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,719
Did you not promise me?

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,840
Relax, Sun Laoban

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,040
We will not make a big scene

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,159
At nine forty last night

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,319
where were you, and with whom

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,239
and what were you doing?

34
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,560
I was in the back kitchen checking ingredients

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,799
I was busy until after midnight

36
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,159
That night

37
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,719
I shoved Boss Zhou away and ran out

38
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,799
The clothes that puppet was wearing

39
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,560
were Wu Laoban's clothes

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,159
It must be Wu Laoban resenting me for betraying him

41
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,319
coming to claim the lives of me and Boss Zhou

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,199
After you ran out

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,199
what happened?

44
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,599
Why are you screaming like a ghost this late at night

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,680
Wu Laoban

46
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,560
It is Wu Laoban's ghost come back

47
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,360
Did you maybe do something

48
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,800
Something you cannot let people know about

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,280
And now Wu Laoban's ghost is haunting you

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,400
I

51
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,680
From now on you had better behave yourself

52
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,439
Stop fooling around with other men and women

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,120
Or even if Wu Laoban does not come for your life

54
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:42,560
I can still cripple your other arm

55
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,439
That is what I said the night before last

56
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,879
That bitch Wen Qing

57
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,879
Even egged Sun Laoban on to slap me

58
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,360
She was begging for a lesson

59
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:52,960
And then what

60
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,960
I did not dare go back to my room

61
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,080
So I hid in the dressing room all night

62
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,120
The next day I heard people saying

63
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,039
that the puppet killed Boss Zhou

64
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,919
What on earth is going on

65
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,960
It was caused by a bracelet cutting in

66
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,639
Wen Qing is dead

67
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,759
Impossible

68
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,199
Nothing could have happened to her

69
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,560
The puppet slit her throat in the costume room

70
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,919
She died horribly

71
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,240
If you want to avenge her

72
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,759
then tell us everything honestly

73
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,560
No way

74
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,400
How could anything have happened to her

75
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,680
Sun Laoban clearly promised me

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,639
that as long as I turned myself in

77
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,280
and calmed the rumors at the nightclub

78
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,240
he would make sure Wen Qing stayed safe

79
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,080
Sun Laoban

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,919
What did he say

81
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,280
Then what leverage does he have

82
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,919
over Wen Qing in his hands

83
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,159
It is

84
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,080
No that is not right

85
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,919
This body is not Wen Qing at all

86
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,919
Wen Qing's arm was burned when she was a child

87
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,039
This body has no scar at all

88
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,000
You tricked me

89
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,000
Boss Zhou is dead

90
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,599
She is the prime suspect

91
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,560
If you do not explain everything

92
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,159
she will be thrown in the station right away

93
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,719
Stop trying to scare me

94
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,560
I do not believe you at all

95
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,199
Because of you a fake killer

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,480
another person died in the nightclub

97
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,000
If you do not want Wen Qing to get hurt

98
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,079
then you had better tell the truth

99
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,600
Wen Qing has already suffered more than enough

100
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,439
Stop hurting her any further

101
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,680
Boss Zhou never cherished her at all

102
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,759
And Sun Laoban only used photos to threaten her

103
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,040
Photos

104
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,160
Look

105
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,079
A camera inside the puppet's eye

106
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,319
No wonder Sun Laoban tried so hard to stop you

107
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,720
He was afraid you would find the camera here

108
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,480
I noticed long ago the puppet's eyes were strange

109
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,439
I dug this out with my own hands

110
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,279
Do you know

111
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,759
Inside many of the puppets

112
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,199
he put this kind of camera

113
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,160
Darn it

114
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,199
I am going to drag that pervert

115
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,079
back to the station right now

116
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,759
Wait a second

117
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,160
Since Liu Dazhu said

118
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,000
Sun Laoban used Wen Qing's photos to threaten her

119
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,040
that means he has many similar photos

120
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,399
If we act rashly

121
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,000
we might alert the snake in the grass

122
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,720
and ruin those girls good names

123
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,279
Then let us get the evidence first

124
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,199
We will split up to search

125
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,600
There is a secret room here

126
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,639
Oh my god

127
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,040
All the photos are in here hurry

128
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,120
Hurry hurry

129
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,279
Oh my god

130
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,199
This pervert

131
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,399
Look at this

132
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,120
These

133
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,560
This is from when Wu Laoban died

134
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,439
Taken from straight across

135
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,279
Does that not mean

136
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,079
he might have captured the killer

137
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,839
All of these are evidence

138
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,279
Come on

139
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,560
Do not take too many

140
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,639
Just take a few

141
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,879
That is enough

142
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,040
Where did I put the contract

143
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,439
Sun Laoban, something's wrong

144
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,879
Hurry out and take a look

145
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,399
Okay, I am coming right now

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,759
What is it

147
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,879
It is Wu Laoban, Wu Laoban has come back

148
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,920
How is that possible

149
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,040
Move, move, move

150
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:08,680
Did I not already say this

151
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,959
No one is allowed to open this room door

152
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,240
Boss, we would not dare open it

153
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,839
It opened by itself

154
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,279
Back off, back off

155
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,319
Do not delay tomorrow's performance

156
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,159
He is already dead

157
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,639
What more do you want

158
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,960
Do not play ghost tricks in front of me

159
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,480
If anything goes wrong in tomorrow's show

160
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,320
all of you are finished

161
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,399
You think that if you leave me

162
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,039
your life will be any easier

163
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,200
I am telling you

164
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
for the rest of your life

165
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,519
you will never escape the palm of my hand

166
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,360
The grand show begins, Puppet's Revenge

167
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,919
Please enjoy

168
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,440
Please

169
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,000
Please

170
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,279
Ladies and gentlemen

171
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,200
The next program we will present is

172
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,960
Puppet's Revenge

173
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,000
Let us give the warmest applause

174
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,039
to welcome the puppet master on stage

175
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,720
Is that not that same puppet

176
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,159
When do we make our move

177
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,159
After the performance ends

178
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,360
The cabaret staff still need to make a living

179
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,879
We must minimize their losses as much as we can

180
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,960
Okay, okay, okay

181
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,440
It moved, it moved

182
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,399
Okay, okay, okay

183
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,639
That is amazing

184
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,399
Yeah, this is really amazing

185
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,879
It must be a real person, it is so good

186
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
The fake looks just like the real thing

187
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,360
It feels really novel

188
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay, okay, okay

189
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,000
So impressive

190
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,559
Impressive, impressive

191
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,600
He help, help

192
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,480
All right

193
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,639

Help, help

195
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,799
Help, help

196
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,000
Help

197
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,240
Someone is dead

198
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,320
Hurry, get out

199
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,480
No, go

200
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,399
This

201
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,840
The carotid artery and jugular vein were severed

202
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,879
Instant death

203
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,440
A real pro

204
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,679
A real expert

205
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,759
All of the puppet's killing moves just now

206
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,000
were designed in advance

207
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,080
After the killing actions were completed

208
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,600
the gears inside would automatically fall off

209
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,000
Then the gear oil would seep out

210
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,120
and spontaneously ignite

211
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,279
The purpose is very clear

212
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,840
to burn the body and erase all traces

213
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,000
so we have no way to start the investigation

214
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,320
With Sun Laoban dead

215
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,200
all of our leads are cut off

216
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,440
We cannot get anything out of anyone

217
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,720
However

218
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,039
I already know who the killer is

219
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,120
Everyone

220
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,360
It has been confirmed

221
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,039
Wu Laoban and Boss Zhou

222
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,679
were both killed by Sun Laoban

223
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,720
The three of them clashed over profit

224
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,440
and in the end the split of the spoils was unequal

225
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,799
Sun Laoban held a grudge

226
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,480
and used the Art of Mechanisms to kill through the puppet

227
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,279
In the end he brought this on himself

228
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:51,240
and was killed by his own Art of Mechanisms

229
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,679
The case is closed

230
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,120
We are very sorry that our investigation

231
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,279
has affected your work and daily life

232
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,720
Miss Meigui

233
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,240
I did not expect it to be this soon

234
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,240
We meet again

235
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,679
How did you know it was me
