1
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:56,240
I respectfully invite Lord Ma, the spirit guardian

2
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,880
Please bless my granddaughter

3
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,240
Keep her safe and healthy

4
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,519
Save me

5
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,079
Grandma, Lord Ma's eyes can move

6
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,719
He can even talk

7
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,519
Lord Ma has shown his spirit

8
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,640
Lord Ma has shown his spirit

9
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,400
Help

10
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,760
Help

11
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,400
Help

12
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,760
All day long

13
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,920
what are you always fiddling with here

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,599
I am telling you

15
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,560
hurry and look for some carpentry work

16
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,000
Let go, Shuanzhu

17
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:51,920
Shuanzhu

18
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,280
Come here

19
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,799
Your dad has not been working for nothing these days

20
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,519
Take a look

21
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,879
This is the renovation plan I drew for your house

22
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,120
Six big tiled rooms here

23
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:02,920
Shuanzhu

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,719
If the house your dad designed gets built

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,480
that eldest girl from Old Li's in East Village

26
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,639
will definitely be pleased

27
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,479
And Old Li

28
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,560
have you figured out

29
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,000
how much it will cost to build this house

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,800
About three hundred silver dollars

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,439
Three hundred silver dollars

32
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,080
We only have thirty silver dollars

33
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,240
We are way short

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,719
Do not worry

35
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,400
I have just found

36
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,479
a really fast way to make money

37
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,159
helping the police station solve cases

38
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,199
Now my income

39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,800
is ten times that of carpentry work

40
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,000
Old Li

41
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,319
we are honest, decent people

42
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,400
no matter how much we earn

43
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,039
we cannot do things against heaven and conscience

44
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,240
What are you talking about

45
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,560
What I am doing now

46
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,360
is upholding justice, acting for heaven

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,439
At most I just help the police

48
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,759
crack a murder case or something

49
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:47,879
Murder cases are no good

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
That is too dangerous, we cannot go

51
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,800
What are you saying

52
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,719
I mean, Dad

53
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,599
how about we just do not

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,599
build this house

55
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,039
I am fine on my own

56
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:57,840
Shuanzhu

57
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:00,159
Your dad is solving murder cases

58
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,560
I will not do anything illegal

59
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,120
Besides, what I promised you

60
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,479
I will definitely achieve

61
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,960
Do you think I talked too much

62
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,199
When Shuanzhu says that

63
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,680
it really makes me feel bad

64
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,639
Put the plans away carefully

65
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,680
I am going to the police station

66
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,159
Are you not having a bite to eat

67
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,560
Be careful on the way

68
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,879
The deceased is male, around forty

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,280
Arms and thighs

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,000
the torso has been cut apart and separated

71
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,479
showing varying degrees of decomposition

72
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,639
Unfortunately

73
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,199
the head is missing

74
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,039
so it is hard to determine his identity

75
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,240
and the time of death

76
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,280
The deceased's liver is missing

77
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,520
Just now by the west suburbs riverbank

78
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,159
they found more severed leg remains

79
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,759
So far four body-dumping sites have been found

80
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,800
All right

81
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,479
let's first sort out the locations

82
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,639
Today they are at

83
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,240
the East Alley kitchen

84
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,519
the west suburbs riverbank

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,439
a North Street trash bin, and

86
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,279
a vegetable plot on South Road

87
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,759
Four sets of body parts were found

88
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,800
The problem is the distance between

89
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,800
each set of remains

90
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,839
is more than fifty kilometers

91
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,160
If the killer dumped them at the same time

92
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,439
how did he pull that off

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,360
He must have been driving

94
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,160
Bro

95
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,800
there is a new case again

96
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,360
What are you doing here

97
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,360
You scared me

98
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,959
I am a model citizen

99
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,000
I came to help you crack a case

100
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,120
You are short on cash again, huh

101
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,000
No matter how short on cash I am

102
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,759
it is not as urgent as our homicide, right

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,879
About that body dumping you mentioned

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,399
are the remains from the same person

105
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,439
We are not sure

106
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,079
we are still waiting for

107
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,560
Miss Su's autopsy report

108
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,600
If that is the case

109
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,720
then I can answer

110
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
the question you just asked

111
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:08,759
First

112
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,160
it is the same killer

113
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,560
who drove around and in a short time

114
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,600
dumped the body parts

115
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,079
The second possibility

116
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:19,560
is that different killers

117
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,079
dumped them separately at the same time

118
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,639
Does what I said make sense

119
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,639
The autopsy results are out

120
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,800
Sorry about that

121
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,319
I forgot you are so squeamish

122
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,639
After stitching it together, we found

123
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,399
the body surface was uneven and bumpy

124
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,120
and the limbs were damaged to varying degrees

125
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,759
The good news is

126
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
we can confirm they are all from one person

127
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,360
Th then what about the bad news

128
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,759
The left arm came from a kitchen in East Alley

129
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,160
No idea how long it soaked in that pickle jar

130
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,759
The skin decayed and became deformed

131
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,040
The torso came from the riverside in the west suburbs

132
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,680
It was also soaked until it was unrecognizable

133
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,040
The other hand and leg

134
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,920
came from a trash pile and a vegetable garden

135
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,319
All the body parts show varying degrees of decay

136
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,879
So in short

137
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,199
there is no way to confirm time of death

138
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,800
But fortunately

139
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,480
I found the cause of death

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,639
The victim's neck and heart were stabbed

141
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,920
causing fatal blood loss

142
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,279
From the wound shape and depth we can tell

143
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,360
the weapon was a carving knife

144
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,000
And during the dismemberment

145
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,680
a thin, sharp saw like this was used

146
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,360
which left messy cuts where parts connect

147
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,399
They are not clean cuts

148
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,560
So

149
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,079
the killer is definitely not a professional butcher

150
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,560
More like

151
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,120
more like

152
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,600
a rushed decision to dismember the body

153
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,639
Right

154
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,079
I recognize this kind of carving knife

155
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,079
It is usually used as

156
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,600
a special knife for stone or wood carving

157
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,680
Also, this

158
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,600
fine tooth hacksaw

159
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,199
we carpenters use it all the time

160
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,160
Some people use it to make

161
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,439
delicate wooden handicrafts

162
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,439
Does he have any other

163
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,319
distinctive features we can use to identify him

164
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,360
Oh right

165
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,800
there is a tiger head tattoo

166
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,600
Does that ring a bell

167
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,800
It looks like one I did

168
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,199
but somehow not exactly the same

169
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,519
I remember I once tattooed Hei Pi A Si

170
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,639
with a tattoo like this

171
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,120
Hei Pi A Si

172
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,399
I know him

173
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,519
That guy is addicted to gambling

174
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,680
and always sneaking around stealing things

175
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,000
He has made enemies with quite a few people

176
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,879
Then for now we

177
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,600
can only start our investigation with him first

178
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,920
The chief wants you two in his office

179
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,720
How is the dismemberment case going

180
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,680
Do you have any leads

181
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,680
We are still investigating

182
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,639
The papers are already reporting this case

183
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,000
People are getting really scared

184
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,720
Yang Zong

185
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,319
You cannot handle this alone

186
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,480
Why not let Zhao Wei work the case with you

187
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,839
Thank you chief

188
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,759
I promise I will handle this case

189
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,879
and wrap it up beautifully

190
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:00,879
No way

191
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,040
Wait what is that supposed to mean

192
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,439
Are you the only one here who can solve cases

193
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,600
Are you the only super detective

194
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,959
Are the rest of us all useless drunks

195
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,600
First time I have heard someone insult himself that badly

196
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,040
Chief look

197
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,240
We have a major breakthrough

198
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,120
We just confirmed the victim’s identity

199
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,399
It is Hei Pi A Si

200
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,079
Can you solve it within three days

201
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,279
I can

202
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,240
If we do not solve it in three days

203
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,560
I will not take a single cent of the bonus

204
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,879
I will take a demotion and assist Captain Zhao

205
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,000
Count me in too

206
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,000
Then it is a deal

207
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,399
Got it chief

208
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,800
We do not want the money

209
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,000
If we solve the case there is a bonus

210
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,080
Why would you not want it

211
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,039
I I uh well

212
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,440
The plans for that new house

213
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,559
are actually all drawn up

214
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,759
Old Li

215
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,480
What I meant was

216
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,480
if we do not solve it in three days we do not want money

217
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,480
Right right right

218
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
The three of us the three swords as one

219
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,679
will be unbeatable

220
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,360
Yeah yeah yeah

221
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,200
Exactly Old Li

222
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,440
Running cases now you are half a cop already

223
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,159
What you mean

224
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,559
you do not believe we can solve this

225
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,960
Of course I have faith

226
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
Then cut the chatter

227
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,080
Yes yes

228
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
So what should the three of us do next

229
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,039
Lets go

230
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,159
We are going to bust Hei Pi A Si s lair

231
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,679
Caught red handed with the stolen goods

232
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,320
Officer Yang, Officer Yang

233
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,279
What are you doing here

234
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,440
Wang Mazi

235
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,360
You have really made something of yourself huh

236
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,799
I thought that after you got out of prison

237
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,759
you would turn over a new leaf

238
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,320
but I did not expect you to be mixed up with Hei Pi A Si

239
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,320
all over again

240
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,399
Officer Yang

241
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,679
I I was wrong

242
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:40,960
To pay for treatment

243
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,120
I borrowed some money from Hei Pi A Si

244
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,600
I had no other choice

245
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,919
I could only run with him

246
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,960
Talk

247
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,240
Who has Hei Pi A Si offended lately

248
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,480
He has offended a lot of people

249
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,399
He is always doing petty theft

250
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,679
and cheating at the gambling house

251
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,279
He is like a rat on the street

252
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,879
even the dogs that pass by despise him

253
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,000
I live in the same room as him

254
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,879
I do not even dare to use the front door

255
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,559
Take a look

256
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,360
The weapon that stabbed the chest

257
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,919
was it a knife like this

258
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,240
It matches the wound on the body

259
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,600
Speak

260
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:16,759
Where did this stuff come from

261
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,399
Officer Yang this was not stolen by me

262
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,240
It was Hei Pi A Si

263
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,919
He stole it from that

264
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,279
Master Wu of cork painting his house

265
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,320
It was not me

266
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,919
Right here

267
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,519
Is it here

268
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,120
Why does it look like a funeral shop

269
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,519
This is definitely the place

270
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,840
Master Wu s cork paintings are famous far and wide

271
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,440
So a lot of thieves

272
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,679
come by here all the time

273
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,519
He deliberately set it up like this

274
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,519
just to scare off thieves

275
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,879
His cork paintings are really amazing

276
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Back then I even wanted to study under him

277
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,879
Anyone here anyone here

278
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:52,960
Yes

279
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,919
Hello we would like to see Master Wu

280
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,120
What do you want with him

281
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,559
We are the police

282
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,720
We are here to ask about a case

283
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,720
Teacher Wu is not seeing visitors please leave

284
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
Did you not say you knew him

285
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,279
Do not worry

286
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,320
Come with me

287
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,639
Here

288
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,120
I do not think this place is that simple

289
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:22,919
We must be careful

290
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,720
Kneel

291
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,639
Do you know you were wrong

292
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,320
A Wen is sorry master

293
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,799
A Wen was wrong

294
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,480
Is that Master Wu

295
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,480
What did you do wrong

296
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,519
As a craftsman A Wen

297
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,240
did not protect his own hands

298
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,399
As long as you understand

299
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:44,600
Cork painting uses the knife instead of the brush

300
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
It is all hand carved with great care

301
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,600
to form complex images with fine textures

302
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,360
He is talking about that carving knife

303
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,360
Your hands are very precious

304
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,279
You must protect them well

305
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,639
You are the only heir to my Wu cork painting art

306
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:00,960
You are exceptionally gifted

307
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,960
As long as you work hard and focus

308
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,799
your future achievements will surely surpass mine

309
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,200
In the future you will carve

310
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,720
many astonishing masterpieces

311
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,519
A Wen will be careful from now on

312
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,360
and never make any mistakes

313
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,799
Who is it

314
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,240
I want to see

315
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,399
which little thief it is

316
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,159
who keeps coming back again and again to steal
