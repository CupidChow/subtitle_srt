1
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,520
There are fingermark bruises on the victim's neck

2
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,840
Deep subcutaneous hemorrhaging is present

3
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,920
This matches two-handed strangulation

4
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,719
Resulting in death by asphyxiation

5
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,079
It covers it up

6
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,079
Little ghost

7
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,600
It must be a little ghost

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,039
The little ghost has come to claim a life

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,439
Aunt Xie, do not be afraid

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,480
Do not be afraid

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,239
They wanted to strangle the carpenter to death

12
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,400
At least

13
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,680
it had to be an adult about one meter seventy tall

14
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,000
The killer's method

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,480
is extremely cruel

16
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,120
Even scarier than a little ghost

17
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,599
We should find a safe place

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,480
and observe the situation first

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,319
The killer only wants to use this tactic

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,400
to trick us into leaving

21
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,000
If we really leave

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,599
we will be doing exactly what he wants

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,400
Right

24
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,159
Putting on spooky tricks, hiding everything

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,480
I want to see

26
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,359
who he is

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,719
The killer is in the dark, we are exposed

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,000
If we push him too far

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,719
our lives will be in danger too

30
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,760
What I mean is

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,200
we should find a safe place

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,719
and watch how things develop

33
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,439
It is not that I am afraid to die

34
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,799
No one said you are afraid to die

35
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,239
But if we leave

36
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,319
we will miss the best time to solve the case

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,480
If you want to leave, you leave

38
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,560
I am a police officer

39
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,799
I have to catch him no matter what

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,000
I also cannot be

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,439
a coward who clings to life and fears death

42
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,159
What do you two mean by that

43
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,519
Let me stress this again

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,959
I just want to find

45
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,519
some temporary safety

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:02,760
Fine

47
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,040
If you are not leaving

48
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,959
I will go find a safe spot first

49
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,360
Has the killer not already shown up uninvited

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,759
Brother, what do you mean by that

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,960
Just now all of us were over there chasing the killer

52
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,120
When we came back, the carpenter was dead

53
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,719
In this old house it was only you and Aunt Xie

54
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,439
So are you not the killer

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,360
Do not slander me out of greed for the estate

56
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,759
just so you can have it all to yourself

57
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,599
If I were the killer

58
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,719
would I murder my own mother

59
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,680
Uncle Xie was crushed by that beam pillar

60
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,840
I am physically weak

61
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,479
I cannot lift heavy things

62
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,360
You say you cannot, so we must believe you

63
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,479
Who would believe that

64
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,159
When Madam died

65
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,919
she was covered

66
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,080
from head to toe in children’s footprints

67
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,840
So that is how it is

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Soul-Slaying Technique

69
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,080
Madam Zhang, Xie Xin

70
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,120
and his death

71
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,680
and the Little ghost traces everywhere

72
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,000
are just like what my master told me

73
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,479
about the Soul-Slaying Technique in Lu Ban's Secret Art

74
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,719
exactly the same

75
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,879
But the dark arts in Lu Ban's Secret Art

76
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,159
are nothing but heretical nonsense, right

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,000
If someone is using this secret art

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,800
to achieve some unspeakable goal

79
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,759
that is serious trouble

80
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,759
I am the heir to Lu Ban's Secret Art

81
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,400
If anyone wants to use this secret art

82
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,319
to harm others

83
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,240
I will never just stand by and ignore it

84
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,560
Fine

85
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,199
Since the killer's method is already clear

86
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,599
I think we should do this instead

87
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,840
All of us should gather in Master Zhang's room

88
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,280
First, we can keep an eye on each other

89
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,080
Second

90
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,120
we can also protect ourselves

91
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,479
Hold on, hold on, hold on

92
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,199
Why should whatever you say

93
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,000
decide what I have to do

94
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,080
If you ask me, you three are the most suspicious

95
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,840
There is a carpenter who knows Lu Ban's Secret Art

96
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,280
over one meter seventy tall

97
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,680
so are you not the killer

98
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,680
Show some respect

99
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,360
What nonsense are you talking

100
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,599
We are doing this to protect you

101
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,159
I never asked you bastards to protect me

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,560
We were all over there just now

103
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,199
and what happened to him was here

104
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,919
Do I have the power to be in two places at once

105
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,360
Everyone

106
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,599
I think big brother has a bit of a point

107
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,199
Ever since you came to the Zhang residence

108
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,680
there has been nothing but turmoil

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,160
and people dying again and again

110
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,600
Rather than stay together with you

111
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,560
I would rather stay in my own room

112
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,199
with the doors and windows shut

113
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,279
Tomorrow morning

114
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,160
I will go to the police station to file a report

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,959
If you want to report it, just go to him

116
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,959
Let us go

117
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,680
We will go to Master Zhang's room

118
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:41,879
Auntie Xie

119
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,040
What illness does Master Zhang have

120
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,240
The doctor said

121
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,079
it is from excessive fright

122
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,600
which caused a mental disorder

123
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,199
he can only recover slowly with rest

124
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,480
But

125
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,680
before this, the master

126
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,319
invited a fortune teller who said

127
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,240
the feng shui of this old house has collapsed

128
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,480
and the yang energy is leaking out

129
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,040
so Little ghosts have come to claim lives

130
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:03,959
Auntie Xie

131
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,680
all of that is complete nonsense

132
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,360
It seems to be the eldest young master's bedroom

133
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:45,000
Again they are using Little ghosts as a cover

134
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,800
He died from a pierced heart

135
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,560
Little ghost

136
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,040
Some of the blood spatter

137
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,240
does not match the location of the wound

138
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,920
It seems that after the killer and the victim struggled

139
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,680
the killer drew those footprints

140
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,680
There is a string of numbers in blood on his left palm

141
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,879
three one four

142
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,360
three one four

143
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,120
What does it mean

144
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,439
It is the date the will is to be announced tomorrow

145
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,040
This time when big brother came back

146
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,600
he kept harping on about splitting the inheritance

147
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,680
Tomorrow happens to be March fourteenth

148
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,639
the date my father asked the lawyer to announce the will

149
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,600
The killer left these numbers

150
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,319
and that is the same day Master Zhang announces the will

151
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,839
What is the connection

152
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,439
I am not sure either

153
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,199
All of this was arranged by my father

154
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,480
If I remember correctly

155
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,879
this is also the Zhang residence's

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,839
pile-driving and foundation-laying date

157
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,720
Pile-driving and foundation laying

158
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,800
The door to the room was tightly locked

159
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,279
How did the killer get into the room to kill him

160
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,399
Secret room

161
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,160
There is a secret room entrance here

162
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,160
Nice one, Old Li

163
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,720
That makes sense now

164
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,040
How did the killer enter and leave the room

165
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,920
and create the illusion of a little ghost killing

166
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,199
The killer must be highly skilled in carpentry

167
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,600
He used the beams and pillars

168
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
the wind tunnel and this secret room

169
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,759
to plan a premeditated murder

170
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,759
So it is clear tonight's murder

171
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,199
was definitely not done on a whim

172
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,480
It must have been planned for a long time

173
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,480
Go in and take a look

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,879
Be careful

175
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,160
Stop! Who is there

176
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,480
Stop

177
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,199
Stop

178
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:15,879
This way

179
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,720
Everyone, be careful

180
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,040
When I was checking just now

181
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,480
I found that Zhang Mengs gun was missing

182
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,839
Split up and chase

183
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,920
Okay

184
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,399
Old Li, look at this

185
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,320
Isnt this my mothers gramophone

186
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,919
Found it.

187
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,759
This is the tool for faking ghosts and gods.

188
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,759
The singing travels through

189
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,639
that opening over there,

190
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,879
into the wind tunnel outside,

191
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,679
then through the wind tunnel again

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,759
and spreads out.

193
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,759
That is how the creepy sound appears.

194
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,600
Did you catch him?

195
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,159
I know who the killer is.

196
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,320
Did you find him?

197
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,919
All right, I got it.

198
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,200
What did your friend say?

199
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,960
Using the address Auntie Xie gave,

200
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,240
he went to that carpenter's house.

201
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,960
He really did not go home.

202
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,720
That matches up.

203
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,159
That matches up.

204
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,480
This carpenter

205
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,759
used his sick child as an excuse to go home,

206
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,159
creating for us

207
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,120
the illusion that he left the Zhang house.

208
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,440
In fact, he left and came back.

209
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,159
Then he found a way to hide in the secret room.

210
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,279
He knew the structure of the beams and pillars well,

211
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,440
so he used them to crush Xie Xin to death.

212
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,000
Then while the shaman carpenter was distracted,

213
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,039
he crushed the carpenter to death.

214
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,200
When the eldest young master returned to his room,

215
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,279
he caught him off guard and killed him in one move.

216
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
Each time he killed, he played

217
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,919
a creepy nursery rhyme,

218
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,919
and left the little ghost's mark.

219
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,039
He framed his carefully planned murders

220
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,679
on the little ghost.

221
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,240
And then

222
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,840
he got himself off the hook.

223
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,720
That actually sounds somewhat reasonable.

224
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,240
Then for that carpenter to kill so many people,

225
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
what was his motive?

226
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,759
To kill for money, of course.

227
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,039
Besides money,

228
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,559
there probably is nothing else.

229
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,039
That makes sense too.

230
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,919
My dad's business is huge.

231
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,840
Who knows how many livelihoods he took away.

232
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,440
He offended so many thugs and hoodlums.

233
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,360
They used the carpenter's identity as a cover

234
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,159
to sneak into the Zhangs' and seek revenge.

235
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,039
That is also understandable.

236
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,399
Dad.

237
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,360
It is all right now, Dad.

238
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,759
That faker who played at gods and ghosts,

239
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,559
the killer who caused my mom's death, has been found.

240
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,080
We will report it to the police tomorrow.

241
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,799
We will have that carpenter arrested.

242
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,279
We will avenge my mom.

243
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,279
Medicine.

244
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,240
Medicine.

245
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,399
Medicine, medicine.

246
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,360
Medicine.

247
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,679
Dad, drink your medicine.

248
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,879
I am fine.

249
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,080
Dad.

250
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,559
Thanks.

251
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,720
I will ask Auntie Xie to cook you another bowl.

252
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:22,960
Thanks.

253
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,639
All right.

254
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,240
I will have Auntie Xie do it.

255
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,679
You rest well first.

256
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:27,399
Thanks.

257
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,240
The killer's goal was to kill Master Zhang.

258
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,679
Then why did he kill Xie Xin?

259
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,519
And why did the eldest young master leave that date?

260
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,840
None of this adds up.

261
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,279
We have all been busy all night.

262
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,840
You must all be hungry.

263
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,159
I made some flatbreads.

264
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,519
Everyone, have some to fill your stomachs.

265
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,159
Auntie Xie, you are so thoughtful.

266
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,360
I have not eaten all night.

267
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,279
I am about to faint from hunger.

268
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,480
Then eat some more.

269
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:00,679
Thank you, Auntie Xie.

270
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,600
Thanks.

271
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,360
Dad.

272
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:06,600
What is wrong with you?

273
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:08,639
Second young master,

274
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,759
the master might be hungry too.

275
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,919
I will feed him some flatbread.

276
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,200
You go and eat with everyone else.

277
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
Smells so good.

278
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,039
It really does.

279
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,240
Eat.

280
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,080
Fresh out of the pan is the best.

281
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,440
Zhang Meng is dead.

282
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,480
Zhang Sheng will die too.

283
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,080
Do not rush.

284
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,600
You are next.
