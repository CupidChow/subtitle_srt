1
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:47,880
Yang Zong

2
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,400
Detective Yang

3
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,800
It will not open

4
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,360
Detective Yang

5
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,800
Are you in there

6
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:00,639
This one will not open either

7
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,840
Detective Yang

8
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,000
Y you wait a moment

9
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:09,960
Do not move

10
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,000
Do not panic

11
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,639
The body was switched

12
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,480
I know

13
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,679
The killer is A Wen

14
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,199
Hurry they are about to leave town

15
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:36,800
Uncle Chen

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,239
I have not said goodbye to Master yet

17
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,039
There is no time

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,079
Where there is life

19
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,199
There is hope

20
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,159
Do not waste your dads painstaking efforts

21
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,400
Stop

22
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:55,239
Man Tun turn around

23
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,079
Why is he here

24
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,880
Was he not in the cabinet

25
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:00,840
Stop

26
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,280
Stop

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,639
Do not move

28
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,480
Come any closer and I will kill myself

29
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:08,559
So you dead men tell no tales

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,360
A Wen

31
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,400
Do not do anything stupid

32
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,880
A Wen put the carving knife down first

33
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,320
You are a craftsman

34
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,519
How can you let your tools be stained with blood

35
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,679
Can you face Master Wu if you do this

36
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,679
You will not get away

37
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,119
Come back to the station with me now

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,599
Fight for lenient treatment

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
If you flee from justice the penalty will be harsher

40
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,360
Explain everything clearly

41
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,760
Only then can Xiang Zi have a way out

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,719
On the twentieth

43
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,480
It was supposed to be the happiest day of my life

44
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,000
These are the tools your Master

45
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:48,519
passed down to you for cork painting

46
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:49,920
Yes

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,360
This is the legacy of the Wu lineage

48
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:54,800
This ancestral carving knife

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,840
can shrink landscapes into a tiny frame

50
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,039
so towering peaks over tens of thousands of li

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
are all contained in one frame

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,840
Starting today

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,760
it is passed to your generation

54
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,199
Thank you Master

55
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,400
Dad

56
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,800
Master passed the carving knife to me today too

57
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,719
Really

58
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,400
A Wen

59
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:17,079
Since Master values you so much

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,800
you must study hard

61
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:19,960
Do not worry Dad

62
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,159
I will definitely study hard

63
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
and make our family proud

64
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,280
Your mom in the afterlife will be happy too

65
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Good child

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,920
A Wen

67
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:30,039
Go back to your room first

68
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,519
Dad is going out for a bit

69
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:35,320
Dad

70
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,840
What is wrong

71
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,239
I am going to see Boss Qin

72
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:41,440
Did Boss Qin dock all your wages again

73
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,880
I scraped the rickshaw while driving

74
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,639
It is right to pay some money

75
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,519
He is clearly just nitpicking

76
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,440
It is normal to bump the rickshaw sometimes

77
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,920
How can he be so mean

78
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,920
Dad

79
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,119
You need to stand tall

80
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,760
You cannot let him bully you anymore

81
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,440
All right all right

82
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,039
Dad will go buy some drinks and food

83
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,760
We father and son will celebrate properly

84
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,239
Okay go back go back

85
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay

86
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,039
Boss Qin

87
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,360
I am here to apologize to you

88
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:19,519
About that rickshaw

89
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,039
I really did not damage it on purpose

90
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,599
I am willing to repay you with my wages

91
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,039
Boss Qin

92
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,039
Wages

93
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:28,920
Wages

94
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,239
What wages

95
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,400
You broke my rickshaw

96
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:33,840
and still dare to ask me for wages

97
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,039
Boss Qin

98
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,239
Y you could at least

99
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
give me a little pay

100
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,760
I still have to support my son

101
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,519
Next month we will have nothing to eat at home

102
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,079
Boss Qin

103
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,079
What does your son have to do with me

104
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,639
You are just a poor dog filthy all over

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,519
It is because I got too close

106
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:50,280
to you poor dogs

107
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,760
that my luck has been so bad

108
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,400
I lost sixty dollars today

109
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,400
Boss Qin

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,559
How about this

111
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,760
Y you give me next months wages

112
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,960
Let me advance a bit please

113
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:01,920
Just a tiny advance I

114
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,559
Poor dog can you not understand human words

115
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,360
The wages belong to my dad

116
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,360
On what grounds do you refuse

117
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:09,960
Hey brat you have grown bold

118
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,159
to talk to me like that

119
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,119
Why would I not dare

120
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:12,719
A Wen

121
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,239
I do not believe there is no justice in this world

122
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,039
If you do not pay my dad I will sue you

123
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,360
and let the law uphold justice

124
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,039
You

125
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:20,239
You damned brat you must have a death wish

126
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,440
Boss Qin Boss Qin

127
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:25,159
Boss Qin I

128
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:25,920
I do not want the wages anymore

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,480
Get out of my way

130
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,320
Dad Dad

131
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,000
I will kill you

132
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,559
You little brat

133
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:37,679
Brat you want to kill me

134
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,719
I

135
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,000
A Wen

136
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,199
A Wen

137
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,159
Qin Qin, Boss Qin

138
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,880
Dad

139
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:55,960
Hurry

140
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,119
Get out of here, quick

141
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:58,679
Go, now

142
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,239
Okay, okay, I will go first

143
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:01,639
So you are saying

144
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,800
that in a panic

145
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,320
you accidentally killed Boss Qin

146
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:06,760
Yes

147
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,079
He was very strong

148
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,039
It was like he was going to strangle me to death

149
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:11,840
I had no choice

150
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:15,760
Then how did Heipi A-Si get involved

151
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,039
What happened after that

152
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,960
I am not sure either

153
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,920
The next night my dad came back and told me

154
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,000
he had taken care of everything

155
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,679
and that none of it was my concern anymore

156
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,400
And how did you all get dragged into this case

157
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,039
On the night of the twenty first

158
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,679
Man Tun and I finished our last fare

159
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,880
and were about to take a shortcut back to the depot

160
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,239
when we suddenly ran into

161
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,960
Xiang Zi moving Boss Qin's corpse

162
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,320
We had pulled rickshaws with Xiang Zi for years

163
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:48,519
we were like real brothers

164
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,320
He had thought about it all day and night

165
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,280
and still could not figure out

166
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,679
how to move Boss Qin's body

167
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,079
We already hated Boss Qin

168
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,159
he always cheated us out of our hard earned wages

169
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,039
But among the younger ones A Wen

170
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,599
was the most promising child

171
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:04,840
None of us could bear

172
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,480
to just watch him go to prison

173
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,119
Brother Xiang Zi, Brother Xiang Zi

174
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,440
Xiang Zi

175
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,960
We could throw the body in the river

176
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,639
and make it look like an accidental drowning

177
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,000
No

178
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,159
He has knife wounds on his chest

179
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,519
The police would find out right away

180
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,079
Ma Wangye, help us

181
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,079
Show us a way out

182
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,440
I will show you a way out

183
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
Cut the body up

184
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,199
and toss it in all directions

185
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,199
No one will know whose body it is

186
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,679
then they cannot trace it back to A Wen as the killer

187
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:39,760
A-Si

188
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:41,400
What do you want

189
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:43,199
Boss Qin owed me money and would not pay

190
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,960
Your son killed him

191
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,800
Now I have no way to get my money back

192
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,519
So how about you pay it back for him

193
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,480
Not much, just one hundred silver dollars

194
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,840
A-Si, I beg you

195
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:54,239
The three of us together

196
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,559
cannot scrape together even one dollar, have mercy

197
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,320
You cannot

198
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,920
Then I will go to the police right now

199
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,679
and send your precious son to prison

200
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,599
You

201
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,400
Brother Xiang Zi

202
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
What do we do now

203
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:10,719
Th this

204
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:11,800
Xiang Zi

205
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,519
That is two lives, Xiang Zi

206
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:14,440
Xiang Zi

207
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,519
What are we going to do

208
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,560
This

209
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,880
I have an idea

210
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,920
They are about the same build

211
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,239
I will smash both of their faces

212
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,439
so the police cannot recognize them

213
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,800
then switch their bodies

214
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,079
On Boss Qin

215
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:35,079
tattoo Heipi A-Si's tiger head tattoo

216
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,319
Then, following Heipi A-Si's idea

217
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,239
we dismember him

218
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,640
and throw the parts all around

219
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,880
Then we put Heipi A-Si

220
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:42,359
in Boss Qin's clothes

221
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,119
and place him inside the Ma Wangye wood carving

222
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,119
No one will know

223
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,359
no one will see through it

224
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,960
Even if they see it

225
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:49,960
they will not think our A Wen did it

226
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,880
because the time of the crime does not match

227
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:55,159
Early that morning

228
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,640
he had already explained

229
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,640
If we could keep it hidden

230
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,319
all four of us would be fine

231
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,600
If we could not

232
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,520
he would shoulder all the crimes

233
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,520
and not drag any of us down

234
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:13,000
My dad did everything for me

235
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,720
He swallowed his anger with Boss Qin

236
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,800
also for my sake

237
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:17,439
He tried every possible way

238
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,199
just to help me escape conviction

239
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,279
But

240
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:22,720
I cannot escape my conscience

241
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,800
After that day

242
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,560
Do not kill me

243
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,319
I did not mean to

244
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,640
I did not mean to

245
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,560
Do not, do not kill me

246
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,720
A Wen, A Wen

247
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,560
A Wen

248
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,079
Dad, Dad

249
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,159
Boss Qin's ghost came for me

250
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,399
He came for me

251
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,000
He wants my life in return

252
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:39,800
Alright, it is okay, it is okay

253
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:41,880
Even if Boss Qin comes, he will come for Dad

254
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:43,079
You will be fine

255
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:44,640
Go to sleep, go to sleep

256
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:47,199
My dad burned paper money and cut his nails

257
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
not for himself

258
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,520
all just to ease my mind

259
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,760
Then your wrist

260
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,159
how did it get hurt

261
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,560
I could not bear the torment inside

262
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,960
and tried to kill myself

263
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:03,319
Uncle Chen and the others found me in time

264
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,800
and saved my life

265
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,800
I have failed everyone

266
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,399
especially Master

267
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,199
I am willing to confess and accept punishment

268
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,720
but I hope

269
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:15,560
to see Master one more time

270
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:18,319
I want to kneel before him and admit my wrongs

271
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,800
A Wen has wronged Master

272
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,880
and failed his guidance and care

273
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,199
I have brought shame on the Wu School of Cork Painting

274
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,359
Please expel me from the Wu School

275
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,039
I will have no complaints

276
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,960
There is no greater good than correcting mistakes

277
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,600
There is no greater good than that

278
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,000
Come back after you have paid for your crimes

279
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,319
Master

280
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,920
will always be your Master

281
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:52,640
Dad

282
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:56,239
A Wen

283
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:57,560
A Wen, I am sorry, Dad

284
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,000
A Wen admits his fault to you

285
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,520
A Wen

286
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:07,479
A Wen, Dad

287
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,039
Dad is useless

288
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:10,000
Dad

289
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:12,439
Dad is the one who ruined you

290
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,840
Dad, it is A Wen who wronged you

291
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,399
What a pity for such a cork painting genius

292
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,479
He will have to spend his time in prison

293
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,239
The law is the law

294
00:11:58,319 --> 00:11:59,880
If you kill someone, you must take responsibility

295
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,800
Everyone must for their own actions

296
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,319
pay the price

297
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:06,399
I contacted a lawyer

298
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,720
to defend him as justifiable defense

299
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,159
I hope

300
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,359
he can get a lighter sentence

301
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:27,640
Ma Wangye's back has been tampered with

302
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,399
Two kinds of wood are joined together

303
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,960
Ordinary people cannot see any difference at all

304
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:35,439
This is what Lu Ban's Secret Art calls

305
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:36,960
the Art of Grafting

306
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,000
Could it be him again

307
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,560
Mu Dun, huh

308
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,680
The case is solved, why can you not rest

309
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,119
Go to sleep

310
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,000
The Wood Carving Corpse Case

311
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:51,680
It definitely was not done by one person

312
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,000
A rickshaw puller

313
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,439
How could he possibly know so much

314
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,840
Behind these cases

315
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,760
there must be someone else
