1
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,439
See that?

2
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,120
The Qiao family is also a very grand household.

3
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,480
Even if we go in through the back door,

4
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,319
there are probably guards inside too.

5
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,799
Who said we were using this way?

6
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,079
Which way then?

7
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:28,719
That way.

8
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,680
The courtyard wall is so high.

9
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,920
You two might get over it,

10
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,319
but with my old arms and legs,

11
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,439
I cannot make it over.

12
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,519
Then there is a second way.

13
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,519
Where?

14
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,680
Have you heard that saying?

15
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,319
A scholar can be killed, but not humiliated.

16
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,159
All right, all right, then you...

17
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:43,879
Then take your time.

18
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,200
We will go in first and wait for you.

19
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,239
Come on.

20
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,280
Hey, there is no guard here.

21
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,879
Have you ever heard a saying?

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,680
A scholar can be killed, but not humiliated.

23
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,639
I will never crawl through a dog hole.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,919
Have you heard another saying?

25
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,080
It goes, a true man knows when to yield and when to assert himself.

26
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,599
Hurry up.

27
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,879
Do not go, give me a hand.

28
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,280
Pull me, I am stuck.

29
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,120
So much for knowing when to yield and assert yourself.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
Keep your voice down.

31
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,800
Go, go, go, over there.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,680
Master, Furen is missing.

33
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,680
Furen is missing.

34
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,919
Was Furen not resting properly in her room?

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,319
How did she suddenly disappear?

36
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,280
Tell the servants

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,199
to search the courtyard carefully.

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,280
You hurry and prepare the young master’s Ghost marriage.

39
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,960
We cannot have any mishaps this time.

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,599
Do you hear me?

41
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,319
Yes, Master.

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,240
Hurry.

43
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,199
Furen.

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,560
Furen.

45
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,800
This old man

46
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,439
this old man

47
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,759
is actually holding a Ghost marriage with a living person.

48
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,759
We have to drag him into the station.

49
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,479
Right now,

50
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,159
there might be another bride

51
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,280
locked up somewhere.

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,560
Here is what we do.

53
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,800
We search inside the house.

54
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,000
There must be more clues.

55
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,000
Follow me, I know the way.

56
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:18,960
Okay.

57
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,680
Come.

58
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,680
The coffin is prepared for the Ghost marriage bride.

59
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,159
See?

60
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,560
Tomorrow

61
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,840
the Ghost marriage must be held.

62
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,599
Could the bride be inside?

63
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,080
What is it?

64
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,280
There seems to be something inside.

65
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,800
There is something inside.

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,920
That is odd, I just pushed it lightly and it opened.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,480
It opened just now,

68
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,519
but now it will not budge.

69
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,560
Then someone must have tampered with the coffin.

70
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,279
Why is there a strange noise inside?

71
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,519
Could it be him?

72
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,199
Tie them all up for me!

73
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,959
Let me go!

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,199
You there, Master Qiao—

75
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,399
I...

76
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,920
My dad is the bureau chief!

77
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,360
If he finds out you treated me like this,

78
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,160
you will be in serious trouble, I am warning you!

79
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,519
Your dad

80
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,639
never told you that breaking into a private home

81
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,000
is a crime that gets you punished?

82
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,399
Speak.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,480
Where did you take my wife?

84
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,160
Where have you hidden her?

85
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,800
We have never even seen Qiao Furen!

86
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,360
Ever since you people came to my house,

87
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,560
my wife has been missing.

88
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,199
Looks like if I do not torture you,

89
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,720
you will not confess.

90
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,120
Come on then, bring the torture!

91
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,800
Master Qiao,

92
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,399
the government forbids private torture, it is illegal.

93
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,720
Against the law.

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,000
Then I will pry open your mouth first.

95
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,319
Come, start with him.

96
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,199
No, no, no!

97
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,560
Master Qiao, I found Qiao Furen in the cabi—

98
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,000
in the chest and rescued her, I...

99
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,000
The government forbids ghost marriage with living people!

100
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,079
There is a living person in the coffin!

101
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,120
Hurry!

102
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,399
Master Qiao!

103
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,959
There is fresh blood flowing inside this coffin!

104
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,480
There is a living person in the coffin!

105
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,480
I am a carpenter!

106
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Hurry up and untie me!

107
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,600
Saving a life is what matters now!

108
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,959
Untie me quickly!

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,879
Quick, untie him!

110
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,560
Come on, loosen these ropes!

111
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,399
Hurry, hurry!

112
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,040
Come on!

113
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,920
Everyone, give a hand, help out, hurry!

114
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,600
Come on, faster!

115
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,079
Open the coffin, come on!

116
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,279
One, two—

117
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,279
three!

118
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,000
One!

119
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,680
Two!

120
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,480
Three!

121
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,839
One, two—

122
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:19,959
Move aside!

123
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,399
Come on!

124
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,639
One, two—

125
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,519
Lift!

126
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,160
Qiao Furen!

127
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,720
My lady!

128
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,079
She must have been struck by some evil sorcery.

129
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,800
Master Qiao,

130
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,600
there is no such thing as evil sorcery in this world.

131
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,800
What killed your wife definitely was not sorcery.

132
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,079
It should have been

133
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,360
a top carpenter skilled in the Art of Mechanisms.

134
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,360
Could it be him?

135
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,399
After him!

136
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,720
Officer Yang

137
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,240
Officer Yang

138
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,399
What is this

139
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,720
What is this thing

140
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,399
Third quarter of si hour, ruined temple north of town

141
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
If you are late, you miss your chance

142
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Did the killer leave this

143
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,720
Are we going to go

144
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,680
Of course we are

145
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,680
Wai wait wait

146
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,839
If we are really going

147
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,639
Officer Yang is not here, it is just us two

148
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,560
Should we go back and call more people from the station

149
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,600
Fine, then go to the station and turn yourself in

150
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,439
Why would I confess, I am not the killer

151
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,879
Did you not say it yourself

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,040
The killer is a top level carpenter

153
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,920
So now, besides Yang Zong

154
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,160
who can clear you of suspicion

155
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,920
And there is no time to call in more officers

156
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,680
Let us go

157
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,360
Is this not the Yellow Immortal temple

158
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,399
Some people say

159
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,039
this place is haunted

160
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,679
Others say

161
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,480
every full moon

162
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,720
the Yellow Immortal

163
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,720
holds some kind of

164
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,000
banquet right here

165
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:45,679
Some even say

166
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,799
that right here

167
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,519
they have seen a Yellow Immortal as tall as a person

168
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,679
It is someone in a costume

169
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,039
People like that are either crazy

170
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,720
or fugitives who cannot show their faces

171
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,039
I do not know about fugitives

172
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,320
but catching fugitives

173
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,240
is your police work too, right

174
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,639
If this case gets solved

175
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,120
I will have my father give you a bonus

176
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,600
What bonus would I get

177
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,799
Young miss

178
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,320
Someone lives here

179
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,720
I knew it

180
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,879
All this haunting stuff must be man made

181
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,639
What puzzles me is

182
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,039
who lured us here

183
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,200
No idea

184
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,600
But the killer will definitely show up

185
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,480
Who

186
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,039
Just now, was not there three statues

187
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,840
What was that sound, who is there

188
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,000
Who is it

189
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,679
Yuan Laoban

190
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Lao Yuan

191
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,039
What are you doing here

192
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,879
It is the fifteenth again

193
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,399
Same old rules

194
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,639
I have to pay my respects

195
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,559
Wha what rules

196
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,919
People in his line of work

197
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,360
always find somewhere to pray on the first and fifteenth

198
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,720
Lao Yuan, tonight will not be peaceful

199
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,120
You had better hurry home

200
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,679
I can not

201
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,639
If I do not pray, I feel uneasy

202
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,480
The window

203
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,759
Darn it, we have walked into a trap

204
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,960
You mean we fell into Lao Yuan s trap

205
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,279
If I had known it would be like this

206
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,320
I would not have come

207
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,799
Stop pretending to be ghosts and gods

208
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,320
If you have got guts come out and talk

209
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,360
Who, who is it

210
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,519
Go
