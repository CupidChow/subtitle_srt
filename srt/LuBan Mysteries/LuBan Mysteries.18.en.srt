1
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,039
Lao Li

2
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:03,840
Ma Wangye, spare my life

3
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,079
Ma... Ma Wangye

4
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,280
Spa spare spare my life

5
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,239
Lao Li

6
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,079
Lao Li

7
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,120
Lao Li

8
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,719
Are you clearheaded now

9
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
When did you all get here

10
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,640
What just happened

11
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,400
Just now

12
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,760
You must have been drugged with a hallucinogen

13
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,920
Or you would not have acted like that

14
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,200
I truly do not know if I was drugged or not

15
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,959
But what I do know is

16
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,840
there is a killer who wants to murder me

17
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,200
But who this person is

18
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,120
I do not know

19
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,680
Lao Li

20
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,200
What did you just find out

21
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,959
Behind the Ma Wangye statue

22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,719
I found the material used to patch the wood

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,159
It was just as I imagined

24
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
It was Chinese cork oak

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,039
It is the special material

26
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,520
used to make cork paintings

27
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,879
Cork painting wood hid the body

28
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,919
A cork painting carving knife was used to kill

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,240
It is obvious

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,319
the killer is the same person

31
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,879
Lao Li

32
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,199
You most likely hit the killer where it hurts

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,159
So he lashed out like a cornered dog

34
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,439
I think so too

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,960
Someone came to my mind

36
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,039
All right

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,840
Let us give it a try

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,599
Master

39
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,120
Your skills are impressive

40
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,719
This wheel has rattled for years

41
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,240
You really fixed it as soon as you touched it

42
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,240
Do you know what the problem was

43
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,360
There is a crossbeam under this seat

44
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,280
The clip came loose

45
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,039
I found a new clip

46
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,759
Put it in and it is fine

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,639
Why are the dark circles under your eyes so bad

48
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,159
And your brow looks ominous

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,120
No way

50
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,479
It can not be because

51
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,960
there is a vengeful spirit in the house right

52
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,080
You you

53
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,240
What did you say

54
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,479
I I am not just talking nonsense

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,319
I have studied Qimen Dunjia

56
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,159
I will tell you a way to break it

57
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,960
You just need to find

58
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,759
the dead spirit body’s fingernails and hair

59
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,000
And then what

60
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,759
Then mix them with hen fat and quicklime

61
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,120
At

62
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,039
Right at the Hour of the Rat

63
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,400
put it in an iron basin

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,719
and bury it in the southwest corner of the house

65
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,159
Then the spirits will be driven away

66
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,199
and you will be kept safe

67
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,199
You

68
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,520
You you mean

69
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,639
what you said is real

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,240
What I said may not be completely right

71
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,479
but that is what Qimen Dunjia records

72
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,040
How dare you

73
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,839
You... y-you, you...

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,240
Why did you try to hurt me

75
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,079
N-no, it was not me

76
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,839
It was not me

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,079
I was not the one who harmed you

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,639
Then why did you still burn spirit money for me

79
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,920
I... I just

80
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,160
I just wanted some peace of mind

81
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,399
I am begging you

82
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,319
Boss Qin almost docked

83
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,920
all of your wages

84
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,959
Why did you still say he was a good man

85
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,000
I... I, I...

86
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:50,959
I know

87
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,759
He was not a good man

88
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,079
I used to curse him to die all the time

89
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,120
I changed my words just to lessen my verbal karma

90
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,480
You have not said a single true word

91
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,519
Today you are going to confess everything you know

92
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,079
That is right

93
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,680
I did it all

94
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,759
That night

95
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,079
the one that carpenter Li saw

96
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,439
the moving Ma Wangye statue

97
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,800
that was me in disguise too

98
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,560
Speak

99
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,959
What really happened

100
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,399
Boss Qin docked all of my wages

101
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,040
I knew he had just gone to the casino

102
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,759
so I blocked him on the road

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
But not only did he refuse to pay me

104
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,120
he even cursed me as a mangy dog

105
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,800
He insulted my son, insulted my whole family

106
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,680
I did not expect A Wen would worry about me

107
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,000
and follow right behind me the whole way

108
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,399
A Wen could not swallow the anger

109
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,759
and went to argue with Boss Qin

110
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,319
Boss Qin flew into a rage out of shame

111
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,680
and threatened to kill A Wen

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
In a fit of anger

113
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,600
I shoved him against the wall

114
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,439
I accidentally

115
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,319
made him smash his head open

116
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:54,720
Boss Qin

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,920
I let A Wen leave first

118
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,480
I was going to take Boss Qin to see a doctor

119
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,879
But when I thought of what he had done

120
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,079
In my heart, I...

121
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,519
I hated him so much that I...

122
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,240
I just decided to walk away

123
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,360
The next day

124
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,279
I was drinking with my coworkers

125
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,000
But I still felt uneasy

126
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,199
When my coworkers got drunk

127
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,839
I used the excuse of going to the privy

128
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,279
and went to take a look

129
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,680
Boss Qin was lying on the ground unconscious

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,079
I wanted to throw him into the river

131
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,519
and make it look like an accidental drowning

132
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,680
But I unexpectedly ran into Heipi A Si

133
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,879
That scoundrel Heipi A Si

134
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,480
He told me to give him 100 silver dollars

135
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,439
as hush money

136
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,399
There was no way I could pay that much

137
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,800
He threatened me

138
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,759
He said he would go to the police

139
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,360
In a fit of rage

140
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,040
I pulled out the carving knife I had on me

141
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,800
and stabbed Heipi A Si to death

142
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,199
When dawn came

143
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,680
I was afraid someone would find out

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,639
so I took Boss Qin's body

145
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,040
and hid it for the time being in the Ma Wangye carving

146
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,199
As for Heipi A Si, I could only dismember him

147
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:56,959
I thought

148
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,079
I had done everything without anyone noticing

149
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,639
But I did not expect

150
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,839
you would still see through the clues

151
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,920
But throwing the body out toward

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,720
the four directions east, south, west, and north

153
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,639
is not something one person can do

154
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,040
Here is how it worked

155
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,360
After I dismembered the body

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,839
I put the parts into bundles

157
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,720
Then I hid the bundles

158
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,399
under the rickshaws

159
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,240
and set up a mechanism

160
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,800
I knew each rickshaw driver's

161
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,560
usual area and route

162
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
When the time came

163
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,480
the mechanism released and the bundle fell off

164
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,399
They did not know about any of this

165
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,480
Dumping the body was done by me alone

166
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,759
Oh, right

167
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,000
Then why did you take

168
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,399
Heipi A Si's liver

169
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,879
What did you take the liver for

170
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
The liver, his liver

171
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,759
I did not take his liver

172
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,279
You must have gotten it wrong

173
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,279
Then where did you hide his head

174
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,960
Under the tree in the back yard of the rickshaw yard

175
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,480
The head had been boiled

176
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,759
It was no longer recognizable

177
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,679
The killer is really bold

178
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,320
He actually dared to bury it here

179
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,360
But this case is finally close to being solved

180
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,840
No, something is wrong

181
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,720
Everything has gone a little too smoothly

182
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:14,960
I will go to A Wen's place first

183
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,399
You keep examining the body

184
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,399
Detective Yang

185
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,120
Detective Yang

186
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,240
If you kill, you must pay with your life

187
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,559
Do you know how much I hurt

188
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,159
Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed to death alive

189
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,080
Master Qin

190
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,519
I did not mean to

191
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,519
I am going to kill your dad

192
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,919
And kill you beastly drivers too

193
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,039
Son

194
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,360
Your dad died so miserably

195
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,039
Ma Wangye is coming to claim my life

196
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,960
The police are coming to claim my life too

197
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,519
This is all your fault

198
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,840
This is all your fault

199
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:12,720
It is all your fault all your fault

200
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,879
This is all your fault

201
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,200
This is all your fault

202
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,240
A Wen your dad has been taken away

203
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,120
Let us go

204
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,440
Police open the door

205
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,080
Detective Yang

206
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,679
Do you still need something

207
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,080
Your dad turned himself in

208
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,320
I have some questions for you

209
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,440
Impossible

210
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,879
What crime did my dad commit

211
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,440
Have you finished your investigation

212
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,399
Listen to me

213
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,919
Your dad personally confessed to killing Heipi A Si

214
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,840
And Boss Qin

215
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,799
Let us talk inside

216
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,840
You are all here

217
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,399
I have to say you are really skilled

218
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,039
You could even stitch this back together

219
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,279
But hey do you not feel

220
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,759
Something about it seems a bit off

221
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,240
The build of this body

222
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,679
Is very similar to Boss Qin

223
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,080
Right

224
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,039
I think it looks a bit like him too

225
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,120
That is what is strange

226
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,320
On the night of the twentieth you and your father

227
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,639
Ran into Boss Qin

228
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
What exactly happened between you

229
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,679
Boss Qin withheld all of my dad's wages

230
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,720
My dad and I went to ask him for the money

231
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,399
Not only did he not give me the money

232
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,759
He even cursed me as a poor dog

233
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,600
He cursed my whole family and shoved my dad

234
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,639
I could not swallow that anger

235
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,960
So I went to argue with Boss Qin

236
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,200
He flew into a rage and threatened to kill me

237
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,879
My dad told me to leave first

238
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,600
After that my dad

239
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,240
Kept apologizing to Boss Qin

240
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,720
My dad really is a coward

241
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,559
But he could not possibly kill anyone

242
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,759
All right calm down

243
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,559
Boss Qin died on the twenty first

244
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,519
It has nothing to do with my dad

245
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,720
Can you show me

246
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,360
The carving knife you use for cork painting

247
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,960
All right I will go get it now

248
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,240
Detective Yang have some tea

249
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,519
About Xiang Zi

250
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,279
I still hope you will get to the bottom of it

251
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,679
He is an honest man

252
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,960
He could not be a killer

253
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,039
Yes

254
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,240
That is why I came to investigate more clearly

255
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:23,919
It matches completely

256
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
It matches completely

257
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,639
I understand now

258
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,639
The bodies were switched

259
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,639
The one hidden in the wood carving is Heipi A Si

260
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,759
The one dismembered was Boss Qin

261
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,480
A Wen and those two rickshaw drivers

262
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,799
Their alibis are all fake
