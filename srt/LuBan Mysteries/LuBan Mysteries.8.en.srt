1
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,480
It is me, it is me, it is me

2
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,560
It is me

3
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:19,959
Why are you grabbing me

4
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:20,760
It is you

5
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,079
I already guessed it long ago

6
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,239
You are the killers

7
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,040
Quit playing ghost, I will blow your head off

8
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,680
No no no

9
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,680
Your gun is loaded

10
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,599
Hurry hurry hurry, put it down

11
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,599
It is not me, it really is not me

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
Cut it out you

13
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,519
If it is not you, why were you hiding there

14
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,000
You just said the killer understands roof beam structure

15
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,040
He is a carpenter

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
Are you not a carpenter

17
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,760
Yes, I am indeed a carpenter

18
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,280
But you kept asking me

19
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,280
about that nursery rhyme coming from all directions

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,560
So I just came out to find the reason

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,319
This wind tunnel has

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,680
a direct link to the nursery rhyme

23
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,439
that you want to understand

24
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,840
You do not believe me, right, come on

25
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,239
Take a look

26
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,680
Do you hear it

27
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,920
Do you hear it

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,920
See, they are connected right

29
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,799
No no no

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,760
You even understand the principle of this wind tunnel

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,360
Are you not the killer then

32
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,759
Of course I am not the killer

33
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,280
I just came to this courtyard, right

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,759
I am actually not familiar with it yet

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,240
And Xie Shen said

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,360
it has been haunted for two months

37
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,520
I think the killer

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,159
must know the overall layout of this yard

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
and the beam structure

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,840
If he is not an insider

41
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:26,439
he could not pull this off

42
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,280
Are you about to say that I

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,439
am that killer again

44
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,319
I did not say you are the killer

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,199
What I mean is

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,919
the killer is very likely a carpenter

47
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,080
This wind tunnel

48
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,840
was clearly left here

49
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,319
when the old house was built

50
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,759
If this person

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,120
does not know a bit of carpentry

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,120
he would never think to use this

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,319
I did not make this

54
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,479
Master Zhang back then

55
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,759
paid double the usual wage

56
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,560
I I only wanted

57
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,039
to work more for him and earn more money

58
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,960
I had no reason to go against him, right

59
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,960
The killer amplified the sound

60
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,400
of the nursery rhyme in all directions

61
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,039
to cause panic among everyone

62
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,560
That way

63
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,159
he could shift suspicion away from himself

64
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,639
and onto the little ghost

65
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,599
So as long as we find

66
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,159
the one playing the creepy nursery rhyme

67
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,400
we can find the real killer

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,599
Yes

69
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,800
That is exactly the logic

70
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,639
All right

71
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,919
Find the little ghost

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,120
Break it up, everyone disperse

73
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,159
Have you noticed

74
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,240
whenever they say the carpenter is the killer

75
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,080
that Zhang Meng goes after Lao Li

76
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,759
But he has never suspected

77
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,680
the carpenter right by his side

78
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,800
I noticed that long ago

79
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,199
So I find that really strange

80
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,800
Here is what we do

81
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,120
Let us go keep a close eye on that man

82
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,319
Miss Su

83
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,560
You go keep an eye on Xie Shen

84
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,639
Her husband just died

85
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,439
She is very likely the killer's next target

86
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,159
Okay

87
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,639
Let us go

88
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,719
Brother

89
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,960
How about this

90
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,879
This Zhang Meng is scarier than the killer

91
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,560
Why not let me follow Miss Su first

92
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,000
Then it is happily decided

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
Miss Su

94
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,039
Young master

95
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,439
No, I cannot

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,039
I feel more and more that something is wrong

97
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,719
No, I have to get out of here fast

98
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,520
If the police catch us

99
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,919
neither of us will get away

100
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,240
What are you afraid of

101
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,759
We are about to succeed

102
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,839
If you walk away now

103
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,839
after all the effort we put in

104
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,439
we will end up with nothing at all

105
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,480
Young master

106
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,879
Ancestor, please, is that acceptable

107
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,360
It has already come to this point

108
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,199
Do you think money or your life matters more

109
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,480
No, I just

110
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,680
I am timid

111
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,480
I cannot afford to play this game

112
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,639
Young master

113
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,079
I take my leave

114
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,800
Young master

115
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,480
You cannot do this, young master

116
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,279
I have elders above and children below

117
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,800
Let me go this once, will you, young master

118
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,079
I want him dead

119
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:50,959
No

120
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,360
He, he is your own father

121
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,600
My own father

122
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,240
Has he ever treated me as his own son

123
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,079
Twenty years ago

124
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,399
my mother died despite treatment

125
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,040
That man

126
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,639
less than three months after my mother died

127
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,560
brought a new woman into the house

128
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,959
Later I learned

129
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,240
it was not that my mother’s illness could not be cured

130
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,319
someone simply did not want her to live

131
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,160
All these years

132
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,279
she and her son joined forces

133
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,439
to sow discord in front of the old man

134
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,399
and make him hate me

135
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,199
They belittled me as unfit for business

136
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,399
and slandered me for gambling and owing debts

137
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,720
until the old man was so angry he threw me out

138
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,279
He never really saw me as

139
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,720
his own flesh and blood

140
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,480
I will avenge my mother

141
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,079
I will take back everything that is mine

142
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,279
Am I wrong

143
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,160
Young master

144
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,399
This is all the Zhang familys own feud

145
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,040
It has nothing to do with an outsider like me

146
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,680
Nothing to do with you

147
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,079
Have you forgotten

148
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,879
what you already did to help me

149
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,199
Do not worry

150
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,399
I am an expert in Luban ghost beam arts

151
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,399
Those beams and pillars are laid out by five elements and bagua

152
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,600
I guarantee

153
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,279
everyone inside that formation

154
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,879
will have all their yang energy drained

155
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,399
without gods or ghosts knowing

156
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,279
Thanks to you

157
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,279
I can finally avenge this great hatred

158
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,000
And now you want to back out

159
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,319
It is too late

160
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,600
According to the original plan

161
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,120
once the old man died

162
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,079
the estate would be split half and half between Zhang Sheng and me

163
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,000
But I never imagined

164
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,000
that the old fossil still had a trick left

165
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,199
making some will

166
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,800
What is in the will

167
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,000
I can tell without even reading it

168
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,519
It must leave the whole estate to Zhang Sheng alone

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,040
Even if it is not for Zhang Sheng

170
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,600
it will go to Xie Shen who cared for him and her husband

171
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Otherwise why would Zhang Sheng have killed Xie Xin

172
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,839
The old man does not want to leave me a single cent

173
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,279
Y young master

174
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,120
Then what do you want to do now

175
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,439
Your Luban ghost beam arts are so powerful

176
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,839
so we might as well go all the way

177
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,319
Use your ghost beam arts

178
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,680
to kill them all

179
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,000
After it is done

180
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,040
this estate

181
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,399
I will give you half

182
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,000
Half

183
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,680
As long as you handle this well

184
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,480
I will not shortchange you

185
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,279
Oh, it is you two

186
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,560
Come on in

187
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,920
My room here is very shabby

188
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Just sit wherever you like

189
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,240
Sorry to bother you

190
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,600
If you have anything to ask

191
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,279
Just ask me straight

192
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,240
Xie Shen, what are you doing there

193
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,079
My husband liked to be clean

194
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,199
I am making him new clothes for his burial

195
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,079
So that on the road to the underworld

196
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,199
he can go in peace

197
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,040
Please accept our condolences

198
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,920
Xie Shen, why do you have a

199
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,360
Luban mechanism box in your room

200
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,079
That is not mine

201
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,199
The previous carpenter left it here

202
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,040
I am only keeping it for him for now

203
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,480
When he comes back

204
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,959
I will return it to him

205
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,639
I know you do not believe in ghosts or gods

206
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,240
But lately in this house

207
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,000
things have been really uneasy

208
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,920
People keep dying one after another

209
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,839
Originally none of this had to do with you

210
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,399
Let me give you some advice

211
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,319
Leave here as soon as you can

212
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,160
Since you know this house is not peaceful

213
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,720
why will you not leave

214
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,600
Back then

215
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,919
our home was hit by a fire

216
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,440
I not only lost my son and daughter

217
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,559
both Xie Xin and I were disfigured

218
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,679
People despised us everywhere we went

219
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,200
We could not find any work at all

220
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,919
Luckily Master Zhang and his wife took us in

221
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,080
Madam Zhang is kind hearted

222
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,679
She is vegetarian and recites Buddha sutras

223
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,799
She not only did not despise our looks

224
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,679
but even agreed to shelter us

225
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,159
This is the master of the house

226
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,799
For Xie Xin and me

227
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,200
the master and madam are our saviors

228
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,279
The servants in this manor

229
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,159
were all scared away by the little ghost

230
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,600
Only my husband and I remained

231
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,240
Later madam also passed away

232
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,679
The master was left paralyzed in bed

233
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,679
So Xie Xin and I could even less leave

234
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,320
Otherwise we would fail the master

235
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,440
and the kindness the madam showed us

236
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,159
Now

237
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,279
my husband is gone as well

238
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,679
I still have to guard this house well

239
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,879
You really are loyal and righteous

240
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,120
I think things are getting more and more complicated

241
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,480
We still have other cases to solve

242
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,960
We are only passing through here

243
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,759
I think it is not necessary

244
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,840
to get entangled in this anymore

245
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,879
How can that be

246
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,879
Someone has already died unnaturally now

247
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,360
How can we just turn a blind eye

248
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,000
My ability is limited

249
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,320
If we run into something

250
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:08,799
This way

251
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,360
Put more effort into the jumping

252
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,360
Do not stop

253
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,159
You must drive that little ghost out for me

254
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,799
What is this

255
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,200
They say it suppresses a little ghost

256
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,919
In fact it uses a secret Luban method

257
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,120
to seize Zhang Shengs soul

258
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,240
and take all the family property

259
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,240
What secret Luban art what ghost suppression

260
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,759
It is all twisted superstition

261
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,399
But there are people who believe it

262
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,240
There it is again

263
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,679
Over there

264
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,240
Keep jumping do not stop

265
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,559
Darn it I will go catch that little ghost

266
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,480
They let it get away again

267
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,440
This is bad

268
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,639
What is going on

269
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,799
It is that carpenter
