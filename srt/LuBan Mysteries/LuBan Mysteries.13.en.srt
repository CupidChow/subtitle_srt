1
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,920
Help!

2
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,320
The puppet is killing, help!

3
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,480
It is all Miss Meigui's fault.

4
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,560
Just watch how I deal with you.

5
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,719
Sun Laoban is not the killer.

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,879
Why?

7
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,400
This motive for murder does not hold up.

8
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,079
We originally thought once Wu Laoban died,

9
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,400
Sun Laoban would become the biggest beneficiary.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But this song and dance hall is losing money.

11
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,879
They were just waiting for the puppet show to open

12
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,040
so they could make a big profit.

13
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,400
At that moment,

14
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,920
if Sun Laoban killed Wu Laoban,

15
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,439
would that not be a losing bargain?

16
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,560
What do you think?

17
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,359
The timing of the murder does not fit.

18
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,000
The killer committed a locked room murder.

19
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,319
He controlled the puppet

20
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,800
and hid in the crowd after the killing.

21
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,280
But that day Sun Laoban

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,039
was the last one to arrive.

23
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,439
He has an alibi.

24
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,560
Then who is the killer?

25
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,080
If we analyze by motive for murder,

26
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,719
Miss Meigui

27
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,159
is actually very suspicious.

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,319
Think about it.

29
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,280
Once Wu Laoban dies,

30
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,840
no one will be promoting Wen Qing.

31
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,199
Then the Star Dancer spot

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,960
will naturally go to Miss Meigui.

33
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,039
Then I will go investigate Miss Meigui.

34
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:38,759
No need.

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,719
Darn it, I will go.

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,080
You go look for other evidence.

37
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,039
No, I...

38
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,199
Why will you not let me go?

39
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,840
Look, we

40
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,159
can follow Miss Su's plan first.

41
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,960
Let us all listen to her for now.

42
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:53,879
Move out immediately.

43
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,319
I am begging you.

44
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,719
I will never talk back again.

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,840
Wen Qing's arm is so badly hurt.

46
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,280
Do you know how much I am losing?

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,120
Can you even afford to pay for it?

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:09,960
I was wrong.

49
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,719
I really know I was wrong.

50
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,199
I have all sorts of ways to deal with you.

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,080
From now on, I will sing whenever you tell me to.

52
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,639
I will sing whatever you tell me to sing.

53
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,120
I was waiting for you to say that.

54
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,159
Work hard for me from now on.

55
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,800
I will not treat you badly.

56
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,000
You came to laugh at me, did you not?

57
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,520
I never laugh at anyone

58
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,240
who has to bow to life.

59
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,039
Wipe it off.

60
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,279
Get up first.

61
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,360
You are a cop, right?

62
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,560
No.

63
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,759
I am a forensic doctor.

64
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,160
I told Sun Laoban that there was something off about you.

65
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,600
I made him drive you away.

66
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,519
How did you figure it out?

67
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,639
The song and dance hall is a real mixed crowd.

68
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,879
All sorts of people from all walks of life.

69
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,279
You smell too proper,

70
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,959
and that actually gave you away.

71
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,720
Ask whatever you want.

72
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,839
I have nothing to hide anyway.

73
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,759
There was a murder in the song and dance hall.

74
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,000
Why did you not leave?

75
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,800
To earn money for my father’s medical bills.

76
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,319
The dance hall pays quickly,

77
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,959
so I became a dance girl.

78
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,399
Sadly, my father still was not cured.

79
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,480
He passed away.

80
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,040
I have also been in this dance hall for over ten years.

81
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,079
I am used to it.

82
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,959
If I leave here,

83
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,800
I do not even know where I could go.

84
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Are you the killer?

85
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,160
No.

86
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,759
I heard

87
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,040
Sun Laoban is really good at taking photos.

88
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,399
If there is a chance,

89
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,800
take a few pictures for me.

90
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,480
My skills are nothing but petty tricks.

91
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,519
If you like,

92
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,879
I will take some for you then.

93
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,600
We are here.

94
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,639
Please come in.

95
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,519
Come on, come on.

96
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,800
Please, please, please.

97
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Just treat Boss Zhou like you would Wu Laoban

98
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,959
After your arm has healed

99
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,360
Miss Wen

100
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,720
As long as you behave

101
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,600
You can get anything you want

102
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,319
Baby

103
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,199
Wu Laoban, Wu Laoban is here

104
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:35,959
Is that you

105
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,480
I have no grudge against you

106
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,800
Please, do not come after me

107
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,079
Wu Laoban, I am begging you

108
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,399
I beg you, I beg you

109
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,439
I do not want your wages

110
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,040
Wu Laoban, I do not want your wages

111
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,720
I will give up my wages, Wu Laoban

112
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,639
I really do not want the wages

113
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,160
No

114
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,959
No more, no more, no more

115
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,560
I really do not want it

116
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,399
How is it you

117
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,879
Do you realize

118
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,360
You scared me half to death

119
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,839
You are here pretending to be a ghost

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,120
I was not pretending to be a ghost

121
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,519
That scary sound

122
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,120
came from the phonograph

123
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,480
Besides, the one faking ghosts is not me

124
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,279
It is under that stage

125
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,360
The person who set up this phonograph

126
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,920
Do not be scared

127
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,959
Important clue, let me say it first

128
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,079
Look

129
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,160
Someone actually put one under the stage

130
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,360
They placed a phonograph there

131
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,319
to play the sound of screams

132
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:29,079
That must be Sun Laoban

133
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,040
To make the puppet show go smoothly

134
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,079
he bribed the master to put on an act

135
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,480
This clue you mentioned is very helpful

136
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,160
But

137
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,959
the police station is calling us back now

138
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,399
They say the case is closed

139
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,360
The killer is not even found, how can it be closed

140
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,199
The killer turned himself in

141
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,839
It is Wen Qing's old flame

142
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:46,800
Liu Dazhu

143
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,800
I am the one who killed Wu Laoban

144
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,680
Liu Dazhu, I am telling you

145
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,720
This is called intentional homicide

146
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,120
You will be sentenced to death for it

147
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,040
I know

148
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
Then why did you kill him

149
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,160
Wen Qing and I

150
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,800
were childhood sweethearts

151
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,879
We were in love with each other

152
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,639
Wen Qing loved to sing and dance

153
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,399
I came with her to try our luck in the big city

154
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,040
We found work at Wucheng Song and Dance Hall

155
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,839
Wen Qing

156
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,199
soon became the hall's Star Dancer

157
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,639
Wu Laoban took a fancy to Wen Qing

158
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,279
He picked a fight and had me kicked out

159
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,800
I went back to see Wen Qing several times

160
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,879
but I was stopped every time

161
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,759
No matter what job I tried to get

162
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,840
Wu Laoban would secretly ruin it

163
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,799
I ended up begging on the streets

164
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,279
Hurry up and get out of here

165
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,480
Wen Qing gave me money several times

166
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,200
She wanted me to leave Wucheng

167
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,879
And go back to the countryside

168
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:56,759
But I flat-out refused

169
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,440
Wu Laoban stole Wen Qing from me

170
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,720
He drove me into a desperate corner

171
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,759
I hate him

172
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,039
So I waited for the right chance

173
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,519
And killed him in one go

174
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,639
How did you kill him

175
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,600
And how did you get out of the sealed

176
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,480
Changing room and escape

177
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,320
First I killed him

178
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,840
Then I set up the puppet properly

179
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,159
To make it look like the puppet killed him

180
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,240
And scared them all away

181
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,720
After that I used the cover of night

182
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,000
Threw away the black clothes

183
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,559
And slipped out disguised as a waiter

184
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,120
Without the gods knowing

185
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,879
Or the ghosts noticing

186
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,919
Since this whole matter

187
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,159
Has already been cleared up

188
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,480
I say we can close this case

189
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,879
Congratulations, you have kept your job

190
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,320
He is not the killer

191
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,759
His leg is injured

192
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,799
So he could not pose as a waiter

193
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,000
And slip away in the chaos

194
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,960
Even less act while disguised as a puppet

195
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,679
This case is closed when I say it is

196
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,159
Stop investigating it

197
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,840
Stop creating trouble for the station

198
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,360
Take him away

199
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,360
You picked a good room

200
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,519
Very well hidden

201
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,320
Boss Zhou

202
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,799
We agreed on this

203
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,039
From now on

204
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,320
We will be relying on you

205
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,559
Of course

206
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,879
I will agree to anything

207
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,519
As long as you

208
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,240
Do as you are told

209
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,799
It hurts

210
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,000
When your injury is healed

211
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,279
Wu Laoban

212
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,240
Wu Laoban

213
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,639
Didn not he say no puppets were allowed

214
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,480
In the changing room

215
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,559
Why is there still one here

216
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,279
Such bad luck

217
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,440
Why

218
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,840
Why

219
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,039
The song and dance hall case was closed

220
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,080
So why are puppet murders still happening

221
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,840
Chief

222
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:26,799
It is possible

223
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,120
Maybe this is a new case

224
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,039
The killer

225
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,799
Wants to frame the hall puppets

226
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,080
Closing the case before it is clear

227
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,879
Will make the public think

228
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,039
We are a bunch of useless gluttons

229
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:44,759
Yang Zong

230
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,440
I am assigning you to keep investigating

231
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,000
You must wrap it up quickly

232
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,080
All right

233
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,919
No

234
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,879
What is your objection

235
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,240
You stop or resume the case as you like

236
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,759
You really do not take us seriously

237
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,320
If you want us to investigate

238
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,039
You must meet my three conditions

239
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,000
Let us hear them

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,679
First

241
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Zhao Wei

242
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,279
Is not allowed to meddle in this case

243
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,519
Second

244
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,399
Yang Zong was demoted before

245
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,639
Now he must be reinstated

246
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,759
Third

247
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,879
Once this case is solved

248
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:13,879
The bonus

249
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,039
Must be tripled

250
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,279
Those three conditions

251
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,679
I accept them all

252
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,360
Restoring the stations reputation

253
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,480
Is our top priority

254
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,600
Solve it quickly, do not fail

255
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,159
Thank you, Chief

256
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,919
Thank you, Chief

257
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:36,840
Yang Zong

258
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,559
You must protect Su Qingyun for me

259
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:44,879
Yes sir

260
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,279
We have not solved the case yet

261
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,519
This money really burns in my hands

262
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:58,600
All right, Old Li

263
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,080
You are actually paying me back

264
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,159
No need

265
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,120
I just negotiated it, we are back on the case

266
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,840
If we solve it, the bonus

267
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:06,960
will be tripled

268
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:08,320
Really

269
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,759
Really

270
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,840
Well, since you put it that way

271
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,919
If you are saying it like that

272
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,639
I do have a new idea

273
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,879
Officer Yang, look

274
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,519
How did you find it

275
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,399
The dancers found it while they were changing
