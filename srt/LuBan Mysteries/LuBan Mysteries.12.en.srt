1
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:46,399
Who

2
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:48,799
He is gone

3
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,000
Officer Yang

4
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,399
Over there, he ran off

5
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,799
Who

6
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,599
How did he disappear

7
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,640
You go that way, I will go this way

8
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,319
I know all your secrets inside out

9
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,599
Do not try to bargain with me

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,120
The cabaret now

11
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,439
is all under my control

12
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,920
If you want to be the star

13
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,200
then stop pretending to be so pure in front of me

14
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,760
Your secrets

15
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,120
I know them all too well

16
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,920
I will give it serious thought

17
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,719
What is it

18
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,719
Why do you keep following me

19
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,080
Because your dad is the bureau chief

20
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,400
It is safer sticking with you

21
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,159
Look, what is this

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,520
This exorcising talisman is really special

23
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,000
Come on, let us go in and take a look

24
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,759
This person

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,360
must be a fanatical puppet lover

26
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,479
So many things crammed together like this

27
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,759
gives a really strange feeling

28
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,199
Those two little puppets just now

29
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,159
gave me a scare

30
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,759
This looks like the puppet we saw earlier

31
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,719
What are you doing here

32
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,560
I am very interested

33
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:03,439
in how the puppets are made up

34
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,360
so I came over to have a look

35
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,039
Yes

36
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,560
I am in the lumber business

37
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,879
All the wooden items here

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,879
including this puppet, really fascinate me

39
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,800
I want to see everything clearly

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,280
You two are really odd

41
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,800
Everyone else wants to hide when they see the puppet

42
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,479
but you actually want to look at it

43
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
These are all belongings of the dead

44
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,400
Be careful not to attract something unclean

45
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
Whose belongings

46
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,000
Wu Laoban

47
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,360
They say when Wu Laoban was alive

48
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,240
he attracted something unclean

49
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,599
and that is why the puppet killed him

50
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,159
This room

51
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,879
is off limits now

52
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,080
Sorry

53
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,000
We will leave right away

54
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,919
Sorry, so sorry, we disturbed you

55
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,800
This dance hall is hiding a lot of secrets

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,639
Everyone is a suspect

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,319
So tell me, next

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
what should we do

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
We stick to the usual plan

60
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,960
We split up and sound them out

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,599
Whoever has no alibi

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,120
is more likely to be the killer

63
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,599
Before Old Wu died

64
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,319
I got off work at 6 sharp every day

65
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,680
Now I have to stay up till dawn

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,080
and I do not even get a break

67
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,680
On the day Wu Laoban had his accident

68
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,279
I rushed over from home on purpose

69
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,600
From that day on

70
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,800
I have been so tired my whole body aches

71
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,040
Right, right here

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,600
So what do you do after work

73
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,879
Of course I spend time with my wife

74
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,879
You young kids

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,720
how would you understand

76
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,759
I get mad every time I mention that day

77
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,120
What happened

78
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,680
That day Zhou Laoban called out by name

79
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,199
and told Wenqing to sing one more song

80
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,240
so my time to go on stage got delayed

81
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,519
I was really pissed

82
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
I could only wait and wait in the dressing room

83
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,279
I did not go onstage until almost eleven

84
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,759
Let me tell you, these days

85
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,720
to meet the deadline for that puppet show

86
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,519
I have been busy from morning till night

87
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,000
Apart from the outhouse

88
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,920
I have not even stepped out the door

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,279
Got it

90
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,160
He really does have an alibi

91
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,759
Wenqing and Rose also alibi each other

92
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,319
Same with Sun Laoban

93
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,079
I asked several waiters

94
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,319
they all said they saw Sun Laoban

95
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,160
leave a little after 6 the other day

96
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,800
So it seems these people

97
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,720
none of them looks like the killer

98
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,480
Officer Yang

99
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,959
Su Xiaojie

100
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,879
And you, Li Mujiang

101
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,959
you three hid yourselves really well

102
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,199
How could you come investigate without a word

103
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,720
Do you think my place does not matter at all

104
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,879
Go, go, go

105
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,639
Go

106
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,920
No need to see us out

107
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,680
No need to see us out, really

108
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,199
Welcome, please come in

109
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,759
What kind of person is that

110
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,519
We have not caught the killer

111
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,439
and getting kicked out is so embarrassing

112
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,560
We just started to get a lead

113
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,040
and we already blew our cover

114
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,199
I cannot help but suspect

115
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,199
this is exactly the killer trying to drive us off

116
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,399
The key thing is this suit is too small for me

117
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,399
I held in my stomach all day

118
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,240
It is way too tight

119
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,120
Why is there a spoon here

120
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,319
Yeah, this

121
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,279
When did a spoon end up here

122
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,600
What else did you take from the dance hall

123
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,160
I did not take anything else

124
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,600
Do not make me search you myself

125
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,000
In this spot

126
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,639
there is only an ashtray

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,959
Old Li, none of this stuff is worth money

128
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,800
Do not disgrace our police station

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,600
What are you talking about

130
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,560
Anything else

131
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,759
Nothing else this time

132
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,879
Really nothing

133
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,240
Then why is there still a bulge here

134
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,480
A clock

135
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,399
So what kind of person do you two take me for

136
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,000
You think I steal things to sell for money

137
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,240
I am learning from you two

138
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,879
This might be a clue to solve the case

139
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:51,680
Once the case is solved

140
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,759
I will definitely return it

141
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,800
Not bad, Old Li

142
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,800
After the case is wrapped up smoothly

143
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,839
I will ask my dad to approve

144
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,879
a personal bonus for you

145
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,079
Really, thank you so much

146
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,439
The cabaret belongs to Wu Laoban and Sun Laoban

147
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,319
If anything happens to Wu Laoban

148
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,639
then Sun Laoban is the biggest beneficiary

149
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:18,720
Sun Laoban is in such a hurry

150
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,000
to kick us out of the cabaret

151
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,720
it is like he is scared we will find something out

152
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,480
He is the most suspicious

153
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,720
There are only two days left

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,560
How is your case going

155
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,879
Mind your own business

156
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,399
I heard

157
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,079
you were thrown out

158
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,680
If you cannot solve the case

159
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,199
it is not too late to speak up now

160
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,639
For the sake of our being colleagues

161
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,199
I can find you a

162
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,480
job sweeping floors and guarding doors

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,279
What is wrong with you

164
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,560
Brother

165
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,120
The carpenter told me

166
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,759
that Sun Laoban hired a master

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,360
to perform rites on the puppet to drive out evil

168
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,399
Looks like

169
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,519
this time we have to get serious

170
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,519
Heaven is round and earth is square

171
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,839
Nine chapters of divine law

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,240
Now I set my brush to paper

173
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,600
ten thousand ghosts shall be subdued

174
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,439
Master please drive out the evil spirit in the puppet

175
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,399
and keep the cabaret safe

176
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,720
Turn spin it for me

177
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,800
You heard that clearly right

178
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,959
It is Wu Laoban's vengeful spirit

179
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,560
There are no such things as souls in this world

180
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,040
That is all nonsense

181
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,399
Why is it you again

182
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,480
Go away go away

183
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,199
Do not disturb the master doing the ritual

184
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,839
This is a special order from the chief

185
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,800
an investigation warrant on Wu Laoban's death

186
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,279
We are going in to investigate to the end

187
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,080
On my side I say

188
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,600
I do not dare disobey Chief Su's order

189
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,279
but our cabaret

190
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,080
still has to operate normally

191
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,200
Fine

192
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,480
We promise you

193
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,559
we will not affect the normal business of your cabaret

194
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,919
You must do as you say

195
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,879
Also

196
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,639
you must not reveal your identities

197
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,559
I am afraid it will cause the guests to panic

198
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,000
No problem

199
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,639
What are you doing

200
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,399
I am saying this puppet is really strange

201
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,240
It has no mechanism nothing at all

202
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:15,919
Where is this sound coming from

203
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,639
Go away

204
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,759
Do not disturb the master doing the ritual

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,799
Go away

206
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,720
Alright alright

207
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,200
You go away too

208
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,120
There are still two days left

209
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,480
So what do we do next

210
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,320
Watch Sun Laoban's every move

211
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,200
Everything else stays the same

212
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,120
This is all the boss's arrangement

213
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,440
You bitch

214
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,720
I will stop the bleeding for you

215
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,120
What is going on

216
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,759
Rose

217
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,480
What have you done to her again

218
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,639
Prime time at eight tonight

219
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,799
it was supposed to be my turn to sing

220
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,600
why did it get changed again to

221
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,679
that bitch Wenqing

222
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,919
Boss Zhou arranged it

223
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,919
there is nothing I can do either

224
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,679
Old Sun do not think I do not know

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,919
the cabaret is losing money now

226
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,840
you rely on me and Wenqing to bring in money

227
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,840
You want to promote her like Old Wu did

228
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:15,039
Fine I will leave

229
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,120
Auntie auntie do not go do not go

230
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,440
Why are you leaving now

231
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,799
The show is about to start

232
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,720
Wenqing hurt her arm

233
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,879
and cannot perform again

234
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,559
Where are you going

235
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,679
The cabaret next door offered me a high price

236
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,480
If you will not keep me someone else will

237
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,000
Auntie

238
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,240
Eight tomorrow night

239
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,600
Eight the day after tomorrow

240
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,840
You can sing both times alright

241
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,919
That is more like it

242
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,000
Wenqing passed out

243
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,080
Come help, quick

244
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,200
Wenqing

245
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,360
Hurry, get her to the hospital

246
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,799
Hurry
