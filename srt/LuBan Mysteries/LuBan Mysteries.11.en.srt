1
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,199
Wu Laoban

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,480
Please do not be like that.

3
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:24,879
Be good.

4
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,399
Normally I

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,600
am very strict about clothing.

6
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:40,240
So this button is a bit tight.

7
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:58,799
Someone is there.

8
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,840
There is no one there.

9
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,840
This is fine now, right?

10
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,239
This is what he gave me.

11
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,159
It looks great, really beautiful.

12
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,199
Sir, careful, careful.

13
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,120
It is fine, it is fine.

14
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,560
Sun Laoban

15
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,360
Boss Zhou

16
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,120
Hello.

17
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,479
Please ask Miss Wen to come down later

18
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,840
and have a drink with me.

19
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,400
No problem.

20
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,319
Of course.

21
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,319
Five silver dollars.

22
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,919
You are practically robbing me.

23
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,560
Li Laoban

24
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,599
This is the drink you ordered.

25
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,639
Can I put it on expenses?

26
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,479
Then I will drink less.

27
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,599
Xiao Yang

28
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,759
This is the new makeup artist.

29
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,240
Take her to the dressing room.

30
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,479
All right.

31
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,840
It is still not as good as my wife’s

32
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,560
homemade sorghum liquor.

33
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,319
Do not waste it.

34
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,120
I did not expect

35
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,240
you two infiltrated even faster than I did.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,680
It is a matter of pride.

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,719
We will let that kid Zhao Wei see

38
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,159
we can crack the case in just a few days.

39
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,719
For this ballroom puppet murder case,

40
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
let Yang Zong handle it.

41
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,520
He just solved a big case anyway.

42
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,439
For this case,

43
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,840
it should be a piece of cake for him.

44
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,120
I agree.

45
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,759
He is the popular choice.

46
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,120
Why is it me again?

47
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,400
Look,

48
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,360
we have already taken this case.

49
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,400
Time is very tight for this case.

50
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,240
Next month

51
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,759
the higher ups will start performance reviews.

52
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,319
The chief is worried it will hurt the rating,

53
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,159
so he ordered

54
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,360
that within three days

55
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,639
we must solve the case.

56
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,879
If we do not solve it,

57
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,560
the officers in charge

58
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,400
must resign to take responsibility.

59
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,560
Three days?

60
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,680
Wait, why did you not say that earlier?

61
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,800
You did not ask either.

62
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,759
What?

63
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,759
You promised them we would solve it in three days?

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,720
That is way too short.

65
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,040
That is not my fault.

66
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,519
It is all that Zhao Wei’s fault.

67
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,720
He set me up on purpose.

68
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:24,920
Do not worry.

69
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,240
I have a plan.

70
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,360
Solving it within three days

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,279
should not be a problem.

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,199
What plan?

73
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,199
I will apply as a waiter.

74
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,680
Su Xiaojie will pose as a makeup artist.

75
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:33,879
Old Li,

76
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,639
you act as a nouveau riche from out of town.

77
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,439
Remember,

78
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,279
do not blow your cover.

79
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,879
Su Xiaojie,

80
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,519
your dressing room is over there.

81
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,519
Okay.

82
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,240
Nice work.

83
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,439
Miss Mei Gui is pretty.

84
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,439
She looks good no matter how you do her makeup.

85
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,360
New girl,

86
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,600
touch up my makeup.

87
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,879
I have not finished yet.

88
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,040
Why bother, who is even looking at you?

89
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,560
Wen Yanhong,

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,079
others may not know,

91
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
but I know exactly what kind of person you are.

92
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,399
A pheasant can never become a phoenix.

93
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,399
Wu Laoban is dead.

94
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,800
Just wait, you will be knocked back to what you really are.

95
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,199
Zheng Qingyan

96
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,000
You are the one who reported this to the station

97
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
I am a police officer from the station

98
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:56,800
Yang Zong

99
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,279
Yes, it was me, it was me

100
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,439
Mei Gui, before this it was us

101
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,079
who were the Star Dancers in this ballroom

102
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,360
Later Wu Laoban

103
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,680
took a fancy to the newcomer Wen Qing

104
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,480
and forcefully pushed Wen Qing

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,160
into becoming the new Star Dancer

106
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,279
This Wen Qing

107
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,040
still has a sweetheart in the countryside

108
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,600
called Liu Dazhu

109
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,720
Has this person come to the ballroom recently

110
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,199
No, he has not

111
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,879
Ever since Wen Qing started seeing Wu Laoban

112
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,120
she cut ties with Liu Dazhu completely

113
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,040
He did come and make a scene a few times

114
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,480
but every time Wu Laoban

115
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,639
sent people to beat him and throw him out

116
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,399
Wen Qing and Mei Gui have always clashed

117
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,639
And now that Wu Laoban is dead

118
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,160
who will be the Star Dancer here from now on

119
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,319
is anybody's guess

120
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,639
Tell me what happened the day Wu Laoban was killed

121
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,839
Go over it with me once

122
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,959
That day

123
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:43,079
we heard the girls screaming

124
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,360
so I ran over right away

125
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:47,800
What is going on

126
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,920
I had just gotten there

127
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
when Sun Laoban

128
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:51,519
came right after me

129
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
What are you doing, what are you all doing

130
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,600
The puppet killed someone

131
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,560
The puppet killed the boss

132
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,680
What nonsense are you talking

133
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,879
How could a puppet kill someone, seriously

134
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,079
Wu Laoban

135
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,600
Where is the puppet

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,160
It was here just now

137
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,319
Right

138
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,160
The crime happened at eleven o clock

139
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,839
After Sun Laoban went in

140
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,759
he searched all around for the killer

141
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:14,680
but did not find anyone

142
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,439
In the end, the autopsy concluded

143
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,240
that Wu Laoban s pancreas

144
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,480
had been dug out by the puppet

145
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,000
His pancreas was dug out by the puppet

146
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,759
Yes, yes, that is right

147
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,600
So in the end we unanimously determined

148
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,959
that it was the puppet that killed him

149
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,959
The new guy looks pretty good

150
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,000
What are you two talking about

151
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,839
Sister Mei Gui, I ll get back to work

152
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,600
His figure is not bad either

153
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,360
How about this

154
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,720
come to my room tonight

155
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,879
and keep me company for a chat

156
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,279
Miss Mei Gui

157
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,040
your performance time is coming up

158
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,639
I will go first

159
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,639
As a young man out there

160
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,800
you should also protect yourself

161
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,079
I

162
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,319
dance pretty well

163
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,160
I just do not wear very much

164
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,679
Come, this way

165
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,200
Boss Zhou

166
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,200
Boss Zhou

167
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,639
Miss Wen is here

168
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,759
Boss Zhou

169
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,600
You two take your time chatting

170
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,799
Miss Wen, your voice is enchanting

171
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,559
I wonder

172
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,559
if you could have a drink with me

173
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,440
I do not know how to drink

174
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,879
When it comes to drinking

175
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,679
there is no such thing as knowing or not

176
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,600
Could it be that

177
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,440
Miss Wen is not willing

178
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,399
Boss Zhou

179
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,279
you coming to support us

180
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,480
is my honor

181
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,519
I will drink with you

182
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,759
I am not like some petty little people

183
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,039
who are not presentable

184
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,639
and do not know their place

185
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,559
Now that I like to hear

186
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,519
Looks like

187
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,519
the Star Dancer is about to change hands

188
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,000
Miss Wen, you are really straightforward.

189
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,440
I like that, I like that.

190
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,799
This...

191
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,159
You used to fight me for this.

192
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,240
And you are still fighting me for it now.

193
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,559
This was my spot to begin with.

194
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,360
What do you mean, your spot?

195
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,480
I am saying,

196
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,679
you two, stop fighting.

197
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,519
You bitch, you hag.

198
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,720
Enough, stop it, stop it!

199
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,919
No, no, stop fighting!

200
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,279
Let go, both of you!

201
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,320
What are you doing?

202
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,879
Look at the state of you two.

203
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,039
Break it up, all of you.

204
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,519
If someone gets hurt, it is bad for everyone.

205
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,320
Besides,

206
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,919
you spilled wine all over me.

207
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,960
Sir, I am really sorry.

208
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,440
I will have someone take care of it right away.

209
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,240
No need.

210
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,519
I will handle it myself.

211
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,879
If you mess it up, you will not get your deposit back.

212
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,120
This alcohol smell...

213
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,240
This...

214
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,159
Brother, you are the carpenter here?

215
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,159
Yeah.

216
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,480
I am the only one left now.

217
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,120
All the other carpenters got scared off.

218
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,120
There are puppets killing people in this ballroom.

219
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,279
What on earth is going on?

220
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,240
Someone has cursed this ballroom.

221
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,360
Many years ago,

222
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,919
someone used Lu Ban's Secret Art

223
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,600
to bring a puppet back from the dead.

224
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,519
But a puppet has no humanity.

225
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
It killed people without mercy.

226
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,279
In the end, a master

227
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,159
sealed it in a box with a Magical Seal.

228
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,240
They buried it in the ballroom basement.

229
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,240
Later, Wu Laoban

230
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,960
wanted to promote that Wen Qing,

231
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,679
so he started rehearsing the puppet dance.

232
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,159
He took that puppet

233
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,960
out of that box.

234
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Then he repainted it.

235
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,159
Ever since then, this ballroom

236
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,120
has had lots of strange things at night.

237
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,000
Some people saw this puppet up in the air,

238
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,679
with those eyes of its,

239
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,320
slyly staring right at you,

240
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,639
just like a living person.

241
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,679
Others saw that puppet's body

242
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,679
covered in loose threads,

243
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,279
spinning around and around.

244
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,840
Enough, enough, that is enough.

245
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,519
In Lu Ban's Secret Art,

246
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,000
there is nothing this harmful.

247
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,440
It must be some ill intentioned person

248
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,360
trying to use the legend to hurt people.

249
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,480
Do not believe this.

250
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,639
Believe it or not, it is up to you.

251
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,600
I am telling you,

252
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,840
they are about to rehearse the puppet dance.

253
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,919
You had better leave now.

254
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,120
If you leave too late, I am telling you,

255
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,759
you will definitely die.

256
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,360
I do not believe that.

257
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,559
That is way too far fetched.

258
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,360
That is all what that carpenter told me.

259
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,679
I actually pushed open the costume room door

260
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,440
and went in to have a look.

261
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,399
That puppet,

262
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,120
it was made so realistically.

263
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:58,879
Then...

264
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
in the blink of an eye,

265
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,200
it vanished.

266
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:02,440
Now,

267
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,240
everyone in the ballroom

268
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,600
thinks it is the puppet that is killing people.

269
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,559
It seems

270
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,360
we have to go and meet that puppet.

271
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,840
It was right here just now.

272
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,039
I will go take a look over there.

273
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,480
Yang Zong.

274
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,039
It feels like something is watching me here.

275
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,440
It is gone.

276
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,360
Yang Zong.
