1
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,479
Yang Zong

2
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:55,679
Yang Zong

3
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,400
Miss Su

4
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,239
Why did you come out dressed like that

5
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,400
I think there is something wrong with this house

6
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,239
Where is Yang Zong

7
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,239
Where is Yang Zong

8
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,239
Yang Zong

9
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:21,480
Officer Yang

10
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,280
I am over here

11
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,359
Officer Yang

12
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:25,959
Officer Yang

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,400
What happened

14
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:28,959
Just now I

15
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,280
was chasing two little ghosts that were singing

16
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,840
then I got locked in this dark room

17
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,879
Lao Li

18
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,799
The layout of this room is very strange

19
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,000
Let us go

20
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,400
So much blood is flowing

21
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,760
Officer Yang

22
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:49,959
Are you all right

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Visually the head took a heavy blow

24
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,480
Died on the spot

25
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,319
The torso

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,519
and limbs have no obvious wounds

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,520
The qian position has collapsed

28
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,039
The heavenly gate has fallen

29
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,560
Xie Xin

30
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,800
Xie Xin

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,560
Xie Xin

32
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,000
Uncle Xie

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,280
What is going on

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,400
Second young master

35
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,400
Xie Xin

36
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,000
died far too miserably

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,719
Qing Yun

38
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,000
Check carefully

39
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,360
Collect the primary clues properly

40
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:42,159
Girl with that tiny body of yours

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,000
you probably would not even dare kill a chicken

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,400
I am a forensic doctor

43
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,360
I have dissected over one hundred corpses abroad

44
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,360
I could easily cut your body open

45
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,759
take out your organs

46
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,039
and then sew you back up

47
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,479
Who are you trying to scare

48
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,439
Help move the body aside please thanks

49
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,439
All right all right

50
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,599
Come on come on give me a hand

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,439
The deceased is male

52
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,680
about forty five years old

53
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,439
with a deformed spine

54
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,759
Thick calluses on the palms and between fingers

55
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,759
He must often have done physical labor

56
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,319
There is a little silt between the fingers

57
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,120
The face was struck hard by a wooden stake

58
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,639
Skull shattered facial features destroyed

59
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,319
The body is still warm

60
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,719
Cause of death

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,800
is preliminarily judged as a heavy blow to the head

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,919
resulting in instant death

63
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,120
But this is only a preliminary assessment

64
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,000
In this place

65
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,840
what are eight pillars here for

66
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,199
Over time they would easily topple

67
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,840
and it also does not conform

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,919
to architectural layout and planning standards

69
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,840
When this old house was built

70
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,159
it was arranged according to the old masters wishes

71
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,960
They said it was to ward off evil in the house

72
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,039
Then why did this wooden stake

73
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,639
fall straight down

74
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,800
and smash someone to death

75
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,000
Th this on the body

76
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,039
seems to be childrens footprints

77
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,560
Little ghosts

78
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,319
It was little ghosts that killed my man

79
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,240
Aunt Xie

80
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,319
We must not believe in talk of gods and ghosts

81
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
We must believe in science

82
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,639
I am not talking nonsense

83
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,000
It is true

84
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
This old house

85
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,319
has always been haunted

86
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,560
Two months ago

87
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,879
when Madam died

88
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,680
her whole body

89
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,600
was covered in childrens footprints

90
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,720
After that

91
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,199
the master became paralyzed

92
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,319
like he had been possessed by a ghost

93
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,399
with his vital energy drained away

94
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,600
And there is Xiao Mei

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,680
the servant girl Xiao Mei from before

96
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,360
she also saw the little ghosts with her own eyes

97
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,160
Big sister, play with me

98
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,279
Later on

99
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,480
Xiao Mei lost her mind

100
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,480
Her parents took her back to their hometown

101
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,839
But the servants in the house

102
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,160
all ran into similar things

103
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
They were so scared they dared not stay

104
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,360
Only my husband and I

105
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,720
kept in mind the master and madam took us in

106
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
so we stayed here

107
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,439
But now

108
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,079
Now

109
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Since ancient times

110
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,720
so many people have used ghostly legends

111
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,000
to do harm to others

112
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,439
So we must break feudal superstition

113
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,560
If we blame the victim's death

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,920
on tales of ghosts and gods

115
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,160
it will only let the killer walk free

116
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,600
Well said

117
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,240
Ghosts and spirits

118
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,439
are all man made

119
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,439
We must find the real killer

120
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,279
to clear the victim's injustice

121
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,839
Who do you people think you are

122
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,319
Do you not know your place

123
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,439
The master has not spoken yet

124
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,519
Yet you all keep chiming in one by one

125
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,399
Are you putting on an opera here

126
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,439
We came in a hurry

127
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,639
and forgot to introduce ourselves

128
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,439
I am Officer Yang Zong of Wucheng Police

129
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,000
These two are officers assisting me

130
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:20,480
Right

131
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,279
The coroner and a carpenter

132
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,000
The victim died in the Zhang house

133
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,360
Everyone here

134
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,639
is a possible suspect

135
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,040
I hope you will cooperate

136
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,240
Xie Shen

137
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,639
Where were you at that time

138
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,519
and what were you doing

139
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,720
I was in the kitchen decocting medicine for master

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,199
I was in my bedroom reading

141
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,160
I was in the hall making a coffin

142
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,439
I was asleep

143
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,040
Was anyone with you to vouch for you

144
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:52,800
No

145
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,879
All the servants in this house have left

146
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,439
You cannot leave medicine unattended

147
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
So it was just me

148
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,160
I live alone in my bedroom

149
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,160
If that carpenter had not left

150
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,800
maybe he could have testified for me

151
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,319
Who can prove you were sleeping

152
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,120
You, little girl

153
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,160
I advise you to show some respect

154
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,319
Xie Shen

155
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,240
Do you know

156
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,839
why Xie Xin went to the backyard

157
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,879
Earlier the master instructed him

158
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,639
to patrol the estate at set times

159
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,839
to prevent thieves from breaking in

160
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,279
And after that

161
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,160
Xie Xin would go every two shichen

162
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,639
to patrol once

163
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,639
Perhaps it was then

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,920
that he met with trouble

165
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,480
Xie Shen

166
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,720
You can go back for now

167
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,839
Zhang Meng

168
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,040
No one can give you an alibi

169
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,439
Among everyone here

170
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,720
you are the most physically fit

171
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,399
the one best able to overpower Xie Xin

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,199
You are the prime suspect

173
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,160
You do not need to investigate anymore

174
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,240
I will tell you who the killer is

175
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,839
Who is the killer

176
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,199
It is that little bastard Zhang Sheng

177
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,639
He was afraid the old man

178
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,199
would leave me half of the inheritance

179
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,040
He grabbed Xie Xin

180
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,759
forced him to say which lawyer had the will

181
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,879
so he could bribe the lawyer to change it

182
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,959
After he got the answer

183
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,319
he killed him to silence him

184
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,560
Zhang Sheng

185
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,319
Someone accuses you of killing for the inheritance

186
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,920
you questioned Xie Xin about the will

187
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,959
and killed him once you succeeded

188
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,759
Do you have anything to say

189
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,920
Was it my big brother who accused me

190
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,560
He cannot wait to get rid of me

191
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,920
If I die

192
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,079
then all the family property is my brother's

193
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,039
Instead of suspecting me

194
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,639
you might as well suspect my brother

195
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,879
I am the eldest son of the Zhang family

196
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,679
I inherit this estate with full legitimacy

197
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,200
Why would I need such tricks

198
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,519
Are you really a cop

199
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,759
Do you ever use your brain when investigating

200
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,919
You even faint at the sight of blood

201
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,240
I have never seen a cop as useless as you

202
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,879
If you ask me

203
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,519
you three are the killers

204
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,720
Before you came our family was just fine

205
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,879
As soon as you arrived people started dying

206
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,120
The killers must be you

207
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,480
What nonsense are you talking

208
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,360
The three of us all have alibis

209
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,720
We each testify for one another

210
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,480
You three are in it together

211
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,279
Thick as thieves who knows what is true

212
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,080
I think you are plotting to take

213
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,440
our Zhang family property

214
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,600
You want to kill off our whole Zhang family

215
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,519
The police are working the case

216
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Please cooperate

217
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,360
Who is afraid of whom

218
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,120
M mi misunderstanding

219
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,279
You two are both mistaken

220
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,399
Actually I think the real killer

221
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,919
is someone else

222
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,759
Someone else Who

223
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,840
Look

224
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,159
This killer

225
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,840
must really know beams and rafters

226
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,120
Otherwise

227
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,240
how could he use the beams to kill someone

228
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,639
So I think the killer

229
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,320
is very likely a carpenter

230
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,080
No you

231
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,720
You are slandering me

232
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,519
All these beams and pillars were arranged

233
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
according to Old Master Zhang

234
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,679
What does it have to do with me

235
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,080
I think Xie Shen makes sense

236
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,039
It must be little ghosts doing the killing

237
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,360
Otherwise how do you explain the nursery rhymes

238
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,320
coming from all directions

239
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,240
I am done playing with you

240
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,759
I am going back to sleep

241
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,679
Little girl

242
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,519
Will you vouch for me

243
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,039
Right

244
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,960
Keep an eye on that little bastard Zhang Sheng

245
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,759
If he goes out to find a lawyer to alter the will

246
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,039
then he is the killer

247
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,080
I am not going anywhere today

248
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,559
I will stay in my bedroom

249
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,080
An innocent person will clear himself

250
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,120
I have to rush work early tomorrow

251
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,120
I cannot afford any delay

252
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,879
Then I will head back first

253
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,480
Who do you think the killer is

254
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
Right now no one has cleared themselves

255
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,279
Everyone could have done it

256
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,720
The singing started again

257
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,120
Move
