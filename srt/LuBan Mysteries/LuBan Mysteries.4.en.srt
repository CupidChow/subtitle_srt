1
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,920
I am still alive

2
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
Darn it, I am still alive

3
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:58,880
Li Mudun

4
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,960
Where are you

5
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,280
Officer Yang

6
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,079
I am locked inside the bridal sedan

7
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,359
Hurry and come save me

8
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,200
I cannot save you right now

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,439
I am locked up too

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,879
No

11
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,040
Aren't you with Miss Su

12
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,599
How did you end up locked in

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,640
Yeah

14
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,000
But I do not know now either

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,959
Where is Miss Su now

16
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,879
I am here

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,239
Miss Su, how are you now

18
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,439
I am locked up as well

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,120
When did you wake up

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,799
Before you two

21
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,760
Your snoring woke me up

22
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,519
I did not expect you to sleep so soundly

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,640
No matter how I yelled you would not wake

24
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,799
Sorry about that

25
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,159
Sorry

26
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,120
This is a Luban lock

27
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,760
You two wait for me a bit

28
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,480
I will have it open soon

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,480
Do you know who locked us

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
up in here

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,040
It must be Lao Yuan

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,879
We just let our guard down

33
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,040
and fell for Lao Yuan's trick

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,640
Lao Yuan

35
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,200
Three bridal sedans

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,680
We should be in his sedan shop now

37
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,239
We probably are

38
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,280
Brother Yuan

39
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,520
Wake up quickly

40
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,080
If you do not, you will drown

41
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,199
If you still do not get up I will tell Xiao

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,639
I was just trying it out

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,800
Nice move, Lao Yuan

44
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,080
to use such a despicable trick

45
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,159
When I get out I will skin you alive

46
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,240
I knew they would wake up

47
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,840
How about I go kill them

48
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,759
Do not rush, come back

49
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,319
Let me go

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,360
Chunya, watch out behind you

51
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,639
Lao Yuan, you are something

52
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,000
I did not expect you to design so many traps

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,479
That trap in the room

54
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,800
was designed just for me, was it not

55
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:01,479
If so I will settle it with you later

56
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,319
I will look for more evidence

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,159
Speak

58
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,759
These three hairpins, where did you steal them

59
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,599
I did not steal them

60
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,000
Sister Xiao Cui gave them to me

61
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,759
Xiao Cui

62
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,080
Sister

63
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,520
Sister, I am scared

64
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,439
Do not be afraid

65
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,199
It is all over now

66
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,080
Chunya

67
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,800
These three hairpins

68
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,879
I will not need them anymore

69
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,000
I will give them to you

70
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,080
They are not just hair ornaments

71
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,520
They are also weapons to protect ourselves

72
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,599
One for our country

73
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,080
One for our family

74
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,680
One for ourselves

75
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,919
If anyone dares hurt you again

76
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,159
use them to protect yourself

77
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,560
When did Xiao Cui give that to you

78
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,120
Xiao Cui

79
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,800
is already dead

80
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,319
Dead

81
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,959
Then who are you stalling us for

82
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,120
All of this

83
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,439
What does it have to do with Xiao Cui

84
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,240
Three years ago

85
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,439
An elderly couple came to the station

86
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,600
Please I beg you to look into this

87
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,240
We already have tons of unsolved cases

88
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,800
We have no time to help you look for someone

89
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,240
You cannot just ignore this

90
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,839
Get out of here now

91
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,160
I beg you Go go go

92
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,959
I am begging all of you

93
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,560
Please save my daughter maam

94
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,519
Maam

95
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,439
What happened officer

96
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,920
This is my daughter Xiao Cui

97
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,079
She is eighteen

98
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,199
A month ago she went out to buy a book

99
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,279
By night she still had not come back

100
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,000
We searched everywhere but could not find her

101
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,800
We have come to the station many times

102
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,519
But no one is willing to take this case

103
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,399
And then

104
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,720
I kept looking for her

105
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,120
Later I found out

106
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,759
The matchmaker introduced her to Master Qiao

107
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,759
Then Master Qiao betrothed her to Young Master Qiao

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,959
as a ghost marriage bride

109
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,920
I went to the graveyard for her but did not find her

110
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,399
So I had no living witness

111
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,120
Recently the matchmaker and Madam Qiao had accidents

112
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,519
Maybe that Xiao Cui came back for revenge

113
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,480
Talk

114
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,480
Where exactly is Xiao Cui now

115
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,000
Major discovery

116
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,120
Lao Yuan

117
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,360
Come on explain this

118
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,240
Red bridal sedan modification plan

119
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,720
What were you using this for

120
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,240
Here and look at this old almanac

121
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,160
The twelfth of the third month

122
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,920
That is today

123
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,680
Right

124
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,920
Based on Young Master Qiaos birth data

125
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,759
The twelfth third month at the chou hour

126
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,759
is the lucky time for his ghost marriage

127
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,240
Chou hour

128
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,480
There is still a quarter of an hour

129
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,839
Lets go

130
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,920
Qiandao leaves the pass

131
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,759
All illnesses vanish

132
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,000
Qiandao leaves the pass

133
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,240
All illnesses vanish

134
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,160
Qiandao leaves the pass

135
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,399
All illnesses

136
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,560
Father

137
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,639
Where is my bride

138
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,519
Father

139
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:56,920
Son

140
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,920
Father found you another one

141
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,279
A pure young maiden

142
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,800
Take a look

143
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,879
Are you satisfied

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,120
Qiao Enfa

145
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,360
Your time to die has come

146
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,120
Xiao Cui stop

147
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,079
Do not come any closer

148
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,839
No no no

149
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,639
Do not move do not move

150
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,560
Step back step back

151
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,720
The other end of that thread

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,879
is tied to the device on Master Qiaos neck

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,399
If we force our way in

154
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,079
he will be strangled to death instantly

155
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,639
I went to all this trouble

156
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
to stop you from coming

157
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,399
I never thought

158
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,240
you would still come

159
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,600
Xiao Cui

160
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,319
Since you escaped

161
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,439
you should live your life well

162
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,199
Why must you kill them so ruthlessly

163
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,680
They all darn it deserve to die

164
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,399
They are the ones who ruined my life

165
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,319
Are you all right, Auntie?

166
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,680
I...

167
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,039
I twisted my ankle.

168
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,120
Then...

169
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,240
Then I will take you to see a doctor.

170
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,480
How about this.

171
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,799
Look.

172
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,039
My house is just up ahead.

173
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,919
Could I trouble you...

174
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,159
to help me over there, all right?

175
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,559
Okay, I will help you over.

176
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,399
Please be careful.

177
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay, okay.

178
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,120
I only meant to help out kindly.

179
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,320
I never expected

180
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,000
that that matchmaker had bad intentions

181
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,919
and used my kindness to traffic me.

182
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,000
Master Qiao,

183
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,679
this was the start of all my nightmares.

184
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,240
Look how cute this one is.

185
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,480
You rarely see goods like this.

186
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,360
Just right.

187
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,840
She can be a wife for my son.

188
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:27,919
Steward.

189
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,639
Today I will

190
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,039
inspect the goods first.

191
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,480
How dare you grab me!

192
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,960
You little bitch!

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,799
I showed you respect and you spurn it.

194
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,879
You spurn my respect, you spurn my respect!

195
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,320
Try grabbing me again, I dare you.

196
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:01,679
You bitch!

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,840
Tell me,

198
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
does he deserve to die or not?

199
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,679
Should I kill him or not?

200
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,440
Xiao Cui...

201
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Do you think

202
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,519
these are the only bad things he has done?

203
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,559
He never treated me as a human being.

204
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,080
He only treated me as an object.

205
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,360
He tormented me for three whole years.

206
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:25,840
Three years...

207
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,080
You eat my food and drink my drink for free,

208
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,879
yet you have not laid even one egg for me.

209
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,039
What use are you to me then?

210
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,320
You are utterly heartless.

211
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,279
You have done every evil thing.

212
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,799
You deserve to be left without sons or heirs.

213
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,480
Left without sons or heirs!

214
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,799
You still dare to curse me?

215
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,279
You bitch!

216
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:46,480
Just watch me today,

217
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,080
I am going to beat you to death.

218
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,759
Master, calm down a bit.

219
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,000
Cool your anger.

220
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,120
She does not lay eggs anyway.

221
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,279
Better let her keep our son company.

222
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,080
They drugged me and I passed out.

223
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,960
When I woke, I was in Young Master Qiao's coffin.

224
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,200
No one cared if I lived or died.

225
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,080
No one could hear my cries for help.

226
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,279
Help, help!

227
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,279
Is anyone there? Help!

228
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,320
Help!

229
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,200
Help!

230
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,960
From the moment I was buried,

231
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,039
Xiao Cui was already dead.

232
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,799
I am a warden from hell who crawled back.

233
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,039
I have come to claim the lives of earthly fiends.

234
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,840
I will make every last one of them

235
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,559
pay with blood for the blood they owe.
