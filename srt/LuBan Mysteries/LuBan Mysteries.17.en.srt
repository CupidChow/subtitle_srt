1
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,280
No

2
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,560
A Wen, hurry and call the police

3
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,439
Let the police

4
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,560
take these three little thieves away

5
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,520
Master, they are the police

6
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,880
Mister Wu, Master Wu

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,280
Yes

8
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,840
I, I am Li Mudun

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,520
I once wanted to follow you and learn

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,719
how to make woodcut pictures

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,719
Master Wu

12
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,200
We are investigating a case

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,119
The murder weapon is a cork painting carving knife

14
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,039
We came earlier but were blocked at the door

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,840
We rushed in recklessly in a moment of panic

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,319
I hope you can forgive us, Master

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,239
Yes, yes

18
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,719
These past years, this old man

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,439
has lived in seclusion

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,040
and has never left this residence

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,079
It is even more impossible for me

22
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,959
to use a craftsman’s tool to kill

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,359
You have come to the wrong place

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,400
Hurry up and get out

25
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:20,840
Listen to me

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,000
We never should have promised to solve it in three days

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,840
We still do not have a single lead

28
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,120
Right, about that

29
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,519
It is fine even if you cannot solve it in three days

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,799
It is just that your, your dad

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,200
he is, he is fine

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,200
We got a report

33
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,359
that in the Horse King Temple’s wood carving

34
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,120
a living person bleeding was found

35
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,640
There was a living person inside the wood carving

36
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:44,400
How is that possible

37
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,400
The victim had completely stopped breathing

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,760
The back of Ma Wangye

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,840
has been tampered with

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,640
Two kinds of wood were joined together

41
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,640
All right, come

42
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:05,920
Lao Li

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,400
What is the situation

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,680
It is obvious

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,479
The two types of material are totally different

46
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,639
but the wood is almost the same color

47
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,599
and has been fitted together

48
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,199
Ordinary people would not notice it at all

49
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,240
the difference in here

50
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,879
This is what Lu Ban's Secret Art calls

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,360
the Art of Grafting

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,000
The deceased, male

53
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,719
around forty-five years old

54
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,960
suffered blunt force trauma to the head

55
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,199
From the level of coagulation we can see

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,360
he was struck around the twenty-first

57
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,719
However

58
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,759
this is not the real cause of death

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,479
The victim's actual cause of death

60
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,479
is prolonged confinement in an enclosed space

61
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,400
leading to death from excessive blood loss

62
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,360
In other words

63
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,199
the victim was attacked on the twenty-first

64
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,400
and then was embedded into the wood carving

65
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:56,759
That is right

66
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,719
Make way, make way

67
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,000
Master

68
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,719
Master

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,159
How could you leave me here all alone

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,960
Heaven really has eyes

71
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,879
Boss Qin docked us rickshaw pullers wages

72
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,240
He even drove a driver to his death

73
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,560
Ma Wangye opened his eyes

74
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
This took his life

75
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
Exactly exactly

76
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,520
He is rich but heartless

77
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,759
He was bound to get his retribution

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,080
What are you all talking about

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,800
Can Ma Wangye really take the blame for this

80
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,199
Someone clearly killed him and hid the body

81
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:40,800
Mrs. Qin

82
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,520
I have a few questions for you

83
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,599
The day before yesterday the twentieth

84
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,319
At eight in the evening

85
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,759
Master went to the gambling den as usual

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,039
He did not come home all night

87
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,560
He is usually like that

88
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,000
So I did not think much of it

89
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,919
But I never expected

90
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,919
That when I saw him again today

91
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,719
He would be just a corpse

92
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,879
Where were you on the night of the twenty first

93
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,639
I did not go anywhere I was at home

94
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,520
Driver Liu can testify for me

95
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,000
What Madam said is all true

96
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,439
After I drove Master to the gambling den

97
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,319
I went back to the old residence

98
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,120
The next day I went there but did not find Master

99
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,040
So I went back

100
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,800
Madam did not use the car these two days

101
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,240
And she did not go out either

102
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,199
Has anything strange happened these two days

103
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,439
Heipi A Si came on the twenty first

104
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,680
To collect a debt from me

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,920
He said Master lost it to him the night before

106
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,399
But he had no IOU

107
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,000
So I did not pay him

108
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,360
I had the butler throw him out

109
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,079
Officer

110
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,000
I really cannot stand Boss Qin

111
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,120
But I have parents and children to support

112
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,079
How could I possibly commit murder

113
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,519
I did not say you killed anyone

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,600
I am just asking

115
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,160
What did you do on the night of the twenty first

116
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,680
I was drinking and playing cards with some drivers

117
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:50,680
Yes

118
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,720
That night Chen Jinsheng and I

119
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,639
And Brother Xiang Zi were all together

120
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,800
I am not lying to you am I

121
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,639
Then until what time did you drink

122
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,279
We drank until the tavern closed

123
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,759
The tavern owner can testify

124
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,600
What do you think of Boss Qin

125
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,519
How is he

126
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,240
Well

127
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,160
Boss Qin is a good man

128
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
He not only rented me a rickshaw

129
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,720
So I can support my family

130
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,639
I can even barely support my own son

131
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,240
From the bottom of my heart

132
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,959
I am grateful to Boss Qin

133
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,439
Who do you think

134
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,600
Is the most suspicious

135
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,720
Xiang Zi

136
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:24,920
Reason

137
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,120
So many people hate Boss Qin

138
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,199
Only Xiang Zi thinks he is pretty good

139
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,279
I think

140
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,160
That is very suspicious

141
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,720
I checked the rickshaw firms accounts

142
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,360
This Boss Qin is really ruthless

143
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,879
When a rickshaw is damaged

144
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,480
He uses the drivers money to pay for it

145
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,240
He exploits all the drivers without exception

146
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,040
Xiang Zi

147
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,480
Is even the worst off among them

148
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:45,680
All right

149
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,920
Then let us investigate this Xiang Zi

150
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,439
Bodhisattva bless me gods bless me

151
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,079
Bless Boss Qin so he travels safely on

152
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,839
But please do not come looking for me

153
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,720
Boss Qin

154
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,439
Rest in peace

155
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,040
I will burn more spirit money for you

156
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,000
Just do not come back to find me

157
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,360
You heard what he said just now right

158
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,439
He begged Boss Qin not to come back to him

159
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,639
A clear conscience fears no midnight knock

160
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,480
That shows there is definitely something going on

161
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,759
Let us think about

162
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,160
Whether we should go up and arrest him now

163
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,920
If we grab him now we will alert the snake

164
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,040
Let us tail him for two more days

165
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,519
What are you doing

166
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,519
This is feudal superstition

167
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,360
Cant you see the spirit has possessed her?

168
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,959
Using incense as a guide and talismans as proof

169
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,279
Spirit of Qin Zhengkun

170
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,879
Show yourself at once

171
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,839
A vile person harmed me

172
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,759
If he is not severely punished

173
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,720
I cannot rest in peace

174
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,160
Do you know who that vile person is?

175
00:07:59,399 --> 00:07:59,920
It was not me

176
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,199
No, it was not me

177
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,120
It was not me, not me

178
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,800
Not me, not me

179
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,680
It was not me, not me

180
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,920
He is right here

181
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,839
It was not me

182
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,199
I was not the one who killed you

183
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,360
It was the person behind you

184
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,519
You little bastard

185
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,560
I will kill you What are you doing

186
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,079
Let go now

187
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:22,759
Stop

188
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,800
You are naming him as the killer

189
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,879
What evidence do you have

190
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,039
Detective Yang

191
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,519
Detective Yang

192
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,000
Our Master

193
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,200
told me to point out the killer

194
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,279
He also asks you to have the killer

195
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,519
arrested and brought to justice

196
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,879
Mrs. Qin

197
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,440
When we arrest people

198
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,039
we rely on real proof and evidence

199
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,200
Tricks like your spirit summoning

200
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,519
cannot solve a case

201
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,440
This spirit summoning of yours

202
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,360
definitely cannot be taken as real

203
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,480
My Master met him before he died

204
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,960
He must be the real killer

205
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,639
Stop talking nonsense

206
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,480
A Wen had no grudge against Boss Qin

207
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,480
Why would he want to hurt him

208
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,679
It was clearly Boss Qin who caught you

209
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,240
and your affair with your driver

210
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,080
You two feared revenge and killed him together

211
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,080
You are lying

212
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,399
The whole garage knows what you two are up to

213
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,320
Adulterer and whore

214
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,240
You deserve to go to hell

215
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,039
Exactly

216
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:29,879
Now that Boss Qin is dead

217
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:30,919
you and Driver Liu

218
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,360
can secretly take over his garage

219
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,679
You two are the killers

220
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,840
You are talking nonsense

221
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,120
Mrs. Qin

222
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,840
Looks like we need to talk again

223
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,960
If you really are having an affair with Driver Liu

224
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,840
I hope you will tell the truth

225
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,440
Or you will not shake off suspicion of murder

226
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,320
I will confess

227
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,200
I confess

228
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,679
Our Master was addicted to gambling

229
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,320
I was bored to death alone at home

230
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,519
After seeing each other again and again

231
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,720
I ended up getting involved with Xiao Liu

232
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,080
The day Master went to the gambling den

233
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,679
Xiao Liu and I

234
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,000
went out together

235
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,639
Be careful

236
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,720
Dont let anyone see us

237
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,600
It is so late There is no one around

238
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,679
Give me another kiss

239
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:34,960
Someone is coming

240
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,080
Go check quickly

241
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,399
Dont let anyone see us

242
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,559
Hurry up

243
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,720
I am going to kill you today

244
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,840
You all believed A Wen was the killer

245
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,120
But you did not have any evidence

246
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,440
So you came up with a possession technique

247
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,639
Using Boss Qin's voice to accuse him

248
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,080
I also did not want our Master to die without peace

249
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,279
But I was afraid what happened with Little Liu

250
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,360
would be exposed

251
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,039
So I thought of this trick

252
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,919
I heard

253
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
on the night of the twentieth

254
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,759
you had a conflict with Boss Qin

255
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,639
Is that right

256
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,960
Yes

257
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,679
My dad went to ask him for our pay

258
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,240
Not only did he refuse to pay me

259
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,480
he also insulted my dad

260
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,200
So I cursed him a few times

261
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,840
Then he started yelling to beat and kill

262
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,279
My dad

263
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,759
was afraid it would turn into a fight

264
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,039
so he told me to leave first

265
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,960
Right

266
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,440
I was the one who told him to go

267
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,480
Then on the night of the twenty first

268
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,840
what were you doing

269
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,720
I did not finish my work on the twentieth

270
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,279
My Master scolded me

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,039
On the twenty first all day and night

272
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,320
I was in the workshop

273
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,840
I did not move my butt at all

274
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,759
My Master can testify for me

275
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,559
Boss Qin died on the night of the twenty first

276
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,039
He had no time to commit the crime

277
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,120
He is not the killer

278
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,399
Since the timing does not match

279
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,159
I will go back and look for the carving knife

280
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,879
and go to the Horse King Temple again

281
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,799
to see who exactly it was

282
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,919
who has such great skill

283
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,840
to hide a corpse inside a wood carving

284
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,240
Ma Wangye

285
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,799
Sorry to disturb you

286
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,919
Pardon the disturbance

287
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,320
My guess was indeed right

288
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,039
It is made from Chinese cork oak

289
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,440
You brazen madman

290
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,480
How dare you damage my golden body

291
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,200
Ma Wangye

292
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,759
I am only investigating the case

293
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,159
not doing this for anything else

294
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,240
You still dare to argue back
