1
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,359
Dad

2
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:44,880
Mom

3
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,280
I finally managed to make it home

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,280
My dad and my mom

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,640
have been running everywhere these years to find me

6
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,079
and spent all their money

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,759
and even delayed their own treatment

8
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,159
Dad, wake up, Dad

9
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,079
Mom, Mom

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,319
Mom, open your eyes and look at me, Mom

11
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,799
Mom, what is wrong with you

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,879
Mom

13
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,200
Mom

14
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,840
Mom

15
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,319
Dying is too easy on him

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,319
He should go down to the eighteenth level of hell

17
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,280
and never be reborn for all eternity

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,879
Xiao Cui, Xiao Cui

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Xiao Cui, Xiao...

20
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,319
This...

21
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,480
Xiao Cui

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,480
When your parents first reported the case

23
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,959
I am the one who did not take it seriously

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,719
You were buried in the ground

25
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,519
because I arrived one step too late

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,760
I have failed you

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,319
and I have failed your parents too

28
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,079
But I am a police officer

29
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,560
I must now arrest you for intentional homicide

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,719
Please come back to the station with me

31
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,239
Xiao Cui

32
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:06,799
Th-this...

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,639
Wait a second

34
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,520
If you dare arrest them

35
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,879
I will stab this in

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,080
I will let everyone see

37
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,960
how you cops drive ordinary people to death

38
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,879
Calm down, calm down, you first...

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,879
What is your relationship with Xiao Cui

40
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,120
Why are you risking your life for her

41
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,000
Sister Xiao Cui

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,400
is the one who saved my life

43
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,039
Save me

44
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,159
Help me

45
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,759
I am here to help you

46
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:51,919
Hide in there first

47
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,240
Leave the rest to me

48
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Stop the sedan

49
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,639
Sister Xiao Cui really is a good person

50
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,400
I am begging you

51
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,919
could you let her go

52
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,400
Lao Yuan

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,879
Where are you taking her

54
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,000
To fulfill her

55
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,879
last wish

56
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,280
Dad, Mom

57
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,400
Your daughter has avenged you

58
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,280
You can rest in peace now

59
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,719
Lao Yuan, your hand

60
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,560
I am fine

61
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,599
I am the one who got you hurt

62
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,599
No

63
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,240
Everything

64
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,199
I did all of this of my own will

65
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,519
Lao Yuan

66
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,800
Did we not already agree on this

67
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,439
Xiao Cui

68
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,839
Lao Yuan

69
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,079
Xiao Cui, this...

70
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,879
You two

71
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,040
Just let her be with her parents

72
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,319
and have a proper reunion

73
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,480
Lao Yuan

74
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,519
You and Xiao Cui

75
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,480
what exactly is going on

76
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,920
Three years ago

77
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,360
I was a long term hired hand at the old Qiao estate

78
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,040
Water

79
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,839
Here

80
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,000
Water

81
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,240
Here, for you

82
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,959
Eat slowly

83
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,399
Master, you are here

84
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,279
Go, hurry, just go

85
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,560
I wanted to save her

86
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,600
But

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,560
I did not dare offend Master Qiao

88
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,240
Later I heard

89
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,480
she was buried as a ghost marriage bride

90
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,160
I was eaten up with guilt

91
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,120
I also left the Qiao residence

92
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,000
and opened a funeral parlor

93
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,040
Until one day

94
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,199
I never expected

95
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,360
that Xiao Cui was actually still alive

96
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,120
Xiao Cui

97
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,120
She begged me to make a wedding sedan chair

98
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,120
She was going to save the ghost marriage bride Song Chunya

99
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,079
and avenge herself

100
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,600
After Xiao Cui rescued Chunya

101
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:00,040
the two of them hid in an abandoned temple

102
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,040
I sometimes brought them food

103
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,439
Everyone looked down on people in the funeral trade

104
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,120
Only they never despised me at all

105
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,279
Xiao Cui was afraid you would ruin her revenge

106
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,480
so she asked me to keep you trapped

107
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,160
She had no ill will toward you

108
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:16,959
Sister Xiao Cui

109
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,879
And besides

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,639
Sister Xiao Cui

111
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,680
She is also about to...

112
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,560
Xiao Cui

113
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,360
What is wrong with you, Xiao Cui

114
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,839
I will take you to see a doctor

115
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,879
It is too late

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,639
The doctor said I have a terminal illness

117
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,360
I will not live past this month

118
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,240
Lao Yuan

119
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,560
Lao Yuan

120
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,079
I do not want to finish my revenge and then

121
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,480
be locked in a cold, dark prison

122
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,920
waiting to be executed by firing squad

123
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,639
I cannot choose how to live

124
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,639
I want to choose how I die

125
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,240
I beg you

126
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,720
I beg you, Lao Yuan

127
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,680
Help me

128
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,879
Help me find a way to die that is not so painful

129
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,959
Will you

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,879
For her, I

131
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,480
tried all kinds of ways to die

132
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,000
Only poisoned wine

133
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,000
was suitable

134
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,879
She could

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,160
without any pain

136
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,399
fall asleep

137
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,159
Brother Yuan

138
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,600
Sister Xiao Cui

139
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,759
Sister Xiao Cui

140
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,600
Sister Xiao Cui

141
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,720
The case is closed

142
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,799
I also thank you for your contribution to this case

143
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,759
I applied for a Good Citizen award for you

144
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,200
This...

145
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,720
That is great

146
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,960
Good Citizen

147
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,039
I originally thought

148
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,639
this was a huge stroke of bad luck

149
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,840
never thought it would turn into a blessing

150
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,720
A disaster that brought me money

151
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:56,919
B... but

152
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,960
th... thank you so much

153
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,200
I... I have a lame son

154
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,559
They just arranged a wife for him

155
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,960
If I were not rushing to build a house

156
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,399
I definitely would not take this money

157
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,120
You earned this

158
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,320
Thank you so much

159
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,320
If you ever

160
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:13,039
n... need me to run any errands

161
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,360
just tell me anytime

162
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,240
All right

163
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,840
How is that little Chunya doing

164
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,960
Miss Su found a school for her

165
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,320
That girl has a really fiery temper

166
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,759
If anyone bullies her, she pulls out her hairpin

167
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,440
Good, good

168
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,759
At least we did not let down

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,799
Xiao Cui and Lao Yuan and all their efforts

170
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,080
It is just a pity

171
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,799
we still never figured out who

172
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,360
modified that wedding sedan chair

173
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,480
Anyway

174
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,559
Lao Yuan alone definitely could not do it

175
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,080
There is another piece of good news

176
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,159
The police station announced Xiao Cui's case

177
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,360
They will crack down hard on ghost marriage

178
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:53,080
From now on no one can force a healthy girl

179
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,480
to be buried with the dead

180
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,960
That is wonderful

181
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,799
Well...

182
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,919
In the morgue

183
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,600
Master Qiao's kidney was taken out

184
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,159
We have no idea who did it

185
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,639
Uh

186
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,960
th... then you handle the case

187
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,200
I will not b... bother you

188
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,000
This is bad, something happened at the dance hall

189
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,720
Left eye twitches for fortune, right eye for disaster

190
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,919
So tell me, with my left eye

191
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,519
is it really twitching for money

192
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,759
Master Luo, I am selling noodles

193
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,679
Are you heading out

194
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,679
Good Citizen

195
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,320
We have a case that needs your help

196
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,679
We just parted and there is a new case already

197
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,799
But I am just a carpenter

198
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,200
will I not just get in the way with you

199
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:32,759
That would be a pity then

200
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,279
Solve this case and there are 20 silver dollars

201
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,840
Forget it

202
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,759
W... what kind of case is this

203
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,279
Did you hear that

204
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,879
Why is he here again

205
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,360
Aunt Xie, Xie Xin

206
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,600
Zhang Sheng

207
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,240
Why am I so unlucky today

208
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,360
The car broke down again

209
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,120
Looks like we will not make it to the dance hall today

210
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,240
Let us see if someone will let us stay the night

211
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,480
Is anyone here

212
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,039
Anyone there, anyone there

213
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,279
Is there anyone or not
