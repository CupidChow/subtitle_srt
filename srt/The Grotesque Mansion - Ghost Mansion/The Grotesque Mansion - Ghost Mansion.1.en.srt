1
00:00:30,612 --> 00:00:33,744
Sometimes called a curse.

2
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,214
Sometimes they lie.

3
00:00:37,986 --> 00:00:40,128
Sometimes it's all true.

4
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:43,104
The story I heard...

5
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:46,274
...I don't know if it's true or not.

6
00:00:47,443 --> 00:00:49,046
But one thing is certain.

7
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:54,010
I shouldn't have come here...

8
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:57,399
... to the Gwang-Lim Great House.

CHAPTER 1: THE AUTHOR

14
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:33,100
GWANG-LIM BIG HOUSE

15
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,307
Hello, sir.

16
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:38,568
I'm Jung Ji-woo. I was the one on the phone.

17
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:40,150
Halo.

18
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:48,227
Thank you.

19
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:59,182
Isn't this coffee, Brazil?

20
00:04:00,518 --> 00:04:02,909
Colombia, right?

21
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:05,062
This is herbal tea.

22
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:15,339
Do you mind if I record this, sir?

23
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:18,198
I won't publish it. For my record only.

24
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:19,998
Of course.

25
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:21,488
Good.

26
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:28,054
Do people today use it?

27
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:30,978
I like retro stuff.

28
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:33,502
Ancient stuff, sir.

29
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:39,592
Can you start by introducing yourself?

30
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:44,876
What to introduce? I'm just the administrator here.

31
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,461
Manager ...

32
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:50,063
You said you were a cartoonist?

33
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,927
That is how it is.

34
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,956
Now they call him a cartoon artist.

35
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:58,305
Why would a painting artist come here?

36
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:02,652
I heard rumors...

37
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,842
...a lot of weird things happen here.

38
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,444
Is that true?

39
00:05:12,753 --> 00:05:14,453
This isn't true, is it?

40
00:05:19,429 --> 00:05:21,065
Once upon a time ...

41
00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:23,549
... there are orphans here.

42
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,546
One day, there was a fire.

43
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:30,098
Those who are mature...

44
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:33,859
... left the children and ran to save themselves.

45
00:05:34,758 --> 00:05:37,747
All the children were burned to death.

46
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:43,952
Since then, strange rumors began to sound.

47
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:46,770
People hear strange noises.

48
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:53,617
The man who moved to the fifth floor said the same thing.

49
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,918
He is a novelist.

50
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,493
Isn't it fun?

51
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,500
You can have a look, but you have to decide quickly.

52
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:12,528
This place is quite famous.

53
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,817
Look at the view! What a beautiful building there.

54
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,547
It is very modern and slick.

55
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,894
You know, the air here is very fresh.

56
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:23,077
Know?

57
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:26,913
It's tough.

58
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,247
What are you doing?

59
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:32,606
Do any children live down there?

60
00:06:33,145 --> 00:06:37,627
Possible. But many children come and go during the holidays.

61
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:41,777
You expect a soundproof room at this price?

62
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:46,029
I live on the seventh floor. We can be neighbors, man!

63
00:06:48,262 --> 00:06:50,360
You are not my friend.

64
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:54,840
Water flow!

65
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:57,315
It's very good here, sir.

66
00:06:57,742 --> 00:06:59,900
You have to see it for yourself.

67
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,980
You might erupt.

68
00:07:13,034 --> 00:07:14,706
BEST NEW AUTHOR AWARD

69
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:11,638
You said it's better without me.

70
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:13,012
Then you left the house?

71
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:16,122
When did you ever listen to me?

72
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:17,764
Have you gone mad?

73
00:08:17,824 --> 00:08:22,104
Until I finish my book. It's more comfortable like this.

74
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:23,818
What about our son?

75
00:08:23,865 --> 00:08:26,061
She cries all day long!

76
00:08:26,134 --> 00:08:30,749
He's alone. How do you know he's crying for me?

77
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,105
Up to you!

78
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,610
When you go home?

79
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:36,371
Go home now!

80
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:39,677
Calm down. Your mother is not angry. Do not Cry.

81
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:42,393
I'm almost done.

82
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:47,963
The three of us will live better when I finish writing this.

83
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:51,830
So please. Let me go.

84
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:58,333
So far you've been very good.

85
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:00,560
Sorry I have to say this.

86
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:03,929
- But you talk insolent. - Hello?

87
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:39,856
Welcome.

88
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:43,567
- Is there anything I can help you with? - Please, headache medicine.

89
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:45,516
What do you feel in your head?

90
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:46,734
Ya ...

91
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:51,543
Please, give me anything.

92
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:54,131
Halo.

93
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:55,619
You sell mildew remover?

94
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:57,699
- I'm here first. - Forgive me.

95
00:09:57,878 --> 00:10:01,050
No, we don't have any. Try it at the grocery store there.

96
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:04,073
All in all, $2.60.

97
00:10:08,747 --> 00:10:11,165
Thank you. Your return!

98
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:03,658
JEON WOO-RAM

99
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:38,296
Please back off.

100
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,519
- Just it? - Yes.

101
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:51,693
But the kids came to my house!

102
00:12:52,158 --> 00:12:54,888
Nothing on surveillance cameras. Calm down.

103
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:58,054
How can I calm down? My laptop is broken!

104
00:12:58,165 --> 00:13:00,813
What if I lose all the data on it?

105
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,439
Hear.

106
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,199
Those kids annoy me!

107
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:09,061
As far as I know, no one lives in your basement.

108
00:13:09,132 --> 00:13:14,206
Impossible. I hear noise from downstairs every day!

109
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:15,526
You know where it came from?

110
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,737
Like banging a stick against the roof.

111
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,602
Like this!

112
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:23,813
You locked your door. How did the kids get in?

113
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,742
You think I saw a ghost? That's crazy.

114
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:30,309
That's just funny.

115
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,828
You're funny, you know that?

116
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:35,840
Just forget it. I'm going down to room 404.

117
00:13:48,388 --> 00:13:49,526
Halo.

118
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,522
Excuse me!

119
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:26,593
JEON WOO-RAM

120
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:31,960
It turns out.

121
00:14:34,778 --> 00:14:36,701
I know you're in there, boy!

122
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:38,519
Go out!

123
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:40,884
Tell your parents to get out.

124
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,640
Open it!

125
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:44,623
Open the door!

126
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:45,851
Excuse me!

127
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:48,169
Please do not be noisy

128
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:07,661
Today's children are outrageous.

129
00:15:07,705 --> 00:15:10,678
So are his parents.

130
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,009
Look at this trash!

131
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,924
Why do I hate children?

132
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,249
CHAPTER 2: A PHARMACEUTICAL

133
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,579
DISAPPEAR

134
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:48,704
Namanya, Lee Hyung-hoon.

135
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:51,257
He won many awards and achievements.

136
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:53,023
But it's just weird.

137
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,885
He suddenly stopped writing two years ago.

138
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:57,751
She disappeares.

139
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:00,979
Do artists tend to be like that?

140
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,400
Disappeared without a trace?

141
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,048
The author you mentioned.

142
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:10,687
He does exist.

143
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:12,065
Lee Hyung-hoon.

144
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:16,173
He disappeared two years ago and used to live here.

145
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:17,923
Your last work...

146
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,381
What is the title?

147
00:20:20,706 --> 00:20:21,725
Sorry?

148
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,056
Why are you asking that?

149
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:39,323
'Scary Horror'.

150
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:42,503
Why is your face like that?

151
00:20:43,096 --> 00:20:45,702
It often fails.

152
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:48,589
That must be painful.

153
00:20:53,317 --> 00:20:55,365
I want to know about you.

154
00:20:56,892 --> 00:20:58,567
Where were you born?

155
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,877
What is your interest?

156
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:02,501
Are you dating?

157
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:06,287
Why? Am I burdening you?

158
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,683
No, it's not like that.

159
00:21:11,588 --> 00:21:15,268
I'm not used to talking like this with my parents.

160
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:19,074
They say...

161
00:21:19,835 --> 00:21:22,996
...life changes according to who you meet.

162
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:27,362
Of course, not every meeting ends well.

163
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:35,091
Once there was a woman living on the ninth floor.

164
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,120
She is very beautiful and fashionable.

165
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,433
He doesn't deserve to be in this place.

166
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,756
According to him...

167
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:50,963
...it was fate, but dating the wrong guy.

168
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:55,357
Someone he shouldn't have met.

169
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:06,737
Latest news.

170
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,202
A man kills his wife and nine year old daughter...

171
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:13,419
... and is said to have fled the scene.

172
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,935
Police are trying to find the culprit.

173
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,880
They took the nearby CCTV footage...

174
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,712
...and contacted his comrades.

175
00:22:22,015 --> 00:22:23,127
Next news.

176
00:22:23,264 --> 00:22:26,583
A man kills his mother and son and his wife...

177
00:22:26,634 --> 00:22:29,220
... and saw him commit suicide.

178
00:22:33,922 --> 00:22:35,087
Yes?

179
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,319
Why haven't you picked up my phone lately?

180
00:22:37,344 --> 00:22:39,145
I am busy.

181
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,231
Just be honest. You're dating, right?

182
00:22:43,715 --> 00:22:45,338
Don't mention that again, ma'am.

183
00:22:45,466 --> 00:22:48,295
You only pick up my phone once or twice a week.

184
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,545
You never pick up if it's past eight at night.

185
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,268
You think I don't know you?

186
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,226
Yes, you don't know me.

187
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:55,816
No need to worry.

188
00:22:55,886 --> 00:22:58,229
How can I not worry?

189
00:22:58,488 --> 00:23:00,088
Remember what I always said...

190
00:23:00,158 --> 00:23:01,253
Men can't be trusted!

191
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:03,802
Stop it! Don't talk about dad anymore.

192
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:09,624
If it wasn't for him, my life wouldn't be like this.

193
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:14,364
What about your life? You even have a boyfriend.

194
00:23:15,631 --> 00:23:17,262
Who said that?

195
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:21,119
It's all clear, ma'am.

196
00:23:21,204 --> 00:23:23,834
Secretly date him or remarry.

197
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:25,819
It's not a serious relationship.

198
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,985
And don't change the subject. Reply me!

199
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:31,810
Mother.

200
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:36,026
I'm not dating anyone and have no plans for it.

201
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:38,611
So don't bother me about that.

202
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:11,484
After killing his mother and son with his wife...

203
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,940
...the husband saw...

204
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:17,626
Welcome.

205
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:20,057
Is there anything I can help you with?

206
00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:21,647
Headache medicine please.

207
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:23,670
How's the pain in your head?

208
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:25,127
In fact...

209
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:28,925
Give me any medicine.

210
00:24:29,272 --> 00:24:30,310
Halo.

211
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,430
You sell medicinal mushrooms?

212
00:24:32,484 --> 00:24:34,444
- I'm here first. - Forgive me.

213
00:24:34,497 --> 00:24:37,011
We don't sell it. Try it at the grocery store there.

214
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,704
All in all, $2.60.

215
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:46,260
- Thank you. - Your change!

216
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:50,377
What is wrong with him?

217
00:24:52,495 --> 00:24:54,640
CD Metadata.

218
00:24:54,682 --> 00:24:55,976
Good grief!

219
00:24:56,504 --> 00:24:58,211
- Did you come here? - Yes.

220
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,621
- Since when? - I've been here long enough.

221
00:25:00,735 --> 00:25:03,336
- Where's the Metadate CD? - On the top shelf.

222
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,849
You said not to come today.

223
00:25:06,094 --> 00:25:09,629
What's the point of staying at home? My son makes me dizzy.

224
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,350
Order another box of this medicine.

225
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,425
ADHD medication? What's so much for?

226
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,325
Just order it for me.

227
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,694
Okay.

228
00:25:21,275 --> 00:25:25,062
By the way, how does it feel to be married?

229
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:30,499
You're still dating that stupid looking married man?

230
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:33,101
Yes, he's married, but he's not stupid.

231
00:25:33,704 --> 00:25:38,445
There are two things you can't do in life.

232
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,825
One, who is married, the other is having an affair.

233
00:25:41,035 --> 00:25:44,355
But you want to do both?

234
00:25:46,235 --> 00:25:48,351
Ho-jun. Are you on your lunch break?

235
00:25:49,752 --> 00:25:50,906
Halo?

236
00:25:53,455 --> 00:25:54,882
Halo?

237
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,057
I'll come later tonight.

238
00:25:57,265 --> 00:25:59,056
Is there any problem?

239
00:26:00,023 --> 00:26:02,173
- We'll talk about it later. - Why?

240
00:26:07,044 --> 00:26:08,315
Have you gone mad?

241
00:26:09,358 --> 00:26:11,475
How did you get fourth place?

242
00:26:13,292 --> 00:26:15,060
- I can't talk any longer. - Wait.

243
00:26:15,796 --> 00:26:16,854
What

244
00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:20,692
But...

245
00:26:21,489 --> 00:26:24,052
Continue. Why is your place so low?

246
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,694
Ho-jun!

247
00:26:43,523 --> 00:26:44,818
Is it raining outside?

248
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:48,204
Why don't you pick up my phone?

249
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,539
Why are you wet?

250
00:26:52,615 --> 00:26:53,845
Dear.

251
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,355
Has something happened?

252
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,748
My wife already knows.

253
00:27:01,612 --> 00:27:03,656
I remind you not to call me at night.

254
00:27:08,636 --> 00:27:09,985
That's good.

255
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:12,518
- What? - Just divorce.

256
00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:14,856
- Why did you say that? - You're planning to go too.

257
00:27:14,923 --> 00:27:17,067
Don't you think this won't happen?

258
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:19,453
You think I'm dating you without this in mind?

259
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:20,607
How about you?

260
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:22,471
No?

261
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,816
Tell me.

262
00:27:25,858 --> 00:27:27,564
You mean I have to end my marriage?

263
00:27:28,573 --> 00:27:30,382
Start a new life with me.

264
00:27:32,691 --> 00:27:34,411
You want that too!

265
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:44,237
Help me.

266
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:47,921
Meanwhile let me stay here.

267
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:51,453
But don't tell anyone I'm here.

268
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:55,088
If someone asks, you just say you don't know.

269
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:57,558
Understand?

270
00:27:58,521 --> 00:27:59,605
No.

271
00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:04,983
Not for a while.

272
00:28:07,906 --> 00:28:09,553
Stay forever with me.

273
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,913
Ho-jun.

274
00:28:50,502 --> 00:28:51,669
Dear.

275
00:28:53,743 --> 00:28:54,965
Dear?

276
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:36,737
I'm going to work.

277
00:30:37,215 --> 00:30:39,166
Okay. See you later.

278
00:30:56,544 --> 00:30:59,586
- You came early? - Yes.

279
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,276
What is it?

280
00:31:04,758 --> 00:31:06,455
Nona Choi Sun-hwa?

281
00:31:06,538 --> 00:31:07,596
Yes.

282
00:31:07,722 --> 00:31:09,970
I'm Detective Park from the Dong-sung Police.

283
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:11,493
I'm Dong-pal.

284
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:13,703
- I'm the Inspector. - You are...

285
00:31:14,818 --> 00:31:16,272
What is the problem?

286
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,093
You know Jung Ho-jun, right?

287
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,989
Do you have a minute?

288
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:27,303
Jung is wanted for being a suspect in the murder of his family.

289
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,355
Do you know his whereabouts?

290
00:31:30,534 --> 00:31:32,914
I heard you had a relationship with him.

291
00:31:33,081 --> 00:31:36,290
A man kills his wife and nine year old daughter...

292
00:31:36,374 --> 00:31:39,578
... and is said to have fled the scene.

293
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:41,583
My wife already knows.

294
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,399
Help me.

295
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,460
Let me stay here for a while.

296
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,808
But don't tell anyone I'm here.

297
00:31:48,128 --> 00:31:49,972
If someone asks, just answer you don't know.

298
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:51,159
Understand?

299
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:58,400
Dear?

300
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:02,645
Ho-jun?

301
00:32:06,377 --> 00:32:07,496
Dear?

302
00:32:10,717 --> 00:32:12,361
Honey, come out.

303
00:32:12,658 --> 00:32:14,037
We must...

304
00:32:26,372 --> 00:32:27,434
Dear?

305
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,923
Don't tell anyone I shower here.

306
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:34,081
The police came to my pharmacy.

307
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:37,853
I know what happened.

308
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:43,327
I don't know what happened, but get out of here.

309
00:32:44,144 --> 00:32:47,120
If we run away now, that's better.

310
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:53,006
Dear?

311
00:32:53,131 --> 00:32:55,575
Don't tell anyone I shower here.

312
00:32:56,113 --> 00:32:57,359
Trust me.

313
00:32:58,317 --> 00:32:59,897
Everything will be fine.

314
00:33:00,588 --> 00:33:02,466
So far we're doing fine.

315
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:05,827
I can definitely take care of it.

316
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,800
Did you hear it?

317
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:12,827
Dear?

318
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,996
Don't tell anyone I shower here.

319
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,940
I just need you.

320
00:33:19,752 --> 00:33:21,315
Let's go as far as possible.

321
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:34,496
Take it easy.

322
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:37,419
Everything is fine.

323
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:41,932
Finish your shower and hurry out.

324
00:33:42,348 --> 00:33:43,385
Dear.

325
00:33:43,404 --> 00:33:45,803
Don't tell anyone I'm taking a shower here.

326
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:49,315
Dear. Don't tell anyone I'm taking a shower here.

327
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:51,891
I won't tell anyone, hurry up and get out!

328
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,340
Dear.

329
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:31,959
Don't tell anyone I'm taking a shower here.

330
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,133
Sun-hwa.

331
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:51,147
Sun-hwa!

332
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:04,516
Dear.

333
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,507
Don't tell anyone I'm taking a shower here.

334
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:19,710
Are you home? Hello?

335
00:35:19,982 --> 00:35:21,034
Dear?

336
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:23,447
Don't tell anyone I'm taking a shower here.

337
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:24,517
Who's that?

338
00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:25,930
Sun-hwa?

339
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:28,449
Sun-hwa!

340
00:35:31,223 --> 00:35:32,417
What is it?

341
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,027
Dear.

342
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:42,011
I hear your voice from in there.

343
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:46,964
You said not to tell anyone you were bathing here.

344
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:48,042
Dear.

345
00:35:48,086 --> 00:35:50,657
Don't tell anyone I'm taking a shower here.

346
00:36:48,303 --> 00:36:49,435
But, Sun-hwa.

347
00:36:51,518 --> 00:36:54,363
I said don't tell anyone I'm taking a shower here.

348
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:57,055
Dear?

349
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:02,182
Why did you tell?

350
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:46,064
CHAPTER 3: SELLER OF GOODS

351
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:07,234
Halo?

352
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:43,595
You live in Gwang-Lim's mansion, right?

353
00:38:48,173 --> 00:38:50,326
What happened to you there?

354
00:39:08,856 --> 00:39:11,376
GOODS STAY RIGHT AWAY

355
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,527
- What are you doing? - Work.

356
00:39:21,743 --> 00:39:23,988
You're not working, sir.

357
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:28,723
You remember the unit you rented last week?

358
00:39:29,011 --> 00:39:32,654
The new tenant says different to what you say.

359
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:34,470
Of course.

360
00:39:35,271 --> 00:39:37,612
And that grandma, you rented out three bedrooms last month...

361
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,595
...says it has a lien for it.

362
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:44,792
His grandson phone complained many times about the deposit he gave.

363
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:46,474
What housing?

364
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,930
What do you think?

365
00:39:49,165 --> 00:39:52,790
That's not selling the house, but marketing it.

366
00:39:52,928 --> 00:39:54,981
- Ever been on a blind date? - Yes.

367
00:39:55,937 --> 00:39:57,047
Have you ever?

368
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:01,457
You know what he was like before you met?

369
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:03,426
No. So what?

370
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:05,434
You're just guessing.

371
00:40:05,623 --> 00:40:07,069
You don't know what he likes.

372
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,864
Who chooses? The client himself.

373
00:40:09,947 --> 00:40:13,350
But our job is to choose the best and show them.

374
00:40:15,095 --> 00:40:18,031
What should I do with you?

375
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:23,160
You have to market it that it's the best.

376
00:40:25,245 --> 00:40:30,522
Why do people dress well and stuff before going on a blind date?

377
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,810
To show his kindness...

378
00:40:32,852 --> 00:40:35,985
... and cover up the ugliness as best you can.

379
00:40:36,256 --> 00:40:37,588
It is common.

380
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:40,353
Where are you going?

381
00:40:41,975 --> 00:40:43,018
Blind date.

382
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,927
You are not my friend.

383
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:49,723
Waterways!

384
00:40:49,877 --> 00:40:52,201
It's very nice here, sir.

385
00:40:52,344 --> 00:40:54,838
You have to see it.

386
00:40:55,212 --> 00:40:56,740
Maybe it will gush at you.

387
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:03,560
Making a living is hard.

388
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,821
Honey, I'm home.

389
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:25,605
I am hungry.

390
00:41:25,887 --> 00:41:27,807
Isn't it cold today?

391
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:38,087
Very delicious.

392
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:41,035
It turns out that kimchi is delicious.

393
00:41:47,022 --> 00:41:49,317
Today's customer is an author.

394
00:41:50,197 --> 00:41:52,893
He went around and inspected the place carefully.

395
00:41:56,244 --> 00:41:58,677
Then he said, "You're not my friend."

396
00:42:00,263 --> 00:42:04,261
What's wrong with calling him a friend?

397
00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:09,431
Okay.

398
00:42:10,981 --> 00:42:13,357
I almost forgot.

399
00:42:15,307 --> 00:42:16,467
Wait a minute.

400
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:22,825
Then! Then!

401
00:42:23,623 --> 00:42:25,027
I found it on my way.

402
00:42:28,052 --> 00:42:30,884
It took me a long time to pick it up.

403
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,447
You look gloomy.

404
00:42:35,308 --> 00:42:36,882
I'll put it on you.

405
00:42:45,403 --> 00:42:46,572
Dear.

406
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:53,839
I already called headquarters.

407
00:42:54,346 --> 00:42:58,659
If they don't fix it this time, I'll sue them.

408
00:43:00,094 --> 00:43:02,917
You don't have to come over and over like that time.

409
00:43:04,255 --> 00:43:06,143
Already.

410
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:11,690
Do not worry.

411
00:44:42,982 --> 00:44:44,982
Unlucky!

412
00:45:46,022 --> 00:45:48,810
Do you have female friends?

413
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,787
What? No. Maybe that's how it is.

414
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:54,777
Why are you asking that?

415
00:45:57,194 --> 00:45:58,266
Look at this.

416
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:00,635
This is women's hair.

417
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:05,207
I have worked in this field for more than 10 years.

418
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:08,431
Sometimes they wash their hair here in winter...

419
00:46:08,473 --> 00:46:10,011
...because the bathroom was cold.

420
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:14,366
It is not easily destroyed. This becomes a stopper.

421
00:46:14,456 --> 00:46:18,098
It will be destroyed the right way. What are you talking about?

422
00:46:18,202 --> 00:46:21,954
And who washes their hair in the sink these days?

423
00:46:22,018 --> 00:46:24,535
I'm the expert here.

424
00:46:24,607 --> 00:46:26,057
You must have just moved.

425
00:46:26,168 --> 00:46:28,575
If not you, it must be the previous occupant.

426
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:31,280
I'll try to get it out by hand.

427
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:34,639
If that fails, I'll have to go and get a rubber suction cup.

428
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,400
Tool with per in it.

429
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,984
I had to roll it up and push it a few feet in.

430
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:43,926
I have to keep pushing it. If it still fails?

431
00:46:44,014 --> 00:46:47,266
So I had to go to the bottom unit to cut the roof and get into the pipe.

432
00:46:47,355 --> 00:46:49,176
So how much does it cost?

433
00:46:52,782 --> 00:46:55,414
The cost is a little expensive.

434
00:46:58,977 --> 00:47:01,077
Isn't it okay to see other people's personal data?

435
00:47:01,175 --> 00:47:02,991
I have to pay 500 dollars in repairs.

436
00:47:03,075 --> 00:47:04,837
I wonder who lives there.

437
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,571
And after you know?

438
00:47:06,755 --> 00:47:08,328
Asking for a refund.

439
00:47:09,584 --> 00:47:10,694
But, sir.

440
00:47:11,502 --> 00:47:13,070
You live in the Gwang-Lim mansion, right?

441
00:47:13,345 --> 00:47:15,865
- I heard rumors about that place. - What?

442
00:47:19,396 --> 00:47:20,523
Cancelled.

443
00:47:21,891 --> 00:47:23,055
LEE JI-YEUN

444
00:47:23,865 --> 00:47:24,882
Could.

445
00:47:36,301 --> 00:47:38,428
Hello. I'm from Right Away Realty.

446
00:47:43,055 --> 00:47:44,286
Halo?

447
00:47:47,512 --> 00:47:48,566
Halo?

448
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,691
Halo?

449
00:48:28,328 --> 00:48:29,452
Yes.

450
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,556
He's wrapped up. I'll send it tomorrow morning.

451
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:39,457
Can you make sure to fix it properly this time?

452
00:48:41,454 --> 00:48:44,894
Don't make him go back and forth like that time.

453
00:48:46,485 --> 00:48:49,069
He is very valuable. You know that.

454
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:51,138
Thank you.

455
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,595
Please take good care of him.

456
00:48:55,329 --> 00:48:56,584
Until found.

457
00:49:32,228 --> 00:49:34,812
Unlucky.

458
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:37,798
The person and the tool.

459
00:49:38,662 --> 00:49:41,286
Why not just pour in some liquid and just dry it?

460
00:49:43,562 --> 00:49:44,746
Where's my cell phone?

461
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:12,497
Do you know what a black hole is?

462
00:51:12,851 --> 00:51:14,307
Yes, why?

463
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:17,103
Could it be in the house?

464
00:51:20,797 --> 00:51:22,209
Just forget it.

465
00:51:22,652 --> 00:51:25,387
Where might it be in the house ...

466
00:51:27,943 --> 00:51:31,705
Sir, I'm feeling worried.

467
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:36,199
I heard that the high school girl died in Gwang-Lim's big house.

468
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:40,324
It might happen.

469
00:51:40,561 --> 00:51:41,707
Not that.

470
00:51:41,913 --> 00:51:45,402
Many people died and disappeared in that place.

471
00:51:46,342 --> 00:51:48,281
I heard it was built by Gwang-Lim Church.

472
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:53,219
His followers believe his leader died and committed suicide.

473
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:56,122
What are you reporting?

474
00:51:58,892 --> 00:52:00,828
You already know, right?

475
00:52:03,717 --> 00:52:05,667
It is a place of worship.

476
00:52:16,546 --> 00:52:18,473
Do you think I made a mistake?

477
00:52:20,315 --> 00:52:22,836
Such a thing does not happen in a perfect home.

478
00:52:23,302 --> 00:52:25,937
I'm just doing my job.

479
00:52:30,467 --> 00:52:31,483
What?

480
00:52:32,295 --> 00:52:33,345
Is that a curse?

481
00:52:37,837 --> 00:52:39,565
I'm just marketing the place!

482
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,566
Why are you looking at me?

483
00:52:45,016 --> 00:52:46,048
What?

484
00:52:51,184 --> 00:52:53,151
Sorry for messing up when we first met.

485
00:52:55,027 --> 00:52:59,174
I just want to get to know you better.

486
00:53:00,789 --> 00:53:04,779
Have a drink. Tos.

487
00:56:36,566 --> 00:56:38,854
So you moved and lived here?

488
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,436
Gwang-Lim Church.

489
00:56:48,982 --> 00:56:50,198
Gwang-Lim Church?

490
00:56:50,555 --> 00:56:55,238
I got cursed because of those crazy followers.

491
00:57:00,544 --> 00:57:02,150
The curse will spread to the others as well.

492
00:57:05,753 --> 00:57:07,063
What else?

493
00:57:08,473 --> 00:57:09,999
What's up with Gwang-Lim Church?

494
00:57:12,338 --> 00:57:13,800
I'm just marketing it.

495
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:17,468
That's all I did.

496
00:57:17,772 --> 00:57:18,874
Sir.

497
00:57:19,855 --> 00:57:21,488
I didn't do anything wrong.

498
00:57:22,193 --> 00:57:24,847
I'm just marketing it.

499
00:57:25,306 --> 00:57:26,754
That's all I did.

500
00:57:27,142 --> 00:57:28,462
I didn't do anything wrong.

501
00:57:28,738 --> 00:57:31,555
I'm just marketing it. It's not my fault.

502
00:57:31,843 --> 00:57:33,590
I'm just marketing it.

503
00:57:34,236 --> 00:57:35,422
It's not my fault.

504
00:57:35,948 --> 00:57:37,732
I didn't do anything wrong.

505
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:42,612
I didn't do anything wrong.

506
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:54,832
SCARY HORROR

507
00:58:21,223 --> 00:58:24,202
CHAPTER 4: STUDENTS

508
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:40,895
Ji-woo.

509
00:58:41,196 --> 00:58:42,225
Yes.

510
00:58:45,744 --> 00:58:48,750
You know your last work failed?

511
00:58:52,489 --> 00:58:54,511
Because it's not pictured like this.

512
00:58:57,536 --> 00:59:00,703
Why didn't you draw like this in the first place?

513
00:59:00,819 --> 00:59:04,030
It's better than your last work.

514
00:59:04,098 --> 00:59:05,946
- So, we agree? - Yes.

515
00:59:06,707 --> 00:59:07,722
But...

516
00:59:09,448 --> 00:59:10,682
It's too short.

517
00:59:12,126 --> 00:59:14,848
This is not a short story.

518
00:59:15,672 --> 00:59:17,704
Make it longer.

519
00:59:18,131 --> 00:59:21,127
I'll send you a deposit now.

520
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:25,392
Do not give it to another publisher.

521
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:29,478
Make it a long story.

522
00:59:29,744 --> 00:59:30,786
You sure can.

523
00:59:32,572 --> 00:59:33,728
I know you can.

524
00:59:35,636 --> 00:59:39,311
- So you're going back there? - Yes.

525
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,906
Did you forget what day it is?

526
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:45,865
It's your birthday!

527
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:49,348
Really?

528
00:59:49,907 --> 00:59:51,915
Take a break today.

529
00:59:52,017 --> 00:59:54,009
You've worked too hard.

530
00:59:54,179 --> 00:59:56,624
Look, there are dark circles under your eyes.

531
00:59:57,316 --> 01:00:01,159
I mean it doesn't look bad.

532
01:00:01,726 --> 01:00:03,916
- I'll call you. - Listen first.

533
01:00:04,236 --> 01:00:05,988
Please, just rest today.

534
01:00:06,123 --> 01:00:07,684
You'll get a web cartoon deal.

535
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:10,982
Can't you appreciate yourself a little?

536
01:00:11,266 --> 01:00:12,355
And also...

537
01:00:12,431 --> 01:00:15,238
- Cut the cake with me. - Da-hae...

538
01:00:16,954 --> 01:00:19,311
Can you go?

539
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,693
You need another story?

540
01:00:34,139 --> 01:00:37,188
Yes, as much as possible.

541
01:00:37,747 --> 01:00:38,897
Okay.

542
01:00:40,165 --> 01:00:42,552
There's nothing more I can tell you.

543
01:00:42,869 --> 01:00:43,882
Sorry?

544
01:00:48,584 --> 01:00:51,152
Sir, I will pay you.

545
01:00:56,624 --> 01:00:57,717
Tell me.

546
01:00:58,535 --> 01:01:00,746
I'll give you what you want.

547
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:08,903
It happened on the sixth floor.

548
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,586
There is a young man.

549
01:01:13,548 --> 01:01:15,924
He returned after studying abroad.

550
01:01:16,562 --> 01:01:19,658
He failed college and came back again.

551
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:25,536
Jae-seok.

552
01:01:25,713 --> 01:01:27,751
He didn't know where to go.

553
01:01:28,506 --> 01:01:33,072
Only his little friend asked for help.

554
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:34,919
Jae-seok?

555
01:01:38,526 --> 01:01:39,734
Halo!

556
01:01:48,296 --> 01:01:49,680
Jae-seok!

557
01:01:55,452 --> 01:01:57,708
THEIR PRAYERS BLESS THE SERVANTS OF THIS HOUSE

558
01:02:00,893 --> 01:02:01,989
Tae-hoon!

559
01:02:02,847 --> 01:02:03,970
Jae-seok.

560
01:02:08,978 --> 01:02:10,724
How are you, man?

561
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:15,297
I'm not a guest. Why spend that much?

562
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:19,460
Now that you're back, you should eat kimchi.

563
01:02:19,637 --> 01:02:21,390
I also eat kimchi there.

564
01:02:23,608 --> 01:02:26,669
Do you clean often?

565
01:02:27,255 --> 01:02:28,291
Busy?

566
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:30,432
No.

567
01:02:31,061 --> 01:02:32,690
What's your occupation?

568
01:02:34,397 --> 01:02:35,498
I?

569
01:02:36,596 --> 01:02:39,886
I'm studying for the civil service exam.

570
01:02:40,301 --> 01:02:42,957
Civil servant?

571
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:45,733
Very noble.

572
01:02:46,976 --> 01:02:48,072
Glorious?

573
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:50,289
I mean, that's great.

574
01:02:51,181 --> 01:02:53,729
You look cool after studying abroad.

575
01:02:53,807 --> 01:02:56,782
Cool? It's up to you, man.

576
01:03:04,452 --> 01:03:05,773
What's that?

577
01:03:07,372 --> 01:03:08,399
What?

578
01:03:09,401 --> 01:03:10,715
What's that on your face?

579
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:15,854
Do not know. Sometimes I experience this.

580
01:03:17,487 --> 01:03:18,732
Is it contagious?

581
01:03:19,244 --> 01:03:22,451
If it's contagious, I'll let you know.

582
01:03:24,749 --> 01:03:26,416
You haven't changed.

583
01:03:29,817 --> 01:03:33,220
Thank you for letting me stay here.

584
01:03:33,379 --> 01:03:34,744
Two weeks at most.

585
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:37,833
Others asked me to come, but I miss you.

586
01:03:38,341 --> 01:03:39,892
I miss you, man!

587
01:03:44,581 --> 01:03:47,707
You can stay longer. My parents allowed it.

588
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:49,427
Your parents?

589
01:03:55,773 --> 01:03:56,862
Thanks the Food.

590
01:04:08,538 --> 01:04:10,289
I think the food is stale.

591
01:04:31,003 --> 01:04:34,693
WHY CAN'T I CALL YOU, BOY!

592
01:04:35,034 --> 01:04:36,706
Tae-hoon? You're awake?

593
01:04:38,612 --> 01:04:39,661
Not yet.

594
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,318
Can I ask you something?

595
01:04:44,385 --> 01:04:45,449
Certain.

596
01:04:48,437 --> 01:04:50,336
You have lots of friends.

597
01:04:50,815 --> 01:04:52,287
Why did you come here?

598
01:04:53,711 --> 01:04:57,180
I told you, because I wanted to see you.

599
01:04:57,776 --> 01:05:01,392
You never came when we were at school.

600
01:05:02,374 --> 01:05:03,382
Is it true?

601
01:05:10,088 --> 01:05:11,236
Jae-seok.

602
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:13,661
Doesn't it feel damp here?

603
01:05:14,657 --> 01:05:17,542
I saw mold growing in several places.

604
01:05:18,219 --> 01:05:20,898
If you're busy with work, I'll clean the house tomorrow.

605
01:06:05,672 --> 01:06:06,831
Sorry for the noise.

606
01:06:07,016 --> 01:06:08,975
No problem.

607
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:10,842
I think this house is a little dirty.

608
01:06:11,025 --> 01:06:12,490
I'll be home at night.

609
01:06:12,642 --> 01:06:14,362
Just eat what's in the fridge.

610
01:06:16,121 --> 01:06:17,122
Okay.

611
01:06:44,974 --> 01:06:47,083
Unlucky! Just forget it.

612
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:06,388
This is disgusting.

613
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:45,179
Okay.

614
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,038
- Give me anything. - Hello.

615
01:07:49,309 --> 01:07:50,480
You sell mildew remover?

616
01:07:50,544 --> 01:07:52,766
- I'm here first. - Forgive me.

617
01:08:06,057 --> 01:08:07,782
I don't like this place.

618
01:08:42,877 --> 01:08:44,277
Unlucky.

619
01:10:10,294 --> 01:10:11,542
You're home?

620
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:15,477
You will fall ill living in a place like this.

621
01:10:15,689 --> 01:10:17,790
I clean it all day here.

622
01:10:20,418 --> 01:10:21,479
Hey!

623
01:10:22,803 --> 01:10:23,971
What is it?

624
01:10:26,356 --> 01:10:27,875
What do you think?

625
01:10:28,269 --> 01:10:29,544
It's clean now, right?

626
01:10:30,485 --> 01:10:32,182
- Because I live here too... - Hey!

627
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:33,574
What are you doing?!

628
01:10:33,697 --> 01:10:35,742
How dare you! Why?!

629
01:10:35,905 --> 01:10:38,071
How dare you do this to my mother and father!

630
01:10:38,219 --> 01:10:41,382
Give them back! You're outrageous!

631
01:11:12,366 --> 01:11:14,997
YOUNG-JOON

632
01:11:16,207 --> 01:11:17,841
- Hello? - Hey, man!

633
01:11:18,767 --> 01:11:20,413
Young-joon! It's me.

634
01:11:21,816 --> 01:11:24,688
- Who's this? - It's me, Tae-hoon.

635
01:11:25,413 --> 01:11:27,192
Tae-hoon?

636
01:11:27,852 --> 01:11:30,374
Long time no see, man!

637
01:11:30,467 --> 01:11:32,547
Why didn't you read my message?

638
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:36,145
I am busy. Are you in Korea?

639
01:11:36,201 --> 01:11:37,957
Certain! That's why I called.

640
01:11:39,153 --> 01:11:42,613
Can I come now?

641
01:11:43,213 --> 01:11:47,202
I miss you and want to know how you are.

642
01:11:47,957 --> 01:11:49,809
- Now? - Yes, now.

643
01:11:50,576 --> 01:11:52,089
But I'm with my lover.

644
01:11:52,689 --> 01:11:55,423
Do not lie! You don't have a boyfriend!

645
01:11:56,511 --> 01:11:58,325
Okay. Just come.

646
01:11:59,057 --> 01:12:00,995
Thanks, dude!

647
01:12:01,142 --> 01:12:03,697
I'll be there soon!

648
01:12:03,764 --> 01:12:07,528
Please provide your address.

649
01:12:11,572 --> 01:12:12,634
Halo?

650
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,454
Halo?

651
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:06,847
Tae-hoon.

652
01:14:09,107 --> 01:14:11,271
I'm sorry I was angry with you earlier.

653
01:14:14,496 --> 01:14:17,200
But my parents are also angry.

654
01:14:17,909 --> 01:14:21,114
You went overseas with my parents here.

655
01:14:21,805 --> 01:14:26,059
But since we're little friends...

656
01:14:26,335 --> 01:14:28,974
...and you just came back from overseas...

657
01:14:29,956 --> 01:14:31,836
...I explained everything to them.

658
01:14:33,673 --> 01:14:35,802
- Jae-seok. - So...

659
01:15:10,395 --> 01:15:12,748
Stay here with me.

660
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:20,566
Help!

661
01:15:40,698 --> 01:15:42,657
Why do things like this keep happening?

662
01:15:46,327 --> 01:15:48,647
Is this place really cursed?

663
01:15:50,433 --> 01:15:51,875
Or Gwang-Lim Church ...

664
01:15:52,646 --> 01:15:54,814
What does that have to do with worship?

665
01:15:55,516 --> 01:15:57,100
I heard from a real estate seller...

666
01:15:57,335 --> 01:15:58,735
...that this building...

667
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:01,579
...built by those cultists.

668
01:16:03,743 --> 01:16:05,111
What exactly?

669
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:12,606
There are places that have been closed for a long time.

670
01:16:13,099 --> 01:16:15,242
Maybe you can find out a lot if you go there.

671
01:16:15,891 --> 01:16:17,907
Why do these things happen.

672
01:16:29,578 --> 01:16:31,494
Why don't you go and find out?

673
01:16:32,156 --> 01:16:33,684
You see for yourself.

674
01:16:42,193 --> 01:16:45,095
LAST CHAPTER: THE MANAGER

675
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:51,663
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JI-WOO

676
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:55,430
Genie. Turn it off.

677
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:10,306
GWANG-LIM MANSION BIG HOUSE 1

678
01:17:10,414 --> 01:17:12,069
Can you start by introducing yourself?

679
01:17:13,166 --> 01:17:15,189
He sounded so cold.

680
01:17:16,337 --> 01:17:19,266
How long have you been here?

681
01:17:23,145 --> 01:17:25,833
The next question is...

682
01:17:30,678 --> 01:17:32,188
Does anyone still live here?

683
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,650
I heard rumors...

684
01:17:39,263 --> 01:17:43,483
...a lot of strange things happen here.

685
01:17:44,939 --> 01:17:46,331
Is it true?

686
01:17:54,911 --> 01:17:56,624
GWANG-LIM BIG HOUSE 2

687
01:17:59,727 --> 01:18:02,579
It often fails.

688
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:07,476
No, it's not like that.

689
01:18:09,184 --> 01:18:12,796
I'm not used to talking like this with my parents.

690
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:28,866
Halo.

691
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:47,013
Halo.

692
01:25:17,066 --> 01:25:19,690
If you're listening to this, Ji-Woo...

693
01:25:21,051 --> 01:25:24,049
...means you really want to know the truth.

694
01:25:25,188 --> 01:25:30,177
That way, you deserve to hear it.

695
01:25:31,463 --> 01:25:33,561
I have to admit something.

696
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:37,386
I'm not the administrator here.

697
01:25:38,632 --> 01:25:43,042
In the past, I was also a newcomer here.

698
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:44,611
Just like you.

699
01:25:46,296 --> 01:25:50,419
But what I'm looking for, isn't the truth.

700
01:25:52,035 --> 01:25:56,826
That time, on a winter night.

701
01:25:58,706 --> 01:25:59,746
my brother.

702
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:03,614
Are you sure about this place?

703
01:26:03,955 --> 01:26:05,267
You are!

704
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:06,656
Don't ask too much!

705
01:26:06,917 --> 01:26:09,298
How is there a safe in here?

706
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,573
Although they are worshipers ...

707
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:15,783
...maybe they put the money in the bank.

708
01:26:17,077 --> 01:26:20,252
"Wealth is where the heart is"

709
01:26:21,006 --> 01:26:24,299
That is what the head of the cult always said to his followers.

710
01:26:25,926 --> 01:26:27,614
It must be here.

711
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:32,244
What are you wearing?

712
01:26:33,496 --> 01:26:34,614
This?

713
01:26:34,967 --> 01:26:38,195
If I get caught, I'll call it a courier.

714
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:40,200
Want to use it too?

715
01:26:42,138 --> 01:26:43,658
Forget it, idiot!

716
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,592
Wait for me!

717
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:20,803
Kak!

718
01:27:22,204 --> 01:27:23,286
Hear that?

719
01:27:23,523 --> 01:27:24,699
Tools!

720
01:27:25,703 --> 01:27:26,744
Didn't you hear that?

721
01:27:27,758 --> 01:27:30,422
There was a strange sound there.

722
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:34,444
Hee-dong.

723
01:27:36,757 --> 01:27:39,034
Your mother fell ill while you were in prison.

724
01:27:39,341 --> 01:27:40,829
He needs surgery.

725
01:27:43,579 --> 01:27:47,067
If we get money here, your mother...

726
01:27:47,821 --> 01:27:49,536
...could be saved.

727
01:28:26,422 --> 01:28:27,446
Kak!

728
01:29:58,750 --> 01:30:00,664
You scared me!

729
01:30:00,766 --> 01:30:01,825
Stop it!

730
01:30:03,663 --> 01:30:04,795
Kak.

731
01:30:05,167 --> 01:30:06,565
Is anybody there.

732
01:30:06,607 --> 01:30:08,569
I just saw someone.

733
01:30:11,142 --> 01:30:12,403
Don't go there.

734
01:30:12,663 --> 01:30:14,898
I saw someone there.

735
01:30:14,953 --> 01:30:18,104
I saw the head move! Don't go there.

736
01:30:31,459 --> 01:30:36,324
I don't think there's a safe here. Let's get out of here, Sis.

737
01:30:39,805 --> 01:30:41,853
Who says there are no safes?

738
01:30:46,822 --> 01:30:47,846
Wait!

739
01:30:52,581 --> 01:30:54,255
Where are you going?

740
01:30:57,744 --> 01:30:58,760
Kak.

741
01:31:00,347 --> 01:31:01,475
Brother, what is this?

742
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:04,846
What's this?

743
01:31:13,304 --> 01:31:14,988
This is the head of cult.

744
01:31:29,831 --> 01:31:33,367
Maybe he can be resurrected. That's why he's in chains.

745
01:31:34,333 --> 01:31:36,061
It's a terrible death.

746
01:31:38,543 --> 01:31:42,601
Is there really a safe here?

747
01:33:00,958 --> 01:33:02,174
What...

748
01:33:26,813 --> 01:33:27,938
Kak!

749
01:34:03,312 --> 01:34:04,448
Money!

750
01:34:08,593 --> 01:34:09,628
Money!

751
01:34:10,912 --> 01:34:12,607
Yes!

752
01:34:14,365 --> 01:34:15,610
We are so!

753
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:22,408
I told you there's money here!

754
01:34:22,509 --> 01:34:24,457
Money!

755
01:34:26,999 --> 01:34:31,151
Money!

756
01:34:32,907 --> 01:34:36,317
Money! We are rich!

757
01:34:38,385 --> 01:34:43,382
- Sis! - I told you!

758
01:34:54,573 --> 01:34:55,667
Kak?

759
01:34:57,347 --> 01:34:58,487
Kak!

760
01:34:59,793 --> 01:35:00,793
Kak!

761
01:37:55,789 --> 01:37:57,718
Where is the key?

762
01:37:59,149 --> 01:38:04,227
Where? Where is the key?

763
01:38:33,432 --> 01:38:34,590
Kak!

764
01:38:36,135 --> 01:38:38,327
What happened? You are okay?

765
01:38:40,113 --> 01:38:43,876
Sis. I brought all the money.

766
01:38:44,131 --> 01:38:46,642
We can save my mom now!

767
01:38:47,111 --> 01:38:49,499
Let's go. Where's the key?

768
01:38:49,776 --> 01:38:50,812
I see it.

769
01:38:51,470 --> 01:38:53,871
Give me the key.

770
01:38:54,389 --> 01:38:56,248
In the closet.

771
01:38:57,414 --> 01:38:58,537
I see it.

772
01:38:58,585 --> 01:39:02,470
What do you see? Say it clearly!

773
01:39:02,589 --> 01:39:05,757
Give me the key now! Let's go!

774
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:08,597
Hurry up!

775
01:39:08,707 --> 01:39:09,952
Want to see too?

776
01:40:03,725 --> 01:40:08,829
You know what I saw in the closet?

777
01:41:00,147 --> 01:41:02,722
The time I spent with you...

778
01:41:04,969 --> 01:41:07,553
...pretty impressive.

779
01:41:13,519 --> 01:41:15,823
I will miss you, Ji-woo.

780
01:41:23,143 --> 01:41:24,907
Open the door.

781
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:27,129
Open!

782
01:41:27,613 --> 01:41:28,618
Sir!

783
01:41:29,077 --> 01:41:31,722
Open the door!

784
01:41:36,869 --> 01:41:40,795
Open the door!

785
01:41:40,824 --> 01:41:42,529
No!

786
01:41:43,302 --> 01:41:46,981
Help me! Get me out!

787
01:41:48,187 --> 01:41:52,028
You bastard! Get me out!

788
01:42:33,004 --> 01:42:34,561
FOLLOW GOD'S COMMANDS THEN THEY WILL BE CALM

789
01:42:34,664 --> 01:42:36,555
AYAT: 16: 3.
