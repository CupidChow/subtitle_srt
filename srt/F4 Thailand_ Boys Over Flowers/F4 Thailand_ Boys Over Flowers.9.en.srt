1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
The cause of this whole
thing is this girl, right?

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,220
For someone like you,
no matter how hard you try,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,400
you will never be worthy of Thyme.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,020
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:10,860
But my relationship,

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,700
my choice.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,540
Are these Thyme's faces?

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,160
I can see that.

9
00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:19,839
Happy birthday, officially.

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,000
You look cute today.

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,759
Don't make me do to you

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,860
what I did to your sister.

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,840
I think you've gone too far this time.

14
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,620
There's no such thing as going too far.

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:39,120
(I'm bored. Just boring people here.)

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,880
(No friends. It's not like I
have friends anyway. Hahaha.)

17
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:43,784
(It's decided. I'll make a run for it.)

18
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:46,605
There's something I want to tell you.

19
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,940
I'm happy to be your friend.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,960
Oh, sorry!

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,650
It's fine.

22
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:28,375
But it's ruined.

23
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,239
I am very pleased to
inform everyone here that...

24
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:39,256
this girl is Lita - Lalita Empicca.

25
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:44,115
And she is to be engaged to Thyme.

26
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,960
(Thyme has a fiancée?)

27
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:55,361
- (Empicca and Parama?!?)
- (They're perfect for each other.)

28
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,280
Mother! What did you just say?

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,419
You think I'll let it happen?

30
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,160
Are you doing to me what you did to Tia?

31
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,419
What? Let go of me! Let go!

32
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,400
Let go of me!

33
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:12,819
Let go!

34
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
Leave me alone!

35
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,220
Thyme!

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,860
Grab him!

37
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,940
Let's go.

38
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,380
That's not...

39
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,799
How...

40
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,980
What?

41
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,220
What kind of sick game are you playing?

42
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,980
What are you doing?

43
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:30,879
Why is this happening to me?

44
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,280
Get out. Get out of the car.

45
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,519
Are you going to start a fight?

46
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,480
What are you doing?

47
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,460
Get your legs out of the car.

48
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:39,559
Let go of me!

49
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,680
Let go!

50
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:42,561
Convenient for you, huh?

51
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,579
You dragged me here.
You have to bring me back.

52
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,999
How else am I going to find my way back?

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,279
Cabs are easy to find around here.

54
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,356
Can't you go back on your own?

55
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,980
Take it. Take everything.

56
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,899
Don't treat me like dirt.

57
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,300
Take responsibility. Take me home now!

58
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,659
What's your problem? Get off!

59
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,259
Take me home now!

60
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,279
What's your problem? Get off!

61
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
No!
Get off!

62
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:19,541
Get off!

63
00:05:20,402 --> 00:05:22,062
What's wrong?

64
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,020
Don't tell me...

65
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:27,569
It's your sensitive spot?

66
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,750
Of course not.

67
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,440
- No?
- No.

68
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,600
Let me touch it again.

69
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:33,959
No! No more touching!

70
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
Leave my ear alone!

71
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,279
Come back. Come and take me back home.

72
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,739
Stop! Stop!

73
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,620
I apologize for Lita.

74
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,620
She's been naughty since she's a kid.

75
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:47,634
She's not prim and proper.

76
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:49,699
There's no need for apologies.

77
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,660
She is lively.

78
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,300
Thyme likes this kind of girl.

79
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,880
Lita is just right for Thyme.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,500
Ms. Roselyn, a few questions, please.

81
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,880
How long has this engagement been planned?

82
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,840
The two families have only recently
started talking about the engagement.

83
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,200
We agree that they are a perfect match.

84
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,380
Lita is a sweet girl. Of
course Thyme likes her.

85
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,280
Nothing to worry, Gorya.

86
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,020
You know Thyme well.

87
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,700
Don't waver because of his mother's plan.

88
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,860
People could see this
as an arranged marriage.

89
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,980
Of course not. We live
in the modern world now.

90
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,075
(Fiancée of Paramaanantra's heir revealed.)

91
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,360
We adults have no part in their affairs.

92
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,419
The wedding? It's all up to them.

93
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,540
He's about to graduate.

94
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,039
Or they can wait until they finish
university and take it from there.

95
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,579
(The guy's family does real estate.
The girl's MPC Group does construction.)

96
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,099
Their logo can be seen at major
construction sites or the sky train.

97
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,779
You can say it's an auspicious occasion.

98
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,040
But for me, it's a business
move to join hands.

99
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,079
One side does real estate.

100
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,500
The other is one of the country's
largest construction groups.

101
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,900
What surprises me is the Empiccas
who suddenly made this move...

102
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,159
Hey, you. Have you heard?

103
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,639
They say Thyme will reveal his 'true' love.

104
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,639
Are you worried about
how the 'fake' one will feel?

105
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,140
Let me ask her.

106
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,860
Gorya, how are you
feeling? Lost an appetite?

107
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,299
You must have felt shaken.

108
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,939
Look at the picture.

109
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,800
You looked pretty lost there.

110
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,919
What's the matter, sore loser?

111
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,480
It's not cute.

112
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,239
Look at this picture. Funny, huh?

113
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,000
This could be a meme.

114
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,580
What are you shouting about?

115
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,300
Sorry, P'...

116
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,060
Oh, it's you.

117
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,280
Yeah, who did you think I was?

118
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
No one.

119
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,280
What are you doing here?

120
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,979
The janitor secretly hired me

121
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,420
to look after this building.

122
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't tell anyone.

123
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,160
Another good thing is that

124
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,440
this gives me a chance
to find out how F4 live.

125
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,880
Why do you need to find out?

126
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
Kidding.

127
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,520
Do they read this kind of thing?

128
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,340
Not usually.

129
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,220
What are you looking at?

130
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,820
How did you get in here?

131
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,340
I have to go.

132
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,259
Hold on! Stop! Come here.

133
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,920
Why are you avoiding me?

134
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,319
I'm not.

135
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,859
What do want to say to me? I'm in a hurry.

136
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,619
I just want to straighten
things out about last night.

137
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,620
You...

138
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,660
It's your fault.

139
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,479
Why didn't you extend
your arm so I could grab it?

140
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,479
Just extend the arm and I could grab it.

141
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,679
Why did you let me grab someone else?

142
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,459
It's so basic. Apologize to
me now and I won't be mad.

143
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,460
Ouch!

144
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,140
Shit!

145
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,820
Judging from his posture, he
was definitely kicked in the balls.

146
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,060
What did you do to Gorya this time?

147
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,880
Talk later.

148
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,679
Guard, I just saw her run this way.

149
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,200
Yes, let's go.

150
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,760
Have you seen a strange
girl running this way?

151
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,300
She went over there.

152
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,440
Thanks for your help.

153
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
No problem.

154
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,400
But actually...

155
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,380
you didn't need to sneak in.

156
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,779
You could just tell them
you're Thyme's fiancée.

157
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,060
No way.

158
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,360
It's going to be a million
times more complicated.

159
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,140
And I'm not here for Thyme.

160
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,060
I'm here to see you.

161
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,620
Huh?

162
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,240
Last night.

163
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,940
I ruined your dress.

164
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm so sorry. I couldn't
find your exact dress.

165
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,200
So I got this instead.

166
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,179
Try it on and see if you like it.

167
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,679
No. My dress was just...

168
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,160
Please take it.

169
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,220
Please.

170
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:19,519
You know, this one is a rare item.

171
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,920
If you didn't place a direct order,

172
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,140
you'd have to send
someone to wait in a long line.

173
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,120
Please take it.

174
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,680
No.

175
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:27,620
If you don't take it, I'll
just leave it right here.

176
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,040
Anyone can come and grab it.

177
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,320
No? In that case, I'll leave it here.

178
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,080
Finders Keepers.

179
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,400
Please take it.

180
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,180
Don't worry. You will look so cute in it.

181
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,580
By the way, I'm Lita.

182
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,580
I'm Gorya.

183
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,920
I'm glad to see you.

184
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,619
I have to go.

185
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,620
I have to go to an event with that jerk.

186
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,980
Bye.

187
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,160
(Akira-Lita: first outing as a couple)

188
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,680
Sis, come and eat. The
drama has just started.

189
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,260
I can't possibly stay here any longer,

190
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,359
not after what your mother said.

191
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,059
But what my mother said means nothing.

192
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,220
Thought you were at an
event with your fiancée.

193
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,000
I escaped.

194
00:13:00,224 --> 00:13:02,084
A lot of egg menus on the table.

195
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,019
I need to replenish my
body. Someone kicked me.

196
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,579
You started it.

197
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,340
I didn't.

198
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:10,340
I went back to get you but you didn't wait.

199
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,900
And you kicked me in the nuts.

200
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,140
Quiet down, please. I want to hear the TV.

201
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,660
Please listen.

202
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,399
- I...
- I thought you wanted to go with her, your fiancée.

203
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,999
That's my mom's doing and you know it.

204
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,499
I don't know that monkey girl.

205
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,940
Who would force an engagement
on their son these days anyway?

206
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,319
But you and she...

207
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,880
What?

208
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:29,200
Are already engaged.

209
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,700
There's no point.

210
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,699
I can't change the rules.

211
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,599
The person who walks away must be me.

212
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,319
- No!
- Change the channel!

213
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,560
Potjanee!

214
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,479
Let's look at gold.

215
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,999
The price of gold today
takes quite a dip at 1,729.44.

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,640
A 1.91% decrease.

217
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,040
Crude oil prices also fall by 2.5%.

218
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,780
Are we not going to talk?

219
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,680
I was so stressed out last night.

220
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,119
I couldn't sleep.

221
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Look.

222
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,240
I cut myself with scissors.

223
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,460
I was sad.

224
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,819
I went back to the party and
someone didn't wait for me.

225
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,399
I didn't get my birthday present.

226
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,799
Someone was going to
marry me and you didn't care.

227
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,240
There was no present.

228
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,559
I threw it all away.

229
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,960
All I have is this.

230
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,800
Your present. Take it.

231
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,560
So what's on the refrigerator?

232
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,180
My present? My present, right?

233
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,180
Where is it?

234
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,040
Just this. I made it.
Don't know if it's edible.

235
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
Did you make it?

236
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Must be inedible.

237
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,520
Give it back then.

238
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:46,219
It's mine. Even if
it's inedible, it's mine.

239
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,479
No, it's mine.

240
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,259
You said you can't eat it.

241
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,640
So? It's mine anyway.

242
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,239
The stocks plummet to a record low.

243
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,939
That coincides with a rumor yesterday

244
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,359
which worried many investors

245
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,719
about Billionaire Pakorn's health issues.

246
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,180
Wait.

247
00:15:01,181 --> 00:15:05,500
As you know, Pakorn is Thailand's
number one businessman,

248
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,299
- the owner of the TN empire.
- What is it?

249
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,780
which connects to several
major businesses in the country.

250
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,339
Of course the news about his condition...
Nothing.

251
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,339
affects the lives of many Thais.

252
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,340
I have to go.

253
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,740
I'll eat it.

254
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,140
See you.

255
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
Honestly, Ren.

256
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,600
You said you got a strange
feeling about Thyme's mom.

257
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,240
I don't get it.

258
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,580
But I do.

259
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,680
If Thyme's mom wants
to just get rid of Gorya,

260
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,120
she doesn't need to
reveal his fiancée so soon.

261
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,880
Don't you think it's too
strange and too soon?

262
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,960
Have you found anything?

263
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,420
This smells fishy.

264
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,900
There are no stars tonight.

265
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,340
You've just arrived. Aren't
you going to get some rest first?

266
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,940
No.

267
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,860
This is a crucial moment,

268
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,060
not just in Thailand,

269
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,460
but also here in Singapore.

270
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,120
What about Mr. Thyme and Miss Lita?

271
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,120
I have no concerns.

272
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,980
Because of the timing,

273
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
everything will be set in motion by itself.

274
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
I know it well.

275
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,300
(TN stock plummets, so
does Pakorn's condition)

276
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,520
Ren. Ren.

277
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,520
Ren.

278
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,240
Ren, wake up. I have
something big to tell you.

279
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,960
Get up. Get up.

280
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,200
Gorya made cookies in the shape of my face.

281
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,720
Admire the magnificence.

282
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,939
It may not look as good as the real me.

283
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,940
But seeing how hard she worked on it I...

284
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,200
Ren, spit it out.

285
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,719
Ren, spit out my cookie. I'm
going to eat every single piece.

286
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,819
Spit it out.

287
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,580
Spit it out now.

288
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,740
You came to see me so early in the morning

289
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,520
just to show me the cookies?

290
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,020
No.

291
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,060
I was in the neighborhood
so I thought I'd stop by.

292
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,140
So you heard.

293
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,619
which worried many investors

294
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,200
about Billionaire Pakorn's health issues.

295
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,780
So what are you going to do?

296
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,180
I'll be very busy.

297
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,840
I'll go back and stay
at my place for a while.

298
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,400
About Lita.

299
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,860
That girl is a pain.

300
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
But don't worry.

301
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,380
I have a way to handle her.

302
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,580
(TN stock plummets, so
does Pakorn's condition)

303
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,460
What are you reading?

304
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Nothing.

305
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,600
I'm just amazed how these
newspapers are still around.

306
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,600
Do people still read it?

307
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,060
Some people do but not our kind of people.

308
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,060
What kind of people then?

309
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,760
This helps.

310
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,980
How come you're such a mess?

311
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,360
Thyme asked us to help him deal with Lita.

312
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,000
Yes. So we planned to use
our coolness to deal with her.

313
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,120
But it's a mess.

314
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
How?

315
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,199
Do you have a map?
It will help me describe.

316
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,199
Why would we have a map?

317
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Found it.

318
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,820
This is so Uncle Ga.

319
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,979
That girl told us she didn't
like to go to simple places.

320
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,979
So the first place we went to

321
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,940
is an amusement park.

322
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:37,099
We went on a roller-coaster 3 times.

323
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:37,960
Pirate ship rides 5 times.

324
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,620
A haunted house.

325
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,859
She tricked us to get on a water ride.

326
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,740
But when we got there, she bailed.

327
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,060
We thought she was tired.

328
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,839
She said she wanted street food.

329
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,000
From the park, we went to Yaowarat.

330
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,900
But that's not all. She wanted
to go to the flower market.

331
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,256
We took her to the flower
market and ended up here.

332
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,660
She's so hyper.

333
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,099
Did Lita go home?

334
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,280
Not possible. I'm still full of energy.

335
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,419
Metro guys are so boring.

336
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,800
They're no good.

337
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,260
Gorya, let's go out.
Find something fun to do.

338
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,520
Well...

339
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,160
I have to work.

340
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,540
Sorry.

341
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:31,200
Does it mean that if someone
buys all the flowers here,

342
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,700
you won't have anything left
to do and can go out with me?

343
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,140
This one is cute. I'll have this one.

344
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,580
This one too.

345
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,400
And this one.

346
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,080
Excuse me, I'll have this one too.

347
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,880
I got a lot of things.

348
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,699
Want me to help carry some?

349
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,720
No, thanks.

350
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,720
Gorya.

351
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,559
Here you go. My treat.

352
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,740
No, I can't take it.

353
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,679
I know you want this bag.

354
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,479
Please take it.

355
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,120
No.

356
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:34,259
Please.

357
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,900
No.

358
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:37,840
Otherwise I'll just leave it here.

359
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,940
I'll leave it here as well.

360
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,040
Don't do this, Lita.

361
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,280
Am I making you uncomfortable?

362
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,300
I've never had a close friend before.

363
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,240
Don't know how to make friends.

364
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,520
Please don't be mad. Please.

365
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,080
I'm not mad.

366
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,640
It's just that these things are too much.

367
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,940
The dress that you gave me the last time...

368
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,340
I almost couldn't put it into my closet.

369
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,340
The zip almost broke.

370
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,540
OK, from now on I won't
do this kind of thing anymore.

371
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,820
Promise.

372
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:39,000
By the way, you said the
zip of the closet almost broke.

373
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,920
What does your closet look like?

374
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,640
Wow, a zippered closet.

375
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,640
I've never seen one before.

376
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,700
This is cool.

377
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,000
What is this?

378
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,339
A dollhouse?

379
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,340
Cute.

380
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,620
This is to trap cockroaches.

381
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Trap cockroaches?

382
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,739
But it's dirty. Don't play with it.

383
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,080
Your house is full of good stuff.

384
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,279
Can I come here often? Please?

385
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,420
Please.

386
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,419
Please.

387
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,959
Sure if you want to.

388
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Really? No take back, OK?

389
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,640
How nice.

390
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,320
You know, in my whole life,

391
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,620
I've never experienced anything like this.

392
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,160
My parents arrange everything,

393
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,380
friends and social life included.

394
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,780
Everything is boring.

395
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
Really?

396
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,200
Sometimes I wish I
could be an ordinary girl.

397
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,940
You can. We can be friends.

398
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,120
Thank you.

399
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,380
But that's the thing.

400
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,280
In the end, no matter how
hard I try to fight a certain thing,

401
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,520
I can't change it.

402
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,980
There's more to it.

403
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,980
Like the engagement?

404
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,520
Are you OK with that?

405
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,260
How can I be OK with it?

406
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,760
That Thyme? I don't even know him.

407
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,180
By the way, what's your
relationship with Thyme?

408
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,900
Thyme and I are friends.

409
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,700
So it means the guy on the rooftop

410
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,540
is your boyfriend?

411
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,979
Who? Talay?

412
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,699
Gentle, Thyme.

413
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,699
Be careful on the bus next time.

414
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,820
You've sprained your ankle.

415
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
What?

416
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:02,900
Why are you here?

417
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,519
I'm here because I'm Gorya's friend.

418
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
What about you? What are you doing here?

419
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,400
I'm...

420
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:10,900
You're also a friend, aren't you?

421
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,620
Sure. So what?

422
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,819
Gorya, you're kind to be friends
with a foul-mouthed donkey.

423
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,719
You're also kind to be
friends with a monkey.

424
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,819
So what, donkey?

425
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,740
So what, monkey?

426
00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:25,260
Donkey.
Monkey.

427
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,380
Donkey.
Monkey.

428
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,920
Fight her.

429
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:37,239
(TN stock plummets, so
does Pakorn's condition)

430
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,900
Alright, the last bouquet
of Miss Lita's order.

431
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,480
My back hurts.

432
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,620
Speak like an old man.

433
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,619
Thank you very much.

434
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,479
Without you, I would've
been in a tough spot.

435
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,600
No problem. I had a free day anyway.

436
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,460
My pleasure.

437
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,520
I should go.

438
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,760
On second thought, I'm starving.

439
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,940
Do you have anything to eat before I go?

440
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,940
Let me check.

441
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,100
Here's some yogurt to calm your stomach.

442
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Thank you.

443
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,760
So this is the kind of food you
eat. No wonder you're so small.

444
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,199
You tease me about being small again.

445
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,499
I'm not teasing you.

446
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,240
I'm praising you for being in shape.

447
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,400
It's good that you take
good care of yourself.

448
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,559
What are you laughing at?

449
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,479
Can I take back what I just said?

450
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,020
How did you get yogurt
on your nose, chipmunk?

451
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,160
Lita was really something, huh?

452
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,600
I never thought she'd buy
every flower in the shop.

453
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,200
True. Thyme's mom was such a conniver

454
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,940
having Thyme engaged to Lita.

455
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,620
For me, I think it's strange
that Thyme's mom did that.

456
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,440
Lita doesn't seem like
the kind of girl she likes.

457
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,020
No, the Empiccas are the
perfect fit for the Paramaanantras.

458
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,719
Most importantly, haven't you noticed

459
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,060
Lita has a lot of things
in common with Gorya?

460
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,340
Thyme's mom is smarter than you think.

461
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,460
Even we don't know how to deal with her.

462
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,120
I'm beginning to worry about Gorya.

463
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,740
Let me call her.

464
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,100
What's up, Gorya?

465
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,400
Why the long face?

466
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,940
What's going on?

467
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Something's going on.

468
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,780
No, you can't stay here. Get out.

469
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,540
We're not. Leave us alone.

470
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,920
I'm going to stay here.

471
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,660
Very hard to deal with.

472
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,660
Very.

473
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,660
This is a cab. Have you been on one?

474
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,080
This is a good day to try it.

475
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,079
Text me when you get home.

476
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,360
Sure.

477
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Gorya.

478
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,579
It was so fun last night.

479
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,940
I'll come and play with you again.

480
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,940
Get home safe.

481
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,640
You haven't won any argument
with her. Feeling down, huh?

482
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
How's Lita?

483
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,959
She's sweet.

484
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,580
She's down-to-earth and very nice.

485
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,820
I'm glad to be her friend.

486
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,680
But I do prefer this kind of life?

487
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
What do you mean?

488
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,700
Hey, what are you doing?

489
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,700
I may be gone for a while.

490
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,420
I've got something I need to do. It's...

491
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,940
very hard to explain.

492
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,200
All I ask is, no matter what happens,

493
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,400
please wait for me, Gorya.

494
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,960
Be patient.

495
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,920
Almost a year that I've known Thyme,

496
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,720
I sometimes thought I
knew all about his world

497
00:30:58,354 --> 00:30:59,879
until I realized that,

498
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,598
it's just...

499
00:31:02,623 --> 00:31:04,192
(Billionaire Pakorn dies.)

500
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,160
The tip of the iceberg.

501
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,340
Yes, Mom.

502
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,079
Breaking news that shocks
Thailand's business scene.

503
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,639
Billionaire Pakorn of the TN Group,

504
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,660
the wealthiest man in
Thailand, has passed away.

505
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
Chipmunk,

506
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,940
do you have lots of flowers for garlands?

507
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,180
I think a big order is coming in.

508
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
Yes, all done.

509
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,500
I've handled it.

510
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,200
Yes, please don't worry, madam.

511
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Mr. Thyme has returned.

512
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,080
Following the sad news of
Pakorn's passing yesterday morning,

513
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,059
the TN Group will face a great challenge...

514
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,480
Have you ever noticed?

515
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,180
Sometimes you watch the
news that you don't understand

516
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,179
what it's about.

517
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,879
(Breaking news! Billionaire
Pakorn dies at his home at 5:23 AM.)

518
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,001
(Billionaire Parkorn has died!)

519
00:32:15,025 --> 00:32:16,119
Gorya,

520
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,699
have you seen the news?

521
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,720
Yes, mom.

522
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,390
Why?

523
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:22,079
He dies at 83.

524
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,880
They won't allow me to bet on
83 on the lotto. I'm so bummed.

525
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,259
Oh, did Glakoa...

526
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,240
All you know is that
it should be important.

527
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,360
But you don't feel any connection to it.

528
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,500
But you know,

529
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,520
that piece of news may
not seem important to you,

530
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,600
and only matters to
only 1% of the population.

531
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:54,700
But that 1% group may have a significant
impact on you even if you don't realize it.

532
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,180
This doesn't feel like a funeral.

533
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,960
Come on, let me help.

534
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,060
For craftwork like this one,
people can tell if you're distracted.

535
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
I'm sorry.

536
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,840
Do your best work.

537
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,740
Pay attention to every detail.

538
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,480
Do you have any idea who the guests are?

539
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,900
If anyone here is impressed with your work,

540
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,360
it will definitely be
good for your business.

541
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,879
On a day like this, do we still
have to think about business?

542
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,640
You do especially on a day like this.

543
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,460
A funeral may be a ceremony
to remember a deceased person.

544
00:33:44,006 --> 00:33:48,506
But with Pakorn's death, change is coming.

545
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,760
This game of how this country
is run is about to change,

546
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,440
especially for real
estate people like Thyme.

547
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,799
The Parama Group is hosting today's
ceremony along with the MPC Group.

548
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,400
This is the information of the
key figures who are coming today.

549
00:34:05,663 --> 00:34:06,843
Understand, Gorya?

550
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:10,158
You must learn how to
look at the big picture.

551
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,360
Although it may be so unfamiliar at first,

552
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,740
you need to be able to understand it.

553
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,799
The fact that the stock
took a dive by 7.47%

554
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,740
doesn't signal good news for either
the TN Group or the Thai economy.

555
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:35,519
Many agree that the next Thailand's
GDP estimate will see a decrease.

556
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,020
You may be standing where
you can see everything,

557
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,420
hear everything,

558
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,280
but it doesn't help you
understand anything at all.

559
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,730
And it makes you feel even more like...

560
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
you're in a completely
different world from them.

561
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,780
Thyme is here.

562
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,840
I kept thinking Thyme would
never understand my world.

563
00:35:23,129 --> 00:35:24,949
Standing here,

564
00:35:25,865 --> 00:35:30,763
I realize I don't understand Thyme's world.

565
00:35:32,543 --> 00:35:38,043
I can't even imagine a single
sentence those people are saying.

566
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,319
I never knew the iceberg
would be this huge.

567
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,959
Excuse me, may I just
leave my glass with you?

568
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,564
- Yes.
- Thank you.

569
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,760
I'll be right back.

570
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Ouch!

571
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,000
How do you know each other?

572
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,840
We're quite close. Known
each other for a long time.

573
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,020
Excuse me, Lita looks rather unwell.

574
00:36:58,045 --> 00:36:59,765
Allow me to accompany her to get some rest.

575
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,920
Go ahead.

576
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,000
- Please take care of Lita for me.
- Yes.

577
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
Go.

578
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Slowly.

579
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,620
Have a seat.

580
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:18,209
What's up, My Lady?

581
00:37:20,193 --> 00:37:23,973
Are you unwell? Get
some rest if you need to.

582
00:37:26,348 --> 00:37:28,908
It's been a long time since I
last wore high heels, Your Grace.

583
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:30,713
So my damn feet hurt.

584
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,740
Want to see?

585
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,379
The smell is pretty ripe.

586
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,639
Dad, I think we should go see Ren's father.

587
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,640
Allow me to help.

588
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,920
You've never been to this
type of ceremony, have you?

589
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
Yeah.

590
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,100
Everybody seems to know everybody.

591
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,900
Rich people in Thailand
account for only 1%.

592
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,320
It's no surprise they know each other.

593
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,760
So it's a surprise that I know you guys.

594
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,580
It's like we're in different worlds.

595
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,680
Have you talked to Thyme?

596
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,320
No way. He seems very busy.

597
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,400
You're really something else.

598
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,720
Your friends started it.

599
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,060
Here. Use this.

600
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,800
Someone will come and get you soon.

601
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,220
This fits you.

602
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,020
Thank you, fiancé.

603
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,960
All good. Let's get
back to doing our duties.

604
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,520
Hey, can we talk?

605
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,020
Ren, do you think...

606
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,800
anything can be done about this engagement?

607
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,180
The duties you're talking
about... I'm not OK with it.

608
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,680
You're not going to agree
to this engagement, are you?

609
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,460
Can you do something about it?

610
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,640
I don't know if I can.

611
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,500
But there must be a way.

612
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,520
We're not in love, Lita.

613
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,260
They can do business all they want.

614
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,920
It's got nothing to do with us.

615
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,900
For me, this concerns many people.

616
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,520
But I get it. The circumstance
now is worrisome.

617
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,820
What do you think?

618
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,560
You...

619
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,600
seem to believe in love.

620
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,800
Is love so grand?

621
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,800
Of course.

622
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,340
It is very grand to me.

623
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,660
I too believe that
everything will get better.

624
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,980
If you don't believe in
love, it's your business.

625
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,980
But for me, love matters the most.

626
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,620
And I won't let anyone
get hurt because of it.

627
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,440
Thyme is so stubborn.

628
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,580
He will find a way.

629
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:59,580
What's worrisome isn't Thyme's feelings.

630
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,400
I'm worried about Lita's feelings.

631
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:19,260
How does Lita really feel about Thyme?

632
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,900
I don't get it.

633
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,340
What are you looking at?

634
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,240
You're still here. I thought you'd left.

635
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,580
No, my family went with Thyme's family.

636
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,519
I guess they're afraid I'd cause a scene

637
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,560
so they left me out of it.

638
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,440
So I've been walking around.

639
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,520
Other pavilions have lots of good stuff.

640
00:42:10,598 --> 00:42:11,938
There's plenty of food.

641
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
And look.

642
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,220
I won a lot of money.

643
00:42:15,274 --> 00:42:17,454
Whoa! How did you win?

644
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,959
There she is. She
definitely hid some cards.

645
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,080
Gorya, run!

646
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,680
Stop! Stop! Stop now!

647
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,500
I thought we wouldn't have made it.

648
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,820
You're awesome.

649
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,920
I can't do anything in this dress.

650
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,660
Hey, let me give you this.

651
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,320
For all the running.

652
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,580
Thank you.

653
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,060
By the way, what were you doing?

654
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,060
Earlier?

655
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,960
I just wanted to understand
you guys a bit more.

656
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,900
So I read up on Pakorn.

657
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,960
But it's full of words like...

658
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:19,760
index, technocrat, etc.

659
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,260
Oh, are you worried about me?

660
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,960
It's no surprise you didn't understand.

661
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,520
I don't get it either.

662
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,860
Well...

663
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,360
don't you want to understand?

664
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,720
It's about to affect your whole life.

665
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,720
I may not understand

666
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,120
but knowing it's important is enough.

667
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,660
My dad used to say

668
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,440
one day he would leave the business

669
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,720
world and get into politics

670
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,280
and make it better.

671
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,160
But he also would say

672
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,020
politics are not for anyone.

673
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:16,640
It may be about influence and connection.

674
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,640
That's why you have to be engaged to Thyme?

675
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,980
It may be hard to understand.

676
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,820
But if I can support him
in any way, I'd love to.

677
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,200
I want to see things improve too.

678
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,240
But it's your life.

679
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,000
May I ask you something, Gorya?

680
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:57,660
For you, is love so important?

681
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,200
Yes, it is.

682
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,640
I can't imagine how I can
live with someone I don't love.

683
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,640
It's our whole life, Lita.

684
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,920
No matter for what reason,

685
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,120
nobody should be forced to
marry someone they don't love.

686
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,760
You know...

687
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:41,720
my family has been telling me
to study Thyme for a while now.

688
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,060
But I was hesitant.

689
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,460
Yes, mom?

690
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,160
I never liked the way he carried himself.

691
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,840
I thought he was just another
guy my family introduced me to.

692
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,220
Let go!

693
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,500
Or a hundred times worse.

694
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,140
But once I've gotten to know him,

695
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,340
I know Thyme is kind to others.

696
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,080
He has a childish side.

697
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:30,680
I don't know why I was so hesitant.

698
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It is very grand to me.

699
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,120
Love matters the most.

700
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,580
But now I know that I
just wanted to be sure.

701
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,320
It's like what you said.

702
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,160
Love matters.

703
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,140
In the end,

704
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:53,340
if I have to leave my family's
business in someone's hand

705
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,560
before my dad gets into politics,

706
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,780
I now know

707
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,800
that I want that someone to be Thyme.

708
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:13,440
Because I believe that
one day I will love Thyme.

709
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,580
Or maybe...

710
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,460
I have already loved him.

711
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:12,960
What's up, Talay?

712
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,340
Are you free?

713
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,240
Keen to earn extra cash while studying?

714
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,799
Hey, let me ask you something.

715
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,580
How many jobs do you actually have?

716
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,569
Waiting in line is an easy job.

717
00:48:43,439 --> 00:48:45,839
But I asked you here
because I needed your help

718
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,120
in case I have to go to
the bathroom. I'll cut you in.

719
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,460
Do you want something to eat?

720
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,520
Wow, you've come prepared.

721
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,220
Of course. Which flavor would you like?

722
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,660
This one.

723
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,120
It's funny.

724
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,160
People line up to buy
such an expensive thing.

725
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:29,380
You don't need to try to
understand rich people.

726
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,980
But if we don't, how can we live together?

727
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,340
Why not?

728
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,760
We live like this.

729
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,760
Don't you want to try at all?

730
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,700
In the end,

731
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,340
the conclusion is always the same, Gorya.

732
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,440
What can't be done, can't be done.

733
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,100
No matter how hard we
try to understand them,

734
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,720
the lesson for us is that

735
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,340
this is how the world works.

736
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,240
So don't force it.

737
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,760
Trust me.

738
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,660
Thyme.

739
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,120
Thyme.

740
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,320
Thyme.

741
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,660
What are you doing here?

742
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,200
I thought I wouldn't make it.

743
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,980
Make it to what?

744
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,560
To see Glakao off.

745
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,940
Here, I got a big set.

746
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:34,179
I didn't bring a lot today
because I just escaped from home.

747
00:51:34,571 --> 00:51:37,351
Despite that, I guarantee
it will be delicious.

748
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,640
Why did you have to escape?

749
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,760
I've been very busy with work.

750
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,860
Mother has recently hired
guards to keep an eye on me.

751
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:51,420
If she knew I was here, she'd
have the guards drag me back home.

752
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,480
But don't worry.

753
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,000
Even if you're not here, Glakao,

754
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,000
Gorya can protect me.

755
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,080
OK, that makes me feel better.

756
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,860
How's this? From Chef Thyme.

757
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,399
Looks so yummy.

758
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,160
Of course it is. Dig in.

759
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Gorya, let's eat.

760
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,959
So yummy.

761
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:14,866
Right?

762
00:52:14,891 --> 00:52:16,131
Is this Korean style?

763
00:52:16,156 --> 00:52:17,156
Yep.

764
00:52:23,964 --> 00:52:25,884
Go slow, Gorya. It's hot.

765
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,080
I miss the magic pork.

766
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,800
I've been having meals
with many people lately.

767
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,920
We eat while talking business. So boring.

768
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,120
Today I have to eat at Lita's house.

769
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,960
When will this end?

770
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,260
You and Lita look great together.

771
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,900
What's up with you? Why the sarcasm?

772
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,600
I wasn't being sarcastic.

773
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,080
You and Lita are right for each other,

774
00:53:02,978 --> 00:53:05,958
in terms of business, lineage.

775
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,600
You're in the same social circle.

776
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,600
On top of everything,

777
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,240
Lita is really cute.

778
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,080
Let's talk outside.

779
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,640
Let's have it out right
now. What's the matter?

780
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,640
Why did you say that?

781
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,000
Was I wrong?

782
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:55,820
With Lita, you don't have to struggle.

783
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,440
What is this, Gorya?

784
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,060
Are you still hung up on that girl?

785
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:03,290
I told you I would handle it.

786
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,740
Just be patient.

787
00:54:09,115 --> 00:54:10,876
If we can get through this,
it's smooth sailing from here.

788
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,000
Smooth sailing?

789
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:16,554
Are you sure about what you just said?

790
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:24,058
I get the part where
you told me to be patient.

791
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,260
But you know,

792
00:54:31,714 --> 00:54:33,774
the more patient I've been,

793
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,703
the more I see

794
00:54:39,572 --> 00:54:41,952
how big your world is.

795
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:48,122
The two of us have been fighting the tide.

796
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,560
Can't we just admit

797
00:54:55,662 --> 00:54:57,762
that even though we get through this,

798
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,660
it will not be the end?

799
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,060
How long will I have
to stay and be patient?

800
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,360
I'm exhausted, Thyme.

801
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,900
I'm exhausted.

802
00:55:21,774 --> 00:55:24,214
I just want to stay in my world.

803
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,779
And you should be with
someone who's right for you.

804
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,280
We can be together, Gorya.

805
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,280
We're always together.

806
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,499
What is this 'your world, my world' thing?

807
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,500
Thyme.

808
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,640
Open your eyes.

809
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,220
Open your eyes to the reality

810
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,339
and how different we are.

811
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,480
What do you want me to do?

812
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,880
I'm trying here, Gorya.

813
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,140
But with Lita,

814
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,700
you don't need to try at all.

815
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,820
I really think

816
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,440
that if you can love her,

817
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,160
things should be easier.

818
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,480
Really, Gorya?

819
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,320
Do you mean what you said?

820
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,020
Did you feel anything when you said that?

821
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:52,046
What about everything I've done, Gorya?

822
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,880
Say it.

823
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:55,530
What about everything I've done?

824
00:56:55,592 --> 00:56:57,132
Don't you see how hard I've tried?

825
00:56:58,481 --> 00:56:59,581
Answer me.

826
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,480
I can't.

827
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,480
I can't do this, Thyme.

828
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,680
Did you tell my family, Gorya?

829
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,399
Go back to your world.

830
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,780
What have you done?

831
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,840
What about all these things
I've done, Gorya? Answer me!

832
00:57:30,634 --> 00:57:31,634
What are you doing?

833
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,339
Let me go!

834
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:34,340
Gorya!

835
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,779
Gorya!

836
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,320
Let go of me!

837
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,640
Gorya!

838
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,980
Realizing that the
world is full of icebergs

839
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,560
can be painful.

840
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:11,480
But seeing just the tip of
it might be a good thing.

841
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,580
Because there's probably
nothing people like us can do.

842
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,640
What's wrong?

843
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,140
Don't you want to go?

844
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,800
No.

845
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,320
Just...

846
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,160
You can say it.

847
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,060
Just that it's too bad.

848
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,880
Thyme can't be here.

849
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,880
If he was here,

850
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,380
he would be excited about everything here.

851
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,300
It'd be very funny.

852
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,580
Sorry, sis.

853
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:07,580
I'm sorry.

854
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,580
I'm trying not to think about him.

855
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,520
Sorry.

856
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,040
Safe travels.

857
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,619
The stock index today closed...

858
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:29,680
In the end, we need
to get on with our lives.

859
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,560
We just need to face the fact,

860
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,179
move forward...

861
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,500
Miss Lita, someone's here to
see you waiting in the living room.

862
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,940
Who is it?

863
00:59:43,194 --> 00:59:47,594
And let the world keep on spinning,

864
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:53,169
spinning the way it's supposed to.

865
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:11,020
When this time comes, you can feel it

866
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,939
that a year almost passes.

867
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:15,839
I wish everyone enjoys their new journey.

868
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:19,240
I wish you all good
luck in your chosen path.

869
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:23,680
Screw it! Whatever happens, happens!

870
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,960
I want to go to your school prom.

871
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:27,380
Shall we go together?

872
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,900
Do whatever you want.

873
01:02:29,402 --> 01:02:32,422
The day on which
everyone's life will change,

874
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,740
except me.
