1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,369
I'll follow Mira to France.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,330
Because of you, I've gathered my strength to fight.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,659
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,549
I've never seen my brother chasing after a girl before.

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,239
This Saturday, come and see me at the clock tower

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,290
near the Ferris wheel at Asiatique at 1 p.m.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,200
Hey, sorry but I need to go.

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:15,810
Gorya!

9
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:17,610
I'm not a guy who chases after someone.

10
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,530
If the girl is important,

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,930
she might... change me forever.

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,410
Thyme.

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,530
You...

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,970
Damn it!

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,240
Have you lost your mind?

16
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:59,179
Is it now 1 p.m. where you're from?

17
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,769
I've been waiting for you, and I'd never waited for anyone.

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,609
I'm wet like a 'piglet' in a pond.

19
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,969
'Puppy!'

20
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,209
Who asked you to wait anyway?

21
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,489
You're the one who set it up without asking me.

22
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,829
There are shades for you to hide from the rain, but you didn't go.

23
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,730
- Are you stupid?
- You're stupid.

24
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:13,319
I called, but you didn't pick up? What was I supposed to do?

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,970
- You called me stupid?
- What if you couldn't find me?

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,480
What are you doing?

27
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:19,890
Who's stupid now?

28
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,770
How's standing in the rain acting cool working for you?

29
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,329
You'll get sick.

30
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,770
I won't.

31
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,570
Here. Dry yourself.

32
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,730
And here, my treat.

33
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,459
What is it?

34
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,769
You haven't tried it?

35
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,799
Normally, the kind of tea that my family drinks is Earl Grey or Darjeeling.

36
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,339
So high class.

37
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,449
I'm taking it back. If you don't, I'll drink it myself.

38
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,290
I'll drink it.

39
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,570
Oh, what about your towel?

40
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,539
Never mind.

41
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,810
It's windy today. It'll dry soon.

42
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,129
Why are you so frustrating?

43
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,159
What? I apologized for making you wet.

44
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,490
So? It's not enough.

45
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,099
I haven't been out and about yet.

46
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,649
Out and about? Who said I'd go out with you?

47
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,609
Who said you wouldn't come? Did you?

48
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,939
I called and you didn't pick up. I texted and you didn't reply.

49
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,349
Is this going to be a waste of my time?

50
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,549
I've been waiting for you all wet...

51
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,330
Fine, my treat today, OK?

52
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,349
Your treat, huh?

53
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,549
This is your treat.

54
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,939
I'll handle the rest.

55
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,690
Got it? Come on.

56
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,059
Why are you standing there looking dumb? Follow me.

57
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,410
You're calling me dumb?

58
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,450
Over there.

59
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,569
It's closed.

60
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,009
It's only temporarily closed. They will open soon.

61
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,860
Let's go see a boat.

62
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:19,659
Haven't you seen one?

63
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,569
Hey, let's take a picture.

64
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,010
Take a picture for me.

65
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,040
You can't take it out. Argh!

66
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,290
Hey, you!

67
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,200
- Hey.
- Thyme.

68
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,069
- Enough.
- Come on.

69
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,170
Get a new one.

70
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,770
Are you giving this out for free?

71
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,889
What? What is this?

72
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,069
Hug me instead.

73
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,140
- Hug me. Hug.
- Thyme, come here.

74
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,159
What are you doing?

75
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,349
Why are you picking a fight with him?

76
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,860
He's opportunistic.

77
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,779
Come on.

78
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,859
Bear-faced jerk!

79
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,739
Stop being so problematic.

80
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,660
You're gullible.

81
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,570
Don't settle just to get free stuff.

82
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,090
Is this worth it?

83
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,680
'Lovebird promotion to watch the sunset'

84
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,250
'Especially for couples'

85
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,810
This makes sense.

86
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,789
Dial it down a bit.

87
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,649
- Hello.
- Can I use the lovebird promotion to watch the sunset?

88
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,400
- Of course.
- Wait.

89
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:23,970
You and your girl can go and wait at the entrance to the Ferris wheel.

90
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,050
Huh? Ferris wheel?

91
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,850
What's wrong? Why do you look so pale?

92
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,259
Let's go. Let's watch the sunset.

93
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,320
I'm bored. Let's go somewhere else.

94
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,299
I could understand though. The Ferris wheel is so high.

95
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,010
A child who has a fear of heights like Baby Thyme wouldn't dare.

96
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:58,920
What a shame...

97
00:05:58,921 --> 00:05:59,929
Hey.

98
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,890
Did you just dare me?

99
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,240
Watch me. I, Akira Paramaanantra, do not have any fear...

100
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,570
I can't take it anymore!

101
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,459
Don't be mad.

102
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,149
I was just teasing you a bit.

103
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,819
Can I get you anything? Water? Inhaler?

104
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,650
I'm hungry.

105
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,819
I'm treating you to dinner to say I'm sorry, OK?

106
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,819
We can eat and go home soon.

107
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,859
Hey, let's go to this restaurant.

108
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:50,352
Hey, wait.

109
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,010
What?

110
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:55,829
Too much. No, no, no.

111
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,329
- Let's talk first.
- What?

112
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,899
- Come here first.
- Let's just eat.

113
00:07:04,232 --> 00:07:07,169
Can we go somewhere else? That restaurant is expensive.

114
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,609
That's your excuse? I'm starving.

115
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,008
It's not an excuse. It's really expensive.

116
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:14,589
Tom Yam Kung costs 500 baht.

117
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,259
500 baht would buy my whole family a decent meal.

118
00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:21,509
Nonsense.

119
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,969
If you don't want to buy, I'm buying.

120
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,779
Thyme, no.

121
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,139
What?

122
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,899
I can't open it.

123
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,109
Help! Can you hear me?

124
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,059
We're stuck here. Help! Is anyone there?

125
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,059
Argh! It's broken again.

126
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:04,379
Call someone and get help.

127
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:09,659
My battery is flat.

128
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,659
Geez.

129
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,137
Help! Is anyone there?

130
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:17,509
Help us, we're stuck here.

131
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,231
Help us.

132
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:22,499
Thyme, help me yell out.

133
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,379
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

134
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,168
What's wrong?

135
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,570
I have a headache.

136
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:51,419
Shit, you're burning up. You're sick.

137
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:56,139
Did I hurt you? I'm sorry.

138
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,673
I have a pill left. Take it.

139
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:08,369
Leave me alone. I'll be fine.

140
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,439
You won't be fine. You're burning up.

141
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,956
Do you want to get sick and die?

142
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:15,059
I'm not taking it. I only take prescribed drugs.

143
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,319
What if my condition is 'aggregated'? Can you be responsible for that?

144
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,929
It's 'aggravated'. Don't be a baby, Thyme.

145
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,930
- Leave me alone.
- Stay still.

146
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,779
Stay still.

147
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,339
Open your mouth. Come on.

148
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:44,859
Slowly.

149
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,379
You really are burning up.

150
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,909
Let me give you a sponge bath.

151
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,179
Take off your jacket.

152
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,977
How come I end up here taking care of you?

153
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:33,666
Hey.

154
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,459
What?

155
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:42,259
You said 500 baht can buy a meal for your whole family. Is that true?

156
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,819
It is.

157
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,509
I can't imagine your family's living situation.

158
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,979
It's uncomfortable.

159
00:10:57,794 --> 00:11:00,769
It's very chaotic.

160
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:06,179
When all of us are together, we talk all over each other.

161
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:14,789
Speaking of home, it must be mayhem over there.

162
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,539
Their daughter is missing.

163
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,539
What about you?

164
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,259
No one would say a word.

165
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,129
No matter what I do or how many days I'm missing,

166
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,410
no one would say anything.

167
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,659
Oh, there's Tia.

168
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,379
But that one is all about kicking me.

169
00:11:47,394 --> 00:11:49,890
Typical siblings dynamic.

170
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:53,419
You have a sibling?

171
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,419
A younger brother.

172
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:03,809
Glakao is a rascal. He's a wisecracker.

173
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,649
Lately, he's been having a growth spurt.

174
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,179
Before I know it, he's gotten taller than me.

175
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:13,099
I always lose in a fight.

176
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:14,989
You lose in a fight?

177
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,699
You could fight me. Who could you lose to?

178
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:22,349
It means that my brother is better than you.

179
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,891
I think I need to test that. How good could he be?

180
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:29,250
Hey, don't hurt my brother.

181
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,305
I'm kidding.

182
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:36,327
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,939
Hey, can I ask you something?

184
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:53,779
Why do you hurt people with the red card?

185
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:00,059
Whether you mean it or not,

186
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,902
what you guys do is quite severe.

187
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:13,219
You know I still get bullied these days.

188
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:23,139
From now on...

189
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,245
I'll cancel the red card.

190
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:29,952
Huh?

191
00:13:31,736 --> 00:13:34,540
Really? You're going to cancel the red card?

192
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:36,049
Mmm.

193
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,499
You mean it? You mean it, right, Thyme?

194
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,729
Let's do a pinky swear. Pinky swear, Thyme.

195
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,609
Thyme, you're canceling the red card.

196
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,419
I don't want caviar.

197
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,609
Hey, I'm not doing anything.

198
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,829
What?

199
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,410
What are you kids doing?

200
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,888
Run.

201
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,379
I can open the door myself.

202
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,219
The date was kind of exhausting.

203
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,529
You call that a date?

204
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,429
It doesn't count when you forced my hand.

205
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,619
Hey, you went on a date with F4.

206
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,980
Anyone would want this.

207
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,419
That was the much-coveted date with F4?

208
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,979
It's not at all what I expected.

209
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,579
What kind of date with F4 did you expect?

210
00:15:44,225 --> 00:15:45,459
What?

211
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,539
Go on. Go home. Go.

212
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,100
Go home.

213
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,930
Gorya.

214
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:02,370
Mmm?

215
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,059
I've gotten to know a lot more of you today.

216
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:09,059
Let's go out again.

217
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,619
No.

218
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,403
What? Come on.

219
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:16,220
- No.
- Yes.

220
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:18,459
You go home now.

221
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,230
- Yes or no?
- No.

222
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,160
If it's a no, I won't return this.

223
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:24,139
Keep it. Go on. I'm sick of you. Go now.

224
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,263
I'll come and pick you up. Bye.

225
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:26,829
No.

226
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,399
See you.

227
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,690
I won't.

228
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,939
Have you talked to Gorya?

229
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,460
No.

230
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,850
What should we do?

231
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:55,499
Can we get someone to help? It's a big deal.

232
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,499
What should we do?

233
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:02,419
Please hear me out. I...

234
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:07,819
Where did you go so early this morning?

235
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,979
What's going on, Mom?

236
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,980
I might as well tell you about it.

237
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:26,540
Dear.

238
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,569
What? Huh?

239
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,210
Nothing.

240
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:36,850
Your dad took out a loan from this flier.

241
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:41,379
This loan shark flier is usually left on a bicycle.

242
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,419
He was caught because Glakao found the flier,

243
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,611
but it's too late.

244
00:17:47,614 --> 00:17:51,445
Recently, the loan shark went to your dad's workplace to collect.

245
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:56,299
He said if we didn't pay the interest, he'd come to our house.

246
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,959
Why did you have to take out the loan?

247
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,943
We've paid the rent and tuition fees.

248
00:18:04,946 --> 00:18:08,479
Your grandfather is sick.

249
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,499
He borrowed some money from me.

250
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,849
I'll get the money in two weeks.

251
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,978
But they changed the date of payment.

252
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:20,959
It's extortion.

253
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,099
How could you trust loan sharks?

254
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,359
You know they're mafias.

255
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,049
They're easy to talk to.

256
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:32,099
All right, we got the loan. Nothing we can do about that.

257
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,099
I'll help out.

258
00:18:37,228 --> 00:18:41,019
How much do you owe them?

259
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,179
35,000 baht.

260
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,819
35,000?

261
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:19,259
Because of you, I've gathered my strength to fight.

262
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,339
This is what I like most about you.

263
00:19:34,597 --> 00:19:37,890
Boss, this is the girl, Gorya.

264
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:43,379
Oh, Gorya.

265
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,991
You want to talk about the loan?

266
00:19:45,992 --> 00:19:49,163
Yes. I've gathered around 2,000 baht.

267
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:51,401
May I pay this much for now?

268
00:19:51,402 --> 00:19:54,899
I'll pay more at the end of the month.

269
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,887
If you want to pay,

270
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,697
there's an easy way to make money.

271
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,981
You're insane. No way.

272
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:17,739
Are you making me a hooker?

273
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:19,289
What are you shouting out for?

274
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,239
This is a bargirl.

275
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,129
You just have a drink or two with guests.

276
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,939
You please them.

277
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,089
If they like, they'll buy more drinks from you.

278
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,639
And you'll earn more money.

279
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,979
If you don't like it, don't do it. I don't mind.

280
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:39,979
But the money is good, so I want to recommend it.

281
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,050
Oh, there are rules:

282
00:20:44,054 --> 00:20:47,629
don't touch, don't grope, don't sexually harass.

283
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,770
(No sexual harassment)
don't touch, don't grope, don't sexually harass.

284
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,299
No sexual harassment?

285
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,930
Of course not.

286
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,754
Wait.

287
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,369
I forgot to tell you.

288
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,739
You must change.

289
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,530
Cheers.

290
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,109
What's wrong? You don't look like you're enjoying yourself.

291
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,170
What's your name?

292
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,399
(Yaya)

293
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,390
such a cute name.

294
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,290
We'll have fun today.

295
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,299
No harassing, no groping.

296
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,090
There are rules.

297
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,699
If you try to do anything, you'll pay.

298
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,585
Tough girl. I like. I like a lot.

299
00:21:47,591 --> 00:21:53,689
I'll buy drinks from you all night long.

300
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,980
Cheers.

301
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,979
Girl, let's have fun.

302
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,579
Clink our glasses.

303
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,379
Oh, my.

304
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:17,139
Want something to eat with that drink?

305
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:24,659
Is this what a guy likes?

306
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:30,690
You talk like you've never had a boyfriend.

307
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,799
Let me tell you something.

308
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,499
A girl like you should understand a guy more.

309
00:22:39,561 --> 00:22:43,499
A guy may be hard to understand,

310
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,819
but it can be done.

311
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:50,819
I don't want to have a boyfriend.

312
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,650
Not relevant. Whether you have a boyfriend,

313
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:02,219
at least have compassion for a guy who tries to win your heart.

314
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,579
Don't you want to know him more?

315
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,775
How about this? Let me teach you something.

316
00:23:23,776 --> 00:23:27,659
Do you want to know what a guy likes?

317
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,985
Buddy, show her.

318
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:38,370
Sure thing.

319
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,050
(No harassment)

320
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:49,499
Yaya.

321
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:00,079
You know now what a guy wants.

322
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,419
Are you ready? La la la. Come on.

323
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,930
Counting one, two, three.

324
00:24:12,207 --> 00:24:13,854
You like something like this, huh?

325
00:24:13,855 --> 00:24:15,869
Like this?

326
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:17,259
What are you looking at?

327
00:24:21,088 --> 00:24:26,219
Tell your boss I quit. I'll find some other way to make money.

328
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:28,579
Step away.

329
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,979
Yaya, what's the hurry?

330
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,339
Wrong move.

331
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,459
What should I do next?

332
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,379
Look.

333
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:06,299
What is this clip?

334
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,299
What?

335
00:25:14,945 --> 00:25:16,819
Or...

336
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:22,499
Gorya, is it you in this clip?

337
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:31,739
Are you the girl in this clip?

338
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,930
(Guys, is this Gorya?)

339
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,105
I thought...

340
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,379
But this clip is not what you think.

341
00:25:53,998 --> 00:25:56,290
Are you dating Thyme?

342
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:59,569
Speak now. What have you done?

343
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,059
Nothing. It's just...

344
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,299
It's just that Gorya and I are dating.

345
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,089
Does anyone have a problem?

346
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,959
Are you nuts? What date...

347
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,219
And I've canceled Gorya's red card.

348
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:17,459
Cancel means cancel. Got it?

349
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:24,019
It means, going forward, Gorya is off-limits. OK?

350
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,379
As promised.

351
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,492
But the date...

352
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:37,939
Wow, the date. This is big.

353
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,154
Let's take this conversation to the canteen.

354
00:26:41,157 --> 00:26:44,589
So we can have a long talk. Let's go.

355
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,379
Come on.

356
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:48,022
Come on.

357
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,175
Let go. I can walk on my own.

358
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,249
Walk faster.

359
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,227
You see.

360
00:26:54,228 --> 00:26:55,793
Walk faster.

361
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:56,979
Go.

362
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,810
(Is Thyme and Gorya really dating?)

363
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,610
(They're holding hands.)

364
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,890
(Gorya? I don't believe it.)

365
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,530
(F4 canceled the red card.)

366
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:06,720
(Really?)

367
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,599
(They're holding hands.)

368
00:27:13,624 --> 00:27:14,400
(My Thyme... No...)

369
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,170
(What the hell is this?)

370
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,129
Let's talk up here.

371
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,829
It'll be a mess if we go out now.

372
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,281
You caused quite a commotion here, Thyme.

373
00:27:29,282 --> 00:27:30,449
A commotion all right.

374
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,339
Like I don't have enough headaches at home.

375
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,379
Where are you going?

376
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,209
You're already here. Just sit with us for a while.

377
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,876
Are you still afraid of us?

378
00:27:44,877 --> 00:27:46,589
No more, please.

379
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,579
By the way, what's your name?

380
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,729
My name is Hana.

381
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,789
Vidalha Malakarn.

382
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,809
Your surname sounds familiar.

383
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:01,695
So Gorya and Thyme...

384
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:04,749
Very good. Let's get to the point.

385
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,129
What's the story here?

386
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:08,110
Are you guys cool?

387
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:08,960
No.

388
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:12,019
No? Tell my friends the truth.

389
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,179
You forced my hand. It doesn't count.

390
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,081
Fine, it doesn't count.

391
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:22,619
So you forced her.

392
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:27,068
Understandable.

393
00:28:27,829 --> 00:28:29,459
Understand what?

394
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:37,687
To be frank, you like Ren, don't you?

395
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,769
But you went out with Thyme.

396
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,650
I don't want my friends to fight.

397
00:28:45,112 --> 00:28:48,930
I can't believe these words coming from the Father of Multi-Dating.

398
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:52,107
What are you worried about?

399
00:28:52,108 --> 00:28:54,630
Are you afraid Thyme getting in a fistfight with Ren?

400
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:56,084
We're grown-ups.

401
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:59,231
We wouldn't be fighting like we were kids fighting over a doll.

402
00:28:59,232 --> 00:29:00,913
Because we're grown-ups.

403
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:03,279
This is a person, not a doll.

404
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,816
What doll?

405
00:29:04,817 --> 00:29:07,349
Stop it. Don't get sidetracked.

406
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,449
That day I forced her to go out, and she went with me.

407
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,979
What she feels is her business.

408
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,889
Stop pressuring her with your questions.

409
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,569
Look, she's getting uncomfortable.

410
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,690
Please pay her some respect.

411
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,969
Shit, pay respect.

412
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,009
Our friend is grown.

413
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,574
Miracles do exist.

414
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,559
Are you being sarcastic?

415
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,219
All right, I'm sorry. I'm just worried about my friends.

416
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,509
If you don't cross the line, then it's all good.

417
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,999
No way we cross the line...

418
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,629
Did you catch a cold from me?

419
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,404
You forced me to take the medicine. Why didn't you do that also?

420
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:47,899
I didn't think I'd catch it.

421
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,684
How could you not catch it? Are you dumb?

422
00:29:49,685 --> 00:29:52,290
You spent the night with me. How could you not?

423
00:29:52,508 --> 00:29:54,933
That sentence is ambiguous.

424
00:29:54,934 --> 00:29:56,409
Ambiguous?

425
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,854
This now has my full attention.

426
00:29:57,855 --> 00:30:01,049
Hold on, MJ. It's not what you think.

427
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,549
You don't need to be shy, honestly.

428
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,649
We don't find this stuff unusual.

429
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,979
There's nothing going on.

430
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,479
Thyme, help me explain it.

431
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,274
Help you? Just tell it straightforwardly.

432
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,759
Stop speaking in a roundabout way.

433
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,484
What can I say?

434
00:30:12,485 --> 00:30:14,621
Anyone, just tell the story.

435
00:30:14,622 --> 00:30:17,129
We both got wet in the rain.

436
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:20,259
Just that? What about the fire escape?

437
00:30:20,262 --> 00:30:21,709
Fire escape!

438
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,259
Shut up. Not another word.

439
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,589
Shut up? You asked me to help you. So I gave it to them straight.

440
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,279
There's no point 'hitting about the bush'.

441
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,399
That's not how the saying goes, I think.

442
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,299
You can believe whatever you want.

443
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,001
Come on, Hana. Let's go to class.

444
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,215
Where are you going? Finish the story.

445
00:30:37,216 --> 00:30:38,730
- I'm going to class.
- Finish the story.

446
00:30:38,731 --> 00:30:39,970
- Bye.
- I'm telling the truth.

447
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:48,939
Gorya, what's the story between you and Thyme?

448
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:53,089
There's no story here. Nothing really.

449
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,459
People misunderstand.

450
00:30:57,465 --> 00:31:01,890
But it must be better than when you got the red card.

451
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,259
I'm happy for you.

452
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,019
Actually, you prefer this anyway, right?

453
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,019
Gorya.

454
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:18,059
Don't forget to take the medicine.

455
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,571
Just leave me alone.

456
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:22,049
- Let's go.
- You won't get better if you don't. Hey.

457
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,859
Leave me alone. Just take care of yourself.

458
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:33,533
You're a maniac.

459
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,979
What?

460
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,979
Let's get serious here.

461
00:31:43,342 --> 00:31:46,419
Are you serious about Gorya?

462
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,039
If you're just playing around, we're fine.

463
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:58,619
But if you're serious about her, your life will be very complicated.

464
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,739
Your family will disapprove.

465
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,519
So what?

466
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,259
When you run into trouble, we fix it for you.

467
00:32:08,965 --> 00:32:12,769
We're not stopping you. We're just saying...

468
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,059
don't be hasty, don't jump headfirst. That's all.

469
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,890
Look here.

470
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,419
Someone who keeps finding a way to earn extra money

471
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,299
and the only son of the Parama Group.

472
00:32:27,687 --> 00:32:29,899
Do you think your mother will approve?

473
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:38,719
You know Tia was forced into a marriage by your mother.

474
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:45,859
If your mother knew you'd pursue Gorya, your life would be a mess.

475
00:32:47,672 --> 00:32:50,859
If I didn't try, how would I know?

476
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,899
Will we ever be able to stop our friend?

477
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:07,617
What are you thinking?

478
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,128
Get some rest. Take care of your health first.

479
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,769
There aren't a lot of customers at the shop anyway.

480
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,659
Thank you, Uncle Ga.

481
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:26,059
If you don't feel better tomorrow, get more rest.

482
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,939
Don't strain yourself.

483
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,377
I know you need cash now.

484
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,090
(Apply now.)
(Clothing store employee.)

485
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,267
By the way, how was your date?

486
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:36,979
What date?

487
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,832
Don't dodge the subject.

488
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:43,170
I need to go. Hello?

489
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:45,699
It blacks out again.

490
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,699
Warm water for sponge bath is here.

491
00:33:50,275 --> 00:33:52,048
Do you have a towel?

492
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:54,210
Find it somewhere there.

493
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,169
Found it.

494
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,659
No, you can't use this one.

495
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,659
Why? Who gave it to you?

496
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,999
Someone important?

497
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,699
No.

498
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:13,013
Is it the curly hair guy in this clip?

499
00:34:13,014 --> 00:34:13,920
No.

500
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:15,539
It's been shared widely.

501
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,130
No.

502
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,089
Fine. Let me take your cellphone.

503
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,139
I'll ask dad to look at it.

504
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,431
Thanks.

505
00:34:25,432 --> 00:34:27,019
See you.

506
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:30,210
What?

507
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,239
Here it is. Done.

508
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,569
Now you take out the battery.

509
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,539
It's out, see?

510
00:35:11,546 --> 00:35:13,900
Now you check to see if it's broken.

511
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:17,250
Wow, you're fixing the phone for me.

512
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,729
I just want to help.

513
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:25,819
Are you feeling well now? You're finding more jobs.

514
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,099
Is there anything I can do?

515
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,919
No way. Just stick with your day job.

516
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,079
There it goes.

517
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,659
I just want to be a cool dad

518
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,409
that protects his kid.

519
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,689
Whose dad is this? So cool.

520
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,780
See? Take a picture.

521
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:46,700
Dad.

522
00:35:46,701 --> 00:35:49,779
Who is it? Is it the debt collector?

523
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,859
Gorya, go and check it out.

524
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,299
Go and see.

525
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,699
Check for me.

526
00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:58,699
There he goes.

527
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,219
Tell them I'm not home.

528
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,219
Whoa!

529
00:36:26,112 --> 00:36:28,060
Thyme.

530
00:36:29,705 --> 00:36:30,917
The door was open.

531
00:36:30,918 --> 00:36:34,579
What are you doing here? Go home.

532
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:39,330
Hey, who are you, boy?

533
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:42,939
Good evening, I'm Gorya's schoolmate.

534
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,299
Who are your parents?

535
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,669
What are you doing at a girl's house this late at night?

536
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,139
It's not appropriate.

537
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,379
Who are you?

538
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:56,072
I'm Thyme. Akira Paramaanantra.

539
00:36:56,075 --> 00:37:00,139
Everyone in the business sector must know him.

540
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,284
Akira Paramaanantra.

541
00:37:02,285 --> 00:37:03,319
That's right.

542
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,639
Besides ranking at the top of the list of wealthiest families in Thailand,

543
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,521
Paramaanantra's fortune puts the family towards the top end

544
00:37:09,522 --> 00:37:12,979
of the world's richest families too.

545
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,099
Yes, that's me.

546
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,235
Well...

547
00:37:28,236 --> 00:37:32,560
Mr. Thyme, would you prefer coffee, tea, or me?

548
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:34,792
Hot tea, please.

549
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,099
- Glakao.
- Yes, sir.

550
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,940
We only have iced tea.

551
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:41,179
Get it out and we'll microwave it.

552
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,109
Hurry up. Hurry. Hurry.

553
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,779
My dear family.

554
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,779
Excuse me.

555
00:37:58,502 --> 00:38:01,459
Can't you see that we...

556
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,979
are open 24 hours.

557
00:38:08,888 --> 00:38:11,619
You're Kaning, right?

558
00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:15,059
How do you know I'm here?

559
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,299
That isn't hard.

560
00:38:21,484 --> 00:38:25,299
Are you free, chipmunk? Let's have a meal.

561
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,773
Here we go.

562
00:38:31,774 --> 00:38:33,549
Come on.

563
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:37,799
We're eating the 499 set. The biggest one.

564
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:41,699
May I have some, please?

565
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,419
See? I told you.

566
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,539
500 baht for the whole family.

567
00:38:48,385 --> 00:38:51,139
Mr. Thyme, please have some.

568
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,139
I'll add some more for you.

569
00:38:56,494 --> 00:38:58,530
Dip it in the sauce.

570
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:03,219
Careful it's hot.

571
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,370
It's delicious.

572
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:21,299
Yay!

573
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,829
Let's eat.

574
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,119
Dear, turn on the TV, please.

575
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,370
OK.

576
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:34,050
So what are you doing here?

577
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:35,779
Let's eat first.

578
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,370
Tell me now.

579
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:41,729
That's my pork.

580
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,309
You steal another piece of pork.

581
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,760
Mom, look at him. He took my pork.

582
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,582
Thyme, did you see it? He took my pork.

583
00:39:49,585 --> 00:39:52,579
Why are you fighting? There's lots of pork.

584
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,580
- Give it back.
- Get a new piece.

585
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,360
Here's a new piece that's bigger.

586
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,329
A lot of pieces floating here. Give that one to your brother.

587
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,979
Mom! He's taunting me.

588
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,219
I'll help you. I'll punish him.

589
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,610
Sis!

590
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:16,149
Start from the top to the bottom.

591
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,729
The tastes will blend nicely.

592
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:22,259
These are made by the top chef. It's so hard to find elsewhere.

593
00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:24,259
Thank you.

594
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,624
Don't be tense.

595
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:38,817
If not at Kavin's house, you can't find it anywhere else.

596
00:40:40,531 --> 00:40:42,210
OK.

597
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,730
So delicious.

598
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:58,539
So what do you want to talk about?

599
00:41:00,908 --> 00:41:06,779
Chipmunk, do you know the dessert costs almost 4,000 baht.

600
00:41:11,111 --> 00:41:13,739
What are you saying?

601
00:41:14,025 --> 00:41:18,662
To be frank, I don't know how serious Gorya is about Thyme.

602
00:41:18,663 --> 00:41:22,059
But I think my friend is getting too serious.

603
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,071
Yes. So we want to give you a warning.

604
00:41:26,072 --> 00:41:28,602
Stop here if possible.

605
00:41:28,604 --> 00:41:32,939
Our lives are not like yours.

606
00:41:33,197 --> 00:41:36,579
Everything is already planned.

607
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,020
For us, these expensive desserts may come easily

608
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:47,380
in exchange for something we can never have.

609
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:54,099
This is the last piece of pork.

610
00:41:54,754 --> 00:41:57,959
We'll play a game called 'Magic Pork'.

611
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,219
Yay!

612
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,289
Thyme, for this game, you must tell your saddest story

613
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,879
to justify why you deserve this last piece.

614
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,179
This piece is magic pork. It'll cure everything.

615
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,810
Who will start?

616
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:16,893
Me.

617
00:42:16,894 --> 00:42:18,383
Go on.

618
00:42:18,385 --> 00:42:22,542
I have to study and work at the same time.

619
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:26,453
I have to get good grades or I'll lose my scholarship.

620
00:42:26,454 --> 00:42:30,671
I'm responsible for my personal expenses.

621
00:42:30,672 --> 00:42:34,899
And my family is in debt right now.

622
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,079
There she goes. Taking a dig at me.

623
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,539
Haha.

624
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,729
For me, I have to wear my school uniform repeatedly.

625
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,298
The buttons are crumbling.

626
00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:46,155
I always wear hand-me-downs at home that I got from Dad or Sis.

627
00:42:46,157 --> 00:42:47,999
I never have anything good to wear.

628
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,489
That's it?

629
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,329
It's a clear win for me.

630
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:54,210
Wait, Thyme hasn't gone yet.

631
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,165
Can I play too?

632
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,348
Of course. Do you have a sad story?

633
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:07,379
No. My life is good.

634
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,459
This is just a piece of pork.

635
00:43:12,078 --> 00:43:19,259
But playing this game makes it the pork magic.

636
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:30,619
At home, there's no game playing.

637
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,619
No one talks at the dining table.

638
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,739
No laughter.

639
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,699
We were taught to be quiet during meals as children.

640
00:43:42,195 --> 00:43:44,939
Only business talks are allowed.

641
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:50,739
It's strange

642
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:56,181
how the food is abundant at my house,

643
00:43:56,182 --> 00:43:59,499
made from top ingredients,

644
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:08,339
but I've never had such special pork.

645
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:17,460
Well, I have no sad story. I don't need that pork.

646
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,020
Mr. Thyme, please have it.

647
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,160
Put it down.

648
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:28,299
Let him have it.

649
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,413
Well, let me handle it.

650
00:44:32,585 --> 00:44:34,099
What are you doing,

651
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,983
Here.

652
00:44:36,703 --> 00:44:37,610
Everybody gets one?

653
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,340
Each gets a piece.

654
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:41,299
Oh really? Let me see.

655
00:44:43,048 --> 00:44:45,070
Magic pork.

656
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,859
Yay!

657
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:55,450
Wish everyone happiness and good health after eating this.

658
00:44:57,955 --> 00:45:01,848
At the end, that piece of pork was divided into 5 little pieces.

659
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:04,289
We could hardly taste anything.

660
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:09,979
But at least it represents how we don't belittle anyone's problem.

661
00:45:09,985 --> 00:45:14,339
It shows that everyone needs some kind of cure for our hearts.

662
00:45:15,662 --> 00:45:19,372
In summary, you want me to stop my friend

663
00:45:19,373 --> 00:45:22,038
because you're worried your friend may get in trouble.

664
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:24,464
We're just making a suggestion.

665
00:45:24,465 --> 00:45:28,769
If you don't want your friend to get hurt, take care of her.

666
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:32,739
If Gorya doesn't feel anything for Thyme, it's fine by me.

667
00:45:32,891 --> 00:45:38,299
But if she does, don't force it. She'll get hurt for nothing.

668
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,099
It's true, Kaning.

669
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:50,939
Our lives are predestined, especially Thyme's.

670
00:45:51,986 --> 00:45:56,299
Chipmunk, I think you could understand.

671
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:59,819
You can't always follow your heart.

672
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,659
Can I have your number?

673
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,251
Of course.

674
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,712
If there's anything we can help you with, let me know.

675
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,619
There's nothing F4 can't do.

676
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:32,659
This dessert costs 4,000, right?

677
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,192
Mmm... why?

678
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,139
I get all the things you said.

679
00:46:47,032 --> 00:46:51,059
But the way you went behind her back is frustrating.

680
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,159
I'd never do anything behind Gorya's back.

681
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,899
More importantly, you told me to have faith in my friend.

682
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,459
Whichever way Gorya chooses, I'm sure that it is the best path.

683
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:12,899
You should try to have faith in your friend.

684
00:47:12,903 --> 00:47:15,219
If there's nothing else, please excuse me.

685
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,899
I can find my way back.

686
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,059
Look.

687
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,120
(You received 4,000 baht at 9.08 p.m.)

688
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:35,299
Just as stubborn. That's why they're friends.

689
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,859
More like naïve.

690
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,920
(The outstanding balance is 12 baht.)

691
00:47:49,905 --> 00:47:54,899
Kaning, you did it without thinking it through.

692
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:06,459
Your family collects a lot of old appliances.

693
00:48:07,407 --> 00:48:11,953
My TV isn't a box like yours.

694
00:48:11,954 --> 00:48:14,004
My dad likes vintage stuff.

695
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,530
Oh, so why did you come here?

696
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,099
I bought some medicine for you.

697
00:48:26,182 --> 00:48:27,899
Magic pork wouldn't cure your illness.

698
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,480
Don't disrespect the magic pork.

699
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,859
Magic pork, huh? Didn't cure you.

700
00:48:36,699 --> 00:48:38,539
Take the medicine.

701
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,489
I was trying to figure out what you're doing here.

702
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:41,829
Thought you'd come to fight my brother.

703
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:44,029
That's right. I forgot. Why didn't I?

704
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:46,050
Enough.

705
00:49:09,634 --> 00:49:11,819
Hold it.

706
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,819
What are you doing?

707
00:49:14,348 --> 00:49:15,849
I'm putting a cooling patch on your forehead.

708
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:16,944
I can do that myself.

709
00:49:16,945 --> 00:49:18,099
I'll do it.

710
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,169
Give it to me.

711
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:19,830
Stay still.

712
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,729
- My forehead. I can do it myself.
- Stay still.

713
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,779
I'll tell you a story about Ren.

714
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:34,139
When we're kids, I took an old doll from Ren.

715
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,099
It's the doll he loved so much

716
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:46,219
to the point that he couldn't fall asleep without holding it.

717
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:54,174
When I saw how much he loved it, I wanted it more.

718
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,779
Give it back. It's mine.

719
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:58,699
No way.

720
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,980
Give me back my doll.

721
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,499
Give me back my doll.

722
00:50:04,205 --> 00:50:07,659
After a tug of war, the doll was torn apart.

723
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:14,659
Instead of apologizing to him, I said it's his fault.

724
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,471
I told my friends not to play with him.

725
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:19,379
Guys, do not play with Ren.

726
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:23,659
I was such a jerk.

727
00:50:25,749 --> 00:50:32,899
After that, Ren wouldn't yell at me or anything.

728
00:50:37,774 --> 00:50:42,419
He treated it like nothing happened.

729
00:50:43,204 --> 00:50:45,339
He came back to play with us.

730
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:55,299
When in fact the doll was his most beloved toy.

731
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:04,099
When we grew up, I learned that I was such a jerk.

732
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,100
Why are you telling me this?

733
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:15,179
I don't know. I just want to.

734
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,379
Ren is a good person.

735
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,979
It's no surprise

736
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:29,819
everyone falls in love with him.

737
00:51:34,314 --> 00:51:39,219
If it's stuck in your head, apologize to him.

738
00:51:39,795 --> 00:51:42,139
No, it'll ruin my image.

739
00:51:43,189 --> 00:51:46,139
The way you are... spoiled brat.

740
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,139
Did you just push me?

741
00:51:48,586 --> 00:51:49,710
Who's a spoiled brat now?

742
00:51:50,654 --> 00:51:52,299
Is this how it's going to be?

743
00:51:52,871 --> 00:51:54,499
Spoiled brat.

744
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:56,942
Don't think I'll surrender just because you're sick.

745
00:51:56,943 --> 00:51:58,419
- Want to fight me?
- Come at me.

746
00:52:15,626 --> 00:52:19,019
It's ruined.

747
00:52:25,774 --> 00:52:29,619
Your house is full of surprises.

748
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:34,539
It's good. I've gotten to know a lot more of you.

749
00:52:34,888 --> 00:52:37,529
All too well.

750
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,539
Go home now.

751
00:52:39,851 --> 00:52:41,199
Go on.

752
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,300
Don't you need to fix this?

753
00:52:43,857 --> 00:52:45,539
I can have someone come and fix it.

754
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,259
This is more than enough.

755
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:49,539
Go on.

756
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,259
I'm going. Bye. See you at the school.

757
00:52:58,499 --> 00:52:59,569
Go on.

758
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:02,259
I'm going.

759
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:15,299
If life is about opening doors to find new things,

760
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,933
my door opening has a lot to offer.

761
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:25,019
From a life full of darkness, I can now see more light

762
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,589
bit by bit.

763
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:29,051
 (Gorya is quite cute, actually.)

764
00:53:29,076 --> 00:53:30,639
(I think they look cute together.)

765
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,429
It seems like I'm getting back to a normal happy life,

766
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:35,539
right?

767
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:44,739
Madam, your suitcase is ready.

768
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:49,739
As usual, please make sure everything here is all in order.

769
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:59,379
In fact, I found this towel hidden in Thyme's closet.

770
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:05,539
I checked and found out that he told every maid not to throw it away,

771
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,259
and not to tell me.

772
00:54:17,112 --> 00:54:18,737
Put it back to where it was.

773
00:54:18,738 --> 00:54:23,249
Have someone monitor Thyme closely.

774
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,809
Yes.

775
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:27,099
Especially at the school.

776
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,099
Yes.

777
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,713
(Where are you, Gorya? Reply now!)

778
00:54:54,738 --> 00:54:55,994
(Aren't you going to eat? Stop loafing 'idolly'. Hurry now. Stop meddling...)

779
00:55:17,296 --> 00:55:18,979
Scandalous.

780
00:55:21,122 --> 00:55:22,979
What are you looking at?

781
00:55:29,197 --> 00:55:30,899
You've been behaving so well.

782
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:35,139
But the tail comes out anyway, Gorya.

783
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:23,019
Someone is messing with me.

784
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:28,019
Do you really believe the photos are real?

785
00:56:29,488 --> 00:56:32,819
All I know is someone is thinking we're stupid.

786
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:45,099
I think I'm switching to Team Gorya.
