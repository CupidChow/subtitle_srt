1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,589
I'm serious.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,590
I will love you.

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,589
What do you want?

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,500
I'm doing all this

5
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:07,630
to avenge him.

6
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,480
Die!

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,450
I've decided to call off my revenge on F4.

8
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:13,979
Am I not being punished?

9
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,489
The fact that you've come
out the other side unscathed

10
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,610
doesn't mean you can live
your life any way you want.

11
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,929
I love you, Gorya.

12
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,089
My love is not fleeting.

13
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,770
I'll love you forever.

14
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,440
Please be my girlfriend.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,810
Hey, what's wrong?

16
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,810
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,949
But I'm not OK with this.

18
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,929
Why?

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,209
This thing with Talay has been
sorted. What else is the problem?

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,050
Thyme,

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,490
you're still in a relationship with Lita.

22
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,050
Silly old me.

23
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,250
How could I be so focused on
Talay that I forgot about Lita?

24
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,210
This is something you cannot forget.

25
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,130
Lita is my friend.

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,810
I don't want to hurt her.

27
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,210
I get it.

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,810
I'll talk to Lita

29
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,930
about the relationship and the engagement.

30
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,170
I have to do the right thing.

31
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,170
I hope Lita would understand.

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,460
OK?

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,640
OK.

34
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,610
Can I leave this with you?

35
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,900
Once I've sorted everything out,

36
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,570
I'll ask you again, OK?

37
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,210
OK?

38
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:42,429
Alright.

39
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,799
Don't give me that face.

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,210
OK?

41
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,090
Yes.

42
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,889
So... if there's nothing
else, I should go home.

43
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,630
I want to take a shower.

44
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:57,259
Hold on.

45
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,529
This is getting late. It's dangerous.

46
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,709
Dangerous? In this country,

47
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,030
the most dangerous
person is you, Mr. Thyme.

48
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,130
Why are you holding me back?

49
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,399
It was exhausting getting you up here.

50
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,909
Can't you stay and keep
me company for a minute?

51
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,769
I'll get you all toiletries and
the type of pajamas you wear.

52
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,970
I'll have someone drive
you home in the morning.

53
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,359
Are you thinking of something dirty?

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,419
I'm taking off.

55
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,439
No.

56
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,729
Gorya, wait.

57
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,889
Hold on. Hold on.

58
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,159
Gorya.

59
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,150
Gorya, where are you going?

60
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:32,289
You have to ask?

61
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,669
You're going to take advantage of me.

62
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,139
Me taking advantage of you?

63
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,719
Why would I do that? I can wait.

64
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,570
We are bound by...

65
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,214
'virginity'.

66
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,299
Excuse me?

67
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,459
No, I mean...

68
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,869
Even if we spend the night
together, we'll just be talking.

69
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,970
I will never give you...

70
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,379
'foreplay' all night long.

71
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,090
What?!?

72
00:03:57,091 --> 00:04:00,679
If we spend more time together,
we'll 'conceive' even more.

73
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,110
You psycho!

74
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,709
What's wrong with you?

75
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,709
Pervert!

76
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,619
Stop!

77
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,690
What is this?

78
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,299
- It's not what you think.
- Gorya didn't do anything wrong.

79
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,460
Before you explain,

80
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,805
tell me first

81
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,450
how Gorya is here.

82
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,410
Isn't this a space where no one can enter?

83
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,690
- This is not...
- Why don't you just let Gorya explain?

84
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,020
It's her who breaks the rule.

85
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,170
Can you please explain

86
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,850
how you're here?

87
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,869
You're not hiding

88
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,890
or betraying me, are you?

89
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,450
Answer me, Gorya.

90
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,789
- Lita...
- I allowed her.

91
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,999
Excuse me?

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,970
I must apologize to you, Miss Lita,
for not informing you in advance.

93
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,970
She's here because we're recruiting
her to be Mr. Thyme's personal maid.

94
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,930
Huh?

95
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,839
Thank you for helping me out.

96
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,850
I wasn't.

97
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:06,050
I thought that was the only way
you could pay for the vase you broke.

98
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,290
You probably do not have enough
money to pay it back, do you?

99
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,580
How much... is the vase?

100
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,850
70,000.

101
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,049
70,000?

102
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,509
I have a duty to make sure
everything in this house is in order

103
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,410
in Madam's absence.

104
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,879
Therefore, I decided
to hold you responsible

105
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,170
by having you work here.

106
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,899
Or if you don't want to do it,

107
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,419
you can pay us back another way.

108
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,930
No,

109
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,880
I'll do it.

110
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,210
How long are you two going to keep hiding?

111
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,210
Come here.

112
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,730
They are Tete and Jiw, full-time maids.

113
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,010
This is Gorya. She'll be a temp maid.

114
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,290
If you have any questions,
you can ask them.

115
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,409
Although every happened quickly,

116
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,140
I do expect a full commitment from you.

117
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,450
Yes.

118
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:34,930
Well... you are a friend of
Master Thyme, aren't you?

119
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:43,299
Yes. But... I work here now.

120
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,609
If there's anything I
can do, just order away.

121
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,090
Looking forward to working
with you, Tete and Jiw.

122
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,529
Let's check out the servant quarter first.

123
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,319
And...

124
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,370
Have you eaten?

125
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,370
Not yet.

126
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,749
I'm getting hungry too.

127
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,810
Do you eat papaya salad?

128
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,730
That's my favorite.

129
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,382
Come on.

130
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:17,527
How long are you staying?
I'll find you some clothes.

131
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,310
- Come on.
- Let me see.

132
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,610
Careful.

133
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,720
Have you finished?

134
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,720
Can you do it?

135
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,720
Yes.

136
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,970
Hey, do this.

137
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,900
Eat this and you'll have a shiny coat.

138
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,459
Look at him.

139
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,460
More than enough to keep him still.

140
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,299
What a cutie, unlike his owner.

141
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
Dango, bite her.

142
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,930
What are you doing?

143
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:17,529
Tidying the room. What are you doing?

144
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,090
I just got out of the shower
and I was going to put on...

145
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,690
This is my room.

146
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,490
Don't treat it like I'm in the wrong.

147
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,890
This is so unfamiliar.

148
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,890
Gorya, about Lita...

149
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,399
I'm trying to sort things out with her.

150
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,570
But she hasn't picked up
my calls since last night.

151
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,529
Give her some time.

152
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:56,530
I understand.

153
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,530
Don't worry. I will
straighten this out with her.

154
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,769
In the meantime, focus on your work.

155
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,756
Any problems, let me
know right away. I'll help you.

156
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,426
A maid should help you,
not the other way around.

157
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,770
Don't worry. I'm doing great.

158
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,979
At first, I thought you
were going to put me down.

159
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,839
What kind of person do you think I am?

160
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,050
Although Mr. Thyme is kind to the help,

161
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,169
it doesn't mean that
you can chitchat with him.

162
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,559
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,879
Go and tidy up the room.

164
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,129
There's still a lot of work to be done,

165
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,369
especially the next task

166
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,059
which is to feed Thyme.

167
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,419
What?

168
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,209
Feed... this guy?

169
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,530
Yes. It's a morning routine done daily.

170
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,176
Isn't that right?

171
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,900
True. We do it every morning.

172
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,219
Yes.

173
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,370
Please take care of it.

174
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,800
Take care of it.

175
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,519
It's still hot.

176
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,789
Don't be too fussy.

177
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,309
Talk to me nicely.

178
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,570
Auntie Yu assigned you this task.

179
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,090
More.

180
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,569
More.

181
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,699
Enough?

182
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,290
Sure.

183
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,260
I hope no one sees me now. Please.

184
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,730
Shit!

185
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,370
This is the perfect shot, Ren.

186
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,569
You did well, man.

187
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,719
Speaking of which, I will post it...

188
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,890
Don't!

189
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,050
I'm kidding.

190
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,049
We know.

191
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,770
We won't cause any trouble.

192
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,980
OK?

193
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,729
For real?

194
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,090
Of course. I'm turning it off now.

195
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,130
Are you stressing out?

196
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:05,149
I've got a lot on my plate.

197
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,149
This thing with Lita is left unfinished.

198
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,329
And I have to pay for this vase.

199
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,530
I haven't been able to go
to work at the flower shop.

200
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,250
I don't know how Kaning is doing.

201
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,249
You don't need to worry about that.

202
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,140
I've sent my guy to help out your friend.

203
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,010
Who?

204
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,099
As I was saying, I was tricked
to work here in place of Gorya.

205
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,779
Marvelous.

206
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,059
We should hand out flyers today.

207
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,970
I've printed a big file of
flyers. What do we do now?

208
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,930
Boy, did I pick the right day to be here.

209
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,490
How's Gorya doing

210
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,139
about work, the house, and Lita?

211
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,849
Kaning. Kaning.

212
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,319
I get that you're worried about Gorya

213
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,989
but we have so much to do.

214
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,309
Let's finish our work first
and talk about Gorya later.

215
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,709
When will we ever finish?

216
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,730
Yeah, if we hand out flyers the
usual way, it will take a long time.

217
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,850
But don't worry,
chipmunk. I've got an idea.

218
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,420
This thing requires some assistance,

219
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,010
like the face and the skin that is glowing.

220
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,529
Mine?

221
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,580
Mine.

222
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,699
Hello, if you buy flowers from Maytee
O Garden regardless of the price,

223
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,619
you'll get a flyer from the shop,

224
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,459
and, for a special promotion,
a kiss from yours truly.

225
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,650
The confidence.

226
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,449
Will it work?

227
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,490
I wonder.

228
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,570
Come on.

229
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,009
No need to worry.

230
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,319
My guy is resourceful.

231
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,259
And who knows,

232
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,279
he might deliver a better job.

233
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,150
Right.

234
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,330
Right now worry about your work, OK?

235
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,119
Or else Auntie Yu may tell you off.

236
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,430
Ahem.

237
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,010
I should get back to work.

238
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,489
Now it's your turn.

239
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,810
Lita hasn't picked up your calls, has she?

240
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,810
Yeah. I don't know what to do.

241
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,930
I did some research.

242
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,730
Since what happened,
Lita hasn't left the house.

243
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,319
She's deactivated all
her social media accounts.

244
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,530
No one can reach her.

245
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,649
So we'll try to see if we
can catch her at home.

246
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,810
Good idea. Let's go.

247
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,779
No.

248
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,850
Lita has ignored your calls

249
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,130
because she doesn't want to see you.

250
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,290
We'll have a better chance
if we go by ourselves.

251
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,629
But if I don't do anything...

252
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,549
Thyme.

253
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,610
This is not weighing on you only.

254
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,410
It's taking a toll on Gorya too.

255
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,170
You stay here and look after her.

256
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,339
You're the only one who can do this job.

257
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,810
Leave other things to F4.

258
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,730
OK?

259
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,370
OK, man. Thanks.

260
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,090
Very well. We should go.

261
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,210
But...

262
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,959
you need to keep your distance from Gorya.

263
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,289
Don't be too obvious.

264
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,739
Seriously? This is me, Thyme.

265
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,130
I know right from wrong.

266
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,140
Jeez.

267
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,689
What are you doing there?

268
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,930
I'm enjoying my garden.

269
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,429
I told you. I don't need you
to watch over me. I'm fine.

270
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,450
Watch you? I'm watching the garden.

271
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,330
Yes, Mater Thyme.
You're watching the garden.

272
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,530
In this heat, aren't you a bit thirsty?

273
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,459
Who's watching the garden now?

274
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,919
You're keeping an eye on me.

275
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,770
What are you talking about?

276
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,210
I'm just...

277
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,849
saying stuff.

278
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,099
Who are you saying stuff to?

279
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,690
Only the trees and me here.
Are you talking to the trees?

280
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,090
What do you want me to do?

281
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,599
I told you. You don't
need to keep an eye on me.

282
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,609
I'm fine.

283
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,769
And you have a lot of things to do.

284
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,890
Ouch!

285
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,360
Clumsy as always. How
can I not worry about you?

286
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,959
You were putting pressure
on me standing there.

287
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,065
- Let me see.
- How can I concentrate?

288
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,260
Answer me, Gorya.

289
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,600
What's wrong?

290
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,130
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

291
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,130
I can take care of myself.

292
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,930
How did it get so complicated?

293
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,930
This is complicated for you?
What else can you achieve in life?

294
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,130
Let me see.

295
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,069
I can do it myself.

296
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,770
And... I didn't complain about this.

297
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,740
I know.

298
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,490
Women like us... We think too much.

299
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,349
We think for others.

300
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,330
We worry about other people

301
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:41,730
while we barely survive ourselves.

302
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,210
I wanted to tell you to stop thinking.

303
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,330
But you will anyway, right?

304
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,770
At first, I was curious why
Mr. Thyme was so serious about you.

305
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,849
But after you came to work
here, I've begun to get a sense

306
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,410
of why he's so keen on you.

307
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,820
And I was right.

308
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,770
What do you mean?

309
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,930
Actually, the vase wasn't that expensive.

310
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,460
Really?

311
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,779
Do whatever you think is good.

312
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,159
But don't be rash.

313
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,010
And don't worry about anything.

314
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,010
I have stayed with
Mr. Thyme for a long time.

315
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,730
He takes very few things seriously.

316
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,730
But when he does, he will do his best.

317
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:47,290
So it may take some
time but it will happen.

318
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,050
Thank you.

319
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,789
Getting yourself involved
with F4 can be exhausting.

320
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,790
Each of them is a handful.

321
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,299
You're right. Each is a
handful in his own right.

322
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,259
I can't even rank them.

323
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,410
Who do you think is the worst?

324
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,380
I think Mr. Kavin takes the cake.

325
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,860
That's a big kiss. Thank you.

326
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,190
Thank you.

327
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,549
Today is a big hit.

328
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,569
Sales of the past two quarters combined

329
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,539
can't even match today's sales.

330
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,690
Kaning, close the shop. We
don't need any more sales.

331
00:21:28,715 --> 00:21:29,869
Sure.

332
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,639
- Thank you so much, Kavin.
- My pleasure.

333
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,330
What's that?

334
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,439
(Ren: Lita doesn't want to see us either.)

335
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,040
(MJ: What should we do?)

336
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,010
- I'm taking off. Good night.
- Bye.

337
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,129
Where are you going, chipmunk?

338
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,519
I'm not sure how Gorya is doing.

339
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,199
So I... want to see her.

340
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,250
No need.

341
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,210
You have a more important thing to do.

342
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,149
I can see what's inside.

343
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,610
No!

344
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,450
Did you make this
using my family's pattern?

345
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,820
It's difficult.

346
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,810
Not that.

347
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,219
You have a great teacher

348
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,610
but you never ask him to teach.

349
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,730
That's why

350
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,570
I'm going to teach you today.

351
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,850
Do you know in my view

352
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,450
why garlands are special?

353
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,189
Because they are delicate,

354
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,050
and it makes them more meaningful.

355
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,050
Really?

356
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:04,770
Yes. That's why they are
used in important events

357
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,049
such as ceremonies and weddings.

358
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:13,170
In the old days, they were
used to find a soulmate.

359
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,700
Find a soulmate?

360
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,169
Fortune garland.

361
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,109
When a woman looked for her soulmate,

362
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,130
she would throw a
garland at a man she liked.

363
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,820
Really?

364
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,170
What I'm telling you is
when making a garland,

365
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,170
you need to concentrate. No distraction.

366
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,570
Haven't I told you this, chipmunk?

367
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,010
What's more important
is you shouldn't be sleepy.

368
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,010
Here, I made you a cup of coffee.

369
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,010
Thank you.

370
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,050
Smells so good.

371
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,850
I just told you not to be distracted.

372
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,589
Don't tell me the reason you
did a poor job on this garland

373
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,239
is that you're busy thinking of me.

374
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,519
Not at all.

375
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,780
What were you thinking then?

376
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,730
I don't know.

377
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,600
At that time,

378
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,850
I may have been worried about Gorya.

379
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,850
You two are cut from the same cloth.

380
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,879
You worry about others than yourselves.

381
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,610
How can I not?

382
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,410
Gorya has been through so much, Kavin.

383
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,410
Before, it was school and Hana.

384
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,410
And then it was Talay.

385
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,450
And when everything seemed
to get better, there's Lita.

386
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,130
I just want her to be happy.

387
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,770
But this is between three people.

388
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,770
There's not much we can do.

389
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,860
Isn't there anything
we can do to help at all?

390
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,960
You know love is a delicate thing,

391
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,340
let alone a love triangle.

392
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,170
There's nothing more complicated.

393
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:45,050
In the end, someone will get hurt.

394
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,050
Only the people inside the triangle

395
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,770
know how it will end.

396
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,410
Are you talking about...

397
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,610
So clumsy.

398
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
Kavin.

399
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,859
The first aid kit is in the back, right?

400
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,210
I'll get it.

401
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,450
It's fine.

402
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,100
Are you a vampire or something?

403
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,850
If you don't want to get
hurt, concentrate more.

404
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,850
Who would want to get hurt?

405
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,850
That's true.

406
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,530
No one wants to get hurt.

407
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,660
But that's life.

408
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,210
You can never know what's
going to happen to you.

409
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:12,090
And sometimes the person
who hurts you the most

410
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,810
is yourself.

411
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,330
No need to say it.

412
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,740
I know I've been bad.

413
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,730
Until I can get things
straightened out with Lita,

414
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,920
I won't let anything
like that happen again.

415
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,290
I'm just here to set the table.

416
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,049
How's it going?

417
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,009
I can't get hold of Lita.

418
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,530
Ren and MJ went to see her at
her house but she wouldn't come out.

419
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,530
If Lita keeps avoiding me,

420
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,410
I'll have to talk to Mother about
calling off this engagement.

421
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:26,170
I checked her work
schedule and got plane tickets.

422
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,289
But you have to talk to Lita anyway.

423
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,799
I know. Why are you so hung up on Lita?

424
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,539
You keep 'festering' me.

425
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,629
Pestering.

426
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,339
And if you don't want me to pester you,

427
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,169
- move.
- No.

428
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,599
I need to set the table.

429
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,759
- Move or Auntie Yu will yell at me.
- No.

430
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,879
- Move.
- No.

431
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,250
Oh, Miss Lita.

432
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,179
You've come quite late.

433
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,290
How long have you been standing there?

434
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,409
Long enough to see

435
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:58,199
how friendly a maid here

436
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,850
can be with the owner.

437
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,969
It's good that you're here.

438
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,130
Let's straighten it out.

439
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,290
Yeah? What's there to straighten out?

440
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,290
How stupid do you think I am?

441
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,900
Everything is clear. It's
been clear for a while

442
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,700
how you and Gorya feel about each other.

443
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,610
And you want to call off our engagement.

444
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,799
But do you really
think you can pull it off?

445
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,879
I'll do it no matter how difficult it is.

446
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,869
I've prepared the plane tickets.

447
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,770
The two of us will talk
to my mother tomorrow.

448
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,010
It's too late, Thyme.

449
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:40,760
Hey!

450
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:42,620
I've talked to your mother.

451
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,179
I've been granted
permission from Mrs. Roselyn.

452
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,090
Starting today,

453
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,090
I'm moving in

454
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,450
here in the same house as you.

455
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,589
You have no right to do this, Lita.

456
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,889
Why not?

457
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,770
You know damn well

458
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,159
the person who has the power in this house

459
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,109
is your mother.

460
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:25,350
Even you can't oppose her.

461
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,140
Right?

462
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,250
Sorry. I'm just playing the game.

463
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,250
When things get this far,

464
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,410
all I can do is to keep going forward.

465
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,730
It's like how you've
become a maid here, Gorya.

466
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,060
Speaking of which...

467
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,050
Please put away my suitcase, Gorya.

468
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,899
Lita!

469
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,610
That's fine.

470
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,610
I'll do it.

471
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,589
Wait!

472
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,259
You have no right to order me around.

473
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,139
If you move even just
one step, I'll tell my parents

474
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,770
and use every power I
have to destroy Gorya.

475
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,930
You know that my parents can do that.

476
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,450
Let's eat dinner, Thyme.

477
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,930
Leave it there.

478
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,130
I'll take it from here.

479
00:31:59,103 --> 00:31:59,810
But...

480
00:31:59,811 --> 00:32:02,300
I want you to go out and
buy something for me.

481
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,410
Thank you.

482
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,300
I thought you're going
to break a thing or two.

483
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,749
That's quite unexpected.

484
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,559
Didn't think you could stay calm.

485
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,559
I never thought you could
be this kind of person either.

486
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,529
But stop it already, Lita.

487
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,850
I can see this is not you.

488
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,850
It's not surprising.

489
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,629
Every girl is willing to do anything

490
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:58,250
for someone she loves.

491
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,829
This is not that.

492
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,250
This is you wanting to win.

493
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,739
Get it together.

494
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,410
You just want to win.

495
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,290
Yes.

496
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,290
I just want to win.

497
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,370
But you know why?

498
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,090
Because I really love you.

499
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,010
Do you know

500
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,010
the day you asked me to be your girlfriend

501
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,660
was such a happy day for me.

502
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,170
I couldn't stop thinking
about you even for a minute.

503
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,490
I really felt that way.

504
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,490
I thought we...

505
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,370
belonged together.

506
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,650
Don't you feel the same

507
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,580
that we're meant to be?

508
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,700
If you don't feel that way,

509
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,610
I'll make sure you do.

510
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,350
Ren,

511
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,249
are you shopping for groceries?

512
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,450
Mmm.

513
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,389
I see someone standing here
staring vacantly for 10 minutes.

514
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,930
So I get a bit concerned.

515
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,690
Is this about Lita?

516
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,290
I can't believe how vicious Lita can be.

517
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,980
I get it.

518
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,730
Lita must feel like she's betrayed.

519
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,579
She's just doing everything she can

520
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,730
to reclaim what is hers.

521
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,300
No one wants to lose.

522
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,130
It's true.

523
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,930
Are you anxious about Thyme?

524
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,930
Anxious about Thyme?

525
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,780
Not at all.

526
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,730
I trust him.

527
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:19,179
Just a place allowing me to feel weak

528
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,970
Only for a day

529
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,039
The person whom I'm worried about

530
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,210
is Lita.

531
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,090
Cover yourself.

532
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,869
The more I trust Thyme,

533
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,890
I more I know how
badly this will hurt Lita.

534
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,890
And there's nothing I can do for her.

535
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,570
Why?

536
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,690
Whatever. I've done everything I can.

537
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,690
The only thing to do is wait.

538
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,099
So...

539
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,410
you don't need to feel upset on my account.

540
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,770
Let's ring these up.

541
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,970
Did I blush?

542
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:35,650
You may not want to hear it but I'm sorry

543
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,650
for everything.

544
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,610
What are you thinking?

545
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,290
I just don't want to hear your apologies.

546
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,639
And you?

547
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,489
What are you going to do?

548
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,530
I have to speak to my mother
frankly to call off the engagement.

549
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,450
Are you dumb or are you dumb?

550
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,450
Do you think she'll just say yes?

551
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,660
She proposed the
engagement to the Empiccas.

552
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,650
If she let you call it off,

553
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:11,370
you know how bad it'd
hurt the Parama Group?

554
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,779
Between us, massive
benefits are riding on this.

555
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,639
That's why I'm trying to fix the problem.

556
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,890
What you're going to
do is cause the problem.

557
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,259
Don't you know

558
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,149
that you're the only one

559
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,820
who doesn't want to get married?

560
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,330
I know. Don't you think I know?

561
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,770
So what are you going to do?

562
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,370
I have no idea.

563
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,009
But there must be a way.

564
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,860
I'm sick of talking to you.

565
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:45,170
I can see there's no way
you can beat this game.

566
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,010
Let me end it right here.

567
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,659
Lita, what are you going to do?

568
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:05,020
You know my parents want this
wedding to happen as soon as possible.

569
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,620
Tomorrow, I'll fix a meeting
to talk to them about it.

570
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,610
If we get married,

571
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,979
this mess will be over, won't it?

572
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,739
Lita, stop it.

573
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,450
Thyme, you're forcing me to do this.

574
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,210
Lita, you're here early.

575
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,290
Excited about the wedding?

576
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,140
Is Thyme here with you?

577
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,130
I think he'll come.

578
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,850
Because he's a kind of man...

579
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,490
who knows his responsibility.

580
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,960
(Gorya.)

581
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:25,759
(Lita set up a meeting
between her parents and me.)

582
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
(No need to worry.)

583
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,610
I first thought Lita wouldn't go along.

584
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,089
Seeing that she set up this
meeting with such short notice,

585
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,260
I'm relieved.

586
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:51,210
Mrs. Roselyn would like to see
this wedding happen quickly too.

587
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:52,850
Isn't that right?

588
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:54,210
That's right.

589
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,978
I've prepared all the
documents and everything.

590
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:02,010
Sorry for not telling you in advance.

591
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,829
But, as you know, with you two,

592
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,899
it's not just about the wedding,

593
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,339
it's business.

594
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:12,340
Actually, the minister has responded to us.

595
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:13,809
Excuse me.

596
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,290
I have an important thing to tell you.

597
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,329
Well... I... I...

598
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,210
I'd like to call off this engagement.

599
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:36,448
Call off the engagement?

600
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,130
What happened? Please tell me.

601
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,330
Because I know

602
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,012
that he...

603
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:56,117
- Why on earth did you do that?
- He's volatile.

604
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,010
See? He can get mad for no reason.

605
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,819
And when I try to teach him a lesson,

606
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,510
he'll yell back at me. Look.

607
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,969
What's your problem, monkey?

608
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:09,239
See? He'd normally use harsher words.

609
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,769
All the time I've spent with him,

610
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:13,029
he brings me nothing but trouble.

611
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,859
When I first met him,

612
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,250
he was going to leave me
in the middle of nowhere.

613
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,970
I had to get on his back.

614
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,519
We wrestled like this.

615
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,599
Monkey, get off me.

616
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,480
Let me go.

617
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:25,319
- We can talk it out.
- We also fought at a friends' house.

618
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,610
Get off me.

619
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,440
- What's the matter with you?
- Don't come any closer.

620
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:32,195
I hate you.

621
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,970
I freaking hate you.

622
00:42:36,038 --> 00:42:40,548
Mom, Dad, I'm begging you.

623
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,650
Please call off this engagement for me.

624
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:51,130
Do you think she'll just say yes?

625
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,130
If she let you call it off,

626
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,810
you know how bad it'd
hurt the Parama Group?

627
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,810
Please.

628
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,690
I don't want to be married to him.

629
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:13,250
This guy is no good.

630
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,850
He's not my type at all.

631
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,250
The man I will love

632
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,100
must be a good man...

633
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,520
You've sprained your ankle.

634
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:28,410
How did you get here?

635
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,070
who brings me joy when he's around.

636
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,690
What are you doing?

637
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:40,570
Warm and kind-hearted.

638
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,070
Here. Put this on.

639
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,340
But for me, love is the
most important thing.

640
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,930
And committed.

641
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,170
That's why I can't love him.

642
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,730
I really can't.

643
00:44:10,292 --> 00:44:11,601
Therefore,

644
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,210
I'm begging you.

645
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,800
Please call off...

646
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,170
Alright, sweetheart, I understand.

647
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,450
You don't need to do this anymore.

648
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:32,730
Don't cry.

649
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,170
Thyme,

650
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,029
let's call off this engagement

651
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:49,530
in a way that will cause as small
damage as possible to everyone.

652
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:02,580
Thank you.

653
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,859
Sigh. You sigh again.

654
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,919
Kaning, you worry about Gorya twice daily.

655
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,519
No,

656
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,380
I'm just bummed that the shop
owner left me to take a trip on his own.

657
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,320
When you have good sales, you take a rest.

658
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,230
Sure.

659
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:25,769
But I do worry about her.

660
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,770
See?

661
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,330
Stop worrying.

662
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,770
The news confirms it. Lita
has called off the engagement.

663
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,949
My goodness.

664
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:38,109
And it looks like a happy ending.

665
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:38,810
Uncle Ga!

666
00:45:38,811 --> 00:45:42,599
Kaning, no more working.
Close the shop now.

667
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,219
- Yes.
- And you, the new guy.

668
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,319
Help Kaning close the shop.

669
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,970
I'm not the new guy.

670
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,400
Bye.

671
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,530
- You keep worrying about others.
- Kavin!

672
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,930
Think about yourself for a change.

673
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,130
What should I be thinking about?

674
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,130
Everything.

675
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,439
Pack up.

676
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,130
I'll give you a ride.

677
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,140
Is the shop closed?

678
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,330
It is. We hope to serve you next time.

679
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,330
Such a shame.

680
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,889
Do you sell this type of garlands here?

681
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,290
Oh no, this is not for sale.

682
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,379
Very beautiful.

683
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,109
I used to practice making garlands too.

684
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,490
But I stopped it a long time ago.

685
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:09,810
It's a shame.

686
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,099
Are you done, chipmunk? Let's go.

687
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,549
Kavin.

688
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:16,250
This customer used to make garlands.

689
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,900
Please excuse me.

690
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:37,170
Love is strange.

691
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:43,450
It sometimes comes to
you when you least expect it.

692
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,970
Gorya, have you seen Thyme?

693
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,970
No, I haven't.

694
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:56,010
Where did he go so early?

695
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,530
When it comes to you,

696
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,850
it brings you joy, pain,

697
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:11,060
memories, and sweet
moments that are hard to forget.

698
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:17,050
Sometimes it makes you do crazy things.

699
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:24,570
Sometimes it makes you become a
person whom you don't want to be.

700
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,869
I used to think

701
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,100
if I give love everything I have,

702
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:48,090
I'll gain it back one day.

703
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,140
I wanted to win.

704
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,559
Before I knew it,

705
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,580
I disregarded your feelings.

706
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,690
I'm such a bad person.

707
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,690
Maybe this is why you're in Thyme's heart.

708
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:10,020
No, in everyone's heart.

709
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:15,770
Because you always think about others.

710
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,770
You know that, Gorya?

711
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:25,770
Whatever... I'm done being
a bad guy in your story.

712
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,010
I should love myself more.

713
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,589
Go study like I've always dreamed.

714
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:35,970
Discover my future.

715
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:39,970
And make myself worthy
enough to get a fresh start.

716
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:44,650
Go.

717
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:50,970
Sorry for the short notice.

718
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:55,610
And sorry for being afraid
to tell you face-to-face.

719
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:02,130
But there's one thing I want to tell you.

720
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:11,610
I'm so happy to have met
you and been your friend.

721
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,730
Thank you and I will always miss you

722
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,010
from USA.

723
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,250
Lita!

724
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,379
Crazy girl, I spent a
lot of time on the clip

725
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:00,970
because I didn't want to see you.

726
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,650
And I didn't want to cry like this.

727
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,210
How can I stay put and do nothing?

728
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,210
We are friends.

729
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,770
And I haven't apologized to you.

730
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,980
I'm sorry.

731
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:22,290
You did nothing wrong in this whole thing.

732
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,610
It's my fault.

733
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,610
It's not you.

734
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,810
It's me.

735
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,810
I'm sorry.

736
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:39,290
Don't cry.

737
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,529
Don't be a cry baby.

738
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,489
You're crying too.

739
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:44,690
We don't look our best right now.

740
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:52,259
(Attention. This is a
call for Star Airlines.)

741
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:57,879
(Flight SA 607, is ready to take off.)

742
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,490
I have to go.

743
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,210
Safe travels.

744
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:23,959
Take care of yourself.

745
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,970
You too.

746
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:30,060
Go or you'll miss the flight.

747
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:44,930
Gorya.

748
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:50,250
Don't ever cry like this again.

749
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:56,869
Something that's important...
sort it out right away.

750
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:59,210
Don't leave it unfinished.

751
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,730
I should go. Bye.

752
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,130
What's with the winking?

753
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:17,179
Wait, so where is Thyme?

754
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:18,920
If you want to know, ask him yourself.

755
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,310
Ren, why don't you help me?

756
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:26,410
Kavin, let me go.

757
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,530
What are you doing?

758
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:42,399
Lita's thing has been sorted.

759
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,450
The only thing left to
be sorted is you two.

760
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,330
Go for it.

761
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:51,330
Alright.

762
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,330
They are very nosy people.

763
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,659
True.

764
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,930
What kind of crazy game are they playing?

765
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:06,509
Shall we get out?

766
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:08,930
Wait, wait, wait.

767
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:14,050
They might be very nosy but...

768
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,810
Can't you answer me yet?

769
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,640
Right now? Are you in a hurry?

770
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:22,930
No but...

771
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,610
This thing with Lita has been sorted.

772
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,580
I'm not a bad person anymore.

773
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:34,330
A guy can be a bit impatient.

774
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,410
A little sympathy for the one who waits.

775
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:46,460
Fine, I'll give you the answer.

776
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:01,940
Help me put it on.

777
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:49,290
Here's the answer.

778
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,530
Huh?

779
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:54,900
Did you answer?

780
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:58,239
Why are you such a dummy?

781
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,329
Stop.

782
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:03,010
I asked you to put on the
necklace for me meaning I said yes.

783
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,010
Got it?

784
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:18,820
It means you and I are a couple.

785
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,220
OK?

786
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,730
Well...

787
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,130
OK... OK...

788
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:36,338
I want to be alone. You...

789
00:56:36,558 --> 00:56:37,515
Get out of the car.

790
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,249
What? What's the matter with you?

791
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:42,250
Go on. Get out of the car. Go.

792
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:49,010
So? Are you two together now?

793
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:54,009
Yes but he threw me out of the car.

794
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,010
Don't know what his deal is.

795
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:59,170
Three,

796
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:00,900
Two,

797
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:02,299
one.

798
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:06,020
I did it!

799
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:13,050
As Lita said, love is strange.

800
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:17,410
It creates a lot of things.

801
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:21,570
Many times it makes us grow.

802
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,154
But what I've learned is...

803
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:25,279
(Billionaire engagement is off!)

804
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,610
when you pass one test,

805
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:31,968
a new test is awaiting
you around the corner.

806
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:36,330
You just have to keep going

807
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,370
because this is life.

808
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:42,370
It never ends.

809
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:44,730
No matter how hard we run,

810
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:49,730
we must face it in the end.

811
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:53,490
Every one of us.

812
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:06,240
Kavin.

813
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:09,130
Huh?

814
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,450
I have something to give you.

815
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,650
I want to give you this
because I want to tell you

816
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,610
that the garlands that you gave me...

817
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:27,690
Kavin, what are you doing?

818
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,010
Are you really getting serious with me?

819
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:51,529
I may not be deserving of love

820
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,609
No more talking.
I may not be deserving of love

821
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:56,140
I may not be deserving of love

822
00:58:56,210 --> 00:59:01,200
Afraid I may hurt someone

823
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,490
The Secret Story of Iris

824
00:59:27,851 --> 00:59:29,048
Block him.

825
00:59:52,585 --> 00:59:54,154
You haven't been around much.

826
00:59:54,155 --> 00:59:56,102
I'm bored of school

827
00:59:56,103 --> 00:59:57,547
so I've gone out and
found something fun to do.

828
00:59:57,548 --> 01:00:00,136
Don't have too much fun
and forget about the exams.

829
01:00:00,822 --> 01:00:03,071
Being F4 doesn't help you graduate.

830
01:00:03,072 --> 01:00:04,738
What if you're the only one
who doesn't finish school?

831
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:06,551
I know, Dad.

832
01:00:06,552 --> 01:00:09,059
You speak to me like I'm a child.

833
01:00:11,057 --> 01:00:14,656
I'm hungry. Let me order
you something yummy to eat.

834
01:00:14,657 --> 01:00:17,699
I guarantee you'll love it.

835
01:00:21,445 --> 01:00:23,019
She's coming.

836
01:00:27,029 --> 01:00:28,582
Here's Mr. Methas's order.

837
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,425
- Oh no!
- Your order is complete.

838
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:32,558
Thank you for using our KFC service.

839
01:00:37,302 --> 01:00:40,979
My friend has recently
found his love to read.

840
01:00:57,628 --> 01:00:59,257
This is good.

841
01:01:00,137 --> 01:01:04,099
Speaking of love, do you
love the chicken or the seller?

842
01:01:04,715 --> 01:01:06,099
What?

843
01:01:06,751 --> 01:01:08,218
I like.

844
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:09,521
You can't!

845
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:14,219
I mean the chicken.

846
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,730
Gorya, what's wrong?

847
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,099
I'm worried about Kaning.

848
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,989
She seems a bit odd.

849
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:33,909
I don't know what's on Kaning's mind but

850
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:35,020
it must have something to do with Kavin.

851
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:36,059
I don't understand.

852
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:38,940
Why did you become a guy who
never opens his heart to anyone?

853
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,159
What happened to Kavin?

854
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,290
I think he came across Mona the other day.

855
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,059
You said I never opened my heart to anyone.

856
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,640
I did once to a girl.

857
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,244
If you want to know, I'll tell you.
