1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:03,009
Phupha Komolpetch, a top
student with a clean record.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,849
All that will be ruined

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,779
just because you planned to
expose what happened in this school.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,290
I'm a student here.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,099
But how come I never saw you here?

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,379
I just got a scholarship here
and I don't like rich people.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,130
Trust me.

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,129
You told me to mind my own business.

9
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,666
And now you're getting
all up in my business...

10
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,557
The person who gave
Gorya the red card was Talay.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,970
(Screwdriver: The fish has taken the bait.)

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,780
What are you doing?

13
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,690
You all go to this school.

14
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,490
Why are you doing this?

15
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,369
Answer me.

16
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,490
They won't answer you

17
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,490
because I told them not to.

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,690
But I can answer.

19
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,170
I gave you a fake red card

20
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,170
because I wanted Thyme to know

21
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,170
how it felt

22
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,369
when someone important was beaten up.

23
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,690
Too bad, someone interrupted.

24
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,690
So we had a change of plan.

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,900
Talay,

26
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,369
- you...
- I'm sorry.

27
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,609
Everything was blown out of proportion.

28
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,010
Sorry for tying you up like this.

29
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,010
Thank you for trusting me all this time.

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,890
Everything will end soon.

31
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,810
What do you want?

32
00:03:30,437 --> 00:03:31,390
What's up, Kavin?

33
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,210
Finally, we've reached you.

34
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,309
Gorya is in trouble.

35
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,049
I know.

36
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,650
Talay texted me.

37
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,339
So you know about everything?

38
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,269
Yeah. Where are you guys?

39
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,639
We're with Ren. He was attacked.

40
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Where are you?

41
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,489
I'm on my way to Talay.

42
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,459
Huh? Stop right now.

43
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,129
Why would you go to Talay?

44
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,849
You know it's a trap.

45
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,900
How can I leave Gorya with him?

46
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,210
You'll go to Gorya no matter what, huh?

47
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:01,010
Yeah.

48
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:02,659
Listen carefully.

49
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,290
Talk to MJ.

50
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:07,908
Thyme, I got intel.

51
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:11,166
These people are anti-F4.

52
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,679
They come together because
we posted them the red card.

53
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,479
And Talay?

54
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:19,324
I could barely get any info on him.

55
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:22,769
But I'm certain that he's
the cause of this whole thing.

56
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,729
Another thing I could find is

57
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,047
Talay must have some kind
of connection with Phupha.

58
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,182
Remember Phupha?

59
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,250
Phupha...

60
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,237
If you remember,

61
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:42,067
there's a senior who got
the red card before you.

62
00:04:43,386 --> 00:04:44,756
His name is Phupha.

63
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,065
He tried to expose F4 about the red card.

64
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,057
In the end, he got it himself.

65
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,776
I'm doing all this

66
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,649
to avenge him.

67
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,291
What is he to you?

68
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:08,003
Brother?

69
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:12,115
No.

70
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,577
He's not even a relative or anything.

71
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,430
Come to think of it,

72
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,087
for me,

73
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,393
he's just an idiot.

74
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,439
Give it.

75
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,919
Give it to us.

76
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
Just give it up.

77
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,060
Come on.

78
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,990
If you'd just handed over the money,
you could have walked out unscathed.

79
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:43,909
Let's go.

80
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,040
Stop it!

81
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:08,961
That was close.

82
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:10,276
You know how dangerous that could be?

83
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,379
What's with you?

84
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,929
They are thieves.

85
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,219
But you should not do that.

86
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,659
Were you trying to stab me?

87
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,159
Don't!

88
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,939
Why are you even here, four-eyes?

89
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,890
What's with you?

90
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:21,889
Looking for trouble, huh?

91
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,109
Huh? Looking for trouble?

92
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,490
What an idiot!

93
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,809
What are you doing?

94
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,490
Run!

95
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:38,611
Did you call the police?

96
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:41,048
Wait a sec. You'll get your money back.

97
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,250
Whoa! What's that?

98
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,250
From the screwdriver?

99
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:49,426
I guess but... that's OK.

100
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,708
Nothing a simple wound
dressing couldn't fix.

101
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,732
Wait!

102
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:57,929
What's up?

103
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,923
Want to make it up to me?

104
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,228
Let's be friends then, OK?

105
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:18,530
What do you say, boy?

106
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,109
My name is not 'Boy'. It's Talay.

107
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,110
Whoa! Really?

108
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:30,361
My name is Phupha. Yours is Talay.

109
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,759
What a coincidence!

110
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,484
Phupha is the son of a steel
factory owner in the area.

111
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:49,145
I don't know if it's because we're
close in age or whatever the reason,

112
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:53,585
but we became best friends in the end.

113
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,794
His family was kind.

114
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,303
He taught an orphan like me everything.

115
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,883
He gave me knowledge.

116
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,170
He found odd jobs for
me to earn some money.

117
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,569
Talay.

118
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,238
He took care of me like his own brother.

119
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,940
Talay!

120
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:17,809
I just need it for a sec.

121
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,770
For me, Phupha makes silly decisions.

122
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,601
He doesn't think things through.

123
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,426
But I respect him from
the bottom of my heart.

124
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,300
And I was confident

125
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,090
that someone like him

126
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,101
has a bright future ahead of him.

127
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,900
Funny, huh? In the end,

128
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,210
he doesn't get even a normal future,

129
00:08:57,255 --> 00:08:58,774
let alone a bright one.

130
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,812
As you know, in this country,

131
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:04,835
if you're influential enough,

132
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,683
you can crush
someone's life just like that.

133
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,530
And the person who did that to Phupha

134
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,650
was F4.

135
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:29,387
You're saying that you're not
even a student of the school.

136
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:33,851
That's right. I hacked
the school's database

137
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,327
and faked my way in.

138
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,389
How was that possible?

139
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,250
It's not that hard

140
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,250
if you're well prepared

141
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,876
and fueled by vengeance.

142
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,570
The IT tech stuff... I
happen to be good at it.

143
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,570
Who knows?

144
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:04,103
It might be fate that
everything links to it.

145
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,250
How did you get the virus?

146
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,506
How would I know?

147
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:14,456
But this puts us in a tough spot.

148
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,030
All the key documents including
bookkeeping are all in there.

149
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:19,115
That sounds difficult.

150
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,382
It is.

151
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,589
No one in our factory can fix it.

152
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,048
So now it's up to you.

153
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,109
I know that you're the best at this stuff.

154
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,850
I leave it in your hands, brother.

155
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,850
If you can fix it,

156
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,210
I'll be your servant for a month.

157
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,509
You make good coffee.

158
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,890
You don't have to be my servant.

159
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,890
Just make a cup for me every day.

160
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,700
This is 3-in-1 instant coffee.
Anyone can make it taste good.

161
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,890
You've fixed it!

162
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,239
Glad my talking you up
with Dad is not a waste.

163
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,709
What are these files?

164
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,130
Let me see.

165
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,569
Talay! Why did you have to show that?

166
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,499
Phupha! Did you download porn?

167
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,450
Dad!

168
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:25,130
You never told me you're
this good at hacking.

169
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,010
That's good though because
I was looking for help.

170
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,389
Download every file in there.

171
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,434
You've worked here for a long time.

172
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,880
Why are you trying to swindle the owner?

173
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,189
Just keep doing your work in silence.

174
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:47,490
Once you're done, I'll cut you in.

175
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:56,695
Yeah, I'm handing it.

176
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,760
What are you doing?

177
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,970
Do you think we're stupid?

178
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,409
Never mind. We can pick it up from here.

179
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,410
You, see this through.

180
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,330
And you, orphan. If you're gone,

181
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,329
no one will care.

182
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,210
Talay, I'm here to save you.

183
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,413
Stop it right now.

184
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,819
Stop hurting Talay.

185
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,185
Are you here alone?

186
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,730
Idiot.

187
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,850
Because of you, this
is getting out of hand.

188
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,818
Stop hurting Talay.

189
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,170
Master, don't try to be a hero.

190
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,890
So you're the owner's son. So what?

191
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,490
You on your own could accomplish nothing.

192
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,276
Who said I'm on my own?

193
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,050
Man, the police are coming.

194
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,250
Are you going to destroy
the evidence and run?

195
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,381
I've blacklisted all of you.

196
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,850
Even if you run, you can't hide.

197
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,370
I can't let bad men like you get away.

198
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,530
Hey, you're talking too much.

199
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,210
You shut up right now.

200
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,530
Don't! Don't catch me. Let me go.

201
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,480
Are you OK?

202
00:13:51,481 --> 00:13:53,319
Why did you have to provoke him?

203
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,319
I didn't know he had a knife.

204
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,810
Oh no, you are bleeding.

205
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,911
I have to stop the bleeding.

206
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,810
Hold on, what are you doing?

207
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,369
I'm stopping the bleeding.

208
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,970
With duct tape? Are you insane?

209
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,439
There must be a limit to your idiocy.

210
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,050
That's all we have. Just use it.

211
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,019
No, don't.

212
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,459
What are you doing?

213
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,310
Phupha!

214
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:31,730
Don't. It hurts.

215
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,450
He tried to close the wound with duct tape?

216
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,849
Were you mad, Phupha?

217
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,139
He was.

218
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,489
It hurt so bad when the doctor removed it.

219
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,020
It was in the moment. Didn't
have much time to think.

220
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,810
It's good that you're safe.

221
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,810
I really thought you were going to die.

222
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,810
It's very fortunate that you're OK.

223
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,010
Since everything has settled down,

224
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,730
I have another important
thing to tell you, Talay.

225
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,140
Yes.

226
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,135
We talked and agreed

227
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,490
that your talent in computing is dangerous.

228
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,050
I've been thinking.

229
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,535
I can't let you go on like this.

230
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:39,210
Next semester I'm sending
you to go to Kocher with Phupha.

231
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,266
Kocher?

232
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,290
The tuition fee is astronomical.

233
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,410
I can afford it.

234
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,829
I thought... you're going to
punish me for... helping them.

235
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,329
What are you talking about?

236
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,249
We know that you were forced to do it.

237
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,210
If you hadn't sent that text, I
wouldn't have known about any of it.

238
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,810
But...

239
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,810
Talay,

240
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,429
listen to me.

241
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,250
I know I'm impulsive.

242
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,197
I often find myself in the
middle of dangerous situations.

243
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,799
Having a smart guy like you by my side

244
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,197
gives me comfort.

245
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,050
I'm proud

246
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,015
to have you as a brother.

247
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,779
Having you by my side

248
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,770
is like having a protection
talisman. Isn't that cool?

249
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,770
How is that cool?

250
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,770
It's so cool.

251
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,279
Speaking of a talisman,

252
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,511
sign this for me.

253
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,720
What is this?

254
00:16:40,721 --> 00:16:42,579
It's a memento from our mission.

255
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,809
No.

256
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,379
Who collects this stuff anyway?

257
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,210
I do.

258
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,620
Who would face such an
awesome experience so often?

259
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,729
Just sign it.

260
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,079
Come on.

261
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,385
Fine.

262
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,659
About going to Kocher... what do you say?

263
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,083
Actually...

264
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,370
I'm proud

265
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,690
to be your brother.

266
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,859
I could just eat you up.

267
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,810
Give me a hug.

268
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,250
My wounds!

269
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,300
What did you say?

270
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,810
You're a proud brother?

271
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,730
To our knowledge, Phupha
had a fight with other students

272
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,430
at the old stadium where
any entry was prohibited.

273
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,135
From the reporting I received,
the fight wasn't that violent.

274
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,079
But it seems like

275
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,810
there was an accident.

276
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,650
The person who found him
said Phupha drowned in the pool.

277
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,663
That may be the reason why
he's in such a serious condition.

278
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,290
On behalf of the school,
please accept our condolences.

279
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,250
Nonetheless, there's
nothing we can do about this.

280
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,129
On another note, when Phupha was found,

281
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,446
he clutched this in his hand.

282
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:55,200
In any case, I wish
his treatment goes well.

283
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,243
After that, everything went quiet.

284
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,209
Please. Help me. Please.

285
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,039
The school took no responsibility.

286
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,994
No lawyer would take the case.

287
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,726
His dad spent every penny on his treatment.

288
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,930
In the end, his dad was in debt

289
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,898
and had to shut down the factory.

290
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,930
Isn't that disgusting?
We know that it's F4.

291
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,289
But no matter how sure we are,

292
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,770
there's no evidence.

293
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,088
So I used Phupha's information

294
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,210
to fake my way into the school.

295
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,930
Unfortunately, it looked
like I came too late.

296
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,050
Everything was wrapped
up like nothing had happened.

297
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,358
All the files were deleted. No
red card was given anymore.

298
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,570
But even without evidence,

299
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,079
it doesn't mean no one hates F4.

300
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,183
(I hate F4 so damn much.)

301
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,251
It doesn't mean no one hates F4.

302
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,129
(Screwdriver: It's time to gather.)

303
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,105
Bit by bit, I started gathering
people who hated F4.

304
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,999
It's not easy

305
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,490
but I finally found a group
of like-minded people.

306
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,450
The people who know
that this is the only way

307
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,370
to punish F4 for all
the things they'd done.

308
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,088
And that day has arrived.

309
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,237
But you know what?

310
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:40,000
The one who got away was you, Gorya.

311
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,847
You used to be against them.

312
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,970
You should have been the
one who stood up to fight.

313
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,610
Look at you now.

314
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,610
You've forgiven them.

315
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,805
You've got close to them.

316
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,410
I don't know how Thyme duped you.

317
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,176
But enough already, Gorya.

318
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,580
You should have known better

319
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,210
how evil F4 was.

320
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,484
Can't you see? It's not too
late to change your mind.

321
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,850
Bring back that rage.

322
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,450
And come to our side.

323
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,130
I can't anymore! Let me go!

324
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,759
Why, Gorya?

325
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,528
After all this talk I just
gave, you still don't get it?

326
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,650
I get it.

327
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,730
I get everything that you said.

328
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,807
It's no surprise that you
want to get back at F4.

329
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,810
Regardless, this is not the right way.

330
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,156
I can never condone this behavior.

331
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,954
You can never condone this behavior?

332
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,805
Then tell me which other way there is.

333
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,763
Stop with your rose-colored glasses, Gorya.

334
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,499
With these guys who have
all the power in their hands,

335
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,850
there's no cure for them.

336
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,900
They are evil by nature.

337
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,509
There's no way they can change.

338
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,706
Really?

339
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,329
You've said they cannot change.

340
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,880
But is that true, Talay?

341
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,130
Who do you think you are?

342
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,918
You think you're the man?

343
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,917
Go ahead.

344
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,846
Go for it.

345
00:22:48,946 --> 00:22:50,150
Punch me.

346
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,020
Too afraid?

347
00:22:53,335 --> 00:22:54,555
Come on, punch me.

348
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,389
Go for it. Come on.

349
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,890
You want it, huh?

350
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,898
Hurry!

351
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:20,178
Ouch! Please don't hurt me.

352
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,479
What are you doing?

353
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,229
What are you trying
to pull? Get up! Get up!

354
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,330
Stop!

355
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,930
I'm so mad at myself.

356
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:35,210
If I'd looked closer, you
would never have fooled me.

357
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,050
I should have known better

358
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,050
that Thyme would never
bring back the red card.

359
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,166
And you, for your revenge,

360
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,779
you were willing to frame Thyme.

361
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,050
You made Thyme look bad in
everyone's view to justify your action.

362
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,559
I can never condone what you did.

363
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,745
So what?

364
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,850
In the end, what they had
done can't just go away.

365
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,379
They have to pay for
everything they had ever done.

366
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,890
They have to pay to you vigilantes?

367
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,477
Are you sure?

368
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,226
I don't know what to do.

369
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,247
But it's not this, Talay.

370
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,278
Trust me.

371
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,859
It's not too late for you
to change your mind.

372
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,210
If we brainstorm,

373
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,810
we may find a solution to this.

374
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,439
Don't fix your issue this way...

375
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,380
Argh!

376
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,810
How can I change my mind at this point?

377
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,050
This is nonsense.

378
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,640
Ultimately...

379
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,953
the ending is always the same, Gorya.

380
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,370
Let Gorya go. You have no right to do this.

381
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,370
Don't worry, P'Thyme.

382
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,378
I'm not going to hurt Gorya.

383
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,810
Unlike you.

384
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,650
You destroy people's lives.

385
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,650
What do you want?

386
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,250
The hurt we've all felt.

387
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,349
Got nothing to say?

388
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,770
At this point, are you not going to admit

389
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,568
that you're responsible
for this red card game.

390
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,190
The card that greenlights everyone
in the school to hurt the victim.

391
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,850
You use your family's wealth and
influence to cover up everything

392
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,850
so no one is held responsible.

393
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,639
Can you admit

394
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,837
that the person who allows
students to hurt each other is you?

395
00:26:26,494 --> 00:26:29,820
Yes, it's me.

396
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,650
The red card. The bullying.

397
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,982
It all comes from me.

398
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,783
That wasn't so hard.

399
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,276
Thyme.

400
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,738
Stop it!

401
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,250
Stop it right now!

402
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:53,920
Is this what you want?

403
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,171
That's right.

404
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,763
Seeing Mr. Akira on the floor

405
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,569
makes me so happy.

406
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,599
You're the man, aren't you?

407
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,969
Come on, hotshot.

408
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,329
Talay.

409
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,420
Stop it!

410
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,290
Talay, tell them to stop.

411
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,140
Stop!

412
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:11,939
Tell them to stop right now.

413
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,456
Argh!

414
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,610
Stop?

415
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,810
You should stop talking, Gorya.

416
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,708
As soon as Thyme got here,

417
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,810
you're no longer of use.

418
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:29,530
What you can do now is watch it together.

419
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,770
How's that, Gorya? Isn't
it such a beautiful sight?

420
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,639
Is this really what you want?

421
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,105
Of course it is.

422
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:42,039
Don't you get it? Oh, how
long have I wanted to see this...

423
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,010
It's beautiful.

424
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:49,565
Unfortunately, this
cannot be on social media.

425
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,996
Enough. This is so not you.

426
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,090
Stop fooling yourself.

427
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,370
I'm not fooling anyone now, Gorya.

428
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,980
I was fooling you earlier.

429
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,690
The Talay you saw was a fake.

430
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,461
All fake.

431
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,185
That's not true. You're not a bad person.

432
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:19,691
If you were, Phupha wouldn't love you.

433
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:37,066
From what you told me, I
could feel that he trusted you.

434
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,281
Because he knows

435
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,405
that deep down you're a good person.

436
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:55,610
I can feel it myself. No matter
how bad you're behaving,

437
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,610
you're a kind person at heart.

438
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:06,029
Deep down you don't
want to do all this, do you?

439
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,440
Therefore, right now...

440
00:29:12,435 --> 00:29:13,942
Gorya!

441
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,730
You talk too much. It's annoying.

442
00:29:20,995 --> 00:29:22,405
What should we do next?

443
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,530
Should we take care of
her next so she'll shut up?

444
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,770
Ouch! What?

445
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,850
When did I tell you to do that?

446
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,170
You don't understand nothing.

447
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,970
Don't want to do this? Good person?

448
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,216
Let me ask you this.

449
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,530
When do you think I'm the happiest?

450
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,130
It's right now.

451
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,170
Don't.

452
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,370
Talay, stop!

453
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,669
This is gratifying.

454
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,719
Now you can shut up.

455
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,370
You can never understand me.

456
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,917
Why are you so quiet, Thyme?

457
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,290
Aren't you going to say something?

458
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,890
You can stop.

459
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,591
What a wimp!

460
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,450
Is this all it takes to break you?

461
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,138
You can stop.

462
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,268
If you don't want to do it, just don't.

463
00:31:11,611 --> 00:31:13,001
Is this

464
00:31:14,777 --> 00:31:16,501
the face of a happy person?

465
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,653
Shut up!

466
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,898
Talay, stop. Are you going to kill him?

467
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,040
Don't worry.

468
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,016
I won't die easily.

469
00:31:53,657 --> 00:31:57,321
Thyme, why aren't you defending yourself?

470
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:00,285
Fight him back.

471
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,894
Silly girl,

472
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,076
if I fight back, I'll lose.

473
00:32:22,463 --> 00:32:25,483
Shut up! Just shut up!

474
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:26,930
Stop.

475
00:32:26,931 --> 00:32:30,250
Not another word!

476
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,590
That's enough

477
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,890
or Thyme will die.

478
00:32:45,857 --> 00:32:47,281
Die, huh?

479
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,168
That's it.

480
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,037
If you die, I may feel better.

481
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,566
Talay, don't! Don't!

482
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,584
Don't! Don't!

483
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,690
Die!

484
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:52,006
Talay, you can stop.

485
00:33:56,354 --> 00:33:57,739
You can stop now.

486
00:34:04,017 --> 00:34:05,197
Gorya.

487
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:08,532
Gorya.

488
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,410
Gorya hasn't woken up yet.

489
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,410
Yes. Mmm.

490
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,810
Kavin, Gorya is awake. I have to go.

491
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:57,396
Hey, was I out?

492
00:34:57,981 --> 00:35:01,065
Yes. Everyone was so worried.

493
00:35:02,035 --> 00:35:03,737
You were out for days.

494
00:35:07,677 --> 00:35:09,142
Does it still hurt?

495
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,394
I've got a little headache but I'm fine.

496
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,781
Do you know how the whole thing is going?

497
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,449
Thyme? He was hurt more badly than me.

498
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:33,684
Thyme...

499
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,057
Gorya! Wait up!

500
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,716
Where is Mr. Akira Paramaanantra staying?

501
00:35:42,855 --> 00:35:44,736
- Room 415.
- Thanks.

502
00:36:22,851 --> 00:36:24,441
Is this true?

503
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,804
Are you playing a prank?

504
00:36:29,198 --> 00:36:31,196
I'm not amused.

505
00:36:40,695 --> 00:36:43,629
Jerk! Wake up.

506
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,250
How can you do this to me?

507
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,105
You can't just leave me like this.

508
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:56,198
I haven't told you since
the first day we met

509
00:36:58,023 --> 00:37:00,516
how I hate you.

510
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,092
I have a lot of bad words to call you.

511
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,610
And I haven't told you

512
00:37:15,509 --> 00:37:17,388
that I love you.

513
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:27,339
Why do you do this?

514
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,410
How can you do this to me?

515
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,570
Alright, with the power of

516
00:37:42,483 --> 00:37:44,658
"I love you"...

517
00:37:45,808 --> 00:37:48,689
P'Thyme has been revived from his death.

518
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,300
Let's drink a toast.

519
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:52,515
Cheers!

520
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,800
I didn't come up with this...

521
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:58,509
- Was it funny to you?
- Ouch! That hurts.

522
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,430
- You might as well be dead.
- That hurts. I've still got wounds. Stop.

523
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,949
Be gentle.

524
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,589
You too!

525
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,499
MJ, help!

526
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,200
Don't!

527
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,199
Hey, stop.

528
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,714
Aren't you glad that I'm OK?

529
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,137
But I'm so glad

530
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,634
that you told me you loved me.

531
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,692
And...

532
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,945
I love you...

533
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,219
Is this the time to be romantic?

534
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,690
That hurts! Look at my wounds.

535
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,810
Gorya, take it easy.

536
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,890
You want it?

537
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,060
Kaning, come here! Kaning!

538
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,250
Hit him!

539
00:39:11,304 --> 00:39:12,704
See you.

540
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:13,809
See you later, Kaning.

541
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:15,840
Drive carefully.

542
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,250
What's next?

543
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,045
Glad this is over.

544
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,250
I'll see you later.

545
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,890
Chipmunk, how are you getting home?

546
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,425
The bus stop is right there.

547
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:40,843
By the way, have you been in a sports car?

548
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,812
The seatbelt is there.

549
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,830
Oh.

550
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,090
You haven't been in
this kind of car, have you?

551
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,735
I have no idea what is where.

552
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,957
I can't understand why people
love these expensive cars.

553
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:10,869
You're the only one who is this tense.

554
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,770
How about this?

555
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:21,050
If you want to know what's
cool about this car, I'll show you.

556
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,810
You...

557
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:34,193
How cool was that, huh?

558
00:40:37,516 --> 00:40:39,706
I thought I'd never get home.

559
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,729
How could you not?

560
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,379
I told you I'd get you home.

561
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:49,490
But if it's the usual
way, it's not F4, right?

562
00:40:57,379 --> 00:40:59,911
I got you this. Can you make sense of it?

563
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,681
(Garland patterns of Taemiyaklin Kittiyangkul)
I got you this. Can you make sense of it?

564
00:41:02,705 --> 00:41:05,216
These are the patterns
my grandmother keeps.

565
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:07,280
The ones I told you I'd give to you.

566
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,610
Wow, they look so classy.

567
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,970
I can never find these patterns on the net.

568
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,204
Of course.

569
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:19,082
These are the Taemiyaklin
Kittiyangkul garden patterns.

570
00:41:19,187 --> 00:41:20,848
Of course, my lord.

571
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,490
But it must be very difficult to make.

572
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:31,050
You're very skilled. I can help advise you.

573
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:40,130
Thank you, Kavin, for remembering
these little details we talked about.

574
00:41:40,485 --> 00:41:42,895
I'll show you a finished product.

575
00:41:43,557 --> 00:41:44,817
See you later.

576
00:41:51,413 --> 00:41:55,243
Kaning, please look after Gorya.

577
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,086
She's just been through a tough time.

578
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,850
Don't know what is in store for her next.

579
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,574
I know that already.

580
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,850
But you said it like it was not over.

581
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:06,661
It's just a general concern.

582
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,690
(Kavin: What's our next move?)

583
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,250
(Thyme: Soon.)

584
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,210
(Thyme: I have a favor to ask.)

585
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,770
(Emergency)

586
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,720
(Boonyawej Hospital: Patient Information)

587
00:42:48,603 --> 00:42:51,861
I'm at the hospital. Yes.

588
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,076
I found Phupha.

589
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,850
Just hurry.

590
00:43:04,244 --> 00:43:05,844
What are you trying to do?

591
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,258
After what happened, the four of us talked.

592
00:43:13,762 --> 00:43:18,306
And we agreed that the whole
thing was caused by our past.

593
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,810
Thyme decided to find all the victims

594
00:43:25,496 --> 00:43:26,933
and apologize.

595
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,129
Apologize?

596
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,690
Yes, and Phupha is on that list.

597
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:39,323
You know that what you're doing is selfish.

598
00:43:39,777 --> 00:43:42,867
Why? Do you want redemption?

599
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,905
You think any of the
victims will forgive you?

600
00:44:17,247 --> 00:44:18,772
You may not believe it.

601
00:44:20,603 --> 00:44:23,323
But Phupha was the last one.

602
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,196
Damn it!

603
00:44:37,243 --> 00:44:38,403
Talay.

604
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,026
Since Thyme met Gorya,

605
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,730
he has changed.

606
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:48,217
I couldn't believe how much
Thyme has changed either.

607
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,683
I understand how frustrated you must feel.

608
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,354
But let the whole thing

609
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,477
end the way it's supposed to.

610
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,426
End how it's supposed to?

611
00:45:05,779 --> 00:45:09,068
I had to go all vigilante on you all

612
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,379
because I knew there's no
way it could end the normal way.

613
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:17,477
And now you're asking to
end it the way it's supposed to?

614
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:23,970
Do you know what the
supposed-to ending looks like?

615
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,715
to cover up everything

616
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,090
so no one is held responsible.

617
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,490
Can you admit

618
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:37,347
that the person who allows
students to hurt each other is you?

619
00:45:40,837 --> 00:45:43,867
Yes, it's me.

620
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:49,170
The red card. The bullying.

621
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,809
(Confession! Thyme Akira started
the red card game #exposingThymeF4)

622
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:53,568
It all comes from me.

623
00:45:55,947 --> 00:45:57,646
The way it's supposed to end

624
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,929
is to expose all the
trash you had ever done

625
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:02,329
for the world to see.

626
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:06,650
And the rest is to admit
your guilt in every case.

627
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:09,331
Can you do it?

628
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:10,824
Wait.

629
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,530
Don't worry. I've prepared everything.

630
00:46:16,557 --> 00:46:18,707
Even with the power you have,

631
00:46:18,732 --> 00:46:20,932
you can't go on living
your comfortable lives.

632
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,316
I promise you.

633
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:26,690
All is left to do is to press 'share'.

634
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,879
And tell Thyme

635
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:33,153
if he wants this to end,

636
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,450
I'll upload everything and turn myself in.

637
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:40,623
I'll face up to all my wrongdoings.

638
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:42,227
It's fair.

639
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,290
This is how it's supposed to be.

640
00:46:49,203 --> 00:46:50,885
Have you thought this through?

641
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:54,705
Listen.

642
00:46:55,610 --> 00:47:01,210
I understand now that
revenge is the wrong thing to do.

643
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,208
The problem should be fixed at the root.

644
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:09,970
I don't know how the red card started.

645
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:14,809
Sometimes, you have
to give them a red card.

646
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,130
But if the root cause gets away with it,

647
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,130
bad things will keep on happening.

648
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:37,013
So own up to your wrongdoings

649
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,090
and let everything end

650
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,210
before it's too late.

651
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:46,910
Let me go! Let me go!

652
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,329
Let me go! I'm telling you to let me go!

653
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:54,010
Let me go!

654
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:00,569
Why did you take me here? Who ordered you?

655
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:01,939
Is it Thyme's mother?

656
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,410
Answer me!

657
00:48:09,537 --> 00:48:13,815
I told you to bring her here
and you abducted her again?

658
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:14,995
Normally, you would...

659
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,500
Stop!

660
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:18,264
Just leave.

661
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,410
Why did you take me here?

662
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:36,490
I'm sorry. I have something to tell you.

663
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,570
What is it?

664
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,288
Listen to me carefully.

665
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:49,465
Ren met with Talay today.

666
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:55,250
Talay said he'd post
everything about the red card...

667
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,306
(Confession! Thyme Akira
started the red card game.)

668
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,160
on social media.

669
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,600
(exposingThymeF4)
on social media.

670
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:01,306
It will be big news.

671
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:04,519
Once it's news,

672
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,010
Talay wants me to admit it

673
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,930
and accept any punishment
the way it should be.

674
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:15,330
I don't know what will happen.

675
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:18,001
But if I agree,

676
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,330
my life won't be the same.

677
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,066
- Is this true?
- Quiet!

678
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:25,829
This is a big deal.

679
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,519
I know it is.

680
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:29,236
Keep it down.

681
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,370
What will you do?

682
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:38,410
I've made my decision.

683
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,732
and let everything end

684
00:49:41,857 --> 00:49:43,667
before it's too late.

685
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:48,850
Thyme, what are you doing?

686
00:49:53,603 --> 00:49:55,923
Are you going to destroy
evidence like you've always done?

687
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,259
It's no use because I...

688
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,890
Since that day, I've been thinking

689
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:06,290
if there's even one person
who doesn't forgive us,

690
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,290
what should I do?

691
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,246
I heard what you discussed.

692
00:50:12,748 --> 00:50:14,327
Are you going to post it tonight?

693
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:17,330
No need.

694
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,071
Let it end right here right now.

695
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:36,940
That's why I wanted to see you.

696
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:39,670
I wanted to apologize. I wanted...

697
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:43,364
Thyme, do you have any
idea what you've done?

698
00:50:46,737 --> 00:50:47,994
I do.

699
00:50:51,997 --> 00:50:53,783
But I don't know what's
happening right now.

700
00:50:59,426 --> 00:51:02,746
And you... uploaded everything,

701
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,384
like everything?

702
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:12,290
From what I saw, there are
clips with #exposingThymeF4.

703
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,960
(#exposingThymeF4)

704
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:17,577
So? Did it break the internet?

705
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,130
(No results for "#exposingThymeF4")

706
00:51:22,127 --> 00:51:23,862
There's nothing.

707
00:51:25,089 --> 00:51:26,581
Did you get it wrong?

708
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,219
How can there not be anything?

709
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,604
I pressed the button myself.

710
00:51:29,815 --> 00:51:31,857
Did you type my name wrong?

711
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,050
I'm not you.

712
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,062
Or...

713
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:52,636
Hello, Gorya.

714
00:51:53,129 --> 00:51:55,179
I have a lot to talk to you about.

715
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,130
Hope it's OK to do it in a voice message.

716
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,170
I'm sorry for the whole thing.

717
00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:06,286
Since what happened that day,

718
00:52:07,161 --> 00:52:09,650
you've made me figure out a lot of things.

719
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:12,089
It must be true

720
00:52:12,114 --> 00:52:15,848
deep down I didn't want to do any of that.

721
00:52:16,186 --> 00:52:17,457
That's why...

722
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,290
I've decided to call off my revenge on F4.

723
00:52:23,295 --> 00:52:25,858
Thank you for helping me figure this out.

724
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:28,870
Oh, and tell Thyme,

725
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:33,891
next time before sharing
any post, look carefully

726
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,363
if it's set for 'only me'.

727
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,170
That's all. Thanks again, Gorya.

728
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:47,620
I wish you the best.

729
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:55,027
That's a relief.

730
00:52:55,329 --> 00:52:56,811
Only me?

731
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:03,241
Am I not being punished?

732
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:05,619
No duh!

733
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,810
Keep it down.

734
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,250
You are frustrating.

735
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:33,263
So you're not going to prosecute

736
00:53:33,831 --> 00:53:35,629
any of the workers who tried to cheat you?

737
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,960
Trust my dad.

738
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,805
He's a good judge of character.

739
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,490
He said apologies would be sufficient.

740
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,850
That's nuts. If any wrongdoing
could end with an apology,

741
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,530
all the police would have no job.

742
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,450
Talay,

743
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,319
you know what?

744
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,450
You talk like a comic I
used to read when I was little.

745
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,002
Don't tease me.

746
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,970
But I do think so, Talay.

747
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,370
If a person who has done wrong

748
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,530
is ready and willing to change,

749
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,100
I'll forgive him.

750
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:32,730
You came within a hair's breadth
of losing everything, you know?

751
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,730
I know.

752
00:55:36,182 --> 00:55:38,342
The fact that you've come
out the other side unscathed

753
00:55:38,596 --> 00:55:41,217
doesn't mean you can live
your life any way you want.

754
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:43,610
I know.

755
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,610
I feel guilty about everything I'd done.

756
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,930
But don't worry. I'll do everything

757
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:01,930
to fix and repair what had happened.

758
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:12,970
I'll be better for you to see. Just watch.

759
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,436
No matter what you will face from now on,

760
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,170
I'll be there for you.

761
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,350
Thank you.

762
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,274
My plan is messed up though.

763
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:44,329
What plan?

764
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,713
Well, I might as well. Come with me.

765
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,719
- What?
- Just come with me.

766
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,079
Where?

767
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,819
What is it?

768
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:58,849
I've got something to show you.

769
00:56:58,850 --> 00:56:59,961
What?

770
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:04,690
Wow, a telescope?

771
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,690
You have this kind of thing?

772
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,530
Why? There's nothing I can't have.

773
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,249
That's true.

774
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,610
What do you want me to do?

775
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,890
Take a look.

776
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:24,819
Where?

777
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,269
There's nothing.

778
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,441
Hold on.

779
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:35,605
Wow, is that meteor rain?

780
00:57:35,794 --> 00:57:39,566
Yes, I checked and found
there's meteor rain tonight.

781
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,850
It's strange.

782
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,259
I never thought

783
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,757
the day I thought my
life would change forever

784
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:51,736
would be the day we saw the meteor rain.

785
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,233
It seems like there's a meaning behind it.

786
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:57,269
True.

787
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:02,070
You like?

788
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,970
I do.

789
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:06,970
I've never used anything like this before.

790
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,338
Beautiful.

791
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:17,050
Unfortunately, it doesn't last forever.

792
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:22,899
You...

793
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,621
Is it that funny?

794
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,657
It will last forever.

795
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,699
Look.

796
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,522
I had it made especially for you.

797
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:58,610
(GoryaThyme)

798
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:08,450
At first, I wanted it to be the
symbol of me if I went away.

799
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:12,090
I didn't know for how long
my punishment would be.

800
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:18,222
Now that things have turned out this way,

801
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,007
I'll just say it right here.

802
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,097
I love you, Gorya.

803
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:30,810
I really do.

804
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,072
My love is not fleeting.

805
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,210
I'll love you forever.

806
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,290
Please be my girlfriend.

807
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,170
The Secret Story of Iris

808
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:27,329
After that day, I would come here so often

809
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:29,090
that I became a regular.

810
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:33,690
And... I started to feel
like I belonged in this place.

811
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:44,970
Come on. We've won. Let's
order some KFC to celebrate.

812
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,130
KFC delivery is here.

813
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:52,019
Your order is complete.

814
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,010
Thank you for using our KFC service.

815
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,219
Are you going to buy a
meal every time we win?

816
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:01,699
Of course.

817
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,779
After a win, we deserve to celebrate.

818
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:07,290
We compete, we win,
and we celebrate together.

819
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:09,639
When we compete, there's only three...

820
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:13,259
But if only just a few people
eat, that's not a celebration.

821
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,890
A celebration must be big. Right?

822
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,090
Ew! Look!

823
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:25,050
Let's get out of here.

824
01:01:30,528 --> 01:01:33,566
I freaking hate the students
of this high-class school.

825
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:42,250
That's why I was afraid
to tell them who I was.

826
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,530
I heard you're a hotshot around here.

827
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:59,094
I want a match.

828
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,309
Want to do it?

829
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:07,259
We can beat them.

830
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,730
All I could think was I
wanted to beat them.

831
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:15,210
But I never thought what
changes the match would bring.

832
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:23,330
So Lita hasn't picked
up your calls, has she?

833
01:02:23,549 --> 01:02:26,739
We will go over to her
house to see her. OK?

834
01:02:26,924 --> 01:02:27,885
OK.

835
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:31,484
You know how love is a delicate thing,

836
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:35,130
let alone a love triangle.

837
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:37,129
You're not hiding...

838
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:38,859
What is this?

839
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,810
or betraying me, are you?

840
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:43,290
You force me to do this.
