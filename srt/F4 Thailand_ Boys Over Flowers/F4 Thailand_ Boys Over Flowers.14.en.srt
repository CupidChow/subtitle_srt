1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,689
I had it made especially for you.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,130
I love you, Gorya.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,930
Please be my girlfriend.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,849
(Kavin)

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,659
You did very well today.

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,899
What a surprise.

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,079
I have many more surprises for you.

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,749
I have a surprise too.

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,570
Gorya, let's go somewhere else.

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,650
What happens?

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,929
Has my order been taken care of?

12
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,250
All done, madam.

13
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,970
Mr. Thyme,

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,530
something bad is happening.

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,749
Stop! What are you doing?

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,969
Hey, where are you going?

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,479
This is my house.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,779
You can't do this to my house.

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,850
Hey, you can't go inside.

20
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,679
Please. Please don't do this.

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,829
This is my house.

22
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,929
I have no idea what's going on.

23
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,650
Calm down.

24
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,079
We're just following an order.

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,210
They told us to destroy. We must destroy.

26
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,210
Who gave you that order?

27
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,370
I'm sorry but...

28
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,530
this land now belongs to the Parama Group.

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,161
(This land is in the possession of the Parama Group.
Tresspassers will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.)

30
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,010
What is this about?

31
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,719
You can't do this.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,970
We have valid documents
to justfy this action.

33
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,140
This is between the landowner and Madam.

34
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,930
Hello.

35
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,500
I have a story I'd like to share with you.

36
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,170
I've just finished a project in Singapore.

37
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,730
So I've come back to Thailand
to work from here for a while.

38
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,610
If you want to have a
meal, talk, or negotiate,

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,450
you are most welcome at
the Paramaanantra's house.

40
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,610
Gorya will not negotiate with you, Mother.

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,369
You have gone way too far this time.

42
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,279
What did Gorya do to deserve this attack?

43
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,779
Attack? I just bought myself a
piece of real estate like always.

44
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,759
You're still not admitting that
what you're doing is wrong?

45
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,770
I haven't broken a single law.

46
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,439
When are you going to understand

47
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,979
that this is how the game
works in the business world?

48
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,650
Haven't I taught you well?

49
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,879
Stop making everything about your business.

50
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,729
This is someone's house. There are memories

51
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,789
and people living in it.

52
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,530
Stop playing the game!

53
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,530
Thyme,

54
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,570
this world is a board game
that wagers on people's lives.

55
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,570
It's no different than the
red card game you played.

56
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,809
I've given Gorya the red card.

57
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,490
If you think you can stop it,

58
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,250
show me.

59
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,161
(This land is in the possession of the Parama Group.
Tresspassers will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.)

60
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,639
Damn it!

61
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,099
I'm so pissed off.

62
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,009
I would be too.

63
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,089
Your mom has gone so extreme this time.

64
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,939
I don't know what she's thinking.

65
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,450
Yeah. You having a girlfriend

66
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,969
doesn't deserve this kind of treatment.

67
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,410
No. You know what is most important to her.

68
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,540
Oh oh.

69
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,050
The Parama Group prepares to
launch a new hub next year.

70
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,810
The young son Akira will hold the reign.

71
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,739
An expansion this size...

72
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,890
I think your mom wants you to get to work.

73
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,890
She's racing against time.

74
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,290
I freaking hate it when my
mom does something like this.

75
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,219
Thyme, your mom doesn't
come to play this time.

76
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,210
My family just called and
told me to hurry home.

77
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,370
This means that all of
us F4 are being watched.

78
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,290
But don't worry about us.

79
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,360
Worry about Gorya.

80
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,029
Why aren't you with her right now?

81
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,330
I wanted to but she said she
wanted to be with Kaning.

82
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,730
Don't you know her by now?

83
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,730
Even if she doesn't want to trouble you,

84
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,330
the only person who gets
her the most is you.

85
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,570
Tell us what you want to do.

86
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,650
We're ready to help.

87
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,319
I'm so frustrated. What's
wrong with these people?

88
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,689
Just because they have money and power,

89
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,370
they think they can do whatever they want.

90
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,420
It's good that you managed to
get something out of the house.

91
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,410
What are you going to do next?

92
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,170
If she does this

93
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,170
to keep me away from Thyme,

94
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,090
I just can't accept it.

95
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,730
Sorry for making you worried.

96
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,010
Gorya,

97
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,090
you know you're up against
someone with real power, right?

98
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,090
I want her to know

99
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,090
that her power

100
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,970
can never bring me down.

101
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,050
In that case, follow me.

102
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,690
I don't have any use for this room.
It's been vacant for a while.

103
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,050
You can stay here.

104
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,279
Don't worry about money.

105
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,010
I will pay you every month.

106
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,079
But Uncle Ga, you can't just give me money.

107
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,090
No worries.

108
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,460
Do you see me as only your employer?

109
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,610
I feel like you're my family.

110
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,410
I can't just leave you fighting all alone.

111
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,339
Fight for me too.

112
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,959
At least it'd make someone who
lives hand to mouth like me

113
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,739
see that a small person

114
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,490
can fight a big bad wolf.

115
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,290
This is no longer about you only.

116
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,839
Nicely put, Kaning.

117
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,370
So, guys, come on in.

118
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,139
Furniture's here.

119
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,970
I can guarantee that you will
live comfortably, My Lady.

120
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,149
Let's put everything in place.

121
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,650
What are you guys doing here?

122
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,650
The four of us are helping you fight.

123
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,530
With us here,

124
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,410
it's like you have an army to
lay some 'lactics' for you.

125
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,250
Stop, don't be stubborn this time.

126
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,579
I've thought this through, Gorya.

127
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,010
The four of us will be your force.

128
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,239
We want to help you.

129
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,780
Let's fight together.

130
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,250
Fine, let's... turn this into a bedroom.

131
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,400
Yay!

132
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,850
What are we going to do after this?

133
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,730
No idea.

134
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,730
One thing is certain,
I won't be home for a while.

135
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,170
I'll be staying at Ren's condo.

136
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,939
There's no point talking
to Mother right now.

137
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,170
Are you going to be a burden to Ren?

138
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,580
If it's too much, don't force it. OK?

139
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,570
I'm not forcing anything. I'm chill.

140
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,530
You... promise me

141
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,730
you won't fight alone from now on.

142
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,370
OK, from now on,

143
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,850
I'll call you to fight
with every day. Happy?

144
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,490
Get to work. Come on.

145
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,250
Thyme, do you think...

146
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,850
there will be a day when your
mom gives us her blessing?

147
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,260
I have no clue.

148
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,250
But I believe

149
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,810
that if all of us are here together,

150
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,370
we can keep fighting no matter how long.

151
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,250
Let's watch and see who will
give up first, me or Mother.

152
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,530
You know,

153
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,570
I'd been feeling so discouraged all day.

154
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,559
But when everyone came together,

155
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,860
it gave me so much strength.

156
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,330
Thank you.

157
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,330
So...

158
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,970
do you want any more support?

159
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,879
Perv, no!

160
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,899
Is there anything else inside your brain?

161
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,209
It's not like that.

162
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,379
Is this the only thing you can think about?

163
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,930
No, I'm just teasing you.

164
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,570
Just teasing?

165
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,970
Not really.

166
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,511
Wow, I'm so proud of our little Thyme.

167
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:05,510
He's all grown up.

168
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:07,550
Every time, you jerks!

169
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,569
- Show up at the worst moment.
- So romantic.

170
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,739
Wait a sec.

171
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,250
Stop right now! Why are
you doing this to me?

172
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,210
Where are you going?

173
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:21,050
If the world was a board
game as Thyme's mom said,

174
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,770
we would be the worst players.

175
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,660
It doesn't mean that we are weak.

176
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,170
We can always hope.

177
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,479
I don't know...

178
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,210
Even if we are so tired today,

179
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,850
I believe

180
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:50,290
that tomorrow we will wake up
to a dream that comes true.

181
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,130
Get that shirt. Pat it down.

182
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,160
Tete, Gorya's ones too.

183
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,189
Do it right.

184
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,690
It's been 30 years that
you've worked here, Yupin.

185
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,010
A loyal employee...

186
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,490
Such a shame that she
will have to leave one day

187
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:28,090
just because she doesn't know her duty.

188
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,000
(Maytee O Garden)

189
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,530
Be careful!

190
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,299
Hey, what are you doing here so early?

191
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,329
Why are you working so early?
You always make me worried.

192
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,549
Uncle Ga has given me a
big allowance in advance.

193
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,049
So I'm planning to work twice as hard.

194
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,450
OK.

195
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,130
But please be careful
while you're hard at work.

196
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,639
Don't do this anymore. I'll do it.
Come down.

197
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,779
No, I'll do it.

198
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,380
Come on down. Now.

199
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,950
What?

200
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,689
You should leave this kind
of work to tall people.

201
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,539
Go on. Do something else.

202
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,129
Fine.

203
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,160
Give me the cloth.

204
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,810
Help yourself to what's inside the jacket.
I got it for you.

205
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,540
(Take care of yourself.
From your boyfriend)

206
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,730
You spell everything correctly.

207
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,290
Thank you, my boyfriend.

208
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,690
Go on. Go on.

209
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,200
Hello.

210
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,410
Are you available? I'm
outside at the moment.

211
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,210
Outside? At this moment?

212
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,210
Yes,

213
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,210
I got fired by Madam.

214
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,010
Let's find somewhere to talk.

215
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,740
I have something very
important to talk to you.

216
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,570
What's the matter, Thyme?

217
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,210
I just talked to Auntie Yu.

218
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,170
My mom fired her.

219
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,170
Why did she do that?

220
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,450
What is it?

221
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,490
You know your mother can do anything.

222
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,730
She fired Auntie Yu because she knew

223
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,450
how important Auntie Yu was to you both.

224
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,050
What does it mean?

225
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,130
This is far from over.

226
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,789
What's going on? Why do you look so pale?

227
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,490
Big trouble. My friend at the bank told me.

228
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,379
Frozen? Can you please check this card?

229
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,890
Thyme's bank accounts have been frozen.

230
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,169
In the business world, there are rumors

231
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,530
that Thyme is about to be
disowned by his mother.

232
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,170
She has never played hardball
at this level before.

233
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,370
What about you three?

234
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,949
We are fine. So we wanted to see you and...

235
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,139
Help!

236
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,850
Help! Stop! Get out of my shop!

237
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,049
Who are you? Why are you
messing with my shop?

238
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,490
- This is no longer your shop.
- Don't go inside.

239
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,650
Uncle Ga!

240
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,530
Stop!

241
00:17:21,064 --> 00:17:22,064
Uncle Ga!

242
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,250
Gorya!

243
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,090
Get out of here.

244
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,730
- Stop!
- Don't pay them any attention.

245
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,550
Get out!

246
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,890
Kaning, what's wrong?

247
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,210
My dad... has suddenly got fired.

248
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,180
Just now.

249
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,210
What do we do, Thyme?

250
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,010
Don't waver?

251
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,490
(Don't waver, Mr. Thyme.)

252
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,730
What Madam is doing

253
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,570
will hurt you and Gorya for sure.

254
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,860
But don't waver.

255
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,610
Please remember.

256
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,349
Every time you do the right thing,

257
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,410
something has to be traded off.

258
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,201
(Notice - Land in possession
of the Parama Group)

259
00:18:49,225 --> 00:18:52,290
I ask you to use all the hurt to power you.

260
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,650
The more Madam hurts Gorya,

261
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,170
Gorya!

262
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,090
The more fuel it will be for Gorya.

263
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,020
Hey, you can't go in there.

264
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,379
You've come quicker than I anticipated.

265
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,490
Would you like to have a rest first?

266
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,210
On the way here, I kept thinking about

267
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,210
how to beat you.

268
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,650
But I admit

269
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,810
that you're clever.

270
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,770
There is no way I can beat you.

271
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,620
Does it mean that you
have an answer in mind?

272
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,770
Yes, I've made up my mind.

273
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,450
I will get out of Thyme's life

274
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,370
in exchange for giving back
the lives of everyone I love.

275
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,130
You seem to understand things
easier than I thought you would.

276
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,029
Does it mean that...

277
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,970
But even if I lose,

278
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,250
Thyme will win.

279
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,810
How?

280
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,570
Honestly, since the first time we met,

281
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,610
I'd always thought you
reminded me of someone.

282
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,450
And I realized that you're
very similar to Thyme,

283
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,730
but it's Thyme back in the old days,

284
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,730
Thyme who would do everything to win

285
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,490
without any regard to
how he gets his victory.

286
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,490
But Thyme has changed.

287
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,410
He's met a lot of people.

288
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,610
He's learned about humanity.

289
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,629
He's gained more understanding about lives.

290
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,490
If I fight, I'll lose.

291
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,770
He has become someone who
hates how you do business.

292
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,850
He will never be what you want.

293
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,690
Even if we don't end up
together as a couple,

294
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,690
Thyme will never love you.

295
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,010
It's no surprise

296
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,780
how things have always revolved around you.

297
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,250
You're quite a wonder.

298
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,330
You have really changed Thyme.

299
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,010
But that's the point.

300
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,049
What are you talking about?

301
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,090
Before we continue this conversation,

302
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,490
I'd like to say that I will
compensate for everything.

303
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,490
I'm really sorry, Gorya, for all
the horrible things I've done.

304
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,379
But if I hadn't done those,

305
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,919
we wouldn't be talking right now.

306
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,050
I don't understand.

307
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:01,050
I have something very
important to tell you.

308
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,090
It affects Thyme's life directly.

309
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,759
Thyme, relax.

310
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,839
Have faith in Gorya.

311
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,970
A tough girl like Gorya will be fine.

312
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,850
Yes, I think things will get better.

313
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,570
Hello, Gorya. Where are you?

314
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,570
Did Mother do anything to you?

315
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,810
She didn't do anything to me.

316
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,810
But can you come out to meet me?

317
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,620
Gorya.

318
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,010
Why did you want to meet here?

319
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,250
What's wrong?

320
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,170
You've got a strange look on your face.

321
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,170
Is it because of my mother?

322
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,210
Well... what did she talk to you about?

323
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,970
Long story short,

324
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,970
I went to tell your mother

325
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,730
how you'd never be OK with her behavior.

326
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,740
And?

327
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,370
And she understood.

328
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,050
She will not fight us anymore.

329
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,850
Are you tired?

330
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,490
No more risky business on your own.

331
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,050
OK?

332
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,250
It's getting late.

333
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,290
Why don't we hang out

334
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,290
before it gets too late?

335
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,690
OK but no more Ferris wheel.

336
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,210
Come on.

337
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:48,809
The same old world I built up

338
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:53,330
You've come in and shaken it up

339
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,949
Never thought I needed someone

340
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,779
Until you

341
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,429
I don't want to go back

342
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,810
Hey, what was going through your head?
I don't get it.

343
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,810
Why did you want to come back here?

344
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,379
Nothing.

345
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,370
I just wanted to.

346
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,970
Do you want me back on the Ferris wheel?

347
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,970
I'm not going to fall for it.

348
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
Hey.

349
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,389
Mmm?

350
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,650
Can I ask you something?

351
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,009
Have you ever thought about

352
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,170
what the future will look like?

353
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,840
My future?

354
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,380
Why do you ask?

355
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,530
You haven't thought about it.

356
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,530
Yes, I have.

357
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,730
I've thought about it all along.

358
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,730
I'll be running the Parama Group

359
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,010
with you by my side.

360
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,010
But I will not do what my mother does.

361
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,940
It's true what you said.

362
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,930
Thyme hates me so much right now.

363
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,250
But I can see a glimpse of hope in him.

364
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,450
It's not hard to imagine

365
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,610
how much he would like to
change the Parama Group.

366
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,610
If I were to guess, he would
probably reset everything.

367
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,370
The Parama Group will prioritize people,

368
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,370
not money.

369
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,770
You're the reason why I have this idea.

370
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,970
The Parama Group must change.

371
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,650
It will have a heart.

372
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,660
And I am certain that it will bring
a lot of business partners to us.

373
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,770
It will be very difficult.

374
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,770
There will be a lot of problems.

375
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,210
I am certain that Thyme is fully aware

376
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:17,540
that he's just a little
kid in the business world.

377
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:24,490
Most importantly, the Parama
Group now has too many enemies.

378
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,780
If he takes a management position soon,

379
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,930
the big players around him
will see him as someone naïve.

380
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,450
They will crush him with no hesitation.

381
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:45,500
The only way for him to
survive is that he needs time.

382
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,570
Time for him to turn
the enemies into allies,

383
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,180
to convince people to
believe in the new way.

384
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,250
I know it will be difficult
but I'm confident,

385
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,090
with you and F4 by my side,

386
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,090
we will make it.

387
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,530
Will your mother allow this?

388
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,530
She won't.

389
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,650
But... she will have to retire.

390
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,770
When that day comes,

391
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,890
I'll be ready.

392
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,130
And when that day comes,

393
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,810
that's when I hand him the reins.

394
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,130
But you won't do that.

395
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,810
It's not about whether I will or I won't.

396
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,130
What matters is how long it will take.

397
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,970
It could be 15 or 20 years.

398
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,170
But I do believe that my
chosen path for our business

399
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,530
will be a steadier more sustainable one.

400
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,530
Give me time and I will show you.

401
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:19,610
Until I can give up the
reins, Thyme's life right now

402
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,610
is hanging by a thread of a
little thing called 'time'.

403
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,690
And that's the point.

404
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,850
If things continue this way,

405
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,740
everything will crumble.

406
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,730
Why?

407
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,850
Because there is one thing

408
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,810
that Thyme doesn't know.

409
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,250
I think you probably know now

410
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,370
what I want you to do.

411
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,170
I think you probably know now

412
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,020
what I want you to do.

413
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,570
Hey.

414
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,940
Is what I'm telling you that boring?

415
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,930
No,

416
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,410
I'm just picturing along.

417
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,770
So cloudy today.

418
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:55,930
Yeah. It must rain soon.

419
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,530
There you go.

420
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,530
Come on, it's raining now.

421
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,610
What's the matter?

422
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,530
You'll get wet.

423
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:20,290
Thyme, I have something to tell you.

424
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,450
We should break up.

425
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,759
What's that?

426
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,690
I said... you and I

427
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,810
should break up.

428
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,810
What are you saying?

429
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,380
It's my mom again, right?

430
00:32:48,203 --> 00:32:49,239
No.

431
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,050
There's no way this comes from you.

432
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,249
Is she controlling you?

433
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,420
What did she do this time?

434
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,359
Who else will she hurt?

435
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,170
She just gave me a piece of paper.

436
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,010
What paper?

437
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,010
Huh? What paper?

438
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,540
What paper?

439
00:33:16,313 --> 00:33:17,319
Tell me!

440
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,370
It's a check.

441
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,050
A big fat check.

442
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,730
What you're looking at is
my medical test results.

443
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,420
I have terminal cancer.

444
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,410
You could understand, right, Gorya?

445
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:42,930
Teenagers such as yourself need
time to cultivate their ideology.

446
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,930
But the adult world waits for no one.

447
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,450
If I die right now,

448
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,369
everything will be ruined,

449
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,410
the company, family.

450
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,730
Most importantly, Thyme's
whole life will be ruined.

451
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,170
I can't have that.

452
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,930
The only way that Thyme will survive

453
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,900
is to force him to grow
up as fast as he can.

454
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,690
Bring back the old Thyme.

455
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,690
It's the only way the Parama
Group can continue without me.

456
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:41,130
And the only person who can change Thyme

457
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,570
is you, Gorya.

458
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,370
I know it's a big ask but...

459
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,370
I'm not asking as a CEO.

460
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:59,410
I'm asking as a dying mom.

461
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,890
Please tear him apart.

462
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,419
Bring back the old Thyme

463
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,970
who was cruel and cold-hearted.

464
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,490
There is no time to be a child seeing
the world through rose-colored glasses.

465
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,210
Save Thyme's life.

466
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,650
Please help.

467
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,820
What are you saying?

468
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,130
A check?

469
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,530
How many times do I have to repeat it?

470
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,530
You're saying

471
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,530
that she gives you money and you accept?

472
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,770
Do you think I'm an idiot?

473
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,650
Tell me the truth!

474
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,309
Tell me what she told you.
Just tell me and we can fix it.

475
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,450
There's nothing.

476
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,090
Your mother paid me

477
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,090
to end the relationship.

478
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,090
That's all it was, Thyme.

479
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,020
And I took that money.

480
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,090
You know

481
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,090
all my life

482
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,229
I never thought to see so much money.

483
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,570
Stop lying, Gorya.

484
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,980
This is not you.

485
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,629
The Gorya I know will
not take a single dime

486
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:47,050
no matter how much Mother offers.

487
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,530
Our love has never been about money, Gorya.

488
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,610
Never been about money, Thyme?

489
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:06,410
You... and your rose-colored glasses.

490
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,490
What are you saying?

491
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:27,200
You think your idea of Gorya is real?

492
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,490
On the first day we met,

493
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,490
when I talked back to you, kicked you,

494
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,740
stood up to you,

495
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,650
it's because I wanted you
to pay attention to me.

496
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,650
Because I know

497
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,469
that you're wealthy and stupid.

498
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,410
What the hell are you saying?

499
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:53,239
You're saying that what
has happened between us

500
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,730
is a lie?

501
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,919
How can it all be a lie?

502
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,370
Do you know how exhausting it is

503
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,810
to force myself to be with you?

504
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,260
To pretend I love you.

505
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,279
I was willing to give up everything

506
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,050
even let my house be destroyed.

507
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,439
And it pans out exactly
as I thought it would.

508
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,290
If we were together briefly,
the money wouldn't be great.

509
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,890
The more I lose, the more money I will get.

510
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,490
And everything has worked out.

511
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,530
And I can finally get out...

512
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:32,420
get out of this hellhole that we're in.

513
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,860
What is this?

514
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,490
Gorya.

515
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,009
I'm begging you.

516
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:48,379
I'm begging you. Please tell me the truth.

517
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,370
Gorya, tell me you're lying.

518
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,450
Tell me! Tell me!

519
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,450
It's the truth, Thyme.

520
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,050
How can it be true? Huh?

521
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,370
For money, Gorya?

522
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,370
You give up everything
you've done for money?

523
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,370
Just for the money?

524
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,890
How much did she give you?

525
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,570
How much did she give you?

526
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,250
How much?

527
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,970
Tell me how much.

528
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,140
It's enough

529
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,930
for me to get over the disgust
I felt from being with you.

530
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,770
No way.

531
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,970
No way.

532
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,970
How can this be true? How can this be true?

533
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,349
How can this be true?

534
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,270
How can this be true? How can this be true?

535
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,890
It can't be true.

536
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,290
How can it be true?

537
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,650
Not true.

538
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,930
You're just a child, Thyme.

539
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,650
That's why you can't rule anyone.

540
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,650
Grow up, Thyme.

541
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,610
This is my last piece of advice.

542
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,920
Have you ever once

543
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,290
looked at me as an ordinary person?

544
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,650
If you were someone ordinary,

545
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,290
I wouldn't even look at you.

546
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,010
I'm giving this back.

547
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,570
I thought you'd be here.

548
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,770
Oh, you must be back at work.

549
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:46,279
I have to go.

550
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,370
Are you really going
to let it end this way?

551
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,129
The Gorya I know will always fight.

552
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,450
She's not someone who can
throw away something so easily.

553
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,330
I'll be waiting.

554
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:10,010
Is it alright if I could spend a moment

555
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:16,570
To let my heart feel
whatever it feels right now

556
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:30,009
Just a place allowing me to feel weak

557
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,650
Only for a day

558
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,970
To let my tears flow

559
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:43,949
Won't ask for a longer time to weep

560
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:47,370
Only for a night

561
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,890
Promise to keep on getting by

562
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:08,450
Madam, it's reported that Gorya
has traveled to another province.

563
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,290
And Mr. Thyme left a message saying

564
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,290
that he wished to learn how to run
a business in Singapore right away.

565
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,250
Please fire the director tomorrow

566
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,129
and give everything Thyme wants.

567
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,490
Yes, madam.

568
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:39,090
Now I wonder

569
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,090
from today on

570
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,770
how everything

571
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,570
will turn out.

572
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,839
(A year goes by so quickly.
#feelingold #auntiegrade12)

573
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,709
(I was pulling Gorya's
pigtails just a year ago.)

574
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:13,520
(Soon we will graduate.
#3hotgirls #hottestinKocher)

575
00:46:13,545 --> 00:46:16,410
Clean the classroom properly, guys.
Don't slack off.

576
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:21,410
You're the only one slacking off.
Want trouble?

577
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:22,510
Do you?

578
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:25,690
Why are you fighting with your friend?
Stop it.

579
00:46:26,382 --> 00:46:27,419
What's the matter?

580
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,519
Without Gorya, you have
no one else to fight with?

581
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,339
Not at all.

582
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,499
But I don't know.

583
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,490
Since Gorya quit school, it's been boring.

584
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,209
I miss it.

585
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,959
You miss Gorya?

586
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,440
F4, of course. Bros always come first.

587
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,970
Speaking of which, let's look at their IGs.

588
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,370
Wow, so handsome.

589
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:05,059
Wow, Master Kavin.

590
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,789
He looks so good after a workout.

591
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,909
I think this picture will
get over 100,000 likes.

592
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,909
What are you doing?

593
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:14,249
Are you a paparazzi now?

594
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,370
I haven't spent much time with F4 lately.

595
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,109
I must do our fans a service,

596
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,889
otherwise they may miss F4 too much.

597
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:22,968
You... haven't changed a bit.

598
00:47:22,993 --> 00:47:24,000
Of course.

599
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:27,614
Hurry. We have an important
appointment today.

600
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:28,679
Sure.

601
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,319
Have you posted the picture?

602
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,730
Yes.

603
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,660
Living in the best life

604
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,789
Raise your glass up in the sky

605
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:40,439
Living in the best life

606
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,240
No worries be on a high

607
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:46,919
F4 in college. I can't get enough.

608
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,079
I heard they change their
cars every other day.

609
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,250
Let's see what they're doing today.

610
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,850
Don't you think their
car looks strange today?

611
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,450
Yeah.

612
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,709
(Maytee O Garden)

613
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,210
Oh my, that looks so yummy.

614
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,639
This is what I'm talking about.

615
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,789
Celebrating our shop's high sales

616
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:13,080
and branching out to another location.

617
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:16,740
This and this fit well with our shop.

618
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,159
Shall we celebrate every day?

619
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,279
No issues from me.

620
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,759
But if you run out of money,
don't cut my paycheck.

621
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,700
Of course I will.

622
00:48:22,701 --> 00:48:24,490
Uncle Ga!

623
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,169
Are F4 coming?

624
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,370
Kavin said they're getting a present.

625
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,770
Here we are. Congratulations, Uncle Ga!

626
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:40,119
Don't tell me...

627
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,029
It's exactly what you think.

628
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,090
We carefully picked this present for you.

629
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:49,359
Do you know how much I want this?

630
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,960
Look!

631
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,979
Inside looks great.

632
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,450
More importantly, there's
so much room in the back.

633
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,429
Maximum room for storage.

634
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:01,419
I can transport as many flowers as I want.

635
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,509
You feel me, right?

636
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:03,879
I feel you.

637
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,420
But... isn't this a bit excessive?

638
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,410
Yeah.

639
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,730
I know that you guys always go big.

640
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,419
But... is this too big?

641
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,199
Don't worry about it, Uncle Ga.

642
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,010
Just think you'll have a nice
car to carry stuff around.

643
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,679
Someone here won't complain about her back

644
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,410
when she carries heavy stuff.

645
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,195
I'll take it.

646
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,949
Just because a sweet
romance is making me sick.

647
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:30,549
- Uncle Ga, do you have some water?
- Why?

648
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,419
I feel like I have ants in my throat.

649
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,810
Come inside. Come on.

650
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:43,130
A sigh?

651
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,099
I'm just thinking...

652
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,330
it would be nice if Gorya was
around on such a good day like this.

653
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,330
I always feel guilty.

654
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:57,650
I never asked her in which
province her parents were farming.

655
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:03,580
It's alright. We're working on it.

656
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,570
Thank you.

657
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,980
What about your other friends?

658
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:13,381
Thyme... screw him.

659
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:17,970
Ren... he's probably being
indie somewhere right now.

(Chonburi)

663
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,330
(Rayong)

664
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,490
Have you seen this woman?

665
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,380
No, never seen her around here.

666
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,309
But let me take a good look.

667
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:41,819
(The Parama Group's
stock is taking a dive.)

668
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,050
No, I don't think I've seen her.

669
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,050
OK, thanks.

670
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,020
Is she your girlfriend?

671
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,860
Just...

672
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,540
she's very important to...

673
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:57,039
(...Akira Paramaanantra, the only son)

674
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,589
who has recently stepped
into the role of Deputy CEO.

675
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:04,760
He will play a big part and may
or may not overcome this crisis.

676
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,210
To me.

677
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:10,599
According to an assessment
of last year's performance,

678
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,170
it is clear

679
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:17,170
that the business development
team had the worst performance.

680
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:23,170
Therefore, I propose that
we replace the entire team.

681
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:26,239
This is a list of people that
I propose to form a new team.

682
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,999
Hold on, Thyme.

683
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,520
Even when the performance is so poor...

684
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:31,869
This is the only option that
will create minimum impact

685
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,539
on the company's numbers.

686
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,140
More importantly, the CEO
has given the greenlight.

687
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:40,130
An important moment like this

688
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:44,540
requires decisive action.

689
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,050
Is there any opposing vote?

690
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,530
You went too far this time.

691
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,359
What did you want me to do?

692
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,309
Have them draft a plan.

693
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:05,850
This team has been with us for a long time.

694
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:08,349
Their mistakes are not grave...

695
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:10,570
Staff who can't deliver
and meet the targets...

696
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,050
We have no reason to keep them.

697
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,010
Our company does business for profit, Tia,

698
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:19,770
not charity.

699
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,279
You know,

700
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,170
you're becoming more and more like Mother.

701
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:33,730
Thyme, I like you better
when you're with Gorya.

702
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:36,689
You know, to this day,

703
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:39,010
everyone's been searching for Gorya.

704
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:40,759
But what I don't understand is

705
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,469
why are you ignoring...

706
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:44,610
Enough!

707
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:54,409
Tia, I've made a careful decision.

708
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:55,730
Yes.

709
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,730
Stop talking about a useless past

710
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,290
and focus on the present.

711
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,690
Thyme, are you ready
to take a step forward?

712
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:12,090
We're meeting with Si Chen
Corporation in 2 days.

713
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,090
I have a big assignment for you.

714
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,850
Where are you?

715
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:51,100
Petchaburi.

716
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,090
Are you still looking for Gorya?

717
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,569
Take a break.

718
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:58,090
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

719
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:02,090
You've disappeared. How can I not worry?

720
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:06,770
Seriously, if Gorya had
wanted us to find her,

721
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,019
we would have found her by now.

722
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,149
She dropped off the face of
the earth on every platform.

723
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:12,519
I don't understand either.

724
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,339
That's why I want to find her.

725
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:19,079
Don't work too hard too. I know
you've been looking as well.

726
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,170
Shit, don't be a know-it-all.

727
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:27,050
Come back already. Everyone misses you.

728
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,370
OK.

729
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,580
Ren,

730
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:36,570
we will find Gorya someday.

731
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,420
Trust me.

732
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:42,129
Yeah I know.

733
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:44,869
Tonight, astronomers invite all viewers

734
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:47,949
to observe a major meteor
shower of this year.

735
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:51,839
The Draconics will be the most
brilliant shower of the year.

736
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,899
The shower happening tonight will be
visible from anywhere in the world,

737
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,700
to the naked eye.

738
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:00,069
Speaking about beliefs,

739
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:03,639
they say if you make a
wish upon a shooting star,

740
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,089
it just might come true.

741
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:09,889
Let's observe this meteor shower together

742
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,579
and your wish may come true.

743
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,129
Moving on to business news,

744
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:17,949
the economy is experiencing a
prolonged slump with a domino effect.

745
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:23,369
As the real estate prices are rising,
its effects are felt in other sectors,

746
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,309
including consumer goods.

747
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:28,539
A group of farmers in Petchaburi
who are struggling with capital

748
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:32,429
gathered today to urge the government to
adjust the prices of dozens of fruits.

749
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,079
The rally took place in front of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives

750
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,160
which ended with farmers throwing away
fruits right in front of the Ministry.

751
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:40,969
The President of Petchaburi
Farmer Community said

752
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,440
the price of produce is very low this year.

753
00:55:57,657 --> 00:56:00,274
As you know, the economy is bad.

754
00:56:00,299 --> 00:56:01,829
It's a domino effect.

755
00:56:02,087 --> 00:56:04,095
And we, the Parama group

756
00:56:04,657 --> 00:56:06,001
needs to survive.

757
00:56:06,376 --> 00:56:09,946
Both here, and in Singapore.

758
00:56:10,055 --> 00:56:11,079
You're joking.

759
00:56:12,188 --> 00:56:13,883
What the heck is going on?

760
00:56:16,438 --> 00:56:18,352
Long story short, Mr. Lee.

761
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,048
We'll put our project on hold,

762
00:56:22,297 --> 00:56:25,571
and cancel the contract
with Si Chen Corporation.

763
00:56:25,596 --> 00:56:26,829
You can't do that.

764
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:28,899
I have signed the M.O.U,

765
00:56:29,204 --> 00:56:31,720
and put together the 10 years span.

766
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:36,532
My company has invested hundred
of millions in loans for you.

767
00:56:37,149 --> 00:56:39,407
Now, you're suddenly cancelling this.

768
00:56:39,643 --> 00:56:41,298
I will not accept it.

769
00:56:42,213 --> 00:56:45,784
Mr. Lee, our decision was carefully made.

770
00:56:47,284 --> 00:56:49,135
If you don't change your mind,

771
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,401
we'll see you in court.

772
00:56:50,426 --> 00:56:51,791
We'll sue you all.

773
00:56:51,816 --> 00:56:52,776
Do you want it?

774
00:56:52,801 --> 00:56:54,338
It won't make a difference.

775
00:56:56,916 --> 00:56:59,065
You don't stand a chance in court.

776
00:56:59,573 --> 00:57:01,573
What we signed was an M.O.U,

777
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:07,072
which clearly states that Parama Group has the
right to terminate any contract without cost.

778
00:57:08,151 --> 00:57:10,635
If anyone is to blame, it's you,

779
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,237
and your incompetence.

780
00:57:14,979 --> 00:57:16,573
I'll go against you guys.

781
00:57:16,598 --> 00:57:19,018
You won't go far with the way you operate.

782
00:57:19,043 --> 00:57:20,104
You lie.

783
00:57:20,129 --> 00:57:23,174
I'll sue you for what you've done.

784
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,293
Don't touch me!

785
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:26,557
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

786
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:28,737
I'll destroy your future.

787
00:57:28,762 --> 00:57:30,463
You won't go far.

788
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:39,130
(If you think you can
pull it off, go ahead.)

789
00:57:41,452 --> 00:57:43,015
Don't touch me.

790
00:57:43,328 --> 00:57:44,617
Don't touch me.

791
00:57:44,726 --> 00:57:46,375
I'll destroy your future.

792
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,820
You won't go far.

793
00:57:51,124 --> 00:57:52,366
Alright then.

794
00:57:52,757 --> 00:57:54,116
Does anybody have any question?

795
00:57:55,124 --> 00:57:57,452
If not, let's proceed with the agenda.

796
00:58:24,465 --> 00:58:25,595
We should break up.

797
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:03,730
What are you doing here, Ren?

798
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:08,560
You've been unreachable.
You never pick up our calls.

799
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,930
So I'm here.

800
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,210
Thyme,

801
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:35,210
I know where Gorya is.

802
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,170
The Secret Story of Iris

803
01:00:00,192 --> 01:00:02,501
long thin structures that are whip-like,

804
01:00:02,502 --> 01:00:05,701
made of microtubules...

805
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:06,979
Hello.

806
01:00:07,134 --> 01:00:08,305
Are you coming to play basketball today?

807
01:00:08,306 --> 01:00:11,071
I'm not sure. I've got stuff to do today.

808
01:00:11,075 --> 01:00:14,089
I will order KFC today.

809
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:15,382
Thought I'd get some for you.

810
01:00:15,383 --> 01:00:17,539
I want to eat that. How about this?

811
01:00:17,871 --> 01:00:20,150
If I finish what I'm doing
early, I'll be there.

812
01:00:20,151 --> 01:00:21,499
OK.

813
01:00:21,994 --> 01:00:25,141
Hurry here or there won't
be any left for you.

814
01:00:25,142 --> 01:00:26,899
OK, see you.

815
01:00:31,268 --> 01:00:32,619
"See you."

816
01:00:33,905 --> 01:00:35,219
Hello.

817
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:38,699
Hey, come and dig in.

818
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:41,899
Wow, looks so yummy.

819
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:45,979
Hey!

820
01:00:46,878 --> 01:00:49,379
Let's save this for MJ.

821
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:50,936
That's a big bite!

822
01:00:50,937 --> 01:00:52,899
Hey!

823
01:00:53,675 --> 01:00:56,139
We want a rematch.

824
01:01:17,188 --> 01:01:18,280
What happened?

825
01:01:18,281 --> 01:01:20,939
They challenged us but were
losing so they played dirty.

826
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:23,299
Aum got hurt.

827
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,018
Hey, don't pick a fight with them.

828
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:29,375
His dad is in charge around here.

829
01:01:29,376 --> 01:01:30,859
You'll get in trouble.

830
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:35,938
Let's do another rematch.

831
01:01:35,939 --> 01:01:38,299
Before you ask for a rematch,

832
01:01:39,248 --> 01:01:41,939
make sure you find someone
to play for your team.

833
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,971
Tomorrow same time.

834
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:54,539
I'll find someone for sure.

835
01:02:00,855 --> 01:02:02,455
Gorya!

836
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,690
Yes, Dad. I'm coming.

837
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,210
If Gorya was a golddigger and
had taken your mom's money,

838
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,610
she would never live the way she is now.

839
01:02:09,665 --> 01:02:12,845
How could you possibly understand
what I've been through?

840
01:02:14,385 --> 01:02:16,195
Although you're far apart,

841
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:20,220
I believe that you two
still have a connection.

842
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,250
Do you think I'll just let it happen?
