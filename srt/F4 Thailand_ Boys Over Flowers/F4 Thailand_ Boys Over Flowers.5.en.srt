1
00:00:00,313 --> 00:00:01,010
Hi.

2
00:00:01,035 --> 00:00:04,699
I'm Hana. I've just moved
here today from the US.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,099
Can't you forgive my friend?

4
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:11,749
Are you dating Thyme?

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,889
From now on...

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,099
I'll cancel the red card.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,220
Do you think your mother will approve?

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,219
Your dad took out a loan from this flier.

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,499
You just have a drink or two with guests.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,850
You please them.

11
00:00:40,727 --> 00:00:41,729
Geez.

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,609
What's up with this Gorya girl?

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,859
So shameless.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,039
This is horrible. How would Thyme feel...

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,880
Stop!
This is horrible. How would Thyme feel...

16
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,370
What have you done?

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,729
I haven't done anything.

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,339
No? So what is it here?

19
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,339
None of it is true. I've been framed.

20
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,791
Believe me.

21
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:17,897
Believe you?

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,459
Is this photoshopped?
You didn't know better?

23
00:01:24,309 --> 00:01:25,927
What is your excuse?

24
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:29,139
Piles of evidence here. Do
you think I'm that stupid?

25
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,699
I used to think that
you'd have more integrity.

26
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,099
But that's not true.
You're just an easy girl

27
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,759
who's ready to get down
with anyone anywhere.

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,777
Hey!

29
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,099
You weren't going to listen anyway.

30
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,487
If you believed this crap from the get-go,

31
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:57,859
why would you even ask?

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,019
Nobody cares if this is true or not.

33
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:05,019
True or not?

34
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:11,299
Is it you in this picture?

35
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,779
Is it?

36
00:02:21,705 --> 00:02:22,505
It's me.

37
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,890
(There it is. She denied it before.)

38
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,530
(Fake.)

39
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,222
I knew that you're low but didn't
think you could be so shameless.

40
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:55,459
Do you have any conscience?

41
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,404
Phony!

42
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,576
Leave and never come back. Go!

43
00:02:58,601 --> 00:02:59,939
Come back and you'll get
what's coming for it.

44
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,619
Leave. Go!

45
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,559
I've seen the post.

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,899
This has gone way too far.

47
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,608
I'm so stressed out. I don't understand

48
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,551
how they got these pictures

49
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,740
and why they released them just now.

50
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:21,059
Have you come up with anything?

51
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,699
Not at all. It's strange.

52
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,179
There's an easy way to make money.

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,939
It seems like someone is messing with me.

54
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,299
What are you thinking?

55
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:47,099
All I know is someone is
thinking we're stupid.

56
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,349
That's true.

57
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,379
But you know what to do next, right?

58
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,339
Help me, Kaning.

59
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,579
I think I'm switching to Team Gorya.

60
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,379
Me too.

61
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,109
I need to find out who this person is.

62
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,170
I must find out who is behind all this.

63
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,099
Hold on, what are you doing here?

64
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:32,379
Hanging out.

65
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,259
That's nuts. Who would believe that?

66
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,279
I told you... we should've changed.

67
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,979
That's not going to cut it either.

68
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,219
No entry if you're not a member.

69
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,690
Go home.

70
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,859
Please excuse these girls.

71
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,139
Kavin, you haven't been around lately.

72
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,219
It's been a while. I miss you, Bell.

73
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,220
See you inside.

74
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,579
What are you doing?

75
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:03,998
What are you doing?

76
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:06,179
I'm here to help Gorya
look into those pictures.

77
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,309
You?

78
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,459
I'm a member of this club.
Here to have a good time.

79
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,289
This is not a place for kids. Go home.

80
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,059
I'm not a kid. I was
born only 2 years after.

81
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,289
That means you're younger anyway, chipmunk.

82
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,379
Stop calling me chipmunk.

83
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:28,290
If you have a lot of free time on
your hand, find other things to do.

84
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:30,529
What do you want us to do?

85
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,569
I don't know. Find something to eat?

86
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,579
We're not hungry.

87
00:06:38,074 --> 00:06:40,210
Gorya, did you hear that?

88
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:41,604
Yes, it's yours, right?

89
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:43,632
It's yours.

90
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,979
Thyme, I've been looking all over for you.

91
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,939
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

92
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,460
Still feeling down?

93
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,579
Do you really believe
Gorya's photos are real?

94
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:13,219
Thyme, you can't run from problems forever.

95
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,739
Everyone, my friend is miserable right now.

96
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,633
I'd like everyone to join us in having fun.

97
00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:44,949
Order whatever you want to eat or drink.

98
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,050
My treat.

99
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,660
Why are you so distracted today?

100
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,939
Another thing is catching my attention.

101
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,499
Do you think there's CCTV here?

102
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:20,489
Of course. To keep things in order.

103
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,339
But it's confidential anyway.

104
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,859
This place is very exclusive, you know.

105
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,770
If this is a very exclusive bar,

106
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:33,379
how did this photo get out?

107
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:37,132
It's right here.

108
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:39,419
I don't know about that.

109
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,659
If you disturb our employees too
much, I must ask you to leave.

110
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:49,779
I just have a few questions.

111
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:51,619
Our bar is closed now.

112
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,250
If you want to continue
talking, please go to the back.

113
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,179
There's no need to make this a big deal.

114
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,345
We can just talk here.

115
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:03,379
Consider this a warning.

116
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:36,699
Your friend is very handsome,
but he seems so grouchy.

117
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,699
Is he like this all the time?

118
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:44,511
Not this bad. When he gets to this level,

119
00:09:44,536 --> 00:09:46,219
no one could stop him.

120
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,080
Request backup.

121
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,580
Request back up.

122
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,810
Back up right now...

123
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,305
What's going on? It's
pretty loud out there.

124
00:10:20,368 --> 00:10:23,619
Nothing, boss. A man started a fight.

125
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,259
But I sent our men down to handle it.

126
00:10:26,284 --> 00:10:27,864
What's his name?

127
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,039
Kavin, I think.

128
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,379
Hmm? What?

129
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:49,124
I've heard about you a
long time, Master Kavin.

130
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:53,899
I never thought your skills
would be so versatile.

131
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,899
Do not judge a book by its cover.

132
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,899
Let me cut to the chase.

133
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,899
You know that my friend is
in trouble because of this.

134
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,020
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

135
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:17,853
I don't think the bar has
anything to do with it.

136
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,659
In that case, can I talk to
the top person of this place?

137
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,059
Sitting right in front of you.

138
00:11:28,752 --> 00:11:32,739
Although I'm not strictly in this business,

139
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:38,059
people like us know all businesses
have the front side and back side.

140
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,139
Please tell me who's backing you.

141
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,459
Well, let me tell you one last time.

142
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,899
You know that if my
family takes any action,

143
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,899
the person who backs you
won't be that comfortable.

144
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:14,195
Don't look at just the outside.

145
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,339
This is not about customer
privacy or how the photos got out.

146
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:22,167
This is about how we are being challenged,

147
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,339
and I want to know by whom.

148
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,580
Hana.

149
00:13:27,075 --> 00:13:28,050
What?

150
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:30,859
Step away. I know him.

151
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,579
So?

152
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,579
You think you can just get rid of us?

153
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:51,579
Don't make me repeat it. Get out!

154
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:08,299
Thyme, don't worry about this nonsense.

155
00:14:10,702 --> 00:14:12,499
Relax.

156
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:29,379
If no one here understands
you, you can talk to me.

157
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,059
Yes, I'm asking Gorya to tutor me.

158
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:14,740
Yes.

159
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:17,979
You don't need to worry.
I'll take good care of her.

160
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,779
Goodbye.

161
00:15:24,438 --> 00:15:28,709
Here's water. If you want
anything, let me know.

162
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,594
Smells so good. My sweet
daughter is a cook today.

163
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:36,359
Well, I am a good host to my friend.

164
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,610
Stop teasing me, Dad.

165
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,139
OK, I'm going to bed now.

166
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:50,299
Gorya, if there's anything Kaning
or I can do for you, let us know.

167
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:52,807
Thank you.

168
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,802
Thank you too.

169
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,939
No problem. Let me help you for a change.

170
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,459
If I let you be on your own,
you'd get stuck in your head.

171
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:05,619
What? No.

172
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,129
OK, OK. Let's eat.

173
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:08,750
Chopsticks.

174
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,299
Thanks.

175
00:16:11,462 --> 00:16:12,681
This is good.

176
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,205
Hey, earlier tonight,

177
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:27,313
I was so annoyed by Kavin.

178
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:27,867
(I can't get him to wake up.
What should I do?)

179
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:29,792
He's fronting all cool.

180
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,739
Right?

181
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:33,740
Gorya.

182
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:35,099
Hmm?

183
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:38,860
There it is. I just said it.

184
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:40,379
What are you looking at?

185
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,291
Nothing.

186
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,379
I just saw Thyme.

187
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,499
So what's the story between you and him?

188
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,739
Everywhere you go there he is.

189
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,499
I'm mad that he didn't listen to me.

190
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:11,459
But you know, the moment
I looked into his eyes,

191
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,379
it hurt.

192
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,239
Don't give it any more thoughts.

193
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,289
It's been a long day for you.

194
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,586
Let's eat. I have more if you want.

195
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,570
Gorya.

196
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,109
Thank you.

197
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,859
Without you, I wouldn't make it.

198
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,619
What the hell are you doing?

199
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,619
Why can't I?

200
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,687
What you did to Thyme was more severe.

201
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,759
Jane, stop.

202
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,489
Thyme canceled the red card.

203
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,339
So?

204
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,219
Are you going to just stand there?

205
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:22,552
Gorya is shameless. She's a disgrace.
She's ruining F4.

206
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,026
Are you just going to let her walk away?

207
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:26,739
Huh?

208
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,204
Fine.

209
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,019
If you don't dare, I'll
ask Thyme for permission.

210
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,350
(Thyme, can you bring back the
red card that's been canceled?)

211
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:54,384
Thyme gave us the greenlight.

212
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:56,170
(Do it.)

213
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,459
Let me go. Let me go.

214
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,939
Keep watch. I'm going
to go hard on her today.

215
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,043
Let me go!

216
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:14,900
- She's been on my nerves.

217
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,300
- Let go!
- She's been on my nerves.

218
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,970
(Gorya got the red card again!!!)

219
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:29,899
(No kidding. Are you serious?)

220
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,530
(Confirmed.)

221
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,450
(Thyme, can you bring back the red
card that's been canceled?) (Do it.)

222
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
(Give her hell.)

223
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,320
(Let's get back at her for Thyme.)

224
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,761
Let's have a look. What's in there?

225
00:20:40,764 --> 00:20:44,379
It's a car key. Do you have a car?

226
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,739
Weird. You normally take the bus.

227
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:49,318
What's the name?

228
00:20:49,343 --> 00:20:51,499
Kaning.

229
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:53,425
Kaning?

230
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,223
No! That's my friend's motorcycle.

231
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,943
Poor her. Do I care?

232
00:21:00,946 --> 00:21:02,339
Bow!

233
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,379
Let go of me!

234
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,616
(Gorya brought a motorbike to school.)

235
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,879
(Find it quick.)

236
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,859
Stop it! Stop!

237
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,250
Stop!

238
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,969
(I saw her on it just now.)

239
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,210
(Found it.)

240
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,890
(There's only one that's old.)

241
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,650
(Poverty stinks literally.)

242
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,040
(The bike is as rotten as she is.)

243
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,250
(Get her to the stadium.)

244
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,049
Stop it. What are you doing?

245
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,170
(This should be good.)

246
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,170
(Go hard, guys.)

247
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,379
Stop it.

248
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,179
Is this a motorcycle? I
thought it's a piece of junk.

249
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,809
True. We're doing you a
favor by disposing of it.

250
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:49,160
This is not funny. Will you stop playing?

251
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,350
Now it's broken.

252
00:21:53,352 --> 00:21:55,990
It is truly a piece of junk.

253
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,059
Does it really work?

254
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:04,059
Can you stop?

255
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,499
Is this how you want to play?

256
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,299
Sure.

257
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:37,443
Hey, about this thing I looked
into last night, I got something.

258
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:38,402
Tell me.

259
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:41,754
That lounge belongs to Kritsana Malakarn.

260
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:43,579
Does the name sound familiar?

261
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:46,619
He's in the financial sector, right?

262
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,379
Does he control businesses
in that area too?

263
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,857
I wonder that too.

264
00:22:51,861 --> 00:22:53,586
What about Thyme?

265
00:22:53,611 --> 00:22:55,129
He's getting out of control.

266
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,579
He met a girl last night and disappeared.

267
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,849
But don't you worry. I texted him. He said,

268
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,979
"Don't worry. I'm home."

269
00:23:07,629 --> 00:23:08,979
Huh?

270
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:10,872
What girl?

271
00:23:10,874 --> 00:23:14,259
Right, I haven't told you.

272
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:18,249
Do you remember Hana, Gorya's friend?

273
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:20,809
When she's outside the
school, she's so sexy.

274
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,579
Have you checked her record?

275
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:39,069
Hana - Vidalha Malakarn.

276
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,109
What's her relation to Kritsana?

277
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,299
His daughter.

278
00:23:43,302 --> 00:23:45,979
I knew it. This is not a coincidence.

279
00:23:46,973 --> 00:23:51,195
Hold on, do you still have the yearbook?

280
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,979
Why?

281
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:55,869
Do you remember when
we're in primary school,

282
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,339
there's a student whose
surname is Malakarn.

283
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,199
Here she is.

284
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,499
Kornkanok Malakarn.

285
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:05,499
She's 2 years younger than us.

286
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,579
Get up.

287
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,620
I got it now, Kavin. I remember her.

288
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,019
Call Thyme now.

289
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:04,059
You're awake, Thyme.

290
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:08,989
How did I get here?

291
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,259
You passed out last night.

292
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:17,939
I just... wanted to take you to a
place where I could take care of you.

293
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:22,579
What time is it?

294
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,619
Thyme, please relax.

295
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,265
Have something to eat first.

296
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,295
Thyme, I've ordered room service.

297
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,703
It should come within 10 minutes.

298
00:25:34,706 --> 00:25:37,259
Thyme.

299
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:54,739
Please rest and stop
thinking about that girl.

300
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:02,859
Be with me, and I'll make you happy.

301
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,659
I don't want it.

302
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,579
Where's my phone?

303
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,279
Thyme, please listen.

304
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,459
I do whatever I want.

305
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,899
Where's my cellphone?

306
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,509
No. I won't let you go anywhere.

307
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,755
Who do you think you
are ordering me around?

308
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:33,786
You took me to this place
and wouldn't let me leave.

309
00:26:33,788 --> 00:26:37,259
What's wrong with you?

310
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,339
Why?

311
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,339
Why have you never opened your heart to me?

312
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,980
How is Gorya better than me?

313
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,579
A stupid girl like that
doesn't deserve you.

314
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,579
I, on the other hand, am your girl.

315
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:00,059
No one could understand you more than me.

316
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:05,859
What are you talking about?
What do you understand?

317
00:27:08,091 --> 00:27:09,859
Thyme.

318
00:27:11,275 --> 00:27:16,859
You don't know... to
get to where I am today

319
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,219
how much effort I've had to put in.

320
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,050
(Thyme Akira Paramaanantra)

321
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,579
Since the first day I met
you, I've been trying.

322
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,699
I've studied you more than anyone.

323
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,259
I know every little facet of your life.

324
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,059
There's no other woman in the
world who could work as hard.

325
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:44,379
Who are you really?

326
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:53,619
I don't understand.

327
00:27:57,878 --> 00:28:00,259
You talk like you've known me a long time.

328
00:28:01,862 --> 00:28:04,179
Didn't you just transfer
to my school this semester?

329
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:11,099
No, we met a long time ago.

330
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:14,779
You may not remember who I was.

331
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:20,139
But you know what? The
first thing I know about you

332
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,139
is that you hate an ugly girl.

333
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:34,779
I was just a primary school
kid who always admired you.

334
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,059
Who's that ugly girl? Your girlfriend?

335
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,499
An ugly girl like you should stay away.
I can't look at you.

336
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,699
Where are you going, Thyme?

337
00:29:04,764 --> 00:29:07,727
It hurt me badly.

338
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:11,659
I knew that I wasn't pretty then.
I looked horrible.

339
00:29:13,277 --> 00:29:19,339
So... I told myself to use that pain

340
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,339
to push myself further.

341
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,099
And I will win you over.

342
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,579
I did everything to get to you.

343
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,059
I studied your history

344
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,401
to know everything about you.

345
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:41,739
I knew what you liked and didn't like.

346
00:29:42,682 --> 00:29:45,739
After I got to a certain age,

347
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,739
I tried to change everything about myself.

348
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,970
(Mouth.)

349
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,170
(Nose.)

350
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,179
I changed my history, wiped the slate clean

351
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:09,139
and became a girl you may like.

352
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:17,220
Finally, I was confident that
I could get your attention.

353
00:30:22,635 --> 00:30:30,635
But everything went wrong
ever since I met Gorya,

354
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:39,379
a girl I feigned a friendship
with just to blend in.

355
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:44,779
But then she took all of
your attention from me.

356
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,860
It's the beginning of
everything that went wrong.

357
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,859
So I planned to destroy her.

358
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,660
It's funny how easy it is
to take down a poor person.

359
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,659
Oh, well.

360
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:08,130
Even with everything I did,

361
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,259
you can't get over her.

362
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,859
What is this?

363
00:31:16,933 --> 00:31:19,139
What is wrong with you, Hana?

364
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,360
What did you do it for?

365
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:23,019
For you.

366
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:28,459
I love you so damn much.
I just want your love.

367
00:31:28,992 --> 00:31:30,459
My love?

368
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,699
You should hate me.

369
00:31:35,148 --> 00:31:36,979
I do.

370
00:31:38,265 --> 00:31:39,619
I hate you.

371
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:42,620
I hate you very much.

372
00:31:43,345 --> 00:31:45,619
But you know what?

373
00:31:48,604 --> 00:31:54,419
Since that day, I haven't been
able to get you off my mind.

374
00:31:55,647 --> 00:32:00,899
I feel both love and hate for you.
Can't you understand?

375
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,260
I want your love.

376
00:32:16,524 --> 00:32:18,739
You think I'm pathetic, huh?

377
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,740
You think I've gone insane.

378
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,539
A guy like you would never understand.

379
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,739
No, I think I could understand.

380
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:44,739
It may not be the same.

381
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:50,358
But that feeling of dislike and love,

382
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,819
I get that too.

383
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:06,540
I didn't know what it was at first.

384
00:33:07,771 --> 00:33:14,419
But I am sure now that no
matter how much pain I feel

385
00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:17,106
or whatever people say,

386
00:33:17,131 --> 00:33:19,299
in the end, deep down,

387
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,819
I believe in her.

388
00:33:25,928 --> 00:33:28,339
In the end, the girl I choose

389
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,379
is Gorya.

390
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,299
What does it mean?

391
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,299
I don't know what you want, Hana.

392
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:48,299
But what I want to tell you is

393
00:33:50,423 --> 00:33:52,779
that no matter how hard you try,

394
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,099
how much you improve yourself,

395
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,099
you can never be Gorya.

396
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,859
No one can be Gorya.

397
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,139
Gorya is Gorya.

398
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,699
This is some crazy shit.

399
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,619
No logic whatsoever.

400
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,619
But it's good.

401
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,699
It means if she's out of the picture,

402
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,160
this will end, right?

403
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:40,739
What are you doing?

404
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,560
What are you doing to Gorya?

405
00:34:41,561 --> 00:34:43,939
Don't come any closer.

406
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:49,965
Stop it, Hana. Give me my phone.

407
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,179
If you don't choose me,

408
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,036
I'll destroy her life right now.

409
00:34:54,037 --> 00:34:55,979
Stop it, Hana. Give me my phone.

410
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:01,419
You stop. Give in already.

411
00:35:03,285 --> 00:35:06,459
Just say it, Thyme.

412
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:16,259
Say it. You choose me, not Gorya.

413
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,259
Say it.

414
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,259
That will be a lie, Hana.

415
00:35:50,677 --> 00:35:55,419
Fine, if this is what you want...

416
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,819
This face will no longer be necessary.

417
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,819
Hana.

418
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,299
Let's end it here.

419
00:36:10,389 --> 00:36:13,899
I'll tell everyone you
hurt a helpless girl.

420
00:36:14,065 --> 00:36:16,099
Everyone will condemn you.

421
00:36:16,629 --> 00:36:17,979
Hana.

422
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,699
The rest will crumble
like a house of cards.

423
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,219
If I can't be happy...

424
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,459
Hana, stop.

425
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,912
No one else can.

426
00:36:25,937 --> 00:36:27,316
Don't, Hana!

427
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:29,859
Hana!

428
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:51,459
Hana, I'm sorry.

429
00:36:55,171 --> 00:37:03,171
But the person you should
love the most is yourself, OK?

430
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,690
(Found it.)

431
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:28,849
(Is this the one?)

432
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,360
(There's only one that's old.)

433
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:38,339
Tend to her.

434
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,059
Are you all right, miss?

435
00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:53,250
Stop it!

436
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:54,289
Stay still.

437
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:54,840
Don't.

438
00:37:54,841 --> 00:37:57,333
Are they going too far?

439
00:37:57,336 --> 00:37:59,280
Where's the tough act now?

440
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,099
Just stop it already.

441
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,102
What are you doing?

442
00:38:05,103 --> 00:38:07,179
This is too much.

443
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:08,719
I'll tell security.

444
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,419
You know you told me to do this, right?

445
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:15,019
Are you sure you want to stop us?

446
00:38:17,388 --> 00:38:19,139
Let's burn it.

447
00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:28,530
Let me go!

448
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,659
Let me go!

449
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,670
Let me go!

450
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,379
Let me go!

451
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,620
Let me go!

452
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:46,334
Let me go!

453
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,634
Are you all insane?

454
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:55,859
Do you want more?

455
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,939
You're the one who makes F4 mad.

456
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,329
And you did a shitty thing.

457
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,859
You still have the nerve to fight us?

458
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,219
Of course.

459
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:11,019
Even though no one else
in the world believes me,

460
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:14,499
I'll never give up.

461
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:37,419
Come here. Come here.

462
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,179
Damn it!

463
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,459
Get out, all of you. Go!

464
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,179
Gorya!

465
00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:57,619
Gorya!

466
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:13,979
I'm sorry for allowing this to happen.

467
00:40:14,924 --> 00:40:17,219
I'm sorry I got here late.

468
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,219
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

469
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:26,219
I believe you now, Gorya. I'm sorry.

470
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,419
I'm really sorry.

471
00:41:20,013 --> 00:41:21,200
Are you sure no one saw me?

472
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:24,779
Yes, we checked. Aunt Yu has gone to bed.

473
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,779
Aunt Yu can never know about this.

474
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,419
Wait.

475
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,899
Thanks.

476
00:41:41,794 --> 00:41:44,739
Did Master Thyme just say thanks?

477
00:41:45,395 --> 00:41:47,102
We probably misheard.

478
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,739
Yeah, we misheard.

479
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,459
Sorry for this.

480
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,859
A girl can't enter my room at night.

481
00:42:01,362 --> 00:42:02,939
You can stay here, right?

482
00:42:07,162 --> 00:42:09,333
We can't turn on the lights.

483
00:42:09,334 --> 00:42:11,779
Find something else that
can shine some light.

484
00:42:21,724 --> 00:42:24,339
What about this one?

485
00:42:40,254 --> 00:42:44,099
Are you one of those who like to buy
nonsense things and clutter the house?

486
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,681
I have impulse control issues.

487
00:42:46,684 --> 00:42:48,899
If I want something,
I must have it right away.

488
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,899
In the end, it all goes to waste.

489
00:42:56,265 --> 00:42:59,460
If I can work on my impulse

490
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,459
and think about what really is important,

491
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,939
things could be better.

492
00:43:15,869 --> 00:43:18,379
Are you still thinking about Hana?

493
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:30,779
I can't believe it even now...
how Hana can be so mean.

494
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:34,779
I'm not the best judge of character.

495
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:40,539
Let me dress your wound.

496
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:47,319
You have a wound.

497
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,230
Let me dress yours.

498
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:50,431
I'll dress your wound. No big deal.

499
00:43:50,435 --> 00:43:51,270
No, I...

500
00:43:51,271 --> 00:43:53,025
Hey.

501
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,139
Let me do it for you

502
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,779
as my apology.

503
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,580
Ouch!

504
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:23,350
I'll do it myself.

505
00:44:23,351 --> 00:44:24,639
I'll do it.

506
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,509
You're too harsh. Be soft.

507
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,410
Suck it up.

508
00:44:28,411 --> 00:44:31,139
I'm putting my most 'deligate' touch ever.

509
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,579
Delicate.

510
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:51,899
Hey.

511
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:59,219
About today... Thank you
for coming to help me.

512
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,219
I have to apologize.

513
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:07,819
You shouldn't have gotten in
trouble because of my past.

514
00:45:10,253 --> 00:45:15,299
It's fine. How many times have
you said sorry to me today?

515
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,059
That's my business.

516
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:28,299
All done.

517
00:45:43,214 --> 00:45:49,059
What happened with Hana is good for us.

518
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,539
How?

519
00:45:57,037 --> 00:46:00,539
I've had my doubts...

520
00:46:02,481 --> 00:46:05,139
a girl with cuts and bruises all over,

521
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,819
got dirt on her body,

522
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,939
her hair all messy,

523
00:46:12,777 --> 00:46:13,879
her looks quite average...

524
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,139
- Are you criticizing me?
- How is it possible for her

525
00:46:17,874 --> 00:46:20,139
to make me fall in love this hard?

526
00:46:23,801 --> 00:46:26,099
But I get it now.

527
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:33,299
What are you babbling about?

528
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:42,529
I think I know my heart.

529
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:46,059
I take issues with a lot of
things and am quite unstable.

530
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,699
If you are far from me, that's an issue.

531
00:46:49,031 --> 00:46:51,629
You have to be near me all the time.

532
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:53,699
In short, you have to be...

533
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:26,419
I don't want to go back

534
00:47:26,423 --> 00:47:28,809
Stuck in my own world

535
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,949
All alone with no one

536
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:35,419
Can I stay would you please

537
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:38,149
You and me together

538
00:47:38,183 --> 00:47:39,897
That's all that matters

539
00:47:39,922 --> 00:47:44,419
Can I stay would you please

540
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:47,219
In the world with you here

541
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:51,970
You've made my life so complete

542
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:06,739
Thyme.

543
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,289
Master Thyme has gone out.

544
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,769
Miss Gorya, please take
a shower and wear this.

545
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:24,304
Mr. Thyme asked me to prepare it for you.

546
00:48:24,305 --> 00:48:25,779
Thank you.

547
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:29,179
Oh, and one more thing.

548
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:41,290
Master Thyme had someone buy one to
replace the one that broke yesterday.

549
00:48:41,554 --> 00:48:44,979
But all he could remember
was the color red.

550
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:47,020
He didn't know the model.

551
00:48:47,022 --> 00:48:48,929
So these are the options.

552
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:52,539
We must apologize. These
are all we could find.

553
00:48:53,678 --> 00:48:55,539
He's consistent.

554
00:49:03,494 --> 00:49:05,275
So... did you pick the motorcycle?

555
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,899
You go big again. I don't want it.

556
00:49:09,152 --> 00:49:12,602
Take it. It's your friend's.

557
00:49:12,604 --> 00:49:14,509
Why do you have issues
with such a small thing?

558
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:17,290
For me, this is not a small thing.

559
00:49:17,293 --> 00:49:19,647
Where did you go so early?

560
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,124
To clear things up from yesterday.

561
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,840
Although it wasn't me,

562
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:24,550
the damage is real.

563
00:49:24,622 --> 00:49:27,386
I'm a responsible guy so I'm helping.

564
00:49:27,388 --> 00:49:29,609
Are you helping or pressuring the director?

565
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:30,600
Don't worry.

566
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:33,177
We've deleted all the files in the CCTV.

567
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,182
Thank you, director.

568
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:38,099
I have to deal with those who hurt you.

569
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,779
Deal?

570
00:49:39,858 --> 00:49:41,615
You're not doing anything serious, are you?

571
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,640
I just...

572
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,249
I'm sorry.

573
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,420
Asked MJ to do some
adjustments to the 'latitude'.

574
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,610
It's done. No problem.

575
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,420
Leave it to me.

576
00:49:51,428 --> 00:49:55,219
You pick the bike and come to school.

577
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,579
If you can't pick one, take them all.

578
00:49:58,524 --> 00:50:01,219
Hold on, Kavin wants to talk to you.

579
00:50:02,094 --> 00:50:06,019
Gorya, there's something
you might want to know.

580
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,099
What?

581
00:50:08,314 --> 00:50:10,299
It's about Hana.

582
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,619
Wait!

583
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,539
I know about your resignation.

584
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:49,539
Don't you have anything to say to me?

585
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,868
I have nothing to say to you.

586
00:50:54,869 --> 00:50:54,871
But I do.
I have nothing to say to you.

587
00:50:54,872 --> 00:50:56,653
But I do.

588
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:03,219
What you did was terrible.

589
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:10,459
I don't think I can forgive you.

590
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,659
But I just want to say that,

591
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:21,179
during the time we're friends,

592
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:28,899
I never felt you're faking with me.

593
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:36,739
I believe that those feelings were real.

594
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:45,739
I won't let you resign
without saying goodbye.

595
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:53,939
Hana, good luck.

596
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,760
(Sorry.)

597
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,269
Hey, honestly,

598
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,499
I don't have the energy to fight with you.

599
00:52:53,692 --> 00:52:55,609
We're not here to fight.

600
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:58,050
We just want to...

601
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,779
We...

602
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:08,059
We just want to a...

603
00:53:11,437 --> 00:53:13,299
Are you here to mess with Gorya again?

604
00:53:14,263 --> 00:53:15,699
No, Thyme, we're not...

605
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:19,199
I'm sick of protecting Gorya from you.

606
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,259
Speaking of which, I'm
going to announce it.

607
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,859
Everyone, listen up.

608
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,899
No one will ever have
any problems with Gorya.

609
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,099
If anyone has a problem with my girlfriend,

610
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,659
you have a problem with me.

611
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:37,699
Got it?

612
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,619
Huh?

613
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,687
You wench, you witch, you poisonous snake.

614
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:45,710
That was close.

615
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,519
Stop thinking things in your head is true.

616
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,391
People here will misunderstand.

617
00:53:50,392 --> 00:53:51,939
Things in my head?

618
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:54,349
Yesterday, I asked you to be my
girlfriend, and you said yes.

619
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:56,819
Don't you remember?

620
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,179
Gorya.

621
00:54:04,922 --> 00:54:07,419
How about...

622
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:10,939
we go steady.

623
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:14,939
Gorya.

624
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:16,939
Gorya.

625
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,059
If you don't reply, it
means you're dating me.

626
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,289
Mmm.

627
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:25,339
Hmm?

628
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,340
Mmm.

629
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,979
Yes!

630
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:39,419
There it is. You said yes.

631
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,379
You didn't just say yes.

632
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,379
What?

633
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:46,641
Did you do stuff to me?

634
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:48,779
Do what? You...

635
00:55:11,398 --> 00:55:13,832
I'm not saying it.

636
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,964
Did you do something?

637
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:20,769
It's not like that. You did.

638
00:55:20,794 --> 00:55:21,480
Me?

639
00:55:21,481 --> 00:55:23,961
You did. I'm not saying anything anymore.
I'm leaving.

640
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:27,160
- That hurts.
- Did you do something to me?

641
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,179
Will they make it?

642
00:55:30,632 --> 00:55:32,610
I think they'll fight every day.

643
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:35,140
More trouble, huh?

644
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,779
Ren!

645
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:58,939
I've been gone a while. The
school is as chaotic as before.

646
00:56:18,499 --> 00:56:20,579
I didn't come back too late, did I?

647
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,090
He's really changed.

648
00:56:22,093 --> 00:56:23,220
So what now?

649
00:56:23,245 --> 00:56:25,890
I don't know. He's not the same.

650
00:56:26,555 --> 00:56:27,278
Damn it!

651
00:56:27,303 --> 00:56:29,079
I wish I could go back to the way I was.

652
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,786
Certain things really
need to be talked through.

653
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:34,399
Clear it up before it's too late.

654
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,219
What's the matter?

655
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,199
I thought everything would be better.

656
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,899
Things are messier than before.

657
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,979
We're going on a date, the F4 kind of date.

658
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,268
What are you frustrated about?
I didn't come late.

659
00:56:44,293 --> 00:56:46,810
I'm not frustrated.
