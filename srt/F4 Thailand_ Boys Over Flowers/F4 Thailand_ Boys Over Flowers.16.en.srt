1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,850
Thyme's mother is smarter than we think.

2
00:00:04,528 --> 00:00:06,529
It seems like they owe everyone some money.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,450
Let me pay it now.

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,310
Ren.

5
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:09,869
Just pay me back over time.

6
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,129
If you look hard enough, you'll see.

7
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,139
We owe it all to a little girl

8
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:19,000
named Gorya.

9
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,259
Can I have this document back?

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,670
Because Thyme is your home.

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,619
(Have you ever thought about
how ordinary teens like us)

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,640
(can make a difference?)

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,669
Breaking news. A shocking
incident occurred at 10:37 a.m.

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,049
Mr. Akira Paramaanantra or Thyme,
the heir of the Parama Group,

15
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,189
was stabbed with a knife during a
press conference at their headquarters,

16
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,929
witnessed by several
reporters and employees.

17
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,095
Initial reports say he is
currently in critical condition.

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,155
Doctors are working hard to
bring him out of the woods.

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,099
The perpetrator was a long-time
supplier of the Parama Group.

20
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,657
It's speculated that a business dispute
was the motive behind the attack.

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,160
(Didn't he deserve it though?)

22
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,859
(Please take the best care of him.)

23
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,119
(You can rest assured.)

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,699
(Thank you.)

25
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,819
Mr. Thyme's condition is critical.

26
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:50,499
The doctor said he had lost a lot of blood.

27
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,460
It will be several hours before
they can assess him again.

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,899
Regarding the meeting today,

29
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,666
- I think we should cancel it.
- No.

30
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:03,521
Please prepare all the documents

31
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:05,383
and reconvene the meeting tomorrow.

32
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:08,884
Mother!

33
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:11,643
Mother!

34
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:14,072
Let's talk.

35
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:17,571
Mother, we have to talk!

36
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:19,072
I know what you'll say.

37
00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:21,501
But Thyme is now in the
doctors' capable hands.

38
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:24,428
We should take this time
to sort out the whole mess.

39
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:29,112
Don't you feel guilty
about what happened at all?

40
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:30,561
It was an accident.

41
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:32,315
It was not an accident.

42
00:02:33,872 --> 00:02:35,511
It wouldn't have happened

43
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:40,311
if you'd taken the time
to prioritize people.

44
00:02:46,062 --> 00:02:48,689
I know that each person

45
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:51,182
has a different thing at the
top of their priority list.

46
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:54,151
Gorya! Gorya!

47
00:02:54,832 --> 00:02:58,431
But I'm not sure now what
is at the top of your list.

48
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:02,471
What is certain is the
path you're about to take

49
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:06,951
will one day cost you
everything that matters.

50
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,032
It's too late now.

51
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:27,421
(Some may think it's too
late to change something.)

52
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,191
(But as long as the future awaits us)

53
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:38,809
(I still believe a miracle
will happen someday.)

54
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,921
(But...)

55
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:46,191
(is the future awaiting us?)

56
00:04:51,172 --> 00:04:52,748
(When will you get better, Thyme?
#PrayForThymeF4D12)

57
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:58,292
(Please wake up, Thyme.
#PrayForThymeF4D12#)

58
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:12,031
Did you get any sleep at all?

59
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:19,902
I want to get to a thousand stars first

60
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:22,712
in case it could help
Thyme regain consciousness.

61
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,271
Don't people usually fold
the paper into birds?

62
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,271
Yeah. But I'd rather do stars.

63
00:05:36,557 --> 00:05:38,751
Don't know when he will wake up.

64
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:50,871
Thyme doesn't give up easily.

65
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:56,031
He has tried so many things to be with you.

66
00:05:56,782 --> 00:06:02,391
This time he will wake
up to be with you again.

67
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,391
Trust me.

68
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:13,431
Hello, Kavin.

69
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:16,911
Thyme's awake?

70
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:23,191
What do you mean?

71
00:06:37,124 --> 00:06:38,695
What's going on?

72
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:41,794
The Parama's bodyguards are keeping us out.

73
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:43,241
They said it's his mother's order.

74
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:45,391
I checked with my family.

75
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,176
But they wouldn't say anything.

76
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:49,225
What's really going on?

77
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,870
All I know is Thyme has woken
up but he's not the same.

78
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,191
I don't know in what way.

79
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:57,861
What the hell is this?

80
00:06:57,862 --> 00:07:00,111
I chose the best doctors

81
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:01,841
so that this would not happen!

82
00:07:01,842 --> 00:07:03,711
We're very sorry, Ms. Roselyn.

83
00:07:03,712 --> 00:07:06,813
The patient's brain is severely damaged.

84
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:10,290
Most importantly, his heart stopped
beating for several minutes,

85
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:12,129
preventing blood from flowing to his brain.

86
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,072
I don't care what the cause is.

87
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:18,215
You should have been able
to cure him no matter what.

88
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:20,591
Mother, please.

89
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:23,062
Doctor, can we please have
a moment to talk in private?

90
00:07:26,762 --> 00:07:28,511
4 years.

91
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:35,351
The fact that Thyme is
alive is already a blessing.

92
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:40,351
As for his condition...
he'll be alright one day.

93
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:47,232
Maybe. This could be a good time
for us to restart something.

94
00:07:51,682 --> 00:07:54,751
The other day you said it's too late.

95
00:07:55,662 --> 00:07:58,011
For me, nothing is too late.

96
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,951
Restart?

97
00:08:10,112 --> 00:08:13,551
Thyme, I want to know
what you can remember.

98
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,631
Do you remember these people?

99
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:21,302
Ren.

100
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:24,311
Kavin.

101
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:27,042
MJ.

102
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,256
They're my friends.

103
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,043
What about this person?

104
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,276
What are you doing?

105
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:39,871
Mom! Mother!

106
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,090
I don't know her.

107
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:42,427
You can't do this.

108
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:43,426
Take Tia out of here.

109
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:44,810
Don't! Mother!

110
00:08:44,853 --> 00:08:46,831
I know what you're trying to do.

111
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:54,151
Thyme, your dream is to rule
the Parama Group, right?

112
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:04,917
And you're ready to listen to
everything I say for victory, right?

113
00:09:08,102 --> 00:09:09,471
I am.

114
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:21,772
Thyme! Thyme!

115
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:23,322
No! You're not allowed in.

116
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:25,551
Thyme! Thyme!

117
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:29,062
Thyme! Thyme!

118
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:43,823
Thyme, are you OK?

119
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:45,812
Are you hurt anywhere?

120
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,191
Who are you?

121
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:54,505
What gives you the right to touch me?

122
00:09:56,082 --> 00:09:57,232
Get out!

123
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,312
Get out!

124
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:05,311
Let's go.

125
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:18,432
Gorya!

126
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:20,762
Tia, what's going on?

127
00:10:22,252 --> 00:10:23,620
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:25,252 --> 00:10:26,880
I can't do anything to help.

129
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:32,691
What do you mean?

130
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:34,311
Listen carefully.

131
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:38,911
Thyme's brain has been severely damaged.

132
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:42,875
His memories of the past
4 years have been lost.

133
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:47,796
Mother is trying to take advantage of it.

134
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:54,099
Excuse me?

135
00:10:55,985 --> 00:10:57,671
You understand me, right?

136
00:10:58,012 --> 00:11:00,896
You can't do this. The patient
hasn't fully recovered!

137
00:11:00,902 --> 00:11:05,271
She will stop Thyme's treatment.

138
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:11,231
Her goal is to restart everything

139
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:18,991
and delete you out of Thyme's life forever.

140
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:33,332
(Maytee O Garden)

141
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:36,071
Oh my goodness!

142
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:38,877
Thyme's memory loss.

143
00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:41,901
And it has to be specific
to these past 4 years.

144
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,672
Of all the things he forgets, look.

145
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:46,671
He has absolutely no recollection of Gorya.

146
00:11:46,882 --> 00:11:49,201
That's not the worst part.

147
00:11:49,202 --> 00:11:53,312
It's looking very likely that
Thyme will go back to his old way.

148
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:01,871
Can't you three talk to him?

149
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:04,472
Tell him about Gorya.

150
00:12:04,478 --> 00:12:06,471
I think he will listen to you.

151
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:09,471
It's not that easy, Uncle Ga.

152
00:12:09,682 --> 00:12:12,791
Thyme's mom knows what we're up to.

153
00:12:16,352 --> 00:12:20,791
So she's doing everything to keep
everyone from getting to him.

154
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:24,311
He's being watched all the time.

155
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:28,391
Everything about Gorya
has been thrown away.

156
00:12:28,912 --> 00:12:32,951
Data on the phone and on his
computer has been deleted.

157
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:36,191
We are not able to reach him.

158
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:39,191
Even Auntie Yu is also kept out.

159
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:45,551
It's very difficult to keep Thyme away
from the outside world so completely.

160
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:49,391
But if someone could do
it, it's Thyme's mother.

161
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:51,431
What kind of mother is she?

162
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:53,326
How could she be so mean to her children?

163
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:55,191
It's so horrible hearing about it.

164
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:03,291
But no one can feel as horrible
as that girl over there.

165
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:05,991
Look, will she be able to go on?

166
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:13,661
Thyme, you jerk! How
can you forget about me?

167
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:14,981
And you had to yell at me!

168
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:16,662
Gorya! Stop.

169
00:13:17,852 --> 00:13:20,631
I think that's out of the question.

170
00:13:22,012 --> 00:13:24,358
So, you will fight with all your might

171
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,191
to help Thyme get his
memory back, won't you?

172
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:30,471
Of course. I won't give up.

173
00:13:31,502 --> 00:13:33,289
But how?

174
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:35,871
You don't need to worry about that.

175
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:40,001
If you're ready to fight, the rest is easy.

176
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:46,946
You can count on us for
scheming an elaborate plan.

177
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,808
The documents that I asked
you to try your hand at...

178
00:14:09,302 --> 00:14:11,151
are flawless.

179
00:14:11,992 --> 00:14:16,671
You may have memory loss but your
ability to work remains intact.

180
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:20,551
Get your 4 years back soon.

181
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:27,632
Mother, since I came back,
I haven't seen my F4 friends.

182
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:31,541
I think seeing them...

183
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:34,072
But you're not fully recovered.

184
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:42,471
I know you're anxious
to get your memory back.

185
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:46,431
But you should get your priority straight.

186
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:49,163
If you do a great job,

187
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:53,431
I'll bring you back in a few
months to manage the Parama Group,

188
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:58,351
as you've always dreamed
of, isn't that right?

189
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,111
Yes.

190
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:08,111
Don't worry about your other memories.

191
00:15:08,402 --> 00:15:10,111
They will come back.

192
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:24,031
His medicines?

193
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:18,951
OK, Gorya. Let's recap.

194
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:24,311
Every day in the afternoon, his
mother goes to the office for 3 hours.

195
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:26,321
Auntie Yu can give us the signal.

196
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:29,882
You will need to get to
Thyme during those hours.

197
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:31,732
Kavin will tell you how.

198
00:16:31,802 --> 00:16:35,229
The most vulnerable spot with
no guards is the balcony.

199
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,232
I've prepared all the equipment.

200
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:41,272
You will run into trouble with two
guards in front of his bedroom.

201
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,791
But no worries.

202
00:16:44,729 --> 00:16:48,391
The maids will get them
out of the way for you.

203
00:16:50,452 --> 00:16:55,071
Help! Help! She just collapsed!

204
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:02,631
No one can hear anything on this side.

205
00:17:03,362 --> 00:17:06,071
There will only be you
and Thyme in that house.

206
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:09,690
Help him get his memory back.

207
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:13,071
We've thought about the
way to help you do this.

208
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:17,761
It may look scary but you can do it.

209
00:17:17,762 --> 00:17:23,751
If you jog his memory the right
way, the rest is up to you.

210
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:25,991
Up for it?

211
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:27,991
Yes.

212
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:30,852
Let's do this!

213
00:17:37,572 --> 00:17:39,791
I know I startled you.

214
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:44,791
But don't worry. I just
have something to tell you.

215
00:17:45,404 --> 00:17:47,432
Please listen to me for just a minute.

216
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,712
It may sound strange.

217
00:18:04,242 --> 00:18:06,792
But I'm your girlfriend.

218
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:14,231
These are the photos we took on our date.

219
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:18,231
You bought this for me.

220
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:23,717
You also punched Kaning's boyfriend

221
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:27,751
because you're angry
that he disrespected me.

222
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:33,311
And this is our chat.

223
00:18:34,842 --> 00:18:39,111
You liked to send me a bunch of stickers.

224
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:43,231
And if I replied late,
you would go off on me.

225
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:45,231
And here.

226
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:48,631
I made you these cookies for your birthday.

227
00:18:48,951 --> 00:18:50,631
Ren said you wouldn't eat it.

228
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,812
You also said you're more
handsome than the cookies.

229
00:18:54,837 --> 00:18:56,911
What Mother warned me is true.

230
00:19:00,563 --> 00:19:02,335
Beware of an imposter.

231
00:19:04,502 --> 00:19:05,954
You don't believe me at all?

232
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:08,033
How can I?

233
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:11,791
These texts are not me.

234
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,157
And this nonsense?

235
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:16,406
And the photos.

236
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,700
Easily edited.

237
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,603
But all this is true, Thyme.

238
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:24,791
Do you really think this
stupid thing can fool me?

239
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:29,621
- Anyone there? Get this woman out!
- Lower your voice down.

240
00:19:29,622 --> 00:19:31,021
Get your hands off me!

241
00:19:31,022 --> 00:19:32,651
Do you know how much this shirt cost?

242
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:34,137
I don't. Let's talk.

243
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,551
Damn it!

244
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:38,249
Stop 'brothering' me.

245
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,191
No matter how much you
say, I won't believe you.

246
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:47,231
Someone like me will degrade
myself to be with a loser like you?

247
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:48,911
It's 'bothering'!

248
00:19:55,164 --> 00:19:58,071
Why are you so frustrating?

249
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:03,381
Just because you have memory loss
doesn't mean you have to be a jerk.

250
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:07,252
Come back to be the person you are.
I'm waiting.

251
00:20:07,277 --> 00:20:11,776
Although I'm a loser, I really do love you.

252
00:20:13,392 --> 00:20:16,311
Is the past worth nothing to you?

253
00:20:26,342 --> 00:20:29,431
Thyme, what's wrong?

254
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:30,523
Thyme.

255
00:20:30,548 --> 00:20:32,211
Why is this so familiar?

256
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:33,671
Can you remember?

257
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:35,071
Go away! I have a headache.

258
00:20:35,072 --> 00:20:39,731
Remember it. Tell me what you see.

259
00:20:39,732 --> 00:20:41,666
I'll help you remember.

260
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:46,111
It's very important.

261
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,952
But I can't see.

262
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:52,951
Thyme, just hang in there.

263
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:54,381
Remember.

264
00:20:54,382 --> 00:20:56,102
I see a girl.

265
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:02,391
Hang in there a little longer.

266
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,911
I...

267
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:08,551
Can you remember?

268
00:21:23,942 --> 00:21:26,111
Go back to the house.

269
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:35,881
Thyme.

270
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:47,413
Take this girl out of here!

271
00:21:47,634 --> 00:21:48,634
Please.

272
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:50,671
Let go! Thyme!

273
00:21:51,492 --> 00:21:53,071
Remember, Thyme!

274
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,071
Let me go! Thyme!

275
00:21:56,212 --> 00:21:57,561
- Let me go!
- Stay still!

276
00:21:57,562 --> 00:21:59,151
Let me go!

277
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,483
How dare you barge in here and hurt my son?

278
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:07,992
I'm here to help him.

279
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:11,092
You're the one who should stop hurting him.

280
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:14,727
Are you insane? I never hurt him.

281
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:17,031
Is this not hurting him?

282
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:21,031
You never care how he feels.

283
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:24,112
You only care how he can be of use to you.

284
00:22:24,702 --> 00:22:28,111
He's lost his memory,
instead of treating him,

285
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:30,911
look at what you've done.

286
00:22:31,732 --> 00:22:35,671
You've tricked him and turned
him to be someone you want.

287
00:22:35,942 --> 00:22:38,951
Admit it. You never love Thyme.

288
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:44,422
He's not a doll. He's your blood.

289
00:22:44,712 --> 00:22:47,979
I feel so sorry for Thyme for having
a selfish person like you as a mother.

290
00:22:53,422 --> 00:22:59,112
What I've done is what's best for Thyme.

291
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:05,031
You wouldn't know.

292
00:23:09,142 --> 00:23:12,311
Close the gate. Don't
let her in ever again!

293
00:23:28,302 --> 00:23:29,631
Thank you, Auntie Yu.

294
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:36,911
Hey, Auntie Yu said Gorya hasn't left.

295
00:23:37,322 --> 00:23:39,514
She's been standing in front
of the house for hours.

296
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:41,871
What is she trying to do?

297
00:23:44,252 --> 00:23:45,576
Ren.

298
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:51,322
You'll see.

299
00:24:27,822 --> 00:24:28,942
Please don't.

300
00:24:29,132 --> 00:24:30,441
- Mother!
- Ms. Tia.

301
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:32,371
- Mother!
- Please stop.

302
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:35,711
You can't do this. You can't
let her stay out there, Mother!

303
00:24:36,232 --> 00:24:37,711
You can't! Mother!

304
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:10,445
Don't misunderstand.

305
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:13,671
I'm not caving.

306
00:25:15,998 --> 00:25:17,766
I just don't understand

307
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:21,427
how long you're going
to do this stupid thing.

308
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:30,671
You know no matter how long you stand
here, I won't let you see Thyme.

309
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:36,069
I know.

310
00:25:40,782 --> 00:25:43,471
I just want to talk to you.

311
00:25:58,352 --> 00:26:00,832
You want to talk to me?

312
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:10,591
Earlier when you slapped me,

313
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:16,871
I wondered why you're so angry.

314
00:26:18,732 --> 00:26:20,871
Finally, I got it.

315
00:26:24,712 --> 00:26:26,871
You couldn't stand it

316
00:26:27,804 --> 00:26:29,752
when people say you don't love Thyme.

317
00:26:32,562 --> 00:26:37,111
You're not selfish. You've
dedicated your life to Thyme.

318
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:47,066
Because you do love him so much.

319
00:26:53,986 --> 00:26:57,071
All this time everything you've done,

320
00:26:57,672 --> 00:27:00,071
the way you've acted so harshly,

321
00:27:01,192 --> 00:27:05,632
it's all for Thyme to one
day rule the Parama Group.

322
00:27:07,191 --> 00:27:09,351
And he will be happy.

323
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:12,501
You understand...

324
00:27:12,502 --> 00:27:15,552
But have you forgotten something important?

325
00:27:18,962 --> 00:27:25,751
Have you ever asked him
what his happiness is?

326
00:27:28,152 --> 00:27:32,791
Mother, I don't know what
Gorya is trying to do.

327
00:27:33,177 --> 00:27:35,752
But she's standing in the rain.

328
00:27:36,192 --> 00:27:37,349
She's fighting.

329
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:39,402
She's fighting with everything she's got.

330
00:27:39,732 --> 00:27:42,742
She's fighting for one thing: Thyme.

331
00:27:43,382 --> 00:27:45,951
That's no different than
what you've claimed to do.

332
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,951
Open your heart, Mother.

333
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:54,431
I want to see Thyme happy.

334
00:27:57,402 --> 00:27:59,791
Happy the way he wants.

335
00:28:02,702 --> 00:28:07,711
The person who understands
this the most is Gorya.

336
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:14,711
For me, he doesn't want power.
He doesn't want money.

337
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:18,491
All he wants is love.

338
00:28:25,552 --> 00:28:26,758
That's not true.

339
00:28:27,302 --> 00:28:28,829
I know him well.

340
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:33,601
Since he was a kid, the thing he wants
the most is to rule the Parama Group.

341
00:28:33,602 --> 00:28:35,791
He wants to rule the Parama Group

342
00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:41,511
because it's the only thing that
will make you be proud of him.

343
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:45,151
Isn't that true?

344
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,351
Thyme loves you so much.

345
00:28:54,392 --> 00:28:56,591
But you know,

346
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:01,991
how he told the story of his dining table.

347
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:15,622
He said it was quiet. No talking.
No laughter.

348
00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:22,111
Everyone sits so far from each other.

349
00:29:23,572 --> 00:29:26,871
He told me he had just realized then

350
00:29:28,277 --> 00:29:32,271
how valuable a warm dining table was.

351
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:38,271
Maybe his happiness isn't something grand.

352
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:47,111
Maybe it's just having a hotpot
with his family whom he loves.

353
00:29:48,492 --> 00:29:50,111
That's all.

354
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:06,151
For that reason, it's OK if you won't
let me see Thyme again. I get it.

355
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:11,151
I just want you to see him smile,
the way I've seen him smile.

356
00:30:14,194 --> 00:30:16,752
That's what you've always
wanted to see, right?

357
00:31:08,315 --> 00:31:10,591
You can do it.

358
00:31:12,342 --> 00:31:14,471
My smile?

359
00:31:21,442 --> 00:31:25,551
What would an outsider like you know?
You think you know me?

360
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:30,511
What you're doing is causing
chaos for other people.

361
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:36,632
My happiness is never a small
thing like what you just said.

362
00:31:38,057 --> 00:31:42,231
I'm Akira Paramaanantra.

363
00:31:43,372 --> 00:31:48,216
My dream is to stand at the top.

364
00:31:49,682 --> 00:31:53,401
This is what someone in my family
would dream of, not what you said.

365
00:31:53,402 --> 00:31:54,911
No.

366
00:31:56,092 --> 00:31:58,211
You have another dream
that's more important.

367
00:31:58,212 --> 00:32:00,181
You've figured it out. You can...

368
00:32:00,182 --> 00:32:04,671
Stop talking! Stop! Stop
acting like you know me!

369
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,322
But I do know you.

370
00:32:22,348 --> 00:32:28,912
Everyone who knows me
doesn't dare to talk back.

371
00:32:30,422 --> 00:32:34,711
Because they know what
they'll get when I'm angry.

372
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:42,015
Girlfriend?

373
00:32:43,974 --> 00:32:48,191
Is this the way you look
at someone you love?

374
00:32:52,475 --> 00:32:54,112
Full of fear.

375
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,871
Come back.

376
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:10,235
Come back from what?

377
00:33:10,592 --> 00:33:12,154
Stop imagining things.

378
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:14,338
This is who I am.

379
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:17,682
Stop talking rubbish.

380
00:33:18,772 --> 00:33:21,151
You go back to where you're from.

381
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,416
Stop!

382
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,071
Go back!

383
00:33:27,191 --> 00:33:28,591
Get out!

384
00:33:38,722 --> 00:33:41,431
I can't change you again, can I?

385
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,204
I wish you all the best.

386
00:33:57,272 --> 00:33:58,993
I love you.

387
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:10,471
Get out! Get out! Go!

388
00:34:52,522 --> 00:34:55,751
Let's go inside, Mother. My head hurts.

389
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,751
The rain stops.

390
00:35:30,677 --> 00:35:33,111
Guys, do you see a falling star?

391
00:35:35,532 --> 00:35:37,151
Yeah.

392
00:35:46,642 --> 00:35:50,338
Guys, do you believe in making
a wish on a falling star?

393
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,111
I do.

394
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:13,888
But I believe in people more.

395
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:31,925
Pruek.

396
00:36:33,603 --> 00:36:35,657
Do you believe in miracles?

397
00:36:36,602 --> 00:36:37,823
Excuse me?

398
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:46,989
(I love you.)

399
00:36:50,564 --> 00:36:51,982
Open the gate.

400
00:36:56,635 --> 00:36:58,055
Open it.

401
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:17,311
You! Stop!

402
00:37:17,574 --> 00:37:19,311
You!

403
00:37:22,124 --> 00:37:23,783
Why did you run after me?

404
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,071
I just wonder.

405
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:30,152
Have I put this necklace on your neck?

406
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:33,597
Why did you make me?

407
00:37:34,674 --> 00:37:35,808
I didn't make you.

408
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:37,498
Why else would I put it on your neck?

409
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:40,612
I told you, we were a couple.

410
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:45,249
That can't be true. I've
never had a girlfriend.

411
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:47,071
I've never kissed anyone.

412
00:37:51,013 --> 00:37:53,071
Why do you look like that?

413
00:37:57,412 --> 00:37:58,791
Thyme.

414
00:37:59,982 --> 00:38:01,321
Get away from me.

415
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:04,717
You're burning up. Take a pill.
I've got it.

416
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:05,703
Leave me alone.

417
00:38:05,706 --> 00:38:09,541
I want nothing to do with
you but look at you. Take it.

418
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:11,431
If so, leave me alone then.

419
00:38:11,432 --> 00:38:13,311
Stop being so stubborn, Thyme.

420
00:38:19,183 --> 00:38:22,871
You've attacked me... several times.

421
00:38:23,192 --> 00:38:24,571
How dare you?

422
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:26,199
Stop talking and take the medicine.

423
00:38:27,712 --> 00:38:29,692
You've forced me to take a pill before.

424
00:38:29,823 --> 00:38:31,503
I only take prescribed medicines.

425
00:38:31,528 --> 00:38:34,596
I didn't know what to do.
What else could I have done?

426
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,871
Why are there so many things?

427
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,671
So many stupid stories.

428
00:38:45,037 --> 00:38:46,671
You've got too many stories.

429
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,881
Of course there are so many.

430
00:38:56,662 --> 00:38:59,471
I've laid on your lap before.

431
00:39:00,302 --> 00:39:02,391
At the fire escape.

432
00:39:03,482 --> 00:39:06,391
No,

433
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:09,352
on the sofa at my house.

434
00:39:17,762 --> 00:39:20,111
That...

435
00:39:21,462 --> 00:39:25,992
You...

436
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,832
You gave me my first kiss.

437
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:42,431
You remember everything. Jerk.

438
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:50,391
Thyme.

439
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,031
What's wrong?

440
00:39:57,634 --> 00:39:59,831
What's wrong with me?

441
00:40:06,254 --> 00:40:08,743
I hurt you again.

442
00:40:15,003 --> 00:40:16,379
I'm sorry.

443
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:23,111
Thank you.

444
00:40:27,412 --> 00:40:29,111
You're back.

445
00:40:31,712 --> 00:40:33,811
Cry baby.

446
00:40:33,812 --> 00:40:36,431
Don't cry.

447
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:40,871
Guys.

448
00:40:45,452 --> 00:40:46,212
(Thyme added a story.)

449
00:40:46,212 --> 00:40:46,812
(Who's the girl?)

450
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:47,472
(Is it Gorya?)

451
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:48,492
(Thyme's back.)

452
00:40:55,326 --> 00:40:56,711
Holy!

453
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,071
Kaning! Kaning!

454
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,068
(Thyme Akira has unveiled his boo.)

455
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:09,797
(Wish you an ever-lasting love.)

456
00:41:09,822 --> 00:41:10,822
(What a cute couple!)

457
00:41:51,863 --> 00:41:56,991
(Have you ever thought about
how ordinary teens like us)

458
00:41:57,462 --> 00:41:59,191
(can make a difference?)

459
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:01,541
(Maytee O Garden)

460
00:42:01,542 --> 00:42:02,963
(As for me...)

461
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:10,182
Today, I'm celebrating with a big
set to mark Gorya's last exam.

462
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:15,772
Who celebrates in the morning?

463
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,258
(After everything these past two years, )

464
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:21,431
(I go back to my normal life.)

465
00:42:21,982 --> 00:42:25,051
(My family has moved back
to live at Uncle Ga's)

466
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:27,221
(because our house is
still being renovated.)

467
00:42:27,222 --> 00:42:30,071
(This place is now very crowded.)

468
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,511
Sis, watch the news.

469
00:42:34,072 --> 00:42:38,119
This doesn't mean that this growth
is exclusive to Parama Group.

470
00:42:38,979 --> 00:42:43,271
(As for Thyme, after that
day, he traveled to USA)

471
00:42:43,586 --> 00:42:47,020
(for his dream of taking better
care of the Parama Group.)

472
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,792
I'll be gone for 4 years. Is
that the goodbye I deserve?

473
00:42:59,106 --> 00:43:01,031
Wait for me.

474
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:06,611
(Actually, being apart from Thyme
makes me feel a bit lonely.)

475
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:12,711
(But seeing him grow from a
distance feels pretty good.)

476
00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:15,711
'Toll' my 'wood' and I'll 'toll' yours.

477
00:43:18,826 --> 00:43:21,031
(I guess.)

478
00:43:24,112 --> 00:43:27,111
I should've taught him more
Thai when he was a kid.

479
00:43:27,112 --> 00:43:28,831
Couldn't agree more.

480
00:43:30,622 --> 00:43:33,351
By the way, what do you
want to eat tomorrow?

481
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:37,911
How about a hotpot?

482
00:43:41,591 --> 00:43:43,427
You've been having a lot of hotpots lately.

483
00:43:46,702 --> 00:43:52,591
(Other F4 find the time to come see me.)

484
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,001
Hello, miss.

485
00:43:55,002 --> 00:43:57,951
Your cool private driver
is here to pick you up.

486
00:43:58,032 --> 00:44:00,951
You don't have to pick me
up every day, Kavin, MJ.

487
00:44:01,152 --> 00:44:02,831
I can take the bus to school.

488
00:44:02,832 --> 00:44:06,572
How else can I find an excuse to
see the juniors at the school?

489
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:11,032
More importantly, your boyfriend
gave us a firm word. Who'd dare?

490
00:44:12,185 --> 00:44:16,014
Rule No. 76, you have to give Gorya
a ride to and from school every day.

491
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:18,851
Don't let an incident where a guy
gives Gorya a ride ever happen.

492
00:44:18,852 --> 00:44:20,491
No one should be allowed to come near her.

493
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:23,031
If anyone adds her on
social media, block them.

494
00:44:23,032 --> 00:44:25,031
You can hack her cellphone.

495
00:44:25,511 --> 00:44:28,891
He can make a mess even when he's not here.

496
00:44:28,892 --> 00:44:31,791
But today is the last day.
I want to go by myself.

497
00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:35,791
Please let me do what I want.
You guys can go back.

498
00:44:36,532 --> 00:44:40,431
Fine. It's your choice today.

499
00:44:40,652 --> 00:44:42,391
See you at the prom.

500
00:44:42,392 --> 00:44:43,551
You're going to the prom?

501
00:44:43,552 --> 00:44:47,281
The director invited us so
we thought we'd drop by.

502
00:44:47,306 --> 00:44:49,781
Are all of you going?

503
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:53,637
We are. We don't know about Thyme.

504
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,501
Why? Do you miss him?

505
00:44:55,502 --> 00:44:59,742
Miss him? Who would miss that guy?

506
00:44:59,972 --> 00:45:01,911
Go back. I'll go to school.

507
00:45:02,121 --> 00:45:06,371
Hold on. Since we're here,
let us wish you good luck.

508
00:45:06,372 --> 00:45:08,062
Hope you will get the top mark.

509
00:45:09,112 --> 00:45:10,521
Amen.

510
00:45:10,522 --> 00:45:11,522
Hope you'll do well.

511
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:21,552
(Although a bit chaotic, my life
in general is quite normal.)

512
00:45:23,132 --> 00:45:25,311
(No more red card.)

513
00:45:29,432 --> 00:45:35,751
(Bullying is there but not as severe.)

514
00:45:36,807 --> 00:45:42,951
(Before I know it, everything
that has happened is a memory.)

515
00:45:52,362 --> 00:45:54,191
I thought you'd be here.

516
00:45:56,652 --> 00:46:00,391
Ren, what are you doing here?

517
00:46:00,682 --> 00:46:04,471
I thought I'd do some drawing,
and I've brought you this.

518
00:46:07,594 --> 00:46:09,751
Thyme sent this for your prom.

519
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,751
He goes big again.

520
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:15,751
It's good that you're here.

521
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:19,871
This is the last payment.

522
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:24,106
I told you no rush.

523
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:28,231
Just take it. I've been working
hard to pay off what I owe you.

524
00:46:33,114 --> 00:46:35,831
What are you drawing?

525
00:46:40,785 --> 00:46:43,551
Thought I'd draw everyone...

526
00:46:45,912 --> 00:46:48,631
as a present for Mira's wedding.

527
00:46:48,922 --> 00:46:51,536
Is she getting married?

528
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,871
Next month.

529
00:46:58,724 --> 00:47:00,071
May I?

530
00:47:02,995 --> 00:47:07,711
(Everyone's life is getting back on track.)

531
00:47:09,002 --> 00:47:13,991
(I think my teenage life will
finally see some happiness now.)

532
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,599
Move out?

533
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,191
Yes, I already told them.

534
00:47:26,392 --> 00:47:30,391
You and your brain. This is not
something you should forget.

535
00:47:30,652 --> 00:47:34,511
How are we going to do this?
Gorya has a prom to go to.

536
00:47:34,512 --> 00:47:38,921
No problem. The three of
us can do it without her.

537
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,712
Take a look at this.

538
00:47:40,789 --> 00:47:44,370
I'm so strong. I can replace Gorya.

539
00:47:49,191 --> 00:47:51,672
I got it. I can't lower my back.

540
00:47:54,012 --> 00:47:55,341
Dad.

541
00:47:55,342 --> 00:47:57,352
Just kidding.

542
00:48:01,442 --> 00:48:06,471
Thanks, dear. I'll drive this to...

543
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,336
No problem, Dad. I'll make the delivery.

544
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:09,485
Can you do it?

545
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:10,911
Sure.

546
00:48:19,212 --> 00:48:20,711
Let's go.

547
00:48:34,348 --> 00:48:38,034
Ren, aren't you going to
take photos with them?

548
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,392
They want your pictures.

549
00:48:42,494 --> 00:48:44,391
No.

550
00:48:48,372 --> 00:48:50,911
Is Gorya here? I haven't seen her.

551
00:48:51,549 --> 00:48:55,151
She must... be getting dressed up.

552
00:48:58,752 --> 00:49:01,771
Guys, do you want my help?

553
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,511
You have a bad back. Just sit tight.

554
00:49:04,512 --> 00:49:06,431
Mister, one more time.

555
00:49:06,592 --> 00:49:07,829
1, 2, 3.

556
00:49:12,086 --> 00:49:14,151
Thanks so much for your help!

557
00:49:15,812 --> 00:49:18,151
Gorya, you've helped us enough.

558
00:49:18,152 --> 00:49:19,443
Go to the prom.

559
00:49:19,447 --> 00:49:21,432
Thank you.

560
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:24,751
Sis, your dress!

561
00:49:42,352 --> 00:49:44,191
It's already 9 p.m.

562
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:45,991
What is she doing?

563
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:50,991
Sis!

564
00:49:51,647 --> 00:49:53,991
No answer.

565
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,831
Typical.

566
00:49:58,403 --> 00:50:01,391
Trouble finds Gorya until the last minute.

567
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:05,031
What if she couldn't make it?

568
00:50:05,374 --> 00:50:06,947
The prom is almost over.

569
00:50:06,972 --> 00:50:08,271
She will.

570
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:12,956
She has to.

571
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,272
Is the prom over?

572
00:50:35,373 --> 00:50:37,271
It is.

573
00:50:49,682 --> 00:50:55,432
(Finally, when other people
seem to move forward, )

574
00:50:57,223 --> 00:51:03,432
(an ordinary girl like me is the
only one who remains the same.)

575
00:51:04,782 --> 00:51:07,591
(Nothing has changed.)

576
00:52:23,812 --> 00:52:25,514
What are they up to this time?

577
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,260
Boo!

578
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,351
Is this yours?

579
00:52:38,362 --> 00:52:41,182
It's the red card so it's surely from us.

580
00:52:42,449 --> 00:52:45,751
Now that we're here, let's
take a walk down memory lane.

581
00:52:45,942 --> 00:52:49,872
The person who gave you the red
card is waiting for you inside.

582
00:52:51,382 --> 00:52:52,871
Come on.

583
00:52:54,692 --> 00:52:56,911
Come.

584
00:53:34,752 --> 00:53:38,231
Hey, why have you got here so late?

585
00:53:38,482 --> 00:53:40,350
Do you have to make me wait every time?

586
00:53:41,022 --> 00:53:44,111
What are you wearing?
Where's the dress I sent you?

587
00:53:44,967 --> 00:53:48,309
Sorry. I dropped it in the mud.

588
00:53:48,311 --> 00:53:49,665
In the mud?

589
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:57,311
Fine. This suits you anyway.

590
00:53:59,512 --> 00:54:02,106
What about you? You said you were busy.

591
00:54:02,111 --> 00:54:04,751
I am so this is all I can do.

592
00:54:05,652 --> 00:54:07,591
Why? Are you sad?

593
00:54:08,109 --> 00:54:13,271
It's your prom and your perfect
boyfriend isn't there with you.

594
00:54:14,127 --> 00:54:17,521
No. You have to work.

595
00:54:17,522 --> 00:54:23,341
Hold on. If anyone else had to go to
the prom alone, they'd be miserable.

596
00:54:23,342 --> 00:54:26,191
That's their deal. I'm fine.

597
00:54:26,412 --> 00:54:29,127
No, no.

598
00:54:29,129 --> 00:54:31,471
You haven't seen your boyfriend for a year.
Aren't you a little sad?

599
00:54:31,472 --> 00:54:34,191
Fine. I'm a little sad.

600
00:54:36,013 --> 00:54:37,711
Just a little?

601
00:54:38,421 --> 00:54:44,933
What if I could clear
all my schedule and I...

602
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,955
What are you going on and on about?

603
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,914
Stop with this babbling already.

604
00:54:49,918 --> 00:54:51,191
Enough.

605
00:54:51,216 --> 00:54:52,216
Wait a sec.

606
00:54:52,412 --> 00:54:56,551
Wait, Thyme. Aren't you in the US?

607
00:54:56,865 --> 00:54:58,551
How can they...

608
00:55:02,443 --> 00:55:04,791
This is my girlfriend's prom.

609
00:55:06,432 --> 00:55:07,991
How can I skip it?

610
00:55:11,238 --> 00:55:13,791
I have to be here.

611
00:55:38,292 --> 00:55:42,671
You know how difficult it
is to clear out my schedule.

612
00:55:43,022 --> 00:55:45,671
Jerk, what a surprise.

613
00:55:45,872 --> 00:55:48,431
This is not the surprise.

614
00:55:48,842 --> 00:55:50,112
This is.

615
00:56:03,352 --> 00:56:05,071
I asked all your friends to stay on.

616
00:56:05,522 --> 00:56:08,471
It wouldn't be a prom otherwise, would it?

617
00:56:09,572 --> 00:56:12,391
Your habit of going big can't be fixed.

618
00:56:12,672 --> 00:56:14,072
Of course not.

619
00:56:18,912 --> 00:56:21,312
I have something very
important to talk to you about.

620
00:56:24,512 --> 00:56:27,152
Sorry for making you wait this long.

621
00:56:28,736 --> 00:56:33,151
But I've sorted out all the work in the US.

622
00:56:35,446 --> 00:56:37,311
It means...

623
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:40,311
It means I've accomplished my dream.

624
00:56:44,926 --> 00:56:47,431
And I'm ready.

625
00:56:49,802 --> 00:56:51,912
Now it's up to you.

626
00:56:52,782 --> 00:56:54,911
Gorya.

627
00:57:10,129 --> 00:57:13,791
But if you want to continue your study
first and won't be ready until then,

628
00:57:14,372 --> 00:57:15,791
go for it.

629
00:57:16,574 --> 00:57:18,511
But don't take too long.

630
00:57:19,252 --> 00:57:21,472
Why that face?

631
00:57:24,982 --> 00:57:27,391
What? Why are you booing?

632
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,791
You got no clue. That is so you.

633
00:57:37,614 --> 00:57:43,511
Since everyone is here, let's celebrate.

634
00:58:02,652 --> 00:58:10,111
(Thinking about it, life is funny.)

635
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:19,911
(Sometimes it takes you to face so
many things when you're not ready.)

636
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:27,951
(But because of that, you meet new people.)

637
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:32,791
(You fight, )

638
00:58:33,323 --> 00:58:35,711
(make mistakes, )

639
00:58:36,696 --> 00:58:38,791
(try to understand, )

640
00:58:40,237 --> 00:58:42,232
(learn, )

641
00:58:43,712 --> 00:58:46,231
(and grow.)

642
00:58:47,292 --> 00:58:52,832
(A group of people has
helped me grow the most.)

643
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:56,311
(It's them.)

644
00:58:58,736 --> 00:59:06,671
(First, MJ - Methas Jarustiwa, an
heir of an influential businessman)

645
00:59:07,492 --> 00:59:11,951
(who loves good fun and puts
his friends first and foremost.)

646
00:59:15,372 --> 00:59:21,071
(It's no surprise behind
his scary mask of a mafia, )

647
00:59:22,362 --> 00:59:24,951
(there lies a sensitive side.)

648
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:40,591
(Kavin Taemiyaklin Kittiyangkul,
a playboy of noble blood.)

649
00:59:41,063 --> 00:59:44,791
(The more I get to know him, the
more I see his delicate side, )

650
00:59:47,172 --> 00:59:48,751
(his sensitive side.)

651
00:59:52,012 --> 00:59:55,041
What's up, everyone? Want to come see me?

652
00:59:55,066 --> 00:59:58,811
(No matter how people
see him on the outside, )

653
01:00:01,402 --> 01:00:09,402
(deep down he's warmer and more
committed than anyone would expect.)

654
01:00:20,172 --> 01:00:26,471
(Ren - Renrawin Aira, my first
love who's out of my reach.)

655
01:00:27,537 --> 01:00:31,311
(An artist who leaves anyone
guessing what's on his mind.)

656
01:00:33,222 --> 01:00:39,231
(It must be fate that has taken
us through so much together.)

657
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:46,271
(Finally, he's someone who can
see right through me the most.)

658
01:00:49,072 --> 01:00:51,631
(Even though I don't
understand him at all, )

659
01:00:52,302 --> 01:00:59,232
(what's certain is that Ren's
journey ahead will be beautiful.)

660
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:05,151
Ready?

661
01:01:14,482 --> 01:01:16,951
(The last person, )

662
01:01:17,192 --> 01:01:25,192
(Thyme - Akira Paramaanantra,
head of F4 and my nemesis.)

663
01:01:26,352 --> 01:01:31,711
(It's this guy who has turned my
life upside down and inside out.)

664
01:01:32,002 --> 01:01:37,232
(And because of him, I've
learned that the strongest thing)

665
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:41,111
(isn't money or power.)

666
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,232
(It's heart.)

667
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:50,471
(After all that we've been
through, good and bad, )

668
01:01:52,212 --> 01:01:54,992
(I am sure...)

669
01:01:57,428 --> 01:02:01,791
(...that his heart has
won me over completely.)

670
01:02:06,902 --> 01:02:13,286
Alright. Now it's time
for ten seconds in heaven.

671
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:16,581
We will turn off the lights.

672
01:02:19,546 --> 01:02:22,272
Do whatever you want.

673
01:02:23,002 --> 01:02:24,627
Ready?

674
01:02:27,332 --> 01:02:29,794
I'll count it down.

675
01:02:30,303 --> 01:02:34,791
(Have you ever thought about
how ordinary teens like us)

676
01:02:35,642 --> 01:02:37,351
(can make a difference?)

677
01:02:37,352 --> 01:02:38,791
10

678
01:02:42,472 --> 01:02:43,347
9

679
01:02:43,372 --> 01:02:49,431
(But I do believe that if you
fight with all your heart.)

680
01:02:51,038 --> 01:02:54,951
(If we fight with all our hearts, )

681
01:02:58,973 --> 01:03:00,572
(miracles will happen.)

682
01:03:07,761 --> 01:03:15,431
(And the miracle can be
something valuable, )

683
01:03:17,432 --> 01:03:23,932
(something that makes your heart
race the fastest like nothing else.)

684
01:03:23,936 --> 01:03:24,942
3

685
01:03:28,642 --> 01:03:29,942
2

686
01:03:32,692 --> 01:03:34,511
1

687
01:03:36,032 --> 01:03:37,422
0

688
01:03:50,412 --> 01:03:54,182
The Secret Story of Iris

689
01:03:54,282 --> 01:03:55,911
Enough.

690
01:03:56,462 --> 01:03:58,036
It's you who broke Aum's leg, huh?

691
01:03:58,037 --> 01:03:59,511
Don't!

692
01:04:05,062 --> 01:04:06,751
What's going on?

693
01:04:08,355 --> 01:04:10,811
I can't have any trouble on my turf.

694
01:04:10,812 --> 01:04:13,670
Daddy, these people picked on me.

695
01:04:13,671 --> 01:04:15,163
You started it.

696
01:04:15,164 --> 01:04:16,668
Give them hell, Daddy.

697
01:04:16,669 --> 01:04:18,751
Let them know who's the boss here.

698
01:04:21,822 --> 01:04:24,751
Yes, who's the boss here?

699
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:26,671
Mr. Kavin, please.

700
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:31,132
These boys don't know any better.

701
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:34,111
Apologize if you don't want
to drag all of us down.

702
01:04:35,182 --> 01:04:36,311
I'm sorry.

703
01:04:39,573 --> 01:04:42,831
(And that's the last time I had KFC.)

704
01:04:44,555 --> 01:04:45,945
You had fun?

705
01:04:49,366 --> 01:04:51,271
We must look like fools to you.

706
01:04:52,742 --> 01:04:54,351
- Aum...
- Stop coming here.

707
01:04:55,468 --> 01:04:57,456
I don't want to see you anymore.

708
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,671
(After that, no one came to this court.)

709
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:06,711
(I never saw Aum again.)

710
01:05:07,016 --> 01:05:10,351
All I could do is going
back to my normal life.

711
01:05:10,856 --> 01:05:13,831
What's Aum first name?

712
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:18,631
Natnada. Sounds familiar.

713
01:05:18,652 --> 01:05:21,342
(Natnada Saentaweesuk)

714
01:05:21,367 --> 01:05:23,928
Wow, she looks so cool.

715
01:05:32,592 --> 01:05:36,831
I'm so sorry for what I did.

716
01:05:38,305 --> 01:05:41,911
I was stupid. Why would I be mad at you?

717
01:05:43,823 --> 01:05:45,182
I'm sorry too.

718
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:55,191
Every time I pass by here,
I think about the old days.

719
01:05:55,441 --> 01:05:58,397
It would be nice to play
hoops together again.

720
01:05:58,398 --> 01:06:02,431
In that case, the loser must pay.

721
01:06:17,287 --> 01:06:19,554
Director: We filmed the
last scene on the last day.

722
01:06:19,555 --> 01:06:21,412
It feels very satisfying.

723
01:06:23,936 --> 01:06:25,754
It's a wrap for F4 Thailand.

724
01:06:25,755 --> 01:06:28,191
Finally!
