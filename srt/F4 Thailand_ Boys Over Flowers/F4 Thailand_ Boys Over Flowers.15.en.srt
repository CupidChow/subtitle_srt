1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,239
I have terminal cancer.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,719
Your mother paid me

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,839
to end the relationship.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,459
I never thought to see so much money.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,099
Are you still looking for Gorya?

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,299
The global economic slowdown causes

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,542
the Parama Group's stock to take a dive.

8
00:00:22,546 --> 00:00:24,989
We're meeting with Si Chen
Corporation in 2 days.

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,410
I have a big assignment for you.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,299
I know where Gorya is.

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,699
(Life is funny.)

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,459
(You thought you had escaped somewhere
so far nobody would find you.)

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,719
Why are you doing this? Back off!

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,019
(But actually, )

15
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,739
(I never escaped at all.)

16
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,099
(Thinking about the world 'countryside', )

17
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,379
(what comes to mind?)

18
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,479
Gorya!

19
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,509
I'm coming.

20
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,970
It's broken again, huh?

21
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,749
(For me, it's full of struggle...)

22
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,130
Ouch! Sis!

23
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,273
(…exhaustion.)

24
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,320
Gorya!

25
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,263
Yes, Dad. I'm coming.

26
00:02:28,288 --> 00:02:29,057
(Double exhaustion.)

27
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,309
How could it be wrong?

28
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,250
Fine. Take it.

29
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:33,389
That's right.

30
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,930
(Triple exhaustion!)

31
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,898
I'm so exhausted.

32
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:39,462
You were awesome today, dear.

33
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:43,459
Guys, Gorya did something awesome today.

34
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,622
She talked Pick into
not reducing our price.

35
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:49,969
Instead of praising me, I should ask you

36
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,999
how you could let him
reduce the price like that.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,899
There's a market price.

38
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,719
Don't let them bleed you dry.

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,459
You speak so eloquently. You
must have surpassed your dad.

40
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:03,579
Not that. I just want to make things right.

41
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,579
He paid in full, right, Dad?

42
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:09,500
Er… Yes, dear.

43
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,969
That's good. If you have money left,

44
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,709
you can retrieve your
ring from the pawn shop.

45
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,519
No need. It's not that important.

46
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,819
The money we got isn't
enough to pay for the ring.

47
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,759
You can sell my things.

48
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,799
I know you still keep my school uniforms.

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,129
Those can't be sold.

50
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,419
Why?

51
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,419
Because your dad and I know deep down

52
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,419
you don't want to throw them away.

53
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,689
Gorya,

54
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,989
to this day, we still have no idea

55
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,306
why you dropped out and came here.

56
00:03:56,122 --> 00:03:58,139
Gorya.

57
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:03,222
Even though you never tell us,

58
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,819
I can feel you can't bring
yourself to throw it away.

59
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,699
Let's wait until you are certain.

60
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,909
These things take time.

61
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,899
Don't worry. Your mom and I can wait.

62
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,519
Hey! The music show is on.
Change the channel.

63
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,819
- What are you doing?
- Don't do it like that. Press it like this.

64
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,789
- I want to watch some drama.
- I'm watching the music show.

65
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,823
Glakao! Even jumped across the food?

66
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,219
(Although the countryside is
not all it's cracked up to be, )

67
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:47,299
(it's not bad at all.)

68
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,179
(It must be true what they say.)

69
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,459
(Growing up into adulthood is
about accepting good things…)

70
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,019
What's the matter, Dad?

71
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,170
You go instead of me.

72
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,220
Gentle, Mom!

73
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,096
(…and overcome all the challenges)

74
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:14,370
(no matter how bad they are.)

75
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,029
What? You said you'd
buy at the market price.

76
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,289
This is a lot less.

77
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,409
It's the market price.

78
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,056
But I have to deduct what you owe.

79
00:05:30,057 --> 00:05:32,419
Don't be tricky.

80
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,419
What we owe?

81
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,419
What are you talking about?

82
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,779
Haven't your dad told you?

83
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,970
Here's the thing.

84
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,189
Your aunt swindled people out of
hundreds of thousands and disappeared.

85
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,610
Your dad has to pay off
the debt in her place.

86
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,195
Honestly, the landlords are
looking to increase the rents.

87
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:04,959
The investors are reducing
prices paid to farmers.

88
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,579
Now is the time to act,

89
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,288
otherwise a debtor like
me will be in trouble too.

90
00:06:09,313 --> 00:06:11,450
(Legal quick cash – no guarantor required)

91
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,169
Warm milk to soothe your stomach.

92
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,100
Thank you.

93
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,560
Get some rest and find other things to do.

94
00:06:32,565 --> 00:06:36,539
Look at your eyebrows. They are
knitted together so tightly.

95
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,539
Let me give you a massage.

96
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,059
- Stop stressing out.
- Do the shoulders.

97
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,320
Stop stressing out. Stop stressing out.

98
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:49,849
I get it.

99
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,049
I'll find something else to do.
No more stress.

100
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,099
OK.

101
00:06:55,394 --> 00:06:57,099
Thank you.

102
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,330
(First celebration in years)

103
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,379
What are you doing, Uncle Ga?

104
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,779
Tada!

105
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,450
Go, Uncle Ga, go.

106
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,019
Let me take a picture of those two.

107
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,379
Uncle Ga, cheers.

108
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,050
Bye.

109
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,259
I know where Gorya is.

110
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:24,100
She went to Petchaburi
to be with her family.

111
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,099
She lays low.

112
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:31,263
No social media activity.

113
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:34,419
This is the info and map I found.

114
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,339
From my investigation,
she's struggling a lot.

115
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,171
It's been a year that she has to live…

116
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:47,939
You've come all this way

117
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,419
to tell me this small thing?

118
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,419
You said it yourself.

119
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:57,660
She keeps to herself.

120
00:08:57,685 --> 00:09:00,534
It means she doesn't want to see anyone.

121
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,016
Have you forgotten?

122
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,547
She's the one who cut me out of her life.

123
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,139
And I have changed.

124
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,499
Between me and her, there's nothing left.

125
00:09:13,357 --> 00:09:14,859
Really?

126
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,450
Really.

127
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,899
Haven't you seen my new world?

128
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,179
One year that I've lived here.

129
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,429
My life has nothing to do with hers.

130
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,979
Are you sure?

131
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,219
Your new world has
nothing to do with Gorya?

132
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,109
(The economy is experiencing a
prolonged slump with a domino effect.)

133
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,169
(As the real estate prices are rising,
its effects are felt in other sectors, )

134
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:43,920
(including consumer goods.)

135
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:47,459
The landlords are looking
to increase the rent.

136
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,250
The investors are reducing
prices paid to farmers.

137
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,579
Although you're far apart,

138
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:58,499
I believe that you two
still have a connection.

139
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:04,057
So?

140
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,049
What's the point of
telling me all this now?

141
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,869
How many times do I have to repeat it?

142
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,599
She dumped me.

143
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,919
She's the one who took the
money and chose that life.

144
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,819
Thyme.

145
00:10:16,371 --> 00:10:20,730
If Gorya was a gold-digger and
had taken your mom's money,

146
00:10:21,182 --> 00:10:23,580
she would never live the way she does now.

147
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,579
Think carefully, Thyme.

148
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,799
Get out. I have some work to do.

149
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,369
Thyme.

150
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,369
You're fooling yourself, you know.

151
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,219
Damn it! What do you want?

152
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:48,339
I want you two to be happy.

153
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,419
I am happy.

154
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,419
Whether Gorya is happy or not

155
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:58,420
is none of my business.

156
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,419
If you care so much about her,

157
00:11:03,146 --> 00:11:04,929
go see her yourself.

158
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,699
That's what you do, right?

159
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,074
Remember what I told you.

160
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,034
If you choose the wrong path,
I won't step aside anymore.

161
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,164
Don't do something you'll regret.

162
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:26,849
It's a lot.

163
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,939
- Let's talk first.
- Please stop.

164
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:33,375
What's going on? Please remain calm.

165
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,479
I can't stay calm. Where's
the money you promised to pay?

166
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:37,792
I haven't seen a single baht.

167
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:40,379
Where? Where's the money?

168
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,209
I don't have any right now.

169
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,959
If you don't have it, get some
from your mega-rich son-in-law.

170
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,759
Yeah.

171
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,100
Get money from your boyfriend.

172
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,185
That's his money. This is my debt.

173
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,160
I can't let them…

174
00:12:56,161 --> 00:12:59,534
How much do my parents owe you?

175
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,669
Over 200,000 baht in total.

176
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,539
200,000?

177
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,447
Mom, how could you borrow this much money?

178
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:09,296
I don't even know if we can
pay them back in this lifetime.

179
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:10,519
There's an easy way out.

180
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,609
Get money from your boyfriend to pay us.

181
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,579
Right?

182
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,279
Even if they don't have
it, let's raid their house.

183
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,580
There must be valuable things there.
Let's go!

184
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,899
Thyme isn't here yet?

185
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,370
Pruek, come find Thyme with me.

186
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:27,339
Stop!

187
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,710
Why are you doing this? Back off!

188
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,443
(Life is funny.)

189
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:43,630
(I ran away from everything
so far nobody would find me.)

190
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,259
Sis! Are you hurt?

191
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:58,434
(But when trouble comes, deep down I…)

192
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,853
Whose car is this?

193
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:19,485
Sorry. I just finished
preparing the documents.

194
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:21,493
Is the meeting about to start?

195
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,299
Yes. Follow me.

196
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:49,900
Ren.

197
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,219
How did you get here?

198
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,413
Is this the rich boyfriend who
will help pay off the debts?

199
00:16:14,862 --> 00:16:17,289
Yes, that's me.

200
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,290
Ren!

201
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:22,272
It seems like they owe everyone some money.

202
00:16:22,277 --> 00:16:23,739
Let me pay it now.

203
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,740
How much?

204
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:27,659
230,000 baht in total. Do you have it?

205
00:16:32,762 --> 00:16:35,516
There you go. Are you going to negotiate?

206
00:16:36,725 --> 00:16:38,144
Let me get some cash from the car.

207
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:51,294
What kind of person has
this much cash on him?

208
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,179
Thank you.

209
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:06,659
Ren.

210
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,779
Before we talk, why
don't you clean up first?

211
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,780
See, you've got stains all over.

212
00:17:15,922 --> 00:17:17,779
About the money,

213
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:20,099
pay me back over time.

214
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,139
I know you don't want any help.

215
00:17:23,681 --> 00:17:25,619
But this time

216
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:29,657
let me be selfish.

217
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,862
How did you find me?

218
00:17:42,865 --> 00:17:44,979
I saw you on TV

219
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:47,199
so I stopped by.

220
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,588
Why? Is it strange?

221
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:51,099
It is.

222
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,979
You showed up out of the blue

223
00:17:53,361 --> 00:17:55,139
to save me just in time.

224
00:17:55,899 --> 00:17:58,939
You must already know that I'm in trouble.

225
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,099
Ren, let me be clear.

226
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,859
It was my decision to move here.

227
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,419
I made up my mind to stop being a child.

228
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,420
If you come here to take me back,

229
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:16,945
I won't.

230
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,139
I didn't say I'd bring you back.

231
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,699
What do you want?

232
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,259
Now?

233
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,490
Yummy food sounds good.

234
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,739
Food?

235
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,422
You drove all the way
from Bangkok by yourself?

236
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:46,445
Yes.

237
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,019
Well done. You didn't get lost.

238
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,539
What about accommodation?

239
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,419
I haven't booked any.

240
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,189
I'm not sure if you can find one now.

241
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:57,019
Why don't you stay here?

242
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,183
This is the best thing I could find.

243
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:01,609
Don't know if you will like it.

244
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,510
Carbonara topped with bacon.

245
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,310
You wouldn't normally put so
much work into your cooking.

246
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,819
If you make it, it must be delicious.

247
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,229
Let's go, dear. We should
prepare a room for Ren.

248
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,230
That's right.

249
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,605
Hold on, Ren hasn't said…

250
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,019
Yes.

251
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,207
I want to stay here.

252
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,179
Can I?

253
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:40,099
You can stay here for as long as you want.

254
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:43,739
I won't go back then.

255
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,554
Funny.

256
00:19:45,555 --> 00:19:48,008
Eat and stop joking around.

257
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,499
I don't get you at all.

258
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,439
Si Chen Corp employees,
both Thai and foreigners,

259
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,069
as well as the suppliers
of the Parama Group

260
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,840
have gathered to rally in
front of the Parama Building…

261
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:21,079
…to oppose the decision to
remove them from a project

262
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,078
which could cause the sudden closure
of Si Chen and many other companies.

263
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,291
You can't do this.

264
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:31,783
Don't you remember?

265
00:20:31,808 --> 00:20:33,805
Who helped you when you were in Singapore?

266
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,840
How could you let him in? Get him out.

267
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:37,056
Release me.

268
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:39,299
I invested in your company,

269
00:20:39,324 --> 00:20:41,010
How can you do this to me!

270
00:20:41,035 --> 00:20:42,502
Let me go.

271
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:44,885
Please,

272
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:47,861
at least give us some compensation.

273
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:49,674
We've started work.

274
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:51,775
Accoridng to the MOU,

275
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:56,150
please we need our compensation,
or my company will go bankrupt.

276
00:20:56,781 --> 00:20:59,740
Beef up security. Don't
let his happen again.

277
00:20:59,806 --> 00:21:01,478
Give me a compensation.

278
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:04,283
I'm not asking for too much.

279
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:05,322
Let me go!

280
00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:07,486
Let me go, release me.

281
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:08,814
Let me go.

282
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:09,869
Release me.

283
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,869
People like you should die.

284
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:13,728
Let me go!

285
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,119
People like you should die.

286
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:31,079
Mother, shouldn't we pay the compensation?

287
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,099
It's business.

288
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,129
Go back and focus on your work.

289
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,542
Don't pay attention to
people who don't matter.

290
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:47,379
But Si Chen Corp has been
with us for a long time.

291
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,379
Long time?

292
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,659
So what?

293
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,979
Do you think relationships and
business are one and the same?

294
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,780
If relationships help, when
the Parama Group is in trouble,

295
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,299
can you think of any
friend who could help us?

296
00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:23,499
See? In the end, people are
ready to turn their backs

297
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,659
even on their friends.

298
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:57,310
Shit! It's late! It's late!

299
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,170
Mom, why didn't anyone wake me up?

300
00:23:06,003 --> 00:23:07,035
What is this?

301
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,989
Ren could see that you're tired

302
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,659
so he's been doing chores
since early morning.

303
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,539
Look at all the food.
Ren prepared everything.

304
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,059
He's wonderful.

305
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,939
If you don't like this, go
and sort it out with him.

306
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,499
Ren, you don't need to go
through all this trouble.

307
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,379
I told you… I won't go back to Bangkok.

308
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,349
So I should be able to do all this.

309
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,499
Speaking of which, let me
stay here and work for a day.

310
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:55,279
Ren, this is a hard place.
We're not farmstay.

311
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,619
It's real life. The real deal.

312
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,259
Let's make a bet.

313
00:24:03,564 --> 00:24:06,619
If I can do it, you'll
have to do what I ask.

314
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,339
There you go. You want me
to go back to Bangkok, huh?

315
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,339
It's not that.

316
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,779
Let's go.

317
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,850
Can you row?

318
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,890
I should ask you.

319
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:31,727
Be careful.

320
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:37,179
How is this ripe? It's not.
It should be yellow when ripe.

321
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,980
They'd make such a sweet couple.

322
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,099
Oh.

323
00:24:46,162 --> 00:24:47,259
It's stuck.

324
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,838
We can try to turn it this way.

325
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,339
Oh!

326
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,430
Wow!

327
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,950
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much, our newest worker.

328
00:25:06,901 --> 00:25:07,825
So?

329
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:12,019
Well, you've done alright so far.

330
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,899
But don't get cocky just yet.

331
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,259
The hardest part is selling
these at the market…

332
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,259
140 baht, please.

333
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,259
Thank you.

334
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,970
(Coconut 20 baht) /
(Durian 120 baht per kg)

335
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,939
Geez, this is cheating.

336
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,019
Talk about pretty privilege!

337
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,054
I did not expect that at all.

338
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,099
Sorry.

339
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,102
Saying that makes him even more attractive.

340
00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:54,459
So?

341
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,939
We can call off the bet.

342
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:02,219
No. If I lose, I lose.

343
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,219
What do you want me to do?

344
00:26:06,912 --> 00:26:11,819
Now that we have time
left today, how about we…

345
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,099
go on a date?

346
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,124
Sis! Sis! The sea!

347
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,020
Glakao, don't run.

348
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,040
You're acting like you've
never seen the sea before.

349
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,459
Of all the places you could've taken me,

350
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,259
the sea really?

351
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,260
Since you moved here,

352
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,459
you haven't spent any
time to relax, have you?

353
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:43,579
Isn't it strange being
so close to the beach?

354
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,309
I have to work.

355
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,529
As I mentioned, adult life isn't anything

356
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,099
like when we were kids, Ren.

357
00:26:52,605 --> 00:26:54,199
I don't have time to hang out.

358
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,219
Who says you can't hang
out when you're an adult?

359
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:07,259
Even though you've grown
up, you can still be Gorya.

360
00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:11,539
The Gorya who yells out loud.

361
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,139
The Gorya who can't seem to escape trouble.

362
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,139
The Gorya who…

363
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,849
gets wet all the time.

364
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:30,259
Ren, don't. I know what you're thinking.

365
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,259
OK, I won't.

366
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,549
Let me do it then!

367
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,550
No!

368
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,219
No!

369
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,559
You know what, Ren,

370
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,339
since she moved here, she's
become a different person.

371
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,699
I've never seen her smile
like this in a long while.

372
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,819
Thank you so much for today.

373
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:50,339
Honestly, being here can
never make her happy.

374
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,339
All she does is find money to pay off debt.

375
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:56,199
She doesn't go to school.

376
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,379
On the friend front… she has none.

377
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,699
I don't want her to get stuck here.

378
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,299
Seriously.

379
00:29:12,795 --> 00:29:14,379
No.

380
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,099
No matter where you are,
which social circle you're in,

381
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,099
trouble can always find you.

382
00:29:27,802 --> 00:29:31,980
Mother, I've seen the Lois that
you submitted to new investors.

383
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,404
And?

384
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,879
Thyme, you must have no idea that

385
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,859
she approached investors

386
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,459
to mobilize funds to
create 3 new subsidiaries.

387
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,625
They will replace our suppliers,

388
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,170
…including Si Chen Corporation.

389
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:55,062
When we told them the project was canceled,

390
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,579
that's a lie, Mother?

391
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,679
Of course. Do you really think

392
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,899
I'll let a mega-project
like this be put on hold?

393
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:07,899
What's wrong with it?

394
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:11,014
We must get rid of the weak link anyway.

395
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,939
Most importantly, I've mobilized the funds.

396
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:17,979
Everybody was on board with my policy.

397
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,300
If everything goes smoothly tomorrow,

398
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,059
the Parama Group will be even greater.

399
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,459
Thyme, are you just going
to do nothing this time?

400
00:30:31,941 --> 00:30:36,579
No. Deep down you must already know

401
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:38,657
that it has to turn out this way.

402
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,819
I taught you myself.

403
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:48,321
You know that this is the
best way for the Parama Group.

404
00:30:50,727 --> 00:30:52,779
And you should stop your pipe dream

405
00:30:53,229 --> 00:30:56,699
of Thyme running the business
the way you believe in.

406
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,899
He is more ruthless than that.

407
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,650
Thyme.

408
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,954
How about this?

409
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:08,681
To launch the subsidiaries as planned,

410
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:11,619
we need only one more signature.

411
00:31:11,979 --> 00:31:14,389
The future of the Parama Group

412
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,019
will be determined by Thyme.

413
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,679
Thyme, are you just…

414
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,110
Stop talking.

415
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:23,579
Let him decide for himself.

416
00:31:27,422 --> 00:31:29,619
You get it, right, Thyme?

417
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,219
The minute you step into the adult world,

418
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,220
the power to make decisions is all yours.

419
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,940
Hello, Ren.

420
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:41,299
Where are you?

421
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,299
I'm at the market.

422
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,819
Can you come out to see me?

423
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,239
Right now?

424
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,579
Yes. I think I've made some decisions.

425
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,059
I want to be left alone.

426
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,400
I said… I want to be left alone.

427
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,859
Ren, what are you doing here?

428
00:33:50,802 --> 00:33:52,539
What's going on?

429
00:33:56,374 --> 00:33:58,339
I've been thinking.

430
00:34:00,594 --> 00:34:01,989
And I've figured it out.

431
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,019
Are you being all indie again?

432
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,499
Let me ask you something.

433
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:20,699
What is it like to live here?

434
00:34:23,488 --> 00:34:25,979
You will build your life
here for real, won't you?

435
00:34:28,926 --> 00:34:29,997
Mmm.

436
00:34:36,514 --> 00:34:38,130
This place is nice.

437
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,940
A lot of things force me to adjust.

438
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,419
But I'm getting the hang of it.

439
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:53,699
Most importantly, even
though living here is hard,

440
00:34:55,281 --> 00:34:58,099
I've decided not to go back.

441
00:34:58,806 --> 00:34:59,938
It will not be hard

442
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:06,019
if you have me here.

443
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,499
Ren, stop joking around.

444
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,662
You're not going to live here forever.

445
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,659
Why?

446
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:30,699
You don't belong to this place.

447
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:34,041
You have a life over there

448
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:36,419
waiting for you to go back to.

449
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:38,829
Why would you live here?

450
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,699
Don't try to analyze this.

451
00:35:45,607 --> 00:35:47,739
Just answer me.

452
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:52,819
One day may be a short time.

453
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,179
But you feel it, right?

454
00:35:57,163 --> 00:36:01,582
If you have me here, everything
will be better for you.

455
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,659
Yes.

456
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:14,113
Having you with me today
made my life a bit easier.

457
00:36:16,812 --> 00:36:19,648
But you don't want to jump
into it without thinking.

458
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:22,619
I've thought about it.

459
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,739
I've thought it through.

460
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,379
In this community,

461
00:36:36,288 --> 00:36:40,099
the nearest healthcare
facility is 21 km away.

462
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:42,874
Over there on that street,

463
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,780
there's a vacant lot
owned by someone I know.

464
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,297
It'd be good if I could
open a small clinic here.

465
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,859
The market owner is also looking to sell.

466
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:05,099
Your orchards just lack some management.

467
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,099
It will take time

468
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,059
but I could see it…

469
00:37:16,718 --> 00:37:23,260
how I can live here and
build a happy family…

470
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,379
…with you.

471
00:37:37,442 --> 00:37:39,539
I thought I'd take you back at first.

472
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:47,410
But being here makes me think

473
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:53,502
that going back will bring you
the same problems that hurt you.

474
00:37:55,350 --> 00:38:00,499
So if you say you want to live here,

475
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,500
I'm ready to support you.

476
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,539
You don't need to do anything.

477
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:17,539
Just add me into your life.

478
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,942
I'll make you happy.

479
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,179
Can I?

480
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,490
I can't make myself any clearer.

481
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,179
Wow.

482
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,219
That sounds amazing.

483
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:31,220
If you open a good affordable
clinic around here,

484
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,219
it will attract a lot of people.

485
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:44,622
The vacant land that you
mentioned is in a prime location.

486
00:39:46,124 --> 00:39:50,620
If you build a house there,

487
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,619
the view will be amazing.

488
00:39:56,451 --> 00:40:01,620
You will probably get a cute dog.

489
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,619
Everything sounds perfect

490
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,939
like a dream.

491
00:40:19,225 --> 00:40:20,899
But your dream…

492
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,939
…won't have me in it.

493
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,939
I'm sorry.

494
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,819
Spending today together,

495
00:40:52,648 --> 00:40:54,977
weren't you happy?

496
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:59,819
Or is my dream too delusional?

497
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,379
Not at all, Ren.

498
00:41:06,301 --> 00:41:07,272
It's just…

499
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:09,410
Because deep down you know

500
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,410
even if your life here gets so much better,

501
00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:19,232
you don't want it.

502
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:24,682
Despite having run so far away,

503
00:41:26,677 --> 00:41:28,771
you never get over Thyme.

504
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,139
Because Thyme is your home.

505
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:50,379
Right?

506
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,410
I'm…

507
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,100
I'm the biggest idiot in the world.

508
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,179
Hey, I have something to show you.

509
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,845
Is this Thyme?

510
00:43:07,597 --> 00:43:08,855
What's going on?

511
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,929
Come on.

512
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,059
What kind of sick game are you playing?

513
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,259
Is this one of your pranks?

514
00:43:15,674 --> 00:43:18,851
Why are you showing this to me?

515
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:19,968
Just keep watching.

516
00:43:20,153 --> 00:43:22,692
It will help answer the question you have.

517
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:32,779
What kind of sick game
are you playing? Huh?

518
00:43:33,731 --> 00:43:35,137
Is this funny to you?

519
00:43:35,442 --> 00:43:38,083
Your mom has you heavily guarded.

520
00:43:38,737 --> 00:43:42,499
And if we hadn't tied you
up, you would've escaped us.

521
00:43:42,898 --> 00:43:44,671
How can I give you the lecture?

522
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,579
What lecture?

523
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:50,124
You're adults. Stop playing a child's game.

524
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:51,640
Adults, huh?

525
00:43:52,314 --> 00:43:54,619
If I had to grow up and be
the kind of adult you are,

526
00:43:56,914 --> 00:43:58,540
I'd rather not.

527
00:43:58,546 --> 00:44:01,859
The kind of adult who let bad things happen

528
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,859
in front of him without doing anything.

529
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,179
Is this the kind of adult you aspire to be?

530
00:44:09,912 --> 00:44:14,259
You know that your mother will talk
to all the new investors tomorrow.

531
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,489
If you let it happen,

532
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:23,499
she will dominate the whole country
with ruthless monopoly power.

533
00:44:28,586 --> 00:44:30,929
No one will be able to stop her.

534
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:34,659
Is this your idea of the
adult you want to be?

535
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,459
So?

536
00:44:36,484 --> 00:44:38,498
You think there's anything I can do?

537
00:44:38,523 --> 00:44:39,562
Let me go.

538
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,645
Let me go!

539
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,099
Stop it.

540
00:44:42,855 --> 00:44:46,089
And listen to our lecture carefully.

541
00:44:46,545 --> 00:44:51,860
We professors will give one
last lecture about love.

542
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,939
Love?

543
00:45:00,854 --> 00:45:04,619
- What's love got to do with anything?
- Because love is the only thing

544
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:10,462
that will help you become the
adult you're supposed to be.

545
00:45:19,841 --> 00:45:21,899
What are you babbling about?

546
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:25,219
Love has no place in this game.

547
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:31,619
Love gives you heart.

548
00:45:32,477 --> 00:45:36,960
A business with heart will help you survive

549
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:39,299
help everyone survive.

550
00:45:39,808 --> 00:45:43,659
That's the way the future should be.

551
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:51,339
Deep down that's what you think.

552
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,459
We know that you know how
to fix your mom's policy.

553
00:45:59,152 --> 00:46:00,992
You're just afraid.

554
00:46:00,997 --> 00:46:02,979
You're scared someone will betray you again

555
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,500
so it's hard for you to trust someone.

556
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,219
But believe us. It can be done.

557
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,179
Stop being so naïve.

558
00:46:23,396 --> 00:46:27,085
You're not me. You don't
understand nothing.

559
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,721
You know, for me,

560
00:46:29,727 --> 00:46:31,459
how risky it is to trust someone.

561
00:46:31,463 --> 00:46:34,459
Of course we understand.

562
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:37,756
We have businesses too.

563
00:46:37,757 --> 00:46:40,500
But I'm the only one who gets hurt.

564
00:46:40,555 --> 00:46:42,519
How could you understand?

565
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,520
You're not in my position.

566
00:46:43,521 --> 00:46:45,939
Who says you're the only one?

567
00:46:48,416 --> 00:46:52,699
You know what this means, right?

568
00:46:54,267 --> 00:46:55,619
You've got F4.

569
00:46:57,215 --> 00:47:01,313
Understand this. No matter
how risky your idea is,

570
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,899
we will support it.

571
00:47:06,145 --> 00:47:08,139
You know why?

572
00:47:08,921 --> 00:47:11,139
Because that's how much we love you.

573
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:17,615
Renew your faith in love, Thyme.

574
00:47:17,616 --> 00:47:21,579
The right kind of future is still possible.

575
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:26,899
Not only we but also everyone around you

576
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,659
will show you.

577
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,490
Mira.

578
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,139
Lita.

579
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:56,779
The world that your mom built…

580
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,219
we can change it.

581
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:05,694
Most importantly, if you
look hard enough, you'll see

582
00:48:06,868 --> 00:48:09,499
the fact that we've come this far,

583
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:16,539
we owe it all to a little girl

584
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,939
named Gorya.

585
00:48:22,226 --> 00:48:24,299
She has made significant changes.

586
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,540
Why can't we?

587
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,419
Stop fooling yourself

588
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:39,419
and believe your heart.

589
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,419
That's enough.

590
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:47,779
The rest is up to you

591
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,779
what you will do.

592
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:12,899
Whoa!

593
00:49:14,477 --> 00:49:15,508
Hey! Thyme.

594
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,727
Thyme, Thyme.

595
00:49:17,001 --> 00:49:18,001
Thyme!

596
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:19,800
Thyme. Easy.

597
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,306
It's still possible, right?

598
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,579
I can still make it happen, right?

599
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:47,219
Of course.

600
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,739
With everything,

601
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,699
including Gorya.

602
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,210
You still think of Gorya, don't you?

603
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,339
All the time.

604
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:09,339
Am I the biggest idiot in the world?

605
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,339
It wouldn't be you otherwise.

606
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:22,519
There. There. Stop crying.

607
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,779
You said you're an adult now.

608
00:50:23,804 --> 00:50:24,750
Let me see.

609
00:50:24,751 --> 00:50:26,430
An adult, huh?

610
00:50:38,345 --> 00:50:40,259
You said you're an idiot.

611
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,379
Looks like you're not alone.

612
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,259
Oh.

613
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,260
Your brother told me.

614
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,789
About Thyme's mother having cancer.

615
00:51:01,621 --> 00:51:04,620
My family takes care of all F4's families.

616
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,779
I see all the documents every year.

617
00:51:12,671 --> 00:51:14,540
If she had had cancer,

618
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,579
I would've known.

619
00:51:26,782 --> 00:51:28,212
I think you were duped.

620
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:39,090
(Aira Hospital)

621
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,626
Thyme, I'm so sorry.

622
00:51:49,628 --> 00:51:52,480
I'm the idiot, the biggest idiot of all.

623
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:54,119
I called you an idiot all the time,

624
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,099
but I'm actually the biggest idiot.

625
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,370
I'm so sorry.

626
00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:00,659
How could I have believed her? So stupid.

627
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,810
Gorya, you fool.

628
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,373
(Let me be your comfort in loneliness)

629
00:52:22,374 --> 00:52:26,000
(Let me take away your sadness)

630
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:30,733
(Let you know there's someone right here)

631
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:33,259
(In the wind)

632
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:36,940
(Cuz I'm too scared to say it)

633
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:57,899
Finally, we have straightened
things out with him.

634
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,299
All good here. How is it going over there?

635
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:03,299
Argh!

636
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,339
Ren, can we go to Bangkok now?

637
00:53:10,128 --> 00:53:11,319
Sure.

638
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,339
Let's go. Let's go right now. Come on.

639
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,090
(Very high energy over here.)

640
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,099
Let's go home.

641
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,699
When will he come out?

642
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,350
Why isn't Thyme here?

643
00:53:52,361 --> 00:53:55,819
Never mind. The document has been signed.

644
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:59,499
Well, with your permission, I'd
like to start the meeting now.

645
00:54:07,249 --> 00:54:09,249
Pardon me for arriving late.

646
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,219
I was up all night preparing the documents.

647
00:54:12,658 --> 00:54:14,056
What documents?

648
00:54:16,714 --> 00:54:20,852
I'd like for you to
reconsider the new policy.

649
00:54:25,454 --> 00:54:26,756
Do you think I'll just let you do this?

650
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,179
Let me speak, Mother.

651
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,499
For the last time.

652
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,436
I didn't know the issue was so serious.

653
00:54:47,828 --> 00:54:50,779
That's why Thyme has to make it right.

654
00:54:51,764 --> 00:54:53,524
There's no point staying here.

655
00:54:53,549 --> 00:54:56,476
Let's sneak inside. There's
a way in at the back.

656
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:04,179
Let's wait for Thyme inside.

657
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:36,214
All of you are aware of the reason
why we approached you for funding.

658
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:42,037
For me, the Parama Group has always been

659
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:46,209
a ruthless uncompromising company.

660
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:47,897
This time too.

661
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,499
When the global economy is weak,

662
00:55:51,836 --> 00:55:54,196
we need to get rid of our weak limbs.

663
00:55:55,490 --> 00:56:01,014
My mother, Roselyn, has a goal
to mobilize 7 billion baht

664
00:56:01,437 --> 00:56:04,859
to create subsidiaries to
replace the companies we removed.

665
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:07,547
We will have an
all-inclusive business model,

666
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,099
a full supply chain.

667
00:56:10,176 --> 00:56:17,233
Surely, our revenue will see
massive growth in just a few years.

668
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,380
But this is not the best policy.

669
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:35,259
My goal is to take 50% of the 7
billion to support all the suppliers.

670
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:42,980
All large-scale projects will
be suspended for 2 years.

671
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:46,579
This is not to increase the
revenue of the Parama Group

672
00:56:47,008 --> 00:56:48,988
but to give assistance to all the suppliers

673
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:51,659
so they will survive the economic crisis.

674
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,259
No one needs to lose a limb.

675
00:56:56,103 --> 00:56:57,779
Within 5 years,

676
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:02,794
our revenue will be as strong as before.

677
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,841
When our allies are back on their feet,

678
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:10,899
they will be a key force for more
important projects in the future.

679
00:57:14,183 --> 00:57:16,807
I know this may sound delusional

680
00:57:17,262 --> 00:57:19,712
and requires a lot of faith from you.

681
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:24,021
But it's possible.

682
00:57:25,974 --> 00:57:27,560
And this is proof.

683
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:39,543
The Taemiyaklin Family, JT
Group, and Aira Hospital Group,

684
00:57:40,783 --> 00:57:43,659
the three biggest capitals
in Thailand at the moment,

685
00:57:46,016 --> 00:57:49,690
are ready to pitch in 3 billion baht

686
00:57:56,177 --> 00:57:58,318
under one condition:

687
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:04,988
The Parama Group must follow
what I proposed earlier.

688
00:58:06,562 --> 00:58:08,175
This is a guarantee

689
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:11,619
that we may be able to go
beyond anyone's imagination.

690
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,509
The rest is up to you all.

691
00:58:18,112 --> 00:58:20,246
The picture may not be
pretty in terms of revenue.

692
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:22,859
But trust me.

693
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:29,339
I've learned that moving
forward without looking back

694
00:58:30,819 --> 00:58:32,652
can be quite a lonely journey.

695
00:58:35,206 --> 00:58:36,988
You feel it too that

696
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,459
being richer while the world
is crumbling around you

697
00:58:45,047 --> 00:58:46,903
is not the future you want.

698
00:58:50,143 --> 00:58:51,912
Let's take a step backward together.

699
00:58:52,957 --> 00:58:55,529
I promise that this step back

700
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:59,069
will be the best move in your life.

701
00:59:00,077 --> 00:59:06,049
And this is the path for the
Parama Group that I choose.

702
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,179
Are you with me?

703
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,699
Please stop.

704
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:50,019
I must apologize for
what has just happened.

705
00:59:51,516 --> 00:59:56,517
Look at the bright side, it
gives us a clearer picture

706
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:58,939
that we're on the right track…

707
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,605
Question?

708
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,735
No, I just want to say that

709
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,735
although his plan has some gaps,

710
01:00:06,945 --> 01:00:08,854
I want to put my money

711
01:00:09,411 --> 01:00:11,625
in the hands of someone
with that look in his eyes.

712
01:00:14,594 --> 01:00:17,979
My company would like to
support Mr. Akira's policy.

713
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:25,219
I agree.

714
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:27,139
I agree.

715
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:28,859
I agree.

716
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:30,859
I agree.

717
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,420
Can I have this document back?

718
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:05,090
(Gorya is on her way to see you.)

719
01:01:07,399 --> 01:01:11,196
Thyme, I can take it from here.

720
01:01:20,517 --> 01:01:24,589
With that, please allow me
to conclude the meeting.

721
01:01:31,685 --> 01:01:33,214
What's up?

722
01:01:33,499 --> 01:01:36,635
How about that! He did it!

723
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,339
Let's go.

724
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,059
Excuse me.

725
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:19,096
Here she comes.

726
01:02:19,121 --> 01:02:22,301
Is it true that all major investors
have rejected your proposal?

727
01:02:22,326 --> 01:02:24,846
Which will be the direction of
the Parama Group going forward?

728
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,169
That's enough for today.

729
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:32,019
Please excuse us. I'm sorry. Sorry.

730
01:03:47,917 --> 01:03:49,210
Thyme!

731
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,230
Thyme!

732
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:08,020
(As if the clock stops ticking)

733
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,330
The Secret Story of Iris

734
01:04:19,093 --> 01:04:21,220
You're ordering so much food.

735
01:04:21,552 --> 01:04:23,220
To celebrate when we win.

736
01:04:24,471 --> 01:04:25,886
This is Mr. MJ's order.

737
01:04:25,911 --> 01:04:26,917
Thank you.

738
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,499
One more stop and we go straight
to the basketball court.

739
01:04:34,139 --> 01:04:35,859
I ordered this to celebrate our win.

740
01:04:36,592 --> 01:04:38,363
But you can eat it now.

741
01:04:38,364 --> 01:04:40,019
We will win no matter when you eat.

742
01:04:49,591 --> 01:04:51,500
Before you talk about winning,

743
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,580
find your team members first.

744
01:04:54,787 --> 01:04:56,889
Who'd be stupid enough
to pick a fight with F4?

745
01:05:11,826 --> 01:05:14,619
I'll go back to work as soon
as my condition improves.

746
01:05:21,299 --> 01:05:22,822
Huh? What did you say?

747
01:05:28,127 --> 01:05:29,162
MJ!

748
01:05:38,477 --> 01:05:41,819
Being lousy didn't keep you from
challenging us to a match, huh?

749
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:45,179
Continue.

750
01:06:03,026 --> 01:06:05,107
You don't enjoy basketball, do you?

751
01:06:05,108 --> 01:06:06,759
You don't enjoy sports.

752
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,200
What you enjoy is a fight. Right?

753
01:06:25,618 --> 01:06:29,804
Guys, do you believe in making
a wish on a falling star?
