00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,181
Thank you.

3
00:00:03,181 --> 00:00:04,320
How is it that you're here?

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,060
I'm a student here.

5
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,300
My name is Talay.

6
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,900
People line up to buy such an expensive thing.

7
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,151
You don't need to try to understand rich people.

8
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,580
If I have to leave my family's business in someone's hand,

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,801
I want that someone to be Thyme.

10
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:22,601
Or maybe I have already loved him.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,960
Go back to your world.

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,560
I really think that if you can love her,

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,770
things should be easier.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,570
Thailand's weather… It rains whenever it wants.

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,470
Is it off-season rain again?

16
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,120
I hate this gloomy vibe.

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,980
It seems kind of depressing, right?

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,860
No, it's because we have no orders.

19
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,900
Graduation ceremonies are coming.

20
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,670
If universities cancel the whole thing because of floods, our shop will be doomed.

21
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,200
With that said, let's get back to work.

22
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,790
When this time of year comes, you can feel it.

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,030
A year has almost passed.

24
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,210
That's why you should hurry and do what you want to do.

25
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,960
Your youth is very short.

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,750
Don't waste your time hesitating. Okay?

27
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,400
I know.

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,910
But honestly, Na Ga,

29
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,610
some matters are very difficult to decide on.

30
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,770
For some matters, if we make just a tiny mistake...

31
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,490
Find him immediately!

32
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,230
it may result in huge consequences.

33
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:55,750
And if that happens, it would be devastating.

34
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,160
That's true.

35
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,630
But hear me out, Kaning.

36
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,330
Whether you make the right or wrong decision,

37
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,490
until we see the result with our eyes,

38
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,321
Hello.

39
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:19,901

What happened?

42
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,620
Sorry to disturb you.

43
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,750
I really don't know who else I can talk to.

44

45
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,530
Thyme came to see me at my place today.

46
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,720
Thyme,

47
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,370
what are you doing here so late?

48
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,050
Were you in the rain?

49
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,580
I have to talk to you about something.

50
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,910
What? Don't tell me you missed me?

51
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,090
Hey, don't take it too seriously.

52
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,130
I was just teasing you.

53

Be my girlfriend.

54
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,010
Funny, I'm not falling for it.

You shouldn't joke about this.

At first, I thought he was joking.

But when I looked him in the eye,

But both recently changed their status to "being in a relationship" with each other.

98
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,620
Many analysts agree that it's the result of the contract they signed

with the MPC Group run by the Empiccas.

100
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,640
The timing happens in conjunction with Pakorn's recent passing,

101
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,091
which makes the Parama Group expand considerably.

00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,470
Well, if I stay until morning, what will you do?

165
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,840
Lita! What are you doing here?

166
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,090
MJ, tutor me about Thyme.

167
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,730
I want to know what he likes, what he eats, and where he likes to hang out.

168
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,098
- Tell me everything.
- No.

169
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:20,950
Why?

170
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,410
First, I don't want to get involved in your business.

171
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,230
If you want to know, ask Thyme yourself.

172
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,370
Second, I'm in the middle of something important.

173
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,190
Between a crazy kid like you and the girls,

174
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,850
it's an easy choice for me.

175
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,030
Bye.

176
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,320
Let's go.

177
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,090
What about our baby that I'm carrying?

178
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,250
What the hell are you talking about?

179
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,130
You irresponsible jerk!

180
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,750
If you don't have mercy on me,

181
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,460
have mercy on other girls.

182
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,020
Stop jerking people around.

183
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,900
Wait. It's not what you think.

184
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,870
Wait!

185
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,530
I see you're free now.

186
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,180
Idiot!

187
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,680
I'm very proud of my friend MJ here. You—

188
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,210
You need to shut up.

189
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,980
As if you could handle that girl.

190
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,860
That time we went out with her,

191
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,920
wasn't it you who was panting beside me?

192
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,610
At least I'm not Lita's babysitter like you.

193
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,060
Can you care about Gorya a bit?

194
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,790
You said you're Team Gorya, didn't you?

195
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,460
I still am Team Gorya.

196
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,540
What's going on with Thyme and Gorya anyway?

197
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,000
They were flirting,

198
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,440
and suddenly they stopped seeing each other.

199
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,010
Ren, have you talked to Thyme lately?

200
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,500
I haven't.

201
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,770
I'm confused as well.

202
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,820
He didn't say anything.

203
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,690
But there shouldn't be anyone who can force Thyme to do anything, right?

204
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,290
Or…

205
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,750
Does Thyme really like Lita for real?

206
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,980
Who would have a change of heart that quickly?

207
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,390
You.

208
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,520
I bet you're talking to a new girl now.

209
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,760
I'm not. I'm talking to Kaning.

210
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,340
She's asking me about this stuff.

211
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,400
What's up, Little One?

212
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,530
And now he has ditched his friends.

213
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,620
I'll be right back.

214
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,360
And so does he. Damn it.

215
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,840
Fine.

Are you thinking about Ai Thyme?

No, I'm not.

219
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,770
Everyone is baffled. You guys suddenly broke up.

220
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,170
How can we break up?

221
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,870
We weren't a couple in the first place.

222
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,500
Why the long face?

223

Let me show you this.

230

See!

231

Mon Thong durian, your favorite.

232
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,970
Gorya, Dear, can you see the pile behind us?

233
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,710
I'll ship all these fruits to you.

234

You're working hard. You must take care of yourself.

Okay, my turn! My turn!

please help me study.

I can, too.

334
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,290
Yes, as a wife.

335
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,230
Rider's wife.

336
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,350
They kissed!

337
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,930
Yes.

338
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,730

339
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,810
What could I do?

340
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,720
Lita is beautiful and nice.

341
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,830
Her boyfriend is a very lucky guy.

342
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,090
Are you really okay with this?

343
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,690
I have to be, Na Ga.

344
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,130
Lita is my friend.

345
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:11,130
Seeing her happy makes me happy.

346
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,220
I have to go.

347

348

Let's go.

349
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,730
Gorya is so mature.

350
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,950
It would be nice if I had half her courage.

351
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,570
You can do it.

352
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,450
F4 will take their last exams tomorrow.

353
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,720
What? Gorya said her last exams are the day after tomorrow.

354
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,450
The seniors will finish first.

355
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,680
I did some digging. Aren't I good?

356
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,650
I'm like F4's number one fan now.

357
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:13,910
Hey, as I mentioned,

358
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,700
if there's anything you want to do, now is the time.

359

Despite today being our last day as students,

362
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,490
not all of F4 are here.

363

Don't feel down.

364
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,260
There's still prom tomorrow.

That's Nong Kaning.

367
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,690

368
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,040
What are you doing here?

369
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,050
I just want to congratulate you all on your graduation.

370
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,410
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

371

Are you here to profess your love to someone?

372

There's the "flower of love" in that bouquet.

373

That's not the case. Don't tease me, P'MJ.

374
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,020
What about the others?

375
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,700
Ai Thyme is staying at home.

376
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,550
He said he's too lazy to come.

377

He, who is above all the rules.

378
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,910
And Kavin is preparing for his speech inside

379
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,330
as a valedictorian.

380
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,881
P'Kavin?

381
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:43,610
Isn't it cool? You don't need to be the best student here.

382
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:49,990
But you need to have an uncle who's the education minister to be a valedictorian.

383
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,430
Do you want to come inside?

384
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,110
The ceremony is starting soon.

Wait, isn't Gorya here?

387
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,540
Gorya is out delivering stuff with Talay.

389
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,940
Yes, she works with him.

390
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,670
Don't you know him?

391
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,950
He goes to this school as well.

392
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,990
Is there a student here who works as a delivery guy?

393
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,910

00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,920
How did Gorya get the red card? How could this be?

661
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,060
Hold on.

662
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,040
Do you think that cleaning lady is a bit off?

663
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,200
What if...

664
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,940
Step back.

665
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,320
What are you doing?

666
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,960
They hacked the CCTV system.

667
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,560
Do they think they can fool me?

668
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,260
Dare to challenge me, huh?

669
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,760
- Hello.
- Hello, Ai Ren.

670
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,760
I know who gave Gorya the red card.

671
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,720
Most importantly, they edited the CCTV footage.

672
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,520
Who was it?

673
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,320
Hello, are you listening?

674
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,160
The person who gave Gorya the red card

675
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,880
was Ai Talay.

676
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,540
He planned everything.

677
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,620
You better get out of there quickly.

678
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,540
As discussed,

679
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,240
let's move to the next plan.

680
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:15,020
[Screwdriver: It's time.]

681
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,400
Try this. It's yummy.

682
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,020
I'm not hungry.

683
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,260
What about this?

684
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,180
Would you try it?

685
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,400
It may not be as delicious as what you usually eat,

686
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,480
but I gave it my best.

687
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,760
What are you doing?

688
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,120
Can you wait here for a while?

689
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,960
I'm going to get some groceries at the supermarket.

690
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,040
You can ask your maid to get it later. Let's go back.

691
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,740
It's something important.

692
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,000
That's why I want to do it myself.

693
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,680
Did you...

694
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,380
The person who made those cookies for you

695
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,500
must be very important.

696
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,900
I won't ask who it was,

697
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:34,700
but can you make some room in your heart for me?

698
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,560
No matter how long it takes,

699
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,240
I will keep on trying

700
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,240
until you can love me.

701
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,900
Okay?

702
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,560
It is now time for dancing.

703
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,320
May I please ask everyone to the floor?

704
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,501
- Let's go.
- Come to the floor.

705
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,320
Before the dance starts,

706
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,560
let me capture this beautiful moment by dimming the light.

707
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:13,120
Everybody, please take out your phone and turn on your flashlight.

708
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,880
Come on, Guys. Okay.

709
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,120
Let's do it.

710
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,320
People in the back, move toward the front, please.

711
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,460
Turn it on, people on the left. Please turn it on.

712
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,720
Keep the flashlight on.

713
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,160
A moment, please. Come on.

714
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,200
Hold it up. Hold it up.

715
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,660
Very beautiful.

716
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:34,360
Okay. One, two, three.

717
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,920
Hold it up. Very beautiful.

718
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,360
Okay. Beautiful.

719
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,160
Raise your hand up high.

720
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,160
Okay, thank you.

721
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,920
What's wrong?

722
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,780
[If you want Gorya to stay alive, come here.]

723

[Come alone.]

724
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:11,923
Thyme.

725
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,080
Thyme!

726
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,900
Thyme!

[Next Week]

730
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,280
How can I leave Gorya with them?

731
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,740
Then listen to me carefully.

732
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:14,260
Ai Talay has some kind of connection with Phupha.

733
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,340
Do you remember Phupha?

734
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,620
For me, he's just an idiot.

735
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,060
Let the whole thing end the way it's supposed to.

736
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,540
End the way it's supposed to?

737
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:28,830
Ultimately, the ending is always the same, Gorya.
