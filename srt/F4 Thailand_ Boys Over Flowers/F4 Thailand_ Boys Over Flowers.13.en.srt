1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,216
I'd like to call off this engagement.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,610
(Billionaire engagement is off!)

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,610
Something that's important...
sort it out right away.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,610
Don't leave it unfinished.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,679
You and I are a couple.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,890
OK?

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,890
Is the shop closed?

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,379
I have something to give you.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,930
Are you really getting serious with me?

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,930
Honestly,

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,139
when you're a couple,

12
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,169
you want to do something...

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,369
What's up, babe?

14
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,650
that a couple does, right?

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,460
What are you doing?

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,079
Um... I...

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,840
You're thinking about
something dirty again?

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,859
No!

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,839
But since I've been in a
relationship with Gorya,

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,840
there's nothing of that sort.

21
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,619
How is this different than
when we're not together?

22
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,939
Come on.

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,999
Getting hit by a pillow is
not too harsh a punishment.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,329
You have no moves, Thyme.

25
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,530
You need to be schooled
by my teacher. Kavin!

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,770
No comment from him.

27
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,249
Let Professor MJ teach you.

28
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,690
Imagine that you want to
a ball from Ren's hands.

29
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,490
What will you do?

30
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,949
Ren doesn't have a ball. Look.

31
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,519
This is the point.

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,520
If you want a ball from Ren,

33
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,549
you need to pass it to him first.

34
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,079
Then, he can pass it back to you.

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,339
Love is the same.

36
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,279
You need to give her
something special first.

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,069
If it's good enough,

38
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,489
she'll give back something romantic to you.

39
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,465
That's right.

40
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,689
You have a point.

41
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,890
But what could be special enough?

42
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,650
A surprise party?

43
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,620
Sold. I am sold.

44
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,819
Watch me. I'll throw
Gorya a surprise party that

45
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,210
she can never forget.

46
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,460
Good. The rest can follow.

47
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,720
Yes. Sure, Mr. Thyme. Got it.

48
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,630
Is this OK?

49
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,730
Move all of it.

50
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,029
He wants to surprise her
but has her set up the party?

51
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,570
Genius.

52
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,570
Lend him a hand, Kavin.

53
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,240
Hey.

54
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,599
I'm taking off.

55
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,770
I feel... a bit tired.

56
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,090
Did something happen to Kavin?

57
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,850
I think he came across Mona the other day.

58
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,199
Kavin...

59
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,490
isn't over Mona yet?

60
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,905
I'm exhausted.

61
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,890
I carried so many
tables my back is hurting.

62
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,250
You can spare a moment of your
time to work here now, Ms. Gorya?

63
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,250
I can't.

64
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,250
There's a lot of work.

65
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,770
What's going on with
Kaning? She seems a bit down.

66
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,719
I don't know.

67
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,309
She hasn't been eating
much. Don't know what's wrong.

68
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,149
It's good that you're here.

69
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,890
Go talk to her.

70
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,890
Kaning.

71
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,479
Gorya, how come you're here?

72
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,359
I just stop by to say hi.

73
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,170
Are you alright?

74
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,989
Did you fight with your dad?

75
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,170
Or something else?

76
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,770
Something's on my mind.

77
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,490
Out of the blue, Kavin
talked to me the other day.

78
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,330
See? You can't do it.

79
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,730
What do you mean?

80
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,050
I do this to every girl.

81
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,909
When someone tells me she likes me,

82
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,719
I'll tell her I like her too

83
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,450
even when I feel nothing.

84
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,499
I will never commit to anyone.

85
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,770
And it will end with a one-night stand.

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,079
You are not cut out for
that type of relationship.

87
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,780
Move on from me.

88
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,530
I don't get it.

89
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,530
Are you trying to scare me?

90
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,930
You could have just chased me off

91
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,909
or fooled me to go all the way.

92
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,019
But you chose to do this.

93
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,369
It's like...

94
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,770
you're trying to be a player

95
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,490
to run away from something.

96
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,090
You're scared to be in
a committed relationship.

97
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,930
I know that I may not
be good enough for you.

98
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,500
But I want to understand

99
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,090
why you've become a guy who
never opens his heart to anyone.

100
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,880
I do want to understand...

101
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:36,210
No.

102
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,610
You said I never opened my heart to anyone.

103
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,690
I did once to a girl.

104
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,730
If you want to know,

105
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,420
I'll tell you.

106
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,050
And?

107
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,050
The rest is nothing.

108
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,330
Just...

109
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,890
Nothing. I should get back to work.

110
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,690
See? How can I not be worried?

111
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,199
Ren, MJ,

112
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,449
I've been thinking too much I can't sleep.

113
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,110
You see my shared screen, right?

114
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,459
Gorya likes green.

115
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,589
So the balloons at the
party should be green.

116
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,759
But white balloons are much more pretty.

117
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,769
What should I do?

118
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,939
Whatever, man.

119
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,469
Your party isn't going to work.

120
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,969
What are you saying?

121
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,549
The party is going to be great.

122
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,629
You're underestimating me.

123
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,179
But you have her set it up, Thyme.

124
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,919
No way she won't find out.

125
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,339
She won't find out. I told her

126
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,989
to set up a party for F4.

127
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,010
I didn't say it's for her.

128
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,519
You can be clever.

129
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,139
That's normal, man.

130
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,639
If she doesn't hear our conversation,

131
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,439
how can she know that
I'm throwing her a party?

132
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Shit!

133
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,490
Gorya, I'm not talking to anyone. I...

134
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,099
Gorya. Gorya.

135
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,810
Hmm?

136
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,679
Where did you go?

137
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,810
What's the matter?

138
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,629
Nothing. I'm fine.

139
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,050
Obviously, you're not fine.

140
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,050
What's wrong?

141
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,499
I'm just worried about Kaning.

142
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,810
She was acting a bit odd.

143
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,979
Kavin too.

144
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,499
He told Kaning out of the blue

145
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,889
that he could never
open his heart to anyone.

146
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,250
It came out all of a sudden.

147
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,730
Is Kavin not over Mona yet?

148
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,790
Mona?

149
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,369
Who's that?

150
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,050
Kavin's ex?

151
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,719
Or was she the one who
turned him into a player?

152
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,466
Hold on. Or was she the one
who turned him into a player?

153
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,929
She's neither a girlfriend

154
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,639
nor someone who turned him into a player.

155
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,930
Kavin has been a player all along.

156
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,670
We should break up.

157
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,890
Huh? What?

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,290
I said let's break up.

159
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,290
Why, Kavin?

160
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,030
Where did I go wrong?

161
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,950
I met someone new.

162
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,580
Who?

163
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,890
There's this girl

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,410
whom Kavin used as an excuse

165
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,490
when he broke up with someone.

166
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,890
That girl was Mona.

167
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,779
This is Mona, my new girlfriend.

168
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,529
I know that this may come as a shock.

169
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,969
But you need to get over it.

170
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,050
Your new girlfriend looks familiar.

171
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,480
Hmm?

172
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,769
I saw this girl when you broke
up with your last girlfriend.

173
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,660
Are you trying to fool me
with this piss poor plan?

174
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,110
Don't drag this out. This
is really my new girlfriend.

175
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,330
We've been together a while now.

176
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,329
Prove it.

177
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,330
Huh?

178
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,430
How can I prove this to you?

179
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,689
Shall I kiss her?

180
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:59,150
Hold on. I don't think
that is necessary, dear.

181
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,589
Come on. If she sees, she'll believe.

182
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,170
No.

183
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,539
I told you. People will
remember if it's the same person.

184
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,519
Next time find someone else.

185
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,769
Don't complain.

186
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,039
If I'd had another friend, I
would have asked her to help.

187
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,469
You're my only close friend who's a girl.

188
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,430
No.

189
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:32,450
You made a move on all
the other girls you know.

190
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,119
You could try a different approach.

191
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,279
Like asking F4 to help.

192
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,249
I think you and Thyme would
make such a cute couple.

193
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,850
That's right. How did I miss that?

194
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,050
You're gonna get it.

195
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,410
You go after my face now?

196
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,469
But really... I think this is too risky.

197
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,170
What if we had to kiss for real?

198
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,849
Give me a break.

199
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,979
You're not like this with other guys.

200
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,859
Who?

201
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,610
Knight, the guy who's chasing after you.

202
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,599
I see you.

203
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,919
Don't make me show the pictures.

204
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,219
Here it is.

205
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,979
Look at this picture.

206
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,819
Hold on, where did you get these?

207
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,619
Knight, kiss kiss.

208
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,210
That's gross.

209
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,219
They'd been close since they were kids.

210
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,570
Other than F4, Mona was the only
one whom Kavin spent time with.

211
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,370
Actually, Mona and Kavin
would make a perfect couple.

212
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,370
And Kavin liked Mona very much.

213
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,610
How about this one?

214
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,509
But he never wanted to break the rule.

215
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,290
A friend is a friend.

216
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,779
He knows all too well
if he crosses the line,

217
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,770
everything will crumble.

218
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,139
I checked it out.

219
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,839
Claire blocks you for real.

220
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,370
I saw her post some pictures just now.

221
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,130
Feeling like you missed out?

222
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,210
I think she's a good fit for you.

223
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,749
If I had a girlfriend, you'd
be the one missing out.

224
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,210
Wow.

225
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,460
Do you think you're a national treasure?

226
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,689
If I had a boyfriend, you'd
be the one missing out.

227
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,829
You're not a national treasure either.

228
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,810
Seriously, even Knight said
that she's a perfect girl for you.

229
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,810
Knight has opinions about me now?

230
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,689
He has opinions about everything.

231
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,539
As soon as I complain about something,

232
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,290
I'll hear opinions,
suggestions, and everything.

233
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,420
The other day I told him I was
done with taking pictures in the city.

234
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,059
He sent me dozens of tourist destinations,

235
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,250
valleys, temples, beaches, hills.

236
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,929
When I told him I wanted
to take pictures of the beach,

237
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,989
you know what he did? Look.

238
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,890
He booked accommodation for our trip.

239
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,930
Do you think I should go?

240
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,890
Why are you all quiet?

241
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,290
I was just thinking that you
didn't need to ask me that question.

242
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,250
Of course I have to ask you.

243
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,260
You're my friend.

244
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,799
Go if you want to go.

245
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,450
But... remember to use protection.

246
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,970
What's that?

247
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,890
How can you say that?

248
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,130
When a guy asks you
to go on a trip with him,

249
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,009
what do you think he wants?

250
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,349
You already know it.
Don't act all innocent.

251
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,159
But I don't know.

252
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,089
If I knew, why would I ask you?

253
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,189
What's wrong with you?

254
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,969
Instead of warning me politely,
you had to be all sarcastic.

255
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,519
I wasn't.

256
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,460
Do whatever you want.

257
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,730
I have no right to stop you anyway.

258
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,770
Gotta go.

259
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:41,330
Wait, Kavin.

260
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,170
Are you here alone?

261
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,850
Kavin.

262
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,740
Let's go.

263
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,610
I'm here to clear the air.

264
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,730
Who are you?

265
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,139
Why are you sticking your
nose where it doesn't belong?

266
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,189
Why are you?

267
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:24,990
So what?

268
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,930
- Stay out of it.
- Mona.

269
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,170
Why are you all up in my business?

270
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,679
I haven't cleared the air with you.

271
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,679
What's the matter with you anyway?

272
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,370
You threw a fit and walked away.

273
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,739
You look like you have
something to say to me all the time.

274
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,100
But you never say it in the end.

275
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,770
I don't want to say it.

276
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,519
How can I understand
you if you don't say it?

277
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,020
You don't need to understand.

278
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,249
Imagine.

279
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,970
If you knew what you say
would make things worse,

280
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,250
would you say it?

281
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,909
What you're doing now
is making things worse.

282
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,490
Is this thing so much more
important than our friendship?

283
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,279
Are you going to let this thing
stop us from being friends?

284
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,439
Yes.

285
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,850
I don't want to be your friend anyway.

286
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,380
Let's go.

287
00:18:20,381 --> 00:18:21,399
You can't just walk away.

288
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,180
I don't want to do this.

289
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:23,289
Kavin, let's talk it out.

290
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,170
I said I don't want to.

291
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,850
Are you really going to ruin everything?

292
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,290
I do not understand you.

293
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,170
Not at all.

294
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,300
Are you alright?

295
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,090
He did cross that line.

296
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,970
And everything was ruined as he expected.

297
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,410
After that, Mona sent a
location to Kavin to meet.

298
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,330
(Let's talk. Meet me at this building.)

299
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,650
(At 6 a.m.)

300
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,650
But Kavin didn't go.

301
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,330
He said from the look on her face that day,

302
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,810
he could tell what Mona's answer would be.

303
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,210
Kavin hasn't seen Mona since.

304
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,370
Although Kavin may seem alright now,

305
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,570
deep down he can't forget her.

306
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,049
It's strange though.

307
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,419
Just because he didn't
show up at that building,

308
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,850
they haven't seen each other since?

309
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,850
Why there?

310
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,850
No one knows.

311
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,739
When Kavin didn't show up,

312
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,979
Mona unsent that message.

313
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,850
To this day, no one knows
where that building is.

314
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,130
Am I making you more stressed?

315
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,130
No.

316
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,490
That's good. It's getting late.

317
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,960
Go to bed.

318
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,959
Is it this late already?

319
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,090
I have an early morning chore tomorrow.

320
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,959
Anyway, thank you
for telling me this story.

321
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,130
I have to go.

322
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,250
I have no idea what she
would say on the rooftop.

323
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,330
But I am certain that bad news is
more difficult to give than good news.

324
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,330
And it's true.

325
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,410
After that day,

326
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,780
Mona has disappeared from my life.

327
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:55,290
It's funny... a guy who's
broken up with countless girls

328
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,530
can't even face it when it happens to him.

329
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,610
Kaning.

330
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,659
Move on from me.

331
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,260
Love could be a beautiful thing

332
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,930
but it doesn't apply to me.

333
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,910
Kaning.

334
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,610
Kaning.

335
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,610
How is it going, dear?

336
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,490
I don't know what you're
up to at the moment.

337
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,490
But you haven't eaten anything, have you?

338
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,100
I haven't.

339
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,610
I'm worried about your health.

340
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,610
Eat this so you won't get hungry.

341
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,610
Thank you.

342
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,980
It helps you stay slim.

343
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,689
I don't have time to take
care of you like this every day.

344
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,850
You need to look after yourself, OK?

345
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,290
Enjoy.

346
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,290
I'll get out of your hair.

347
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,890
How did you get yogurt
on your nose, chipmunk?

348
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,729
Gorya, I don't think Kaning
is back to her normal self yet.

349
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:19,839
She's been gone the whole day,

350
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,029
didn't pick up my calls or texted me back.

351
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:26,290
Can you think of something?
I'm getting really worried about her.

352
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,259
It's OK, Uncle Ga.

353
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,290
I finished work early
today. I'll try to reach her.

354
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,830
Goodbye.

355
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,545
(Kaning. Where are you?)

356
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,610
(If you read this, please reply.)

357
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,459
What? Let me go!

358
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,609
Ms. Gorya, please brace yourself for a...

359
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:57,610
Surprise!

360
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,299
What are you playing?

361
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,010
This party is to celebrate
the day you became a couple.

362
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,180
Especially made for you only.

363
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,410
Let's have fun, Ren. Go.

364
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,570
Hey.

365
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,209
Why the long face?

366
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,489
I know you're worried about Kaning.

367
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,090
But everyone wants
you to relax now, alright?

368
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,450
Alright?

369
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,330
Stop it.

370
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,170
Thank you.

371
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,330
Better?

372
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,170
If you feel better,

373
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,250
do you see that box?

374
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,730
Open it for me.

375
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:08,810
Why?

376
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,730
Well...

377
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,770
Whatever, just open it.

378
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,570
Here. Stand right here.

379
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,290
Open now.

380
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,359
Kaning has just replied, Thyme. Look.

381
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,970
Kaning has replied.

382
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,029
Looks like something's up.

383
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,030
Well...

384
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,649
Dang.

385
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,260
But...

386
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,530
Come here.

387
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,530
That wasn't the highlight but this is.

388
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,329
Here. Stand right here.

389
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:53,760
What is it?

390
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,680
Turn this way.

391
00:27:54,681 --> 00:27:57,609
Let me tell you what I
prepared for you is magnificent.

392
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,340
Because it is this!

393
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,540
Just a sec, Thyme.

394
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:09,069
Hello, Kaning.

395
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:09,970
What's going on?

396
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:10,870
Gorya! Gorya!

397
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,570
Detained?

398
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,090
Gorya!

399
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,729
By who?

400
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,330
Wait, Gorya! There's one more.

401
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,309
This is the real highlight.

402
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,690
Just tell me.

403
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,050
Send me the location. I'll be right there.

404
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Gorya!

405
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,259
Gorya! Gorya!

406
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,010
Wait!

407
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,010
Look at that! Look!

408
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,570
Gorya! Gorya! Hey!

409
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,570
Who came up with the sky message?

410
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,580
Not me.

411
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,889
It'd only take a second.

412
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,650
Kaning.

413
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,010
What's going on?

414
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:07,019
This lady was trying to go up to
the rooftop without permission.

415
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,770
Has there been a misunderstanding?

416
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,770
No, Gorya. I was trying
to go up to the rooftop.

417
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,669
According to our hotel's regulations,

418
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:19,770
I must file a report with the police.

419
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,510
But...

420
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:22,770
Although she broke the rule,

421
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,730
this doesn't need to go to the police.

422
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,760
Thyme, how did you get here?

423
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,719
Please get out or they'll tell you off.

424
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,890
Tell me off? This is my hotel.

425
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,660
So? What's going on here?

426
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,309
May I go up to the hotel rooftop?

427
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,650
- I'm trying to find...
- Yes.

428
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,330
Excuse me, please look after her.

429
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,330
Of course, Mr. Thyme.

430
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,530
Thank you so much, Thyme.

431
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,849
Wait a second, Kaning.

432
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,900
What is this about?
What are you looking for?

433
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,459
It... It's hard to describe.

434
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,290
I'm trying to locate a rooftop.

435
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,530
Let me come with you.

436
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,450
Please? I'm worried about you.

437
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,050
Gorya, I need to do this by myself.

438
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,340
If you want to help,
just try to understand.

439
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,669
Thanks so much.

440
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:26,999
Hold on, Kaning.

441
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,330
Stop prying into other people's business.

442
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,490
Worry about yourself.

443
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,519
Please prepare a room
and dry clothes for me.

444
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Right away, sir.

445
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,890
And you...

446
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,970
we need to talk.

447
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,050
Are you angry?

448
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,250
Feeling better.

449
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,569
I am angry

450
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,779
not because you ruined the party.

451
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,619
I'm angry because you inserted
yourself into Kaning's business.

452
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,809
How can I stop worrying about her?

453
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,300
I didn't say you should stop worrying.

454
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,090
Didn't you get a feel

455
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,690
that Kaning wanted to do this on her own?

456
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,020
I don't know what's on Kaning's mind

457
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,530
but it has something to do with Kavin.

458
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,549
She's acting this way

459
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,510
because she's figured out

460
00:31:57,511 --> 00:32:00,290
that she wants to climb
Kavin's wall on her own.

461
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,890
That must be it.

462
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,210
But I don't understand.

463
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,780
Is Kavin's wall that big?

464
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,770
Kavin may seem that way.

465
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,890
But he holds on to things
more tightly than you think.

466
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:40,330
If he cannot get over his past with Mona,

467
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,410
he cannot move forward.

468
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,709
As my professor said,

469
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,050
because Kavin is who he is,

470
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,050
if you want him to pass a ball back,

471
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,770
Kaning must pass the
ball to him first. Got it?

472
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,490
How did you get to basketball?

473
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,370
But thank you.

474
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,989
Are you still stressed out?

475
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:28,319
Your brows are tied into a knot.

476
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,320
I just want to do something.

477
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,730
How about this?

478
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,289
If you support her from a distance,

479
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,050
see if she's OK,

480
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,909
I'll lend you a hand.

481
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:44,970
Sounds good?

482
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,810
What about Kavin?

483
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,970
He's quite worrisome too.

484
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,620
I'll talk to him.

485
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,380
Still a good swimmer, huh?

486
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,050
Hey.

487
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,699
What? I can't take your picture now?

488
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,429
It's not that.

489
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,530
No one has taken my
picture like this in a while.

490
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:59,210
Nothing has changed here. I missed it.

491
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,770
Everything remains the same.

492
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,050
Everything.

493
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,050
What about you?

494
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:18,250
Has anything changed?

495
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:28,410
The girl I met at the flower shop is cute.

496
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,200
Why do you bring her up?

497
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,770
The other day the building
staff of my office said

498
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,969
they found a stranger sneak up to the roof.

499
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,930
So I pulled footage
from the security camera.

500
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,050
It looks like this girl is
finding some rooftop.

501
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,210
Is it just me thinking
that this is about that day?

502
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:11,370
So you've come here because of this.

503
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,930
I don't know who she is to you.

504
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,009
And I don't know what you told her.

505
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:24,399
But for a girl to go up to a
rooftop all alone is very dangerous.

506
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:24,700
You...

507
00:36:24,701 --> 00:36:26,770
OK.

508
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,450
I get it.

509
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,820
I don't want things to
turn out this way either.

510
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,810
I'll deal with it.

511
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:42,290
Sorry for reminding you of bad memories.

512
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,690
It's never bad, Kavin.

513
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:03,050
Everything about you is
a good memory for me.

514
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,570
I should go.

515
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,290
Kavin, I may have just met her

516
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,770
but I could feel her dedication.

517
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:35,450
I could... never do that.

518
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,090
Damn it!

519
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,170
(I know what you're trying to do.)

520
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,760
(Stop getting involved in my business.)

521
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,920
(At 6 a.m.)

522
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:17,090
6 a.m.

523
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,810
Sunrise.

524
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,010
(I found that building.)

525
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,330
(Can you meet me here tomorrow at 6 a.m.?)

526
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,530
(I'll be waiting.)

527
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,280
Cheers.

528
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,680
(Kavin.)

529
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
(Please come.)

530
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,690
Kavin.

531
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,379
Who is that?

532
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,410
He's been spying on you.

533
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,220
Why are you here?

534
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,370
I'm... clubbing.

535
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,409
Why does everyone give me headaches?

536
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,659
You and Kaning,

537
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,250
why are you bugging
me to go to that rooftop?

538
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,019
Did Kaning find the rooftop?

539
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,850
Yeah.

540
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,730
Good. Kaning is a fighter.

541
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,159
What good does it do though?

542
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,049
Ever since Kaning set
out to find the rooftop,

543
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:19,650
my life has been such a mess.

544
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,859
This thing was a long time ago.

545
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,879
It's so pointless.

546
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,370
Pointless or not, only you can answer that.

547
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,010
I don't know

548
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,599
but for a girl who
fights with all her might

549
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,810
so you could find what she
doesn't know if it's useful for you...

550
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,850
Are you going to leave her hanging?

551
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,730
Anyway, it's your decision
whether to go or not.

552
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,810
But I don't want you to
make the same mistake twice.

553
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,850
Find out what's important to you.

554
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:09,410
And you'll be able to make that decision.

555
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,760
What's up with that guy?
Come and have a good time.

556
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,470
You can't go up.

557
00:43:48,471 --> 00:43:50,109
But my friend is upstairs.

558
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,499
Without Mira's permission,
you are not allowed up there.

559
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,320
Please.

560
00:43:53,321 --> 00:43:56,489
But the way you went
behind her back is frustrating.

561
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:59,170
I'd never do anything behind Gorya's back.

562
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,800
Chipmunk.

563
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,030
Ouch!

564
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,550
Clumsy again. Let me see.

565
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,979
But I could feel her dedication.

566
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,439
Find out what's important to you.

567
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,499
I could... never do that.

568
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,410
And you'll be able to make that decision.

569
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,260
Excuse me.

570
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:58,170
Took you a while.

571
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:24,600
Chipmunk, you know how
frustrating your stubbornness is?

572
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:28,500
But I found what Mona
was trying to tell you.

573
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,220
Time is running out. Hurry!

574
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:50,250
Kavin, I understand you
two were very close friends

575
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,970
and that made it so hard
to tell her how you felt.

576
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,759
But you know,

577
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,570
Mona felt it was very difficult too.

578
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:07,340
How would you know?

579
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,610
I do.

580
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,410
What is this?

581
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:54,450
Kavin, your feelings did reach her.

582
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:59,820
Because I like you.

583
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:02,450
Happy?

584
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:14,490
And she... had something to tell you.

585
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:34,610
She wants to tell you this all along.

586
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:03,730
(Kavin)

587
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:13,609
No matter what's the meaning

588
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:19,189
A beginning or a farewell

589
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:20,379
You said you're not fit for love.

590
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:24,689
Like sunlight in the morning
You said you're not fit for love.

591
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:26,690
Like sunlight in the morning

592
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:32,690
Or when the sun fades away

593
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,690
That's not true at all.

594
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:45,419
I may not be deserving of love

595
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:50,370
Afraid I may hurt someone

596
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:06,460
Love is only a dark shadow in my heart

597
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:12,370
Not ready yet for a new start

598
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:17,330
And to love someone

599
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,449
Silly girl.

600
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:34,450
Hope that light will shine
and chase the shadow away

601
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:40,339
So I can find a brand new day

602
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,990
When I can love again

603
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:53,210
(Kavin)

604
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:00,019
As a rematch for the surprise party,

605
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:04,890
let's have fun to the max. Woohoo!

606
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,760
Nothing is wilder than this party.

607
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:15,090
This is even sadder
than the last party, Thyme.

608
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,039
Why did you have to drag us here?

609
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,970
I just wanted to party.

610
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,059
I think you guys should
get some rest. Next time.

611
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,139
True.

612
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:29,530
Now that you're here, let me say something.

613
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,530
Congratulations to you all

614
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:36,530
on everything.

615
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:44,869
Alright, let's go.

616
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,029
Kavin, get up.

617
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,570
Give them some privacy.

618
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,929
Anyway, how are you getting home, Kaning?

619
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:54,949
I can give you a ride.

620
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:58,229
Hey, stop right there.
I'll give her a ride.

621
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:01,130
Ah, let's go.

622
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:03,850
See you.

623
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:07,130
Hey, Kaning.

624
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,730
See you tomorrow at the flower shop.

625
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:14,050
Have you paid off all your debt?

626
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,770
You should go to bed in your room.

627
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,469
I can't. Can't get up.

628
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:30,150
Let me sleep here.

629
00:51:30,151 --> 00:51:31,319
What?

630
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,619
- Let me sleep here.
- No. No!

631
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,859
Thyme, move.

632
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,730
No! Help!

633
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,860
- Auntie Yu, please help.
- Stay still. I'll sleep here.

634
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,159
See you, Kavin.

635
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,080
See you.

636
00:51:46,081 --> 00:51:48,029
Aren't you going to let Kaning drive?

637
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:50,130
Do you want to drive, Kaning?

638
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:52,680
Later, Ren.

639
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,130
I haven't thanked you yet.

640
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,130
Thank you.

641
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,950
But no more.

642
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:35,259
It's embarrassing.

643
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:38,570
It's been years since I
cried in front of someone.

644
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,609
Thank you too

645
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:46,890
for coming to get to the
bottom of this thing with Mona.

646
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,690
I actually thought you
weren't going to come.

647
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,490
Actually

648
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,250
I didn't come because of Mona.

649
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:11,769
And you came because...

650
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:13,640
Not going to tell you.

651
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,020
Let's drive.

652
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:17,170
Kavin, talk to me first.

653
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,640
Kavin.

654
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,970
Kavin! Let's talk.

655
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,359
What's up with you today?

656
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,360
You've been such a baby.

657
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,529
You won't be working here anymore.

658
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,890
Can't I just be a baby
for a little while longer?

659
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:11,480
You did very well today.

660
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,010
You were calm and understanding.

661
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:18,439
It was me who was rash.

662
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,290
And I got good advice
from someone like you.

663
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,530
What a surprise.

664
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,749
If you stay with me,

665
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,730
I promise I have many
more surprises for you.

666
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,800
Like the pool party?

667
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,050
That's all I could come up with.

668
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:41,530
I never did this for anyone before.

669
00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:51,210
Actually

670
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:54,329
I have a surprise too.

671
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:55,490
What?

672
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,129
Hey.

673
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,130
Wait.

674
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,850
That doesn't count. I wasn't prepared.

675
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:14,850
It doesn't count.

676
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,130
I...

677
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,570
Can I have one more?

678
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,199
No.

679
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,449
- Please.
- No.

680
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:25,370
Only once is enough.

681
00:55:25,371 --> 00:55:31,210
Please. Please. Please.

682
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,090
Just one more.

683
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:17,169
Yes, mom.

684
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,819
The house? Neat and tidy.

685
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:23,050
Because I attended a
course in being a maid.

686
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,370
Mom, I have to go. I'll call you later.

687
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:37,010
Ren, what are you doing?

688
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,560
Gorya.

689
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:41,409
Let's go somewhere else.

690
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:42,810
What happens?

691
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,090
Let's go somewhere else.

692
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:15,089
Has my order been taken care of?

693
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:16,690
All done, madam.

694
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:39,979
The Secret Story of Iris

695
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:43,105
After I found out where Aum worked,

696
00:57:43,106 --> 00:57:45,997
KFC was the place I
wanted to go to every day,

697
00:57:45,998 --> 00:57:47,659
no matter how hard.

698
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:52,299
Hey, don't you want to have
more room for more passengers?

699
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,539
Come on, think of this as a sports car.

700
00:57:58,845 --> 00:58:01,019
This order belongs to...

701
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:04,473
MJ! How is it that you're here?

702
00:58:04,474 --> 00:58:05,044
I've come here on purpose...

703
00:58:05,045 --> 00:58:07,179
Is this your dad?

704
00:58:07,616 --> 00:58:07,937
Dad?

705
00:58:07,938 --> 00:58:10,139
Dad, hello.

706
00:58:12,404 --> 00:58:14,136
I think you should go back to work.

707
00:58:14,137 --> 00:58:16,305
Let's talk after work.

708
00:58:16,306 --> 00:58:18,699
Enjoy your meal.

709
00:58:26,977 --> 00:58:28,422
You've been treating everyone.

710
00:58:28,423 --> 00:58:30,422
I didn't know you're struggling.

711
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,379
You work so hard.

712
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:35,379
Where do you find the
energy to play basketball?

713
00:58:37,841 --> 00:58:41,338
I have to try harder.
Just following my dream.

714
00:58:41,339 --> 00:58:42,296
How?

715
00:58:42,297 --> 00:58:44,499
I want to be a pro basketball player.

716
00:58:45,176 --> 00:58:49,136
I'm not in school or belong to any club.

717
00:58:49,137 --> 00:58:52,713
But an open tryout for the
pro league is coming up soon.

718
00:58:52,714 --> 00:58:54,504
If I made it,

719
00:58:54,505 --> 00:58:57,419
I wouldn't have to work and
practice like this anymore.

720
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,418
This court is like a club to you.

721
00:59:00,419 --> 00:59:01,739
Yeah.

722
00:59:01,825 --> 00:59:03,619
And you...

723
00:59:05,395 --> 00:59:07,859
are my clubmate.

724
00:59:08,774 --> 00:59:10,579
Just a mate?

725
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:18,339
A person with a dream is kind of... cute.

726
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:28,121
In that case, I'll help you
practice until you turn pro.

727
00:59:28,122 --> 00:59:29,659
Thank you,

728
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:30,669
my clubmate.

729
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:34,059
Fine, I got it. Just a mate.

730
00:59:35,835 --> 00:59:38,659
I know how we can get back at them.

731
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:48,730
This world is a board game
that wagers on people's lives.

732
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,369
It's no different than the
red card game you played.

733
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:53,040
Damn it!

734
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:56,770
Tell me what you want
to do. We're ready to help.

735
00:59:56,890 --> 01:00:01,250
You know you're up against
someone with real power, right?

736
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,530
I want her to know

737
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:08,370
that her power can never bring me down.
