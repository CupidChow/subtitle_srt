1
00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:01,899
Tesla!

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,042
Here you go. Have you waited long...

3
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:06,314
sweetheart?

4
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:08,109
You're on the right track, Thyme.

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,249
But if you choose the wrong path again,

6
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,679
I won't back down for
you for the second time.

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,919
I've made a decision

8
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,850
from now on

9
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:16,299
no one will ever get a red card from F4.

10
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,539
It's official.

11
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:21,539
Sorry for not telling
you that I'd be home late.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,299
Hello.

13
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,678
Ms. Roselyn, this is Gorya, my...

14
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,659
I know who she is.

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,490
OK.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,179
Gorya, this is Ms. Roselyn.

17
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,059
I know who she is, Dad.

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,739
What brings you here?

19
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,859
How can you all live like this?

20
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,129
The house is so small.

21
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,819
And it smells so stale and moldy.

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,080
Don't you feel uncom...

23
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:27,477
I think...

24
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,739
you should get to the point.

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,740
What is it that you want?

26
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,899
You must want a better life, right?

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,090
That's why you're trying to land my son.

28
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,969
I do want my son to stop associating
himself with this sort of thing.

29
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,819
So I'm here to ask you briefly.

30
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,659
How much would it take for
you to leave my son alone?

31
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,509
Is this the way it works for your family?

32
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,249
You solve every problem with money.

33
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,019
One million.

34
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,139
If you accept, the money will
be in your account tomorrow.

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,843
Let me set things straight right here.

36
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,879
I've never wanted to land Thyme.

37
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,790
We're not a couple.

38
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,659
But no matter what,

39
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,899
money can't buy a relationship.

40
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:38,849
Five million?

41
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,729
It's not about how much money.

42
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,090
Really?

43
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:46,538
That kind of money is
worth more than this house.

44
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,459
Ego alone doesn't make your stomach full.

45
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,169
I think we're going nowhere
with this conversation.

46
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,922
Fifteen million.

47
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,889
That's enough to buy a nice new place.

48
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,739
I said this can't be bought with money.

49
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,690
Enough!

50
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,219
What's your problem?

51
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,119
All of a sudden, you come into my house

52
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,093
and throw money at my
daughter like she can be bought.

53
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:17,201
You think others are lowly and
you're an angel from high above

54
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:20,219
that's why you can't see people as equals?

55
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,820
Between the two of us, is
there any part that's equal?

56
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,010
That does it!

57
00:03:36,914 --> 00:03:39,930
Dear!

58
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,049
See? You see yourself so grand.

59
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,859
But in the end, you and I poop
out smelly shit just the same.

60
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,579
Fish sauce?

61
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,418
It fits right in this rotten house.

62
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:56,539
So? It's better than your rotten heart.

63
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,539
The dreadful smell of fish sauce

64
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,769
got nothing on your vile obnoxious heart.

65
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,899
Whoa! That cuts deep.

66
00:04:04,936 --> 00:04:07,859
Get out. Our home doesn't
welcome people like you.

67
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,499
Most importantly, you
should get it through your skull

68
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,549
that although I'm poor,

69
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,709
I'm proud to have a good
daughter who has dignity.

70
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:20,059
My daughter will never take
your rotten money. Know that!

71
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,901
It's a pity.

72
00:04:30,902 --> 00:04:32,559
I came to offer you money today

73
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,259
because I think your family is in trouble.

74
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,437
Oh well.

75
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,472
I guess we shall see how far
your stupid dignity will take you.

76
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:56,339
And know this. Equality is
just another beautiful word.

77
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,286
For someone like you,

78
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,669
no matter how hard you try,

79
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,859
you will never be worthy of Thyme.

80
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,709
Wow, dear. That was awesome!

81
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,299
- Sharp words...
- I'm about to pass out. Dear, inhaler now!

82
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,270
Sit down, dear.

83
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:29,180
Here's an inhaler for you.

84
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:31,210
Let me have that.

85
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,590
Nice.

86
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,360
Thanks, Mom. You're a badass.

87
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,242
Definitely.

88
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,079
What about when she said

89
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,419
how our family was in trouble?

90
00:05:46,004 --> 00:05:47,969
What's that about?

91
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,539
Why are you all packed?

92
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,779
I was waiting for you to
come home to tell you.

93
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:01,219
Gorya, listen carefully.

94
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:07,779
My company has gone out of business

95
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,929
and I'm left stranded.

96
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,019
Our household...

97
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,019
has no income.

98
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,490
Here we go. It's time to celebrate, guys.

99
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,922
I've been waiting for this moment
for so long. We will go all out today.

100
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:47,089
Why do you have to make
such a big deal out of it?

101
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,457
This is an official F4 reunion.

102
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:55,579
What are you two waiting
for? Clink the glasses.

103
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,619
No.

104
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,779
Let's clink it this way.

105
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,559
Yeah, that's how it's done.

106
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,299
Finally, peace and quiet
have been restored to our lives.

107
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,179
Cheers.

108
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,980
And now it's time for me
to pursue Gorya for real.

109
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:27,400
What?

110
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:29,811
There goes our peace.

111
00:08:29,814 --> 00:08:34,162
Hasn't it been for real
all this time, Mr. Thyme?

112
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,329
Of course.

113
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,159
But I have to go next level this time.

114
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,751
I got Ren's blessing.

115
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:40,925
Everything is ready.

116
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:44,086
And now Gorya wants
me to pursue her harder.

117
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:46,899
Look. All of you, take a look.

118
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:50,583
See? You know what this is?

119
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:52,596
Take a look. Come closer.

120
00:08:52,694 --> 00:08:55,232
These are all the texts that
Gorya hasn't responded at all.

121
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,339
You know what this means?

122
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,259
She ghosts me because she
wants to see me in person so bad.

123
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,588
He excels

124
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:03,879
in his imagination.

125
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:04,940
No need to praise me.

126
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:06,357
It's not hard to figure out.

127
00:09:06,453 --> 00:09:09,490
Gorya, why didn't you just
tell me you wanted to see me?

128
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,819
No problem.

129
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,759
Hey, we will graduate soon.

130
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,481
And your birthday is coming up.

131
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:23,480
Let's put your focus on
what's important here.

132
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,832
How am I focusing on the wrong thing?

133
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:28,369
We're graduating so I have
to close the deal before that.

134
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,619
How am I wrong, right, Ren?

135
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:36,160
Go for it.

136
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:37,809
There it is! I knew it!

137
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,737
You're the only one who
truly understands me.

138
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,352
You will see after today

139
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:44,409
I will move forward to
pursue Gorya for real.

140
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,600
Come on. Cheers!

141
00:09:49,194 --> 00:09:51,260
Cheers!

142
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,659
(Part-time job)

143
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,929
Come and help me with my homework.

144
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,329
Sure. Which one?

145
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:05,930
This one.

146
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,200
This? It's about...
(Doorbell not working: Must fix!)

147
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,080
Is Gorya here?

148
00:10:16,084 --> 00:10:17,140
No, she's not.

149
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:19,039
Please pass this to her.

150
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,980
OK.

151
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:22,122
Please be gentle with the door.

152
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:24,299
Hello, Uncle Ga.

153
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,260
(Call mee back now!
- Thyme)

154
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:35,339
Argh! What's up with her?

155
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,787
Hello, Kavin.

156
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:46,719
I have a favor to ask.

157
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,340
It's urgent!

158
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,339
(Maytee O Garden)

159
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:55,980
Why does it have to be me?

160
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,779
Sorry.

161
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,859
You carry things too heavy for your size.

162
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,860
Thank you.

163
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,619
No need to thank me.

164
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,700
Of course I help you.

165
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:33,219
You're my girlfriend.

166
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:37,520
What girlfriend?

167
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:41,019
When we saw your ex the last time.

168
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:43,019
Don't you remember?

169
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,568
My heart is broken. I'm so sad.

170
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,133
Stop it, Kavin.

171
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:50,110
No more teasing me.

172
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:52,909
Fine.

173
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,198
What were you doing
carrying all this stuff?

174
00:11:57,211 --> 00:11:59,279
Uncle Ga recently got
a whole lot of flowers.

175
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,299
He's thinking of making
garlands for extra income

176
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,228
and sell it here.

177
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:05,962
It's not easy to make beautiful garlands.

178
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,540
Want me to teach you?

179
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,859
Can you?

180
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,860
Sure.

181
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:12,640
It's actually nice.

182
00:12:12,645 --> 00:12:14,419
Although I'm not your boyfriend,

183
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,779
I get to be your teacher.

184
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,662
Are you going to flirt every 10 seconds?

185
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:21,453
Enough playing.

186
00:12:21,454 --> 00:12:24,328
By the way, what are you doing here?

187
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,899
I'm just... worried about Gorya.

188
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,979
She hasn't been around lately.

189
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,219
Thyme is getting cranky.

190
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,970
Gorya is around.

191
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:38,059
She's been taking on more jobs.

192
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,937
She has serious financial problems.

193
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:43,115
Her folks have gone back to their hometown.

194
00:12:43,117 --> 00:12:44,100
What's going on?

195
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:46,619
Her dad's company was shut down.

196
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,519
He lost his job.

197
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,599
Luckily, her mom has
an orchard in the province.

198
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,699
So her mom and dad decided
to move back there permanently.

199
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,959
Take care of yourselves.

200
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,850
Don't worry, Dad. I'll take care of him.

201
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,060
Glakao said he might move
there too during his school break

202
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,059
and will leave Gorya here on her own.

203
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:15,019
But you don't have to worry.

204
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:16,619
Gorya's got a lot of fight in her

205
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,379
because of your friend's mom.

206
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:21,779
My friend's mom?

207
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,179
What does she have to do with anything?

208
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,324
You do know, right?

209
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:32,129
She went to see Gorya at her house

210
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,179
and offered her money in exchange
for her leaving Thyme alone.

211
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:42,419
You didn't know?

212
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:46,539
What is the name of the company
where Gorya's dad worked?

213
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,739
Mr. Thyme!

214
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,740
Hold on.

215
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,317
I found out about the whole thing.

216
00:13:54,414 --> 00:13:58,059
How could you have
done that to Gorya's family?

217
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,699
I just went to negotiate.

218
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,980
How could that be a negotiation?

219
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:06,939
It's a threat.

220
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,449
All I did was offering a way
that could benefit both parties.

221
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:16,351
How was that a threat?

222
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,470
How?

223
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,447
I looked into it.

224
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:23,329
Sanchai Jundee's company had to close down

225
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:26,337
because two major investors pulled out.

226
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,699
All orders from overseas disappeared.

227
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,619
Everything can be traced
to the Parama Group.

228
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,057
You made them suffer financial
ruin and then offered them money.

229
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,459
That's no way to negotiate.

230
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,300
You've learned how to be smart.

231
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,810
I will never back down...

232
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:57,148
But be smart in the right place.

233
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,699
You'll be a man in a few days.

234
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,459
But you've been obsessed
with your stupid puppy love.

235
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,969
That girl will only be a dead
weight for the Parama Group.

236
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,479
Start thinking about your future.

237
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,339
You're not going to fix anything, are you?

238
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,460
Sure, I'll help her out myself.

239
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,599
Oh? How?

240
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,099
Are you going to donate your money to her?

241
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,819
How can someone like you help anyone?

242
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:41,219
Even though I can't help, I'll try.

243
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,959
Hello,

244
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,339
it's first-time farmers calling.

245
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,439
Do we look cool or what?

246
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,409
Do we, huh?

247
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,939
Very cool.

248
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,719
How has life over there been
treating you? Any difficulties?

249
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:06,345
We... OK...

250
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,719
The signal is terrible.

251
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,359
Don't worry about us.

252
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,074
Worry about yourself.

253
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:13,809
I know that thieves are being
active in our neighborhood.

254
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,097
How did you find out?

255
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,259
How could we not?

256
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,550
Your brother was very visible.

257
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,009
(Citizens file charges after over
10 houses have been burgled.)

258
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,349
People living in Kaset-Nawamin
area have filed charges

259
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,639
after over ten houses have been burgled.

260
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,680
The police haven't been
able to catch the burglars.

261
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,069
I tried to keep it quiet.

262
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,690
The economy isn't good.

263
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:38,909
The gov... very...

264
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,949
When the economy slows
down, burglary increases.

265
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,694
You need to take care of yourself.

266
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:46,410
If this happens again, you need to tell us.

267
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,449
- Don't keep quiet.
- I know. I know.

268
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,579
It's nothing. You don't need to worry.

269
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,139
The police are excellent. They
will catch the burglars soon.

270
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,099
Mom! Mom!

271
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,099
Can you hear me?

272
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,549
Thyme!

273
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,589
What's your problem?

274
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,149
What's yours?

275
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,460
You can't sneak up on people like that.

276
00:18:02,465 --> 00:18:03,920
What are you doing here anyway?

277
00:18:03,924 --> 00:18:05,382
I'm just coming home.

278
00:18:05,386 --> 00:18:06,609
- Home?
- Yeah.

279
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,700
Don't be a wisecracker.
Your home isn't here.

280
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,849
People like me, when we get bored,
we find a new place to hang out.

281
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,379
A new place to hang out?

282
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,799
But there are no condos
or hotels around here.

283
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,499
There's just...

284
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,040
(For sale, please call Phuchong.)

285
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,199
That's right.

286
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,339
There's no condo for me to buy around here.

287
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,699
So I... bought a house.

288
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,460
Nice to meet you, neighbor.

289
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,069
If you have anything to say, just say it.

290
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,739
Mother, I've never asked you for anything.

291
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:20,139
But can you please allow
Thyme freedom in his love life?

292
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,179
You fly back to Singapore tomorrow

293
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,009
and sort out everything
before the end of the month.

294
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,089
Mother, I'm serious.

295
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,923
You forced me into a
loveless marriage once.

296
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:40,860
And I let you.

297
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:42,459
Because of the word 'family'.

298
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,439
Can't I ask for my brother's
happiness in return?

299
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,369
Happiness?

300
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:53,529
Are you saying you're not happy
having everything you have today?

301
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,511
The beautiful love in your
dream is fleeting happiness.

302
00:19:57,514 --> 00:20:01,859
I will never put our family
at risk for this nonsense.

303
00:20:07,536 --> 00:20:09,939
Unless you have anything else, get out.

304
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,939
And remember this.

305
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,700
Everything that I plan must be perfect.

306
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,579
I think you've gone too far this time.

307
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,180
For perfection,

308
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,060
there's no such thing as going too far.

309
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,379
But you've gone too far!

310
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:56,339
You've spent millions to buy a house.

311
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,679
Are you nuts?

312
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,199
Well... this house is...

313
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,659
beautiful, isn't it?

314
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,529
It's a vacation home.

315
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,999
- Vacation home?
- Yes.

316
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,159
Vacation home?

317
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,462
Look at it, it's nothing like
the mansion where you live.

318
00:21:10,463 --> 00:21:11,619
You can never live in this place.

319
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,829
Vacation home?

320
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,125
What else could I do? You went missing.

321
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:16,809
I know that only you
and your brother live here,

322
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,179
and there are thieves.

323
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,899
Don't you know how much I care?

324
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,899
I know that you like to fix things
yourself and don't involve others.

325
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,139
But if anything happened to
you and I wasn't there to help,

326
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,139
the guilt would plague
me for the rest of my life.

327
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,539
Please Gorya, let me take care of you.

328
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,899
It can be from a distance.

329
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,580
I promise I won't 'outvade' your privacy.

330
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,297
Almost.

331
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,579
If you think you can live here, then do it.

332
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,369
But are you sure,

333
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,575
before you can take care of others,

334
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,670
that you can take care of yourself?

335
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,219
This is Thyme.

336
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,219
If I set my mind on something,

337
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,899
there's nothing I can't do.

338
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,129
Gorya!

339
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,149
Gorya! Help!

340
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,550
Thyme!

341
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,737
What's happening?

342
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:31,950
What is this?

343
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,489
What are you doing?

344
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,259
I just want to do my laundry.

345
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,620
But I don't know what's
wrong. Can you take a look?

346
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,619
Stop! Stop!

347
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,670
You didn't connect the pipe, did you?

348
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,900
Did I have to?

349
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,289
Pour it in the cap.

350
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,539
Then pour it here.

351
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,739
Close the lid.

352
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,669
And push 'start'.

353
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,492
- Are you listening?
- I am. I am.

354
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:58,569
It smells great. Hold on.

355
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,009
Push the button, close
the lid, and pour it in.

356
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,312
- What?
- No. Pour, close, and push.

357
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:04,317
Pour, close and push.

358
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,100
Pour, close, and push.

359
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,730
Gorya! Help!

360
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:09,720
Gorya!

361
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:11,857
Thyme! What's happening?

362
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:15,199
Gorya, catch it. I don't know what that is.

363
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,649
Can you see? It's walking away.

364
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,149
Why are you standing
there? Help me catch it.

365
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,440
It's got six legs.

366
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Did you get it?

367
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,339
Thyme, it's gone.

368
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,440
- Where did it go?
- Right here!

369
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,979
Stop! Stop!

370
00:23:31,085 --> 00:23:32,060
Gorya!

371
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:33,529
Gorya! Help!

372
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,330
What is it this time?

373
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,809
Gorya, how did it burn a hole in my shirt?

374
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,060
How can I wear it? I can't.

375
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,192
Gorya!

376
00:23:44,197 --> 00:23:45,530
Gorya! Help!

377
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,839
Gorya, this is bad.

378
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,949
Hurry, it's bad.

379
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,059
Come and help.

380
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,140
Gorya!

381
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,100
I'm exhausted!

382
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,759
I can't anymore, Kaning.

383
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,819
My family situation is
a lot of work already.

384
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,599
Now I have to raise a giant baby too.

385
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,030
Unreal.

386
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:07,499
Come on.

387
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,769
He's just moved in so
there's a lot of things to do.

388
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,770
Take it easy.

389
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,649
I'm tired.

390
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,349
I'm jealous of everyone.

391
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,949
Why does everyone seem
chill and happy, except me?

392
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,618
We don't have what they have.

393
00:24:20,717 --> 00:24:23,720
Keep going. You can do it.

394
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,999
So... what are you going to do next?

395
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,792
I don't know.

396
00:24:27,794 --> 00:24:32,450
Work hard, study hard. That's all I can do.

397
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,069
But if you talk about Thyme,

398
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,032
I can tell you I'm so sick of him.

399
00:24:37,035 --> 00:24:42,179
I see him four times a day. I just can't.

400
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,519
Don't tell me

401
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,499
you hate him already.

402
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,579
I don't. I know he means well.

403
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,179
Try to keep your distance. It might help.

404
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,609
I have to go. Bye. Fight on.

405
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:00,240
Thanks.

406
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,709
Thyme's birthday is within a few days.

407
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:13,262
I think the party will be grand this year.

408
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,740
I so want to be invited.

409
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,479
I saw the Thyme extravaganza at the school.

410
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,459
Tons of shares on social media.

411
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,639
Isn't it a bit too big and odd?

412
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,229
Like Mother tries to blow up something.

413
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:47,029
She always goes big.
Don't mind her. It's annoying.

414
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:47,810
No.

415
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,810
If she goes big, you have to be prepared,

416
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,819
especially with Gorya.

417
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,229
I don't even know if
she's going to be there.

418
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,469
She has to be there.

419
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,209
Don't worry.

420
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,349
I sent her a gorgeous dress.

421
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,359
I guarantee you she
will shine amid the crowd.

422
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,189
I can't do anything to stop you, can I?

423
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,484
Don't worry.

424
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:10,489
You two have my full support.

425
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,419
I know about your
moving next door to Gorya.

426
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,420
You did great. Keep going.

427
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,419
I have to go. Bye.

428
00:26:22,352 --> 00:26:23,499
What's the big deal?

429
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,960
It's just another birthday.
Why does it have to be so big?

430
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:28,159
It's not surprising.

431
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,739
This is an important event
for the Paramaanatras.

432
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,959
All the high-level people will be there.

433
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,939
And you're about to graduate.

434
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,459
Your mom probably wants you
to be involved in the business.

435
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,899
But I got a strange
feeling about it this time.

436
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,339
Never mind.

437
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,197
Why did you bring us here anyway?

438
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:56,009
It's a housewarming party for my new place.

439
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:56,980
Party?

440
00:26:56,981 --> 00:27:00,039
I want you to experience
a new kind of party.

441
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,250
Change of scenery, you know.

442
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,930
How about the truth?

443
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,019
I'm here to take care of Gorya.

444
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,339
I can't bother her every second.

445
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,149
If I run into trouble here,
you'll have to help me. OK?

446
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,639
OK.

447
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,999
But where's the party? Food?

448
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,359
We're starving here.

449
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,919
Yeah, we are starving.

450
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,890
OK. Wait a minute.

451
00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:28,319
Stop whining.

452
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,097
I'll cook.

453
00:27:29,195 --> 00:27:30,609
You guys find something to do.

454
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,825
Wow, Thyme is cooking.

455
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:35,500
Oh my.

456
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,450
There's no food.

457
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,939
There's no entertainment.

458
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,480
It's a true luxury home.

459
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,250
Stop whining. Here you go. All done.

460
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,830
Wow!

461
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,809
It looks better than I thought.

462
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:02,230
Of course. I can make
something yummy on my first try.

463
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,070
Let's start.

464
00:28:04,071 --> 00:28:06,019
Stop! Stop!

465
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,210
Why?

466
00:28:15,157 --> 00:28:18,279
Alright, this is what I told you about.

467
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,779
Watching TV while eating instant noodles.

468
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,920
The lifestyle that you've
never experienced before.

469
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,810
This will never work.

470
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,380
Shit, she has to scream and slap?

471
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,810
The male lead is so stupid.

472
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,960
The female lead, slap her.

473
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,880
That's right. That's the
way to do it. Very gratifying.

474
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,459
Again! Again!

475
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,219
Yeah!

476
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:53,300
- (Wear this dress to Thyme's birthday party. I want to see you shine.
- Tia.)

477
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,259
Wow, Sis. So premium.

478
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,259
You will look so beautiful in it.

479
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,259
Why do you look like that?

480
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,739
I just thought everyone's
acting all chaotic.

481
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,469
Our family situation
alone is chaotic enough.

482
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,699
You don't want to go to
Thyme's birthday party.

483
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,540
Why would I? It's a waste of time.

484
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,579
Also, if I go, I don't know...

485
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,899
what else I'll have to endure.

486
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:46,339
Come on, you can work
on the problem step by step.

487
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,499
All the chaos will slowly resolve.

488
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,979
You start to sound more
and more like Kaning.

489
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,879
Thank you.

490
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,150
Gorya! Help!

491
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,709
The TV just went black. Fix it for me.

492
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,519
What is this? Get out.

493
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,769
I'll fix it later.

494
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:10,680
But the drama is just about to get good.

495
00:30:10,681 --> 00:30:12,256
I know. I'll look into it later. Get out.

496
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:13,259
What?

497
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,060
Things don't seem to
get less chaotic at all.

498
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,810
Sis.

499
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:20,897
What?

500
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,899
Things look to be even more chaotic.

501
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,019
Wow, 600 baht.

502
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,709
600?

503
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,644
But it says here that it costs 300.

504
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,189
Why did the price just go up?

505
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,889
The stain is so big. Very hard to remove.

506
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,580
I need to use a special cleaning agent.

507
00:30:47,586 --> 00:30:50,578
See the stain? Very hard to remove.

508
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:52,659
600?

509
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,659
Can you please give me a discount?

510
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,039
I don't have enough money.

511
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,459
You have an expensive dress

512
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,659
and you're saying you
don't have enough money?

513
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,079
Are you charging based
on the price of the dress?

514
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,259
If you don't want to let me
clean it, you can do it yourself.

515
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,459
600?

516
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,059
Here it is.

517
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,259
It's strange.

518
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,369
I picked up a dress with a similar stain.

519
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,099
The owner charged 300 baht.

520
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,019
Why did the rate increase?

521
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,859
Maybe the stain was smaller?

522
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,329
It's the same size.

523
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,524
Let me call the owner.

524
00:31:35,525 --> 00:31:36,579
That's OK.

525
00:31:38,737 --> 00:31:40,579
300 it is.

526
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,099
Thank you.

527
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,989
If something demands
more than what you can offer,

528
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,219
better to leave it alone.

529
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,199
I think I should stop complaining

530
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,159
and switch to plastic flowers instead.

531
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,789
This won't be a problem anymore.

532
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,369
Look, all things here wilt.

533
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:28,259
The flowers wilt. The person wilts.

534
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,994
That's true. What's wrong?

535
00:32:31,995 --> 00:32:35,739
I just suddenly wonder

536
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,859
about the word 'be worthy of'.

537
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,379
What does it really mean?

538
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,189
Is this about Thyme's birthday party?

539
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,459
A lot of things really.

540
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,149
For me, Gorya, it's about
how you view this word,

541
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,259
not anyone else.

542
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,699
How about this?

543
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,219
What do you think is the most
valuable birthday gift I've ever received?

544
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,339
What?

545
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,619
Here it is. The keyring you
made for me a few years ago.

546
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,369
I love it so much.

547
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,499
You still keep it?

548
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:26,039
For me, it's the pink wig
that looks like cotton candy.

549
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,069
You guys got it for me last year.

550
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,017
You know, I haven't worn it, not even once.

551
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,379
Too self-conscious.

552
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:36,930
That's right. Don't stress over it.

553
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,979
If you want to get Thyme
a gift, put your care into it.

554
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,259
The more care you put,
the more clearly he will see.

555
00:33:51,546 --> 00:33:55,499
The more you care, the more visible?

556
00:33:57,438 --> 00:33:58,739
You know what?

557
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,677
Since Thyme moved next door,

558
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:05,020
I can see how hard he tries to change.

559
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,990
See you.

560
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,320
- See you.
- See you.

561
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:14,860
I can see that what's he
doing has been hard for him.

562
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,019
It seems like both of us bite
off more than we can chew.

563
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,429
There. There.

564
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,179
Uncle Ga!

565
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:36,099
So? You've been biting off more
than you can chew your whole life.

566
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,459
These things take time.

567
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:44,179
Who knows? Thyme may make
magic happen for you to see.

568
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,179
Let's wait and see.

569
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,210
Make it straight.

570
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,220
It is straight. See?

571
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,658
Hold it.

572
00:34:58,659 --> 00:35:01,099
Gorya, have some breakfast.

573
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,210
You need your strength.
I'll make it for you.

574
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,479
What is it?

575
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,699
Your breakfast.

576
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,520
What are you drawing?

577
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,316
Here you go.

578
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,790
It's you.

579
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,620
Am I good or what?

580
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,939
Better than I thought.

581
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:23,749
Thank you.

582
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,939
You're welcome.

583
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,490
How is it good? It's not good at all.

584
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,499
Take this to school.

585
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,119
Let's go to school.

586
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Let's go.

587
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,209
Can I ask you something?

588
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,210
Do you like cookies?

589
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,529
Who would eat cookies in the morning?

590
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:47,870
Not right now. I mean in general
do you enjoy eating cookies?

591
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,099
I eat everything.

592
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,259
(We've cut the dough into teddy bears.)

593
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:02,110
(We will take the bears into the
oven for 5 minutes at 175 degrees.)

594
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,299
This is so comfy.

595
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,559
I've been sleeping on a
hard bed. My back hurts.

596
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,739
(Complimentary by Taemiyaklin Kittiyangkul)

597
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,899
This chair is superb.

598
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,419
Of course it is. It costs
hundreds of thousands.

599
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,893
I'm thankful that my family
donated this to the director.

600
00:36:15,894 --> 00:36:18,029
We can use it when we have some free time.

601
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:21,979
Makes sense. Things we donate are ours.

602
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,299
Anyway, is it a good idea to trick Gorya?

603
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,909
How can someone like me live in that house?

604
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,828
I can tolerate a hard bed
but what about clothes?

605
00:36:34,924 --> 00:36:36,709
Who washes it? Who dries it?

606
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,237
I stressed about it for days.

607
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,029
But I've got a plan now.

608
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,179
Explain.

609
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,499
It's not difficult.

610
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,319
I just wait for Gorya to go to sleep

611
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,859
and I bring all my clothes
to be washed at home.

612
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,859
I take them all back in the morning.

613
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,139
Easy-peasy. No problem.

614
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,900
You said you were concerned about thieves.

615
00:36:52,903 --> 00:36:56,319
Ren, it's not rocket science.

616
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,179
I just place my security
team in the neighborhood.

617
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,019
You need to focus on what's important here.

618
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,395
I need to win some points from Gorya.

619
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:10,480
And my clever plan will
win major points from her.

620
00:37:10,484 --> 00:37:13,529
Most importantly, she's so stupid.

621
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,200
She can't figure out my plan.

622
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
How stupid?

623
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,859
As stupid as a...

624
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,179
Have you ever died at the
hands of a fool, smart guy?

625
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,579
- Gorya!
- You call me stupid?

626
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,133
Stop! Hear me out!

627
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,520
Am I stupid?

628
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,400
Stop it!

629
00:37:31,401 --> 00:37:33,859
Where are you going? Come back.

630
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:58,859
You asked for it. Get it.

631
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:02,779
What are you doing?

632
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:16,749
You're the rider from the other day.

633
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,859
How is it that you're here?

634
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,139
I'm a student here.

635
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,139
What a small world!

636
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:26,139
Thank you for the other day.

637
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,939
But how come I never saw you here?

638
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,050
It's not surprising.

639
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:35,359
I just got a scholarship here
and I don't like rich people.

640
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,969
I try to keep to myself.

641
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:40,739
I don't stand out like
someone here, Miss Gorya.

642
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,742
You know my name.

643
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,500
And...

644
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,059
My name is Talay.

645
00:38:59,515 --> 00:39:01,779
What is this?

646
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:07,339
You don't like F4 that much?

647
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,734
I hate them. They're so spoiled.

648
00:39:12,737 --> 00:39:14,689
They think they're so clever.

649
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,019
Right?

650
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,712
But it's too bad we
can't do anything to them.

651
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,659
True. This is as good as it gets.

652
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,419
Speaking about it makes me angry.

653
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,419
Why don't we do some more?

654
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:38,419
Come on.

655
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,379
What?

656
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,779
Just go with it. This is
not enough damage, right?

657
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,099
"Right."

658
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,551
Come on.

659
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:52,340
Should I?

660
00:39:52,341 --> 00:39:53,739
Definitely.

661
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,520
You suck!

662
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,059
You're an idiot!

663
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,257
More.

664
00:40:04,717 --> 00:40:06,963
Are you looking at me?

665
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,039
Eat this. You spoiled self-indulgent brat!

666
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,259
What are you doing?

667
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,120
Wait! Stop!

668
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,897
Thanks for giving me a ride.

669
00:40:27,543 --> 00:40:29,419
No problem.

670
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:33,276
You said you're looking for more jobs.

671
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,499
I can help with that. I've got quite a few.

672
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:39,499
Thank you very much, Talay.

673
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,779
You've been a great help.

674
00:40:42,345 --> 00:40:44,979
If we don't help each other, who will?

675
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,059
True. No one at the school gets me.

676
00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:00,859
Those rich kids? No way.

677
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,039
For someone like you,

678
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,489
no matter how hard you try,

679
00:41:34,585 --> 00:41:36,779
you will never be worthy of Thyme.

680
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,538
Carry the gift table to the front.

681
00:41:55,635 --> 00:41:58,299
And do it carefully.

682
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:07,379
I'm returning this dress to Tia.

683
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,849
She's not here. She's overseas.

684
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,499
Do you want to leave her a message?

685
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:20,499
Please tell her that I
can't wear this dress.

686
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,899
It's a pity.

687
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,100
Pardon?

688
00:42:30,103 --> 00:42:31,877
It's nothing.

689
00:42:31,878 --> 00:42:34,939
Do you want me to inform Ms.
Tia that you won't be attending?

690
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,539
Please excuse me.

691
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,390
Ren.

692
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,699
What are you doing here?

693
00:43:04,284 --> 00:43:07,499
Thyme left something on
my yacht so I'm returning it.

694
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,499
Your yacht?

695
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,019
It's so F4.

696
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,099
Do you have free time?

697
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:28,219
Let's go for a walk.

698
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,259
It's a shame about that dress.

699
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:48,300
I want to see you wear it.

700
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,339
It won't work, Ren.

701
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,339
But you've never tried it.

702
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:02,039
You're right.

703
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,140
But it's not right for me.

704
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,179
No one should think
something isn't right for them.

705
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,819
Wasn't that what Mira said?

706
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:26,739
I'm beginning to have doubts about it.

707
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:32,961
Regardless,

708
00:44:32,968 --> 00:44:35,522
I believe

709
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:37,259
that you will make it.

710
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,659
I believe in you.

711
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,579
I believe in Thyme.

712
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,419
All of it.

713
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,900
- Put it all?
- Yes.

714
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,659
This looks delicious.

715
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,139
Am I good or what?

716
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,289
You praise yourself again.

717
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:40,859
I made this myself.
Who else should I praise?

718
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,289
You've come home late.
The food is getting cold.

719
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:49,241
You're exaggerating, Thyme.

720
00:45:49,244 --> 00:45:50,409
We finished it just now.

721
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,469
What are you doing?

722
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:54,209
Thyme wanted to cook

723
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,229
so he dragged me to
the market for groceries.

724
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:58,179
And we went in blind in our cooking.

725
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,939
Look at the kitchen and
our clothes. It's a mess.

726
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,019
I will clean it up.

727
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:10,870
(Who wants to be a millionaire?) Sorry,
I borrowed this one from your family.

728
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:16,120
Let me see what's on the table?

729
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,680
(Sorrie)

730
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,259
I told him it's misspelled.

731
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,899
It looks yummy.

732
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,539
Let's eat.

733
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,059
OK, I'll get some water.

734
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,500
Go on.

735
00:46:42,677 --> 00:46:43,689
Which one is delicious?

736
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:45,179
They all are delicious.

737
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,249
There are fried vegetables,

738
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:49,330
omelet, and clear soup.

739
00:46:49,826 --> 00:46:52,720
Let me start with fried vegetables.

740
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,170
Let me join.

741
00:46:56,171 --> 00:46:57,489
Did you make these yourselves?

742
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:58,550
Of course.

743
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:03,739
The food you made was quite good.

744
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:05,739
No doubt.

745
00:47:07,093 --> 00:47:09,739
I can't give you even small praise.

746
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,659
Are you staying here? You look chill.

747
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,461
Don't you have to go back
to prep for the birthday party?

748
00:47:18,715 --> 00:47:20,459
No.

749
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,860
I want to stay here a while longer.

750
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:30,378
That kind of party is
not even a bit interesting.

751
00:47:30,474 --> 00:47:31,270
I don't care about it.

752
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:33,663
Wow, you're a grown man.

753
00:47:33,665 --> 00:47:36,259
You're P'Thyme now. You
don't care about your birthday.

754
00:47:37,351 --> 00:47:41,299
I don't care about that nonsense party.

755
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,339
But birthdays are important to me.

756
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,979
Go inside.

757
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,939
Why are you in a hurry to chase me away?

758
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,459
I'm not but it's getting late.

759
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,329
Just a bit longer.

760
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:07,099
Oh, I have something to talk to you about.

761
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,459
Can I bring my laundry home once a week?

762
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:12,819
It's so hard to wash.

763
00:48:13,231 --> 00:48:16,139
Fine. It's up to you.

764
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,668
If you can't do it, don't force it.

765
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,436
So we can go inside now, right?

766
00:48:22,437 --> 00:48:23,279
Hey, Gorya.

767
00:48:23,377 --> 00:48:24,809
What else?

768
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:27,005
- What?
- You held me back twice.

769
00:48:27,008 --> 00:48:28,099
I...

770
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,100
What about the clock?

771
00:48:39,813 --> 00:48:41,379
What's so funny?

772
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:47,579
I told you it's important to me.

773
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,259
Will you count it down for me?

774
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,229
Are you ready to become a year older?

775
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:10,859
Yes.

776
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,649
10

777
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,259
9

778
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,859
8

779
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,719
7

780
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,339
6

781
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,089
5

782
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:24,119
4

783
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,309
3

784
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:28,479
2

785
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,480
1

786
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,219
Happy birthday.

787
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,380
Can you say happy birthday to yourself?

788
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,379
Sure I can.

789
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:17,539
We can go.

790
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,579
Gorya.

791
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,939
My birthday party...

792
00:50:29,457 --> 00:50:31,859
if you don't want to come, it's fine.

793
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,299
I'll be there.

794
00:50:41,702 --> 00:50:45,179
I'll bring you a gift.

795
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,179
But if you don't like it,

796
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,580
don't complain to me.

797
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:03,840
More.

798
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:04,869
Here I am.

799
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:06,389
- Did you get everything?
- Yes.

800
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,540
Flour and then eggs.

801
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:15,910
We are making cookies for Mr. Thyme.

802
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,630
Here we go.

803
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,449
Done.

804
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:25,529
Wow.

805
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:26,660
They look good.

806
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,969
Are these Thyme's faces?

807
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:37,659
I can see that.

808
00:52:23,414 --> 00:52:26,699
I must say I have to hand it to you.

809
00:52:27,928 --> 00:52:30,339
After all those things I said,

810
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:34,539
you show up here like nothing happened.

811
00:52:37,456 --> 00:52:39,309
Don't you think

812
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:43,059
this is more embarrassing than
accepting the money I offered?

813
00:52:50,302 --> 00:52:53,299
I'm here to celebrate
Thyme's important day.

814
00:52:53,974 --> 00:52:55,353
What's embarrassing about that?

815
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:57,219
Really?

816
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,819
No hidden agenda?

817
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,459
There is, in fact.

818
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,516
I wanted to see you and tell you

819
00:53:06,613 --> 00:53:11,700
that no matter how many
insults you throw at me,

820
00:53:11,958 --> 00:53:15,699
I know that I'm worth more than that.

821
00:53:17,074 --> 00:53:21,979
Just a stranger telling me I'm worthless...

822
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:25,099
It doesn't make me feel small.

823
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,979
I'm sorry if that disappoints you.

824
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:34,979
But my relationship,

825
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,059
my choice.

826
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,649
That was so cool.

827
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:54,778
Too bad I didn't capture it on VDO.

828
00:53:54,877 --> 00:53:57,219
No adults have ever done what you just did.

829
00:53:57,269 --> 00:54:00,220
You're a badass, Gorya.

830
00:54:00,275 --> 00:54:02,219
Have you seen Thyme?

831
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,619
Go see him.

832
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:12,019
No, I'm just bringing him
a gift. I'm leaving soon.

833
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:14,019
No need to rush out.

834
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,079
You're a star tonight.

835
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,300
How am I a star?

836
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:18,970
This.

837
00:54:25,437 --> 00:54:27,219
(Kavin)

838
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,539
(Here he comes.)

839
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,819
Be careful.

840
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:52,979
Do you have to be all dressed up?

841
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:56,059
If you want to say I look
handsome, just say it.

842
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:03,019
You...

843
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,950
look cute yourself.

844
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:14,020
Happy birthday, officially.

845
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,019
Thank you.

846
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,019
So...

847
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,649
Where's my gift?

848
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:22,979
No?

849
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:23,930
Where's my gift?

850
00:55:23,931 --> 00:55:25,288
There's no gift. Who
said anything about a gift?

851
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:27,579
Good evening.

852
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,479
The Paramaanatra family welcomes everyone

853
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,259
who honors us with their
presence at Thyme's birthday party.

854
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:40,980
And I am pleased to meet special guests...

855
00:55:41,398 --> 00:55:43,699
every one of them.

856
00:55:45,617 --> 00:55:48,729
But this year is even more special.

857
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:55,019
There is a special family who
comes to our event for the first time.

858
00:55:55,642 --> 00:55:58,219
They are the Empiccas.

859
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:06,219
You all know that the EPC Group is
well renowned in the business scene.

860
00:56:06,392 --> 00:56:08,219
And I...

861
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,860
Catch her.

862
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:12,168
Catch her.

863
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:15,539
Madam.

864
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:21,139
And I'm ready to support
new blood in the scene.

865
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:28,579
For a closer stronger relationship
between our two families,

866
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,819
I am very pleased to
inform everyone here that...

867
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:06,299
this girl is Lita - Lalita Empicca.

868
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,339
And she is to be engaged to Thyme.

869
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:26,959
If Thyme's mom wants
to just get rid of Gorya,

870
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,130
she doesn't need to
reveal his fiancée so soon.

871
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,310
Don't you think it's too
strange and too soon?

872
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:35,740
Thyme? I do not like him at all.

873
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,560
But... what's your relationship with Thyme?

874
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,699
What about Mr. Thyme and Miss Lita?

875
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,099
Because of the timing,

876
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:46,480
everything will be set in motion by itself.

877
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,540
I know it well.
