1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,809
I was going to ask you
to give it back to Gorya.

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,329
She dropped it when she met me.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,880
I must've left my phone on the bus.

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,000
What did you say?

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,880
What did you just say?

6
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:09,229
Thyme! Stop!

7
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,539
Because you're still the same.

8
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,210
And I hate this kind of person.

9
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:14,060
Let's just stay like this for a while.

10
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,649
The higher something rises to the top,

11
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,059
when it crashes,

12
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,706
(I wish you find new love
that's better than me.)

13
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,040
the more dangerous it will get.

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,299
Hey, did you find Gorya?

15
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:58,545
Look at her.

16
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,579
I made one comment on her IG.

17
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,579
She sent me a bouquet.

18
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:04,879
What a stupid girl!

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,760
So easy.

20
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:08,139
You're having fun, huh?

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Excuse me?

22
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,459
You're having fun fooling someone, huh?

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,890
Answer me!

24
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:21,059
Shit! What the hell?

25
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,059
Let's go. What's up with that guy?

26
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,809
- Thyme! Thyme, stop!
- No filming. No filming.

27
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,379
Easy or you'll kill him.

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,339
Do you want a piece of this?

29
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,249
Shit, don't say it.

30
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,380
Nobody can stop him when he gets this way.

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,109
Thyme! Stop, Thyme!

32
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,219
What the hell are you doing?

33
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,619
Kavin, MJ.

34
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,499
I made up my mind.

35
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,379
There will only be three in F4.

36
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,129
Hmm?

37
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,939
What do you mean?

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,379
Ren is out of F4.

39
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,419
Thyme, slow down.

40
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,420
Let's be civil and talk about it.

41
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,699
We are all friends here.

42
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,579
I don't have such a shitty friend.

43
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,949
You two, stop hanging out with him.

44
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,216
Hey, Thyme.

45
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:13,259
What? Are you going against me too?

46
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,099
I'm tired.

47
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,619
I don't want to deal with this anymore.

48
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,239
Thyme, let's talk.

49
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,379
Thyme!

50
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,139
Is there anything left to talk about?

51
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:54,939
Ren, what did you do?

52
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,939
Go and talk to him now.

53
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,859
Everyone just does whatever he wants.

54
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,919
Thyme!

55
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,449
Thyme! Stop!

56
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,079
Thyme, just stop!

57
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,179
Let's talk it out.

58
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,459
You're mad at me about the phone.

59
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,459
I know I was wrong for lying to you.

60
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,999
But the only person you
should be mad at is me.

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,779
No need to take it out on other people,

62
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,779
not to mention Ren.

63
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,779
You've gone too far,

64
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,839
blowing up at people who
got nothing to do with this.

65
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,939
What did Ren do to get kicked out of F4?

66
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,670
Stop letting your emotions take over.

67
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,579
Damn it! Stop! Not another word! Stop!

68
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,900
Want to protect him, huh?

69
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,499
Want to protect him, huh?

70
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,179
Sure, I won't kick him out of F4.

71
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,259
But tell me you hate him.

72
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:35,739
Tell me that you hate him.

73
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,979
Say it. Say that you hate him.

74
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,579
Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it!

75
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,160
For God's sake!

76
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,299
You will never choose me anyway.

77
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,229
This is a very serious
situation for our school.

78
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,289
His parent threatened to sue the school.

79
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,269
We've been aiding him all this time

80
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,127
but there's nothing we can do this time.

81
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:27,839
I fully understand the
severity of the situation.

82
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,089
We will compensate the
school for everything.

83
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,429
Please do not worry.

84
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,139
I'm not worried about those things.

85
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,970
The most damaging things are the clips.

86
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,950
Clips?

87
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,029
Yes.

88
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,479
Some students were
recording what was going on.

89
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,720
There may not be a lot, but
it's started to be shared.

90
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,099
If the clips blow up, we
have to protect ourselves.

91
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,219
Hope you can comprehend that, Ms. Tia.

92
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,779
This clip... Has it been deleted?

93
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,279
We will start by contacting the
other party requesting a mediation.

94
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,769
If they won't settle, Madam has greenlighted
to force them through their business.

95
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,590
Yes, sir.

96
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:17,916
About all the clips, have
every IT person clean it up.

97
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:18,712
Yes, sir.

98
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:21,629
But don't forget to keep the
evidence for possible litigation.

99
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,979
Yes, sir.

100
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,459
Director, please don't worry.

101
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,225
Madam has learned about
the entire situation.

102
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,235
I can assure you that

103
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,139
everything will be alright.

104
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,779
And...

105
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:41,869
We've learned the CCTV system
of the school is out of order.

106
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:48,179
The Parama Group has resolved to
double our donation to fix this issue.

107
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,219
I hope you won't have any concerns

108
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,459
about whatever Madam wants to do.

109
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,379
Not at all.

110
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,419
Nothing to worry about.

111
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,019
Please excuse me.

112
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:06,580
Mr. Pruek...

113
00:10:06,581 --> 00:10:11,179
Luckily, Madam has arrived back today.

114
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,079
Is she back?

115
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,099
Where is she?

116
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,539
Master, please come out and have a bite.

117
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,379
Master Thyme.

118
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,379
Master, please open the door.

119
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,770
I told you... leave me alone!

120
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,139
You created a huge mess this time,

121
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,329
despite knowing that whatever you do

122
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,259
cannot be leaked on the internet.

123
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,659
You caused quite a commotion for me.

124
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,639
Have you ever worried about me?

125
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,459
Of course.

126
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,369
The company has to absorb hundreds
of millions baht worth of damages

127
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,139
at the hands of my only son.
It's impossible not to worry.

128
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,219
Are you worried about the company or me?

129
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,499
I thought you've already had
your share of letting me down.

130
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,659
But you keep on disappointing me.

131
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:05,139
The cause of this whole
thing is this girl, right?

132
00:12:10,758 --> 00:12:11,450
What are you going to do?

133
00:12:11,451 --> 00:12:13,819
You have no right to ask me.

134
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,339
I haven't done anything because
I thought you were having fun,

135
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,059
you had it under control.

136
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,220
But what's this? You go
nuts because of a girl.

137
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,339
Stop this nonsense and
go back to your old self.

138
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,339
Don't make me do to you

139
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,500
what I did to your sister.

140
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,019
Understand?

141
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,359
I can't believe it.

142
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,779
That huge thing happened the other day

143
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,859
but it's very quiet now.

144
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,995
Look, all the evidence is gone.

145
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,230
And the internet is all about F4 breakup.

146
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,048
"#F4breakup It will be
only F3 from now then? Sad"

147
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,389
The only people sadder than
people on the internet are...

148
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,489
you two!

149
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,439
You sell flowers not tissue.

150
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,899
No need to be that sad.

151
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,899
I'm not sad.

152
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,779
Hey, are you still
trying to win Tesla back?

153
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,419
But he wouldn't reply. He
read my texts and ghosted me.

154
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,629
Sorry.

155
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,309
I told you. Stop blaming yourself.

156
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,339
Your thing with Thyme is so much bigger.

157
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,249
Gosh! Stop it, both of you.

158
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,789
Listen to me, Kaning.

159
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,915
It's your first broken heart. You
don't have the energy to do anything.

160
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:04,659
I get that.

161
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,779
And you, Gorya.

162
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:11,869
What you told me, after
giving it much thought,

163
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,469
there's no way it's your fault.

164
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,219
It's Thyme's problem.

165
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,379
Try to relax and chill.

166
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,379
Things will work themselves out, OK?

167
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,379
OK.

168
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:32,495
How about we close the shop early today?

169
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,159
You should go home and
lick your heart wound.

170
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,379
- But...
- No but.

171
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:40,260
Has any customer come
by since this morning?

172
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,060
We're going out of business
and I'm not stressing out.

173
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,539
Let's close early.

174
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,540
Is the shop closed?

175
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,739
Ren.

176
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,579
So you've got free time now.

177
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,579
Thyme, I'm tired of begging you.

178
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,979
But please sort it out with Ren.

179
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,979
Think about it.

180
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,539
Ren has been friends with
us for how many years.

181
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,000
Are you listening to me?

182
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,019
You try.

183
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,779
Well,

184
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,779
you haven't seen this, have you?

185
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:47,066
(Dominique - Mira go public
with their relationship.)

186
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,746
I could understand Ren. (Dominique -
Mira go public with their relationship.)

187
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,619
If it were you, you'd be confused too.

188
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:56,815
The hell?

189
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,359
Shit, that's my dad's.

190
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,179
Stop ignoring us.

191
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,540
How hard can it be to
sort things out with Ren?

192
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,859
We are tired of talking to you.

193
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,099
Then mind your own business.
Your meddling is annoying.

194
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,399
What did you say?

195
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,699
Thyme, that was harsh.

196
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,459
See them out.

197
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,779
And don't let any more
outsiders into my room.

198
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,269
Let's talk about this, Thyme.

199
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,299
Don't waste your time talking to him.

200
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,299
We are outsiders to him anyway.

201
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,509
Take it easy, Kavin.

202
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,409
You should stop.

203
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,819
You can stay if you want but I'm out.

204
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,960
What? What about your friend?

205
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,919
To hell with him. Maybe
it's time to break up.

206
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Argh!

207
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,619
Are you serious?

208
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,889
Are you going to let F4 fall apart?

209
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,899
What would you do?

210
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,259
OK, I'll talk to Thyme.

211
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,979
You talk to Ren.

212
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,420
- Well...
- Or are you going to talk to Thyme?

213
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,339
Fine, I'll talk to Ren.

214
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,049
But if it doesn't work out,

215
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,259
we go our separate ways.

216
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,619
What is this?

217
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,499
Soy milk.

218
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,819
What about this?

219
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,660
Soy ice cream.

220
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,059
Do you like this kind of stuff?

221
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,380
No, I'm allergic to soy.

222
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,579
So why would you buy all this?

223
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,579
I thought you like soy.

224
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,979
I saw that time...

225
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Oh, you still remember that.

226
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,859
I do.

227
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,499
You got a stain on your.. lip.

228
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,179
No need to go into detail.

229
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:54,499
So why did you suddenly take
me out to eat this stuff?

230
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,499
Suddenly I thought you
must've been stressed out.

231
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,059
So I wanted to take you out to do
something fun to ease the stress.

232
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,059
Is this something fun?

233
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,289
I'm all tensed up.

234
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,219
Oh.

235
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,339
You look stressed too,

236
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,339
about Mira and the fight with Thyme.

237
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,019
You shouldn't be worried
about someone else.

238
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,899
Point taken.

239
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,879
Well, that's fine.

240
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,359
Now that we're out,

241
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,979
I'll show you around.

242
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:36,933
You can trust me when it
comes to something fun.

243
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,760
Let's go.

244
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,099
Let me be your comfort in loneliness

245
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,709
Let me take away your sadness

246
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,539
Let you know there's someone right here

247
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,249
In the wind

248
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,710
Cuz I'm too scared to say it

249
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,360
Not easy to express my feelings

250
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,990
But what can I do when everything

251
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,859
That is you makes me love only you

252
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,249
Let me be your comfort in loneliness

253
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,849
Let me take away your sadness

254
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:32,639
Let you know there's someone right here

255
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,180
In the wind

256
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,810
Cuz I'm too scared to say it

257
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,460
Not easy to express my feelings

258
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,090
But what can I do when everything

259
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,419
That is you makes me love only you

260
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,019
In the wind

261
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,139
What? Those two went on a date?

262
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,099
Hey, have you been able to reach Ren?

263
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,319
Not yet.

264
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,619
I looked for him at the flower shop

265
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,059
and found out that he
took Gorya out on a date.

266
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,349
What was he thinking?

267
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,639
I don't know.

268
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,959
But Gorya is to blame too
for easily switching sides.

269
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,259
Gorya is not easy.

270
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,459
What would you call her? Loyal?

271
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,010
Don't mess with Kaning just yet.

272
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,020
Talk to Ren.

273
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,349
Talk to Ren? I don't
think we can get anywhere.

274
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,579
This is it. This is enough.
I need to take a break from this.

275
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,660
OK, I get you. Take a break.

276
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,699
Let me talk to Kaning.

277
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,470
Kaning, do you have any idea

278
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,139
where Ren and Gorya went?

279
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,285
I do.

280
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,736
Can you please take my
friend there to take a break?

281
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,290
Feed him food and water.
He's quite low maintenance.

282
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,479
I just said I didn't want to see him.

283
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,649
I'm begging you, Kavin.

284
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,610
If you see Ren, deal with him.

285
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:31,740
MJ!

286
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,819
It's been a long time since
I got to chill on my day out.

287
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,819
What about when you went out with Thyme?

288
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,219
It was nothing like a date. It's
more like a day trip from hell.

289
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,859
When I go out with him,
trouble always finds us.

290
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:02,339
Can you believe Thyme almost
punched a mascot handing out flyers?

291
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,049
At the zoo, he beat up Kaning's boyfriend.

292
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,939
He also fought with birds.

293
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,259
What kind of person is he

294
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,259
picking a fight with everyone?

295
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,979
Let's... not talk about him.

296
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,659
But you seem happy when
you talk about Thyme.

297
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,299
No. How can I be happy?

298
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:41,499
It's a lot better hanging out like this.

299
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,139
Is it really better?

300
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,859
Is this...

301
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,017
really better?

302
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,259
Let me ask you something.

303
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,339
Yes?

304
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:15,179
If you had to choose between Thyme and me,

305
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,617
who would you choose?

306
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,280
I'm thirsty.

307
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:24,630
I'm going to buy something to drink.

308
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,080
Stop!

309
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,099
Stop!

310
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,059
Stop, Gorya.

311
00:25:20,976 --> 00:25:22,765
What's wrong?

312
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,499
Here's your phone.

313
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,499
Thank you.

314
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,819
Kaning is calling.

315
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,619
Excuse me.

316
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,619
Hi, what's up?

317
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,619
Are you coming to see me?

318
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,459
See you soon.

319
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,459
Gorya and Ren are coming to see us here.

320
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,459
You can just wait.

321
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,059
That's it?

322
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,859
(I'm at EmQuartier. If you
could come out to meet.)

323
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,109
Having a fight with your boyfriend?

324
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,110
Of course not.

325
00:26:23,326 --> 00:26:25,296
You keep looking at your phone

326
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:27,830
because he doesn't reply to you, huh?

327
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:34,733
You don't have to tell me

328
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:37,311
but you should brace yourself.

329
00:26:37,336 --> 00:26:39,296
When a guy does this,

330
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:41,880
it usually means he's found someone new.

331
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,499
I do it too.

332
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,780
No, Tesla isn't that kind of person.

333
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,819
You said you weren't having a fight.

334
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:56,316
But my boyfriend isn't a player like you.

335
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,499
You've always been naïve.

336
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,260
Tesla!

337
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,897
(Have you been waiting long, honey?)

338
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,219
(Really long. Someone has to be punished.)

339
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:21,975
(What's the matter?)

340
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,819
(I thought I saw someone
who looks familiar but...)

341
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,819
(No, I don't know her. Let's go.)

342
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,499
I'm going to the restroom.

343
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,700
I'll say it again. You're too naïve.

344
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,180
Are you here to taunt me?

345
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,499
No.

346
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,500
I'm here to console you.

347
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,259
What are you doing?

348
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,479
Stop messing around.

349
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,759
Delete the photos now.

350
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,730
- No way.
- Stop messing around.

351
00:29:07,731 --> 00:29:10,690
- No.
- Stop it. Hand over your phone.

352
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,700
This looks more like you.

353
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:26,259
It's boring when you cry.

354
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,259
Some girls cry pretty.

355
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,007
But tears...

356
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,419
are not for someone like you.

357
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,939
Dry your tears and get
back to being a fighter.

358
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,819
Don't you know how to console
people the normal way?

359
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,622
Alright, let's go.

360
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,820
I think Gorya and Ren should be here now.

361
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,699
I mean your thing.

362
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,699
It's not fun if it just ends this way.

363
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,479
It's strange how Kaning would
like to see me out of the blue,

364
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,960
not to mention she's here with Kavin.

365
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,819
I suspect MJ was behind this.

366
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,339
Kaning has to get caught up in this mess.

367
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,310
She already has a lot on her mind.

368
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,149
(This is the bag I want.)

369
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,849
(Wow.)

370
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,219
That's Tesla, Kaning's boyfriend.

371
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,179
(The price is so damn...)

372
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,889
(cheap.)

373
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,120
(It wouldn't bother me at all.)

374
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,440
(But I'm getting tired.)

375
00:30:52,442 --> 00:30:55,419
(Honey, let me go in and
have a look just for a sec.)

376
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,419
(I promise you I have a reward
waiting for you tonight.)

377
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,940
(Doesn't that sound good?)

378
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,180
(Alright, let me take you inside.)

379
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,859
How can he do this?

380
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,979
(I want this one.)

381
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,359
Mr. Kavin, hello.

382
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,900
How many bags would you like today?

383
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,189
Let me have a look around first.

384
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,800
Kavin... That's Kavin from F4.

385
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,739
Do you like that one?

386
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,540
Yes.

387
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,340
Please ring this one up for me.

388
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,339
Of course.

389
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,619
You have great taste.

390
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,499
If you have free time,

391
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,659
please come with me and
help me pick more bags.

392
00:31:49,926 --> 00:31:51,686
Are you insane?

393
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,199
I'm not going to allow that.

394
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,979
- She's not...
- With great pleasure.

395
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,359
This is nuts. You're nuts.

396
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,219
I'm not letting her go.

397
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,199
You should let her make that decision.

398
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,099
She's not an object.

399
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,100
You're asking for it.

400
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:12,100
Want to choose? Fine, you choose.

401
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:16,865
But if you choose him, I'll come after you.

402
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,120
Wow, you think I'm afraid of you?

403
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,459
You get jealous because
of this small thing?

404
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,559
If you don't trust me, we
should just break up now.

405
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,579
A stingy guy with a foul mouth like you?

406
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,420
No one wants that for a boyfriend.

407
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,530
Get out. Get the hell away from me.

408
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:33,876
You're just a gold digger.

409
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,019
What are you looking at?

410
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:44,299
Kaning.

411
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:54,428
A girl who is your girlfriend
must be very lucky.

412
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:58,374
I don't know about that.

413
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:01,188
You have to ask her.

414
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:05,252
Thank you very much for
helping me choose a bag

415
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:06,277
for my girlfriend.

416
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,097
Here you go.

417
00:33:15,122 --> 00:33:17,061
Have you waited long...

418
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,660
sweetheart?

419
00:33:20,597 --> 00:33:22,236
Do you two know each other?

420
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,639
I think he looks familiar
but no, I don't know him.

421
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,840
Let's get out of here.

422
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,539
OK.

423
00:33:44,218 --> 00:33:46,957
All F4 guys are into
low-class women, I see.

424
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:52,801
I knew one. What's the name?

425
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:55,395
Oh, Thyme.

426
00:33:56,742 --> 00:34:02,791
He's into a poor lowly girl,
the kind I nail and bail.

427
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,379
But he's too much into her.

428
00:34:06,457 --> 00:34:12,166
When I mentioned his girl,
he blew up and came at me.

429
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:16,509
Your money can buy
everything, except your taste.

430
00:34:16,978 --> 00:34:19,037
What's wrong with a girl like me?

431
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,716
Good that you're here.

432
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,979
A poor low-life girl like you

433
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,219
goes hand in hand with a violent guy.

434
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:45,107
My boyfriend turned to violence

435
00:34:45,498 --> 00:34:47,917
because of an asshole like you.

436
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,479
So what if I'm poor?

437
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,179
You have no right to look down on me

438
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,339
or look down on Thyme.

439
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,299
You know why?

440
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,459
Being stable in your
relationship like Thyme can

441
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,459
is not something you can do.

442
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:08,350
Someone like Thyme is worth a
lot more than what you said.

443
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,379
Do not say anything to
insult Thyme ever gain.

444
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,419
Got it?

445
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,930
Stop it! What's going on here?

446
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:46,419
Thyme, I know you can hear me.

447
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,299
Think carefully,

448
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,299
Ren has been our friend for over 10 years.

449
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,539
Are you going to let it end just like that?

450
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,980
Thyme, I know you're listening...

451
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,779
Damn you! What the hell is wrong with you?

452
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,779
I've had it up to here.

453
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,779
Don't you care about us at all?

454
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,819
Answer me!

455
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:25,859
Are we worth nothing to you?

456
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,179
Where are you going?

457
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,659
Hey! Where are you going? Tell me.

458
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,209
Ren asked me to meet at the school.

459
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,819
Great. I have a bone to pick with him.

460
00:37:23,737 --> 00:37:26,876
Thyme! Thyme!

461
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,200
Hello, Kavin.

462
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:35,810
Come right away. Something's up.

463
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,500
(Thyme: Why didn't you pick up the phone?)

464
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,839
Thyme, cool it.

465
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,779
We are all friends here.
Don't be a hothead.

466
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,419
Why did you call me here?

467
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,139
I have something I want
to talk to you about.

468
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:24,139
I've been trying to talk to you
but you've been avoiding me.

469
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,139
And now you want to talk?

470
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:31,580
Why? That serious, huh?

471
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,739
Thyme,

472
00:38:44,648 --> 00:38:45,365
I want to talk to you about...

473
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,739
If it's about Gorya, no need.

474
00:38:49,386 --> 00:38:51,565
I no longer have an interest in that girl.

475
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,659
I've been thinking for a while...

476
00:38:55,684 --> 00:38:58,929
being with her is nothing but trouble.

477
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,979
I had to lose a friend. It's not worth it.

478
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,820
Are you serious?

479
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,819
Ren, I am.

480
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:17,475
The part where I kicked you out of F4...

481
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,939
That's history.

482
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,419
You can come back.

483
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,222
Just an ordinary girl.

484
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,217
I don't care.

485
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,419
You can have her.

486
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,299
She's all yours.

487
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:52,539
I'm happy that you're considerate of me.

488
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,899
But you can't just hand her over

489
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,580
when Gorya was never yours.

490
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,539
She was never into you.

491
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,860
Ren!

492
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,819
You've known all along that Gorya likes me.

493
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,819
I asked her today how she felt about me.

494
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:24,814
She insisted that she still felt the same.

495
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,609
She asked me to be her boyfriend.

496
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:30,460
Ren, stop it!

497
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,899
I think she's cute

498
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,519
but to be in a relationship with her...

499
00:40:39,351 --> 00:40:40,901
I don't think so.

500
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,539
I'll just keep leading her on

501
00:40:44,564 --> 00:40:46,333
for my entertainment.

502
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,139
That'd be enough to make her happy.

503
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,209
She just wants a rich guy as her boyfriend.

504
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,072
Shut up!

505
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,539
Why? Gorya is mine.

506
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,639
I can do whatever I want.

507
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
Shut up!

508
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:05,739
Thyme!

509
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,619
This is nothing.

510
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,399
Thyme, cool it down!

511
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,829
Thyme! Thyme!

512
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,379
Mind your own business!

513
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,839
I have to mind your business
because of you guys.

514
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,589
Why are you fighting?

515
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,699
Mind your own business!

516
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,339
You never care about F4 anyway.

517
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,299
How could you say that I never care?

518
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,899
Thyme, you bastard!

519
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,779
Thyme, I'm sorry for getting you all wrong.

520
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,499
I now know that you punched
Kaning's girlfriend because of me.

521
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,939
But I never understood
where you're coming from.

522
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,499
I was wrong for not trusting you.

523
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,419
I'm really sorry, Thyme.

524
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,619
Hello, Tia. Is something wrong?

525
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,020
What? What's that?

526
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,699
Admit it, Thyme.

527
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,299
You're just a kid who's
possessive of his toys.

528
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:20,540
I told you... I've never
thought of Gorya that way.

529
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,779
Get it straight, Ren.

530
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,899
Which way do you think then?

531
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,669
You said you didn't care about her.

532
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,500
But you're just all talk.

533
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,159
Fine, I'm all talk.

534
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,189
So?

535
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,459
I care about her.

536
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,459
Gorya is very important to me.

537
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,619
I love her.

538
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,462
Stop insulting her.

539
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,019
That's all it took for you to admit it.

540
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,182
I lied to you.

541
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,499
Everything I said was a lie.

542
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:35,419
Bastard, what the hell?

543
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,860
If I hadn't done that,

544
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,859
would you have admitted to me

545
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,419
that you're in love with Gorya?

546
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,710
So?

547
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,164
What if I'm in love with her?
What's the point?

548
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,139
The point is Gorya loves you very much.

549
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:08,819
You know,

550
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,819
I went out with her today.

551
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,379
She couldn't stop talking about you.

552
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:23,939
Now that you know,

553
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,539
are you still backing out?

554
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,179
How did it feel

555
00:45:52,631 --> 00:45:55,340
fighting it out with us?

556
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,979
It sucked.

557
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,579
You're on the right track, Thyme.

558
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,259
Don't go back to how you were.

559
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:34,229
But if you choose the wrong path again,

560
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:37,070
I won't back down for
you for the second time.

561
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:40,499
Jerk.

562
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,090
Now it's your turn.

563
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,009
Why didn't you use your head?

564
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:16,459
- Stop!
- What have you done?

565
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:17,820
Wait, wait!

566
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,489
Easy.

567
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,490
You guys too.

568
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:24,139
Gorya!

569
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,219
We've sorted it out. We're all good.

570
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,519
Are you sure?

571
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,062
Yes.

572
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,630
Yes.

573
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,619
Now it's just you two who
haven't sorted it out.

574
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:40,579
Do it now.

575
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:42,859
Sort what out?

576
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:45,859
Your feelings.

577
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,649
You know

578
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,979
how you feel about Thyme.

579
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:57,179
You shouted out loud and proud at
the mall that he's your boyfriend.

580
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,475
My boyfriend turned to violence

581
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:02,179
because of an asshole like you.

582
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:07,579
I was just...

583
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,939
It was a slip of the tongue.

584
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:11,419
- Did you call me your boyfriend?
- No.

585
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,489
Did you call me your boyfriend?

586
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,549
Did you? Did you?

587
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:14,470
You called me your boyfriend, didn't you?

588
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:15,470
Don't try to cover my mouth.

589
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:16,259
Admit it now.

590
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,329
I said 'boyband'.

591
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:19,179
You said boyfriend. It can't be 'boyband'.

592
00:48:19,183 --> 00:48:20,183
You called me...

593
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:21,750
You called me...

594
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,000
You punched me hard.

595
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,259
You started it.

596
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:45,019
Ren, stop being so indie.

597
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:46,990
Let's go.

598
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,619
Anyway, you went extreme today.

599
00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:00,379
How did you come up with this
ploy to mess with Thyme's head?

600
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,739
You can't be silent this time.

601
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,739
Nothing much.

602
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:08,399
I just wanted to...

603
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,819
beat up Thyme.

604
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,060
What for?

605
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,379
I haven't got back at him

606
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,290
for tearing apart my doll.

607
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,140
When we were in kindergarten?

608
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,989
Are you insane?

609
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:28,379
This is so you.

610
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:29,930
Let's get out of here.

611
00:49:29,931 --> 00:49:31,930
Dude.

612
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:34,779
Finally.

613
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,700
Ouch!

614
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:52,099
Sorry.

615
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,700
Did you have fun today?

616
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:02,025
Less trouble than when I went out with you.

617
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:02,819
Hey!

618
00:50:02,856 --> 00:50:04,219
It's true.

619
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,989
I'm sorry.

620
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:19,059
Huh?

621
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:23,579
I know now that you
punched Kaning's boyfriend

622
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,579
to defend my honor.

623
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,579
Sorry for getting you wrong.

624
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,739
Sometimes I thought I had figured you out

625
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,739
when in fact I'd never really
tried to understand you.

626
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:46,779
Before I knew it, things had escalated.

627
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:51,460
You must've been very angry and frustrated.

628
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:54,459
I'm very sorry.

629
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:03,950
- What are you doing? It hurts, Thyme!
- I'm getting back at you.

630
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,180
And stop talking.

631
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:10,939
How can I stay mad at you?

632
00:51:11,893 --> 00:51:14,532
You're the only one I love.

633
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,739
But it's not that surprising.

634
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:36,739
I was a horrible person.

635
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:49,859
Well, get up.

636
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,129
Where are we going?

637
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,739
Just follow me.

638
00:51:53,326 --> 00:51:54,339
Come on.

639
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,419
What's going on?

640
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,220
Just follow me.

641
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,219
Come here.

642
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,859
Where are we going?

643
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:04,723
Here.

644
00:52:19,502 --> 00:52:20,556
What are you doing?

645
00:52:20,581 --> 00:52:21,590
There it is.

646
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,369
You know,

647
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:38,139
all my life, people have been telling me

648
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,139
I'm the heir of the Paramaanantras.

649
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,139
I was born greater

650
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,782
and more special than anyone.

651
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:02,497
In reality, I'd never been confident.

652
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:07,299
I was afraid I'd lose the power.

653
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:10,299
I was afraid I wouldn't be accepted.

654
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,299
The more I feared,

655
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,059
the more I tried to build my power.

656
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:22,259
It's all about proving myself.

657
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,580
I thought if I could rule the school,

658
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,060
I could rule the Parama Group.

659
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:36,177
Honestly, I...

660
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:40,940
I saw people's lives as a fun game

661
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,939
until I met you, Gorya.

662
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,939
You're the only one who's
not afraid to stand up to me.

663
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:59,599
You made me rethink

664
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,320
if what I'd done was the right thing.

665
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,739
When I relive that part,

666
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,739
I hate myself so much.

667
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,340
I hate Thyme who's drunk with power.

668
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:25,739
I hate Thyme who uses only
violence to solve problems.

669
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,659
You know,

670
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:37,180
you make me want to change.

671
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,939
You make me want to prove that

672
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:45,899
I deserve you.

673
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:49,899
I want you to accept me,

674
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,579
not Paramaanantra.

675
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:01,259
I've made a decision,

676
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:03,339
from now on

677
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,180
I will not use violence.

678
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:12,259
No one will ever get a red card from F4.

679
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,190
It's official.

680
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:29,100
Great. I'm happy for you.

681
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,920
From this day on,

682
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,699
no one should have a reason to come here

683
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,260
forever.

684
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,560
(No entree.)

685
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,459
What's that...

686
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,779
This reads 'entrée'.

687
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:11,151
- Give it to me.
- What?

688
00:56:11,154 --> 00:56:12,432
It's 'entry'.

689
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:14,779
Gorya, no. Don't fix it.

690
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,109
What if people wouldn't understand?

691
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,219
They wouldn't understand your entrée.

692
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,139
Do I have to knee you so you'll get it?

693
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:22,379
Give it back.

694
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,100
(Thyme: Are you home, girlfriend?)

695
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:50,210
(I told you it's a slip.
I'm not your girlfriend.)

696
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:51,880
(Whatever... I count it this time.)

697
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,459
Sorry for not telling you
that I'd be home late.

698
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,519
What are you doing here?

699
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,897
I'm just worried about Gorya.

700
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,480
She hasn't been around much lately.

701
00:57:29,889 --> 00:57:31,019
I found out about everything.

702
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,889
How could you do this to Gorya's family?

703
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,450
I just went to negotiate.

704
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,390
I think your family is in trouble.

705
00:57:39,682 --> 00:57:41,531
Do I have to be all dressed up?

706
00:57:42,273 --> 00:57:45,043
If it's beyond your
reach, you leave it alone.
