1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,810
If you really like her, face it.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,830
Thank you.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,880
Because of you, I've gathered
my strength to fight.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,499
If you don't choose me,

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,499
I'll destroy Gorya's life right now.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,290
Let me go!

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,700
No one will ever have any
problems with my girlfriend.

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,890
Huh?

9
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:24,930
I've been gone a while.

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,290
The school is as chaotic as before.

11
00:00:33,227 --> 00:00:34,891
I trust everything's in order.

12
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,633
My pleasure to work with
you on this project.

13
00:00:36,657 --> 00:00:37,562
Likewise.

14
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:38,961
Keep in touch.

15
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:56,859
It's has been extremely
busy at work lately.

16
00:00:56,884 --> 00:00:58,013
Yes.

17
00:01:00,772 --> 00:01:02,980
How is the trouble at the school going?

18
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:05,934
I checked. It's not
Thyme's doing this time.

19
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:09,322
The kid who did it sorted it out.

20
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:14,236
But Thyme took care of the damages
and handled everything himself.

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,250
Really?

22
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:24,859
By the way... do you know
anything about this girl?

23
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:37,379
Not at all.

24
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,939
She might be one of the collaterals?

25
00:01:43,928 --> 00:01:49,099
She happens to be a collateral
in too many incidents.

26
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:57,139
Are you flying back to Thailand tonight?

27
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,749
Take care of it.

28
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,659
Make sure everything is put
back in its rightful place.

29
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:08,299
Don't disappoint me.

30
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,412
You know well

31
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,229
that I hate changes,

32
00:02:17,127 --> 00:02:19,357
any kind of changes.

33
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:33,339
Tulip symbolizes first
love that is so romantic,

34
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,819
which fits well with the
current mental state of Gorya

35
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,939
that is full of confusion

36
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,333
now that the man of her
dreams has returned.

37
00:03:43,334 --> 00:03:44,334
Bite me.

38
00:03:45,644 --> 00:03:48,219
No! This is for sale.

39
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,219
What's the matter, Gorya?

40
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,200
Ren has been back for over a week.

41
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:54,060
Are you still hung up on him?

42
00:03:54,062 --> 00:03:58,899
It's not that. I just feel a bit uneasy.

43
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,939
He... really has changed.

44
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,379
So?

45
00:04:08,742 --> 00:04:12,309
Ren, why didn't you tell
us you're coming back?

46
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:14,349
He never does.

47
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,439
He didn't tell us when he left.

48
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,099
He didn't tell us when he's back.

49
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:20,179
Missed you, dude.

50
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:27,330
Was I away for that long?

51
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:33,689
Hold on.

52
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,070
I haven't told you.

53
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:37,232
Gorya and I have agreed to go steady.

54
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:38,520
Wait, when did I agree...

55
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,179
Really?

56
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:44,539
I'm happy for you.

57
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:49,889
Now that Ren's back,

58
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,179
this calls for a celebration.

59
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,289
F4 reunion?

60
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,208
Yeah.

61
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:55,287
Let's go.

62
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:58,339
Are you coming?

63
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,032
Ren, this is exclusive to F4.

64
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:02,259
Girlfriends are not allowed.

65
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,857
Hey!

66
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:04,611
Bye!

67
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:20,139
I don't know. He's not the same.

68
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:23,499
Have you talked or done anything with him?

69
00:05:24,414 --> 00:05:27,810
I haven't seen him. He's always with F4.

70
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,259
There it is. You can try to approach him.

71
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,125
If you feel weird, find
something to talk to him about

72
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,779
or give him something.

73
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:43,010
Right, I haven't given
back his handkerchief.

74
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,619
That thing? Hasn't it crumbled into pieces?

75
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,619
Use that handkerchief.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,380
Give it back and find a moment to talk.

77
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,851
There's no point in you
getting stuck in your head.

78
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,379
You haven't even talked to him.
How can you know

79
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,979
if he's the same or different?

80
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,699
He may not have changed a bit.

81
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:07,207
You're right.

82
00:06:12,385 --> 00:06:14,824
I'm with my F4 gang today.

83
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:15,600
(He's enjoying himself the most.)

84
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,625
Hey, Ren!

85
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,930
Man, you dog.

86
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,279
Heck! Take a look!

87
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,054
Mmm? Geez.

88
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,810
Take a screenshot!

89
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,190
Zoom it in!

90
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:33,375
What's wrong with your phone?

91
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,919
It's broken again!

92
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,929
Charger! Let's find a charger!

93
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,810
Where is it?

94
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,210
My girls... total chaos.

95
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,050
Let me borrow yours.

96
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:52,059
As Kocher High School was founded in 1986,

97
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,979
our school has created a large number
of valuable members of society.

98
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,905
Today, I want to see all you here focus...

99
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,250
Announcement. Miss Thitara Jundee.

100
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,170
Miss Thitara Jundee,

101
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,903
come meet me at the back
of the meeting hall. Now.

102
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:14,939
It's you. Can't you remember your name?

103
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:17,299
What are you looking at? Get up now.

104
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:19,369
Can't you see the teacher is waiting?

105
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,419
Come on.

106
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:23,389
I told you it's important and most urgent.

107
00:07:23,397 --> 00:07:25,699
You know how many missed
calls I got from you?

108
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,289
Here.

109
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,599
Look.

110
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,839
Here, see?

111
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,930
(Gorya - 83 missed calls)

112
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,009
See how many missed calls.

113
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,849
Look. Take a look.

114
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,269
What do you want from me?

115
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,253
My phone is broken.

116
00:07:40,254 --> 00:07:43,019
Yeah, I figured as much.

117
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,979
Here, I got this for you.

118
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,530
What is this?

119
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:47,508
Don't you know?

120
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,299
It's a cellphone. Take it.

121
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:51,429
I know what it is.

122
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,539
Why would you give it to me?
I don't want it.

123
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:55,040
Why are you being difficult?

124
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,486
Do you know how frustrating it is
when I can't get a hold of you?

125
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,254
And wasn't it partly my fault
that your phone is broken?

126
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,179
No, it's not.

127
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:02,932
Will you take it or not?

128
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,790
No.

129
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,574
No?

130
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,939
In that case, I'll leave it here.

131
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,419
Finders Keepers.

132
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:12,789
There's a phone here. Come and get it.

133
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,859
Fine. Are you happy?

134
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,801
Great.

135
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:21,851
Now I can contact you this
Saturday for our date.

136
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:23,823
What date?

137
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:26,369
Our date. You and me.

138
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,166
We're going on an F4 kind of date.

139
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:30,613
An F4 kind of date?

140
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:32,369
I don't want to know what it's like.

141
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,849
And I don't want to go.

142
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,160
But I want to make it up to you.

143
00:08:35,185 --> 00:08:36,279
Make sure your phone is on.

144
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,320
I'll tell you the time and place.

145
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:39,400
See you.

146
00:08:39,425 --> 00:08:41,159
But I haven't said that I'll go.

147
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,409
You haven't said you won't come either.

148
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,360
I will not...

149
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:46,329
I can't hear. Hello, Kavin. What's up?

150
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,379
Ren wants to go out again?

151
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,800
What's going on with him
since he got back from France?

152
00:08:53,263 --> 00:08:54,869
Well, he wants to go, huh?

153
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,754
OK. OK.

154
00:09:24,472 --> 00:09:27,019
You still hide out here like before?

155
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:40,219
I thought you wouldn't come here anymore.

156
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:43,709
Why?

157
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,699
I don't know. You seem different.

158
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,201
Don't you draw anymore?

159
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,579
I lost my sketchbook.

160
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,059
How has dating Thyme been treating you?

161
00:10:14,435 --> 00:10:17,240
I'm not dating Thyme.

162
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,651
We're not a couple.

163
00:10:18,653 --> 00:10:20,219
Thyme just assumes things.

164
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:23,299
You don't need to be so jumpy.

165
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,099
Even if you're dating him,
we can still be friends.

166
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,099
That's right.

167
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,700
Or do you want to be more than friends?

168
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,179
We can date behind his back.

169
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:50,850
Thyme doesn't need to know.

170
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,777
That's all.

171
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,709
I'm kidding.

172
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,779
You're easily shocked.

173
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,259
Did you take it seriously?

174
00:11:12,262 --> 00:11:15,179
Umm... I just wanted to
return your handkerchief.

175
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:20,929
I forgot that you had it.

176
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,099
I should go.

177
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,579
Something...

178
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,579
you realize how important it
is only when you get it back.

179
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,499
I didn't come back too late, did I?

180
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,860
(Maytee O Garden)

181
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:58,259
I can't take it anymore!

182
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,259
What's wrong with him?

183
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,259
He seduced you hard.

184
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:06,690
As old as I am, I couldn't help but...
be infatuated.

185
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:10,243
True. But I think I'm
jealous of my friend here.

186
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:12,373
She has admirers left and right.

187
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,995
One is her first crush who
makes her heart flutter.

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,339
The other is a maniac that annoys her.

189
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,919
Who annoys her?

190
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,160
Don't tell me it's Thyme.

191
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:24,294
I thought you said he'd
stopped bullying you.

192
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,819
I thought things were better.

193
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,819
Things are messier, uncle.

194
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:30,210
Don't just take my word for it.

195
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,250
(Thyme is happy.)

196
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,090
(Thyme is mad.)

197
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,570
(Reply now.)

198
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,520
It's kind of cute.

199
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,579
He has his stickers.

200
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:48,653
Let's come back to you.

201
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:50,059
What are you going to do?

202
00:12:50,223 --> 00:12:51,740
Just say no?

203
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:56,259
I wanted to say no. But I could imagine
a world of headaches that follows.

204
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,289
If I say no, there'll be
more trouble from him.

205
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,579
True.

206
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:04,563
You should just go out
and get it over with.

207
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:07,139
I'm going to the zoo with
Tesla this Saturday anyway.

208
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:09,019
Tesla your boyfriend?

209
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,222
Yes.

210
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,849
If you don't have any idea where to go,

211
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,699
you can invite Thyme to come with us.

212
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:15,699
A double date like the movie.

213
00:13:17,974 --> 00:13:19,699
I actually want to go.

214
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,560
The problem isn't me though.

215
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,579
What?

216
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:26,169
No way!

217
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,289
Do you want me to hang out
with your friend, Gorya?

218
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,559
And the zoo? Please. It's so childish.

219
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,688
Do you want me to be a 'first' wheel?

220
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,259
I'm not going to correct that.

221
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,769
Whatever. I'm not going.

222
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,619
Fine, if you don't want to, don't come.
I'm hanging up.

223
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:44,219
See? I knew it. It's over.

224
00:13:45,362 --> 00:13:47,117
Can't you just be civil to each other?

225
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,619
Look at this, uncle. Look.

226
00:13:54,454 --> 00:13:56,915
It's not over.

227
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,819
Answer it. Talk to him properly.

228
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,409
You can squeeze it while talking.

229
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,659
It may help relieve the pressure.

230
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,769
Are you not going to make it up to me?

231
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,769
Do I have to do everything you want?

232
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,699
I should be asking you that question.

233
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,659
Isn't it you who want to go to the zoo?

234
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,419
That's right.

235
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:23,299
What do you want? Tell me.

236
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,939
How about you ask me nicely?

237
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,499
Try this.

238
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,401
"P'Thyme, you're the coolest kha."

239
00:14:35,247 --> 00:14:36,484
Why do I have to say that?

240
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:38,499
"P'Thyme, you're the coolest kha."

241
00:14:43,094 --> 00:14:46,739
P'Thyme, you're the coolest kha.

242
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,170
"Would you please go on a
date with me Nong Gorya kha?"

243
00:14:57,072 --> 00:15:02,850
Would you please go on a
date with me Nong Gorya kha?

244
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:05,659
And then...

245
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,139
Meow, meow.

246
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:13,703
I'll meow your ass.

247
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,139
If you don't do it, I won't go.

248
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,690
Come on. You're almost there.

249
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,939
Meow, meow.

250
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:40,911
This is legendary.

251
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:42,210
Agree.

252
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,720
Twirl for me.

253
00:15:45,724 --> 00:15:47,279
You're going too far.

254
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,379
Just two times. Come on.

255
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,739
Actually, I haven't been
to the zoo in a long time.

256
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,659
If you don't want to go, I can go instead.

257
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:03,217
You don't need to do that.

258
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:05,730
I show you mercy and
you get off easy today.

259
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:08,819
Recognize that, Gorya. Hanging up now.

260
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,529
Argh! I can't stand it any longer!

261
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,229
What's wrong with him?

262
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,230
Does he earn a baht every time he gets
his way and that's why he's so rich?

263
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:35,819
Calm down, meow, meow.

264
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,370
Kaning, don't tease me.

265
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,210
Geez, can it get any crazier?

266
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,641
Hello.

267
00:16:46,642 --> 00:16:48,139
Welcome.

268
00:16:58,149 --> 00:16:59,769
A date with Thyme?

269
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,145
A double date?

270
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,810
It's going to be crazy.

271
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:06,185
I'm really worried.

272
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:10,219
Aww... it's going to be fine.

273
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:13,050
Seeing that you're fine enough

274
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:15,099
to be worried about this kind of thing

275
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,099
is quite a relief.

276
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,419
You seem a bit odd, Tia.

277
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,419
Something on your mind?

278
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:26,850
It's nothing.

279
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,099
I'm just worried about you.

280
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,499
If there's something that
makes you feel uncomfortable,

281
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,099
you can tell me.

282
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,450
OK?

283
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:41,099
Lately, there's Thyme.

284
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:43,650
And...

285
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,650
There's Ren.

286
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,099
He seems strange

287
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:57,099
like a different person.

288
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,099
That's normal, Gorya.

289
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:06,099
Anyone can change.

290
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:08,099
Look at Thyme.

291
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:10,099
From that day to today,

292
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,099
he's changed quite a lot.

293
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,570
Listen.

294
00:18:22,754 --> 00:18:25,457
Being something you've never been before,

295
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:28,099
doing something you've never done before,

296
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,099
it's not easy.

297
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,604
It's not something that just happens.

298
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:38,099
There must be something important
that affects you and changes you.

299
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:40,099
And I think

300
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,099
the most powerful thing

301
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:45,099
is love.

302
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,099
I'm always here for you.

303
00:18:50,294 --> 00:18:51,479
Don't forget.

304
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,690
If there's any trouble,
let me know right away.

305
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:56,099
Sure thing.

306
00:18:56,105 --> 00:18:59,939
If Thyme wreaks havoc, I'll tell on him.

307
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,890
Sure.

308
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,604
I'll give him what he deserves.

309
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,099
I just want to squeeze you.

310
00:19:11,511 --> 00:19:13,299
You can stop right here.

311
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,800
I can get home easily from here.

312
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,939
Thank you for the ride.

313
00:19:17,143 --> 00:19:18,939
- See you, Gorya.
- See you.

314
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,210
(Kaning: See you at the entrance
of Safari World at 1 p.m.)

315
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,570
(And I think)

316
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:48,219
(the most powerful thing)

317
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,754
(is love.)

318
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:11,970
You're here again.

319
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:26,299
Ren, let me ask you honestly.

320
00:20:28,506 --> 00:20:30,299
How was your trip to France?

321
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,779
France was like in the postcard.

322
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:36,779
What you imagined in your head,

323
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,779
that's exactly what it's like.

324
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,779
No.

325
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,299
I meant what happened with Mira.

326
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,300
I just wanted to know.

327
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:48,450
Oh.

328
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,370
Are you worried about me?

329
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,770
No need.

330
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,779
Mira was so happy when she saw me.

331
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,779
Thank you

332
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,779
for telling me not to avert
my eyes from the problem.

333
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:27,019
When I took a close look, it
turned out to be very good.

334
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,859
Really?

335
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:45,419
Really.

336
00:21:47,103 --> 00:21:49,579
Let's talk about you now.

337
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:52,769
How has it been?

338
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,690
Same old.

339
00:21:55,612 --> 00:21:57,097
Nothing to tell.

340
00:21:57,122 --> 00:21:58,739
My life is boring.

341
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,739
That's not true at all.

342
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,819
Your life is colorful.

343
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:18,179
But I believe you about it being the same.

344
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:36,459
Are you the same in all aspects?

345
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,059
Because I'm not.

346
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,410
My bus is here.

347
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,539
I have to go.

348
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:31,259
What's going on with him?

349
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,259
Who are you stressing out about?

350
00:23:34,922 --> 00:23:36,819
You have to ask? It's P'...

351
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:39,459
Which P' are you talking about?

352
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,900
Why didn't you pick up when I called?
Where's your cellphone?

353
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,919
I must've forgotten it at the flower shop.

354
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,859
You look suspicious.

355
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,179
It's true. After the flower
shop, I came straight home.

356
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,554
I didn't make a stop
anywhere or see anyone.

357
00:24:03,152 --> 00:24:06,321
Fine. It's just a cellphone.

358
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:08,699
What about tomorrow? When and
where do you want to meet?

359
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,540
Do I pick you up?

360
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:13,466
No need. Let's meet in front
of the zoo at the entrance.

361
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,398
1:00 p.m.

362
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,639
If you're there and it's raining,
find a place to take cover.

363
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,869
Wisecrack, huh?

364
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,049
If you're late, I'll make you pay.

365
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,899
Be on time.

366
00:24:24,948 --> 00:24:25,948
Hanging up.

367
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,802
Wait a sec.

368
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,837
Where did you get this from?

369
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,969
Thyme got it for me.

370
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,410
Huh?

371
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,819
You know it's not right.

372
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,250
Sis, don't just yell at me.

373
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,859
Dear, should we take this a dowry?

374
00:24:58,647 --> 00:25:00,930
How can he be so insane?

375
00:25:04,758 --> 00:25:07,650
It's going to be a long
exhausting day tomorrow.

376
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,059
Ren! Ren! Ren! Ren!

377
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,099
Ren. I need a favor.

378
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,369
What is it?

379
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:59,360
It's not a big deal or anything.
I just wanted to know...

380
00:25:59,364 --> 00:26:01,539
how an ordinary person
dresses when going to the zoo.

381
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,470
And I...

382
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,650
want your opinion.

383
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,579
Come on.

384
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:12,619
How about this? Is it OK?

385
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,971
Don't you think it's going to be too warm?

386
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,330
Warm?

387
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,019
True.

388
00:26:19,325 --> 00:26:20,610
Not too warm.

389
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,584
This is not going to be too warm.
Very thin.

390
00:26:23,585 --> 00:26:25,890
That's too thin.

391
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,539
Here, wearing a tiger to see a tiger.

392
00:26:30,948 --> 00:26:32,448
Here.

393
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:33,450
No?

394
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:35,306
This one.

395
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,657
You're going to the zoo, Thyme.

396
00:26:38,282 --> 00:26:40,534
The zoo. The zoo.

397
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,690
Jiw, give me the binoculars.

398
00:26:42,715 --> 00:26:43,960
This is it.

399
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:46,959
I went on safari in Africa in this getup.

400
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,579
Look. Here we go.

401
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:56,191
Are you laughing? Are you laughing at me?

402
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,613
What's wrong with my outfit?
I'm serious about this.

403
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,330
Why aren't you serious with me?
Why are you laughing?

404
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:06,179
I'm laughing because
you're taking it seriously.

405
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,813
Speaking of which,

406
00:27:16,814 --> 00:27:19,859
since you've been back, you hardly laugh.

407
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,521
I asked you about what happened
there, but you wouldn't say anything.

408
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,937
You seem confused. Are you OK?

409
00:27:37,694 --> 00:27:40,103
Let me choose a shirt for you.

410
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,619
Oh yeah, I was going to ask
you to give it back to Gorya.

411
00:28:03,383 --> 00:28:05,617
She dropped it when she met me.

412
00:28:33,394 --> 00:28:36,979
Sis, are you going on a date or to war?

413
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:40,979
I don't know what mess Thyme will make.

414
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,288
I'm afraid.

415
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,909
Are you afraid that Thyme will be trouble

416
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,459
or that you won't be beautiful?

417
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,779
Don't tease me.

418
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:53,819
Sis, on a day like this,
you don't need to do much.

419
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:56,155
Be your natural self.

420
00:28:56,586 --> 00:28:58,979
Nothing is better than that.

421
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,579
Wow, wise words coming from you.

422
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,660
No, I got it from an ad.

423
00:29:09,188 --> 00:29:11,059
Take a shower already.

424
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,459
I got it for you in case you
want to add more confidence.

425
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,389
What am I not confident about?

426
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,989
Everything.

427
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,539
Be confident. Don't think too much.

428
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,299
When you're confident,
things will work out for you.

429
00:29:28,072 --> 00:29:29,939
Don't forget to use it.

430
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:35,970
Dress in a way that you feel confident.

431
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:58,429
What are you frustrated about?
I didn't come late.

432
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,859
I'm not frustrated.

433
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,859
Are you sure?

434
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,299
Why do you look like that?

435
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,159
Your... outfit is cute.

436
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,410
What? The birds are loud.

437
00:30:26,028 --> 00:30:27,769
- Your outfit is cute.
- What?

438
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,619
Why do you keep asking me that?

439
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,269
I wasn't frustrated at
first but I'm getting there.

440
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,802
Fine, I won't ask you anymore.

441
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,699
Please don't get upset today.

442
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,589
If not for me, do it for Kaning.

443
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,650
I love Kaning as much as my family.

444
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,179
Don't you think I have a calm 'demoner'?

445
00:30:48,108 --> 00:30:49,750
Demeanor!

446
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,549
Your boyfriend is funny.

447
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,899
Are you doing word jokes?

448
00:30:58,905 --> 00:31:02,380
Like... oops wrong word.
No, that's correct.

449
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,779
Hello, Thyme. I'm Kaning.

450
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:07,619
This is Tesla, my boyfriend.

451
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,650
Tesla, this is Thyme and Gorya.

452
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,509
Bro, you can be chill with me.

453
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,299
OK, let's go inside.

454
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,299
It's now a 'suspicious' time.

455
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:33,480
Auspicious. Get it?

456
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:36,539
Why didn't you correct me?

457
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,539
Let's go in.

458
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,859
- Gorya.
- Hmm?

459
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:48,859
Let's go inside.

460
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,579
It's going to be a disaster.

461
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,020
Hey!

462
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:09,899
No.

463
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:16,769
Gorya, look at this. Look at this.

464
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,680
Looks good.

465
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:18,689
Very good.

466
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,690
Yes.

467
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:27,619
- Boo!
- Argh!

468
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:49,059
This is the first time in my life, I see
someone eating ice cream with such anger.

469
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,555
What should we do, Gorya?

470
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,779
Thyme, look at this. Isn't it cute?

471
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,303
What kind of animal is this?

472
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,103
Who knows? Do you want it?

473
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,910
No, it's expensive.

474
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:06,040
I'll take one. Do you accept a credit card?

475
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:11,490
Shit! You're a sugar daddy.

476
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,489
I heard you're loaded.

477
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,289
How rich are you?

478
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,289
How about buying the whole booth?

479
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,285
No, why don't you buy the entire zoo?

480
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,200
Smartass.

481
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,328
The dolphin show is showing soon.

482
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,169
Let's split and we can meet up back here.

483
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,380
Let's do that. See you later.

484
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,099
Let's go, Tesla.

485
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:51,705
Tesla! Look at him. Look.

486
00:33:51,924 --> 00:33:54,329
He's a smartass, right? 'Yes.' Right?

487
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,634
He is, right? 'Yes.' Right?

488
00:33:56,635 --> 00:33:58,849
My ice cream is now melting on the floor.

489
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:02,215
Damn it! Look how much of
a smartass he is. I can't.

490
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,400
Gorya, look. He said that guy
is a smartass. Can't you see?

491
00:34:05,425 --> 00:34:07,609
- Thyme.
- Do you have another one?

492
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,979
I'll buy all.

493
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,287
I'll hit his face with this.

494
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,859
Should I hit him? "Yes, you should."

495
00:34:20,914 --> 00:34:22,200
Hey,

496
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,159
I'm sorry.

497
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,619
I didn't know that Kaning's
boyfriend would be like this.

498
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,169
You guys should learn
how to pick a good guy.

499
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,619
Like me. Can't you find
another one like me?

500
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,619
Sure.

501
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,619
How's today going so far?

502
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,339
Not including Tesla, it's going well.

503
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:50,850
I've never been out like this.

504
00:34:54,314 --> 00:34:56,659
You've been great today.

505
00:34:56,851 --> 00:34:58,530
You've been patient all day.

506
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,299
Thank you.

507
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,299
No need to thank me.

508
00:35:07,602 --> 00:35:10,299
I just want to be a good boyfriend.

509
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,099
Thyme, let me set the record straight.

510
00:35:20,637 --> 00:35:23,739
I didn't say yes to being
your girlfriend that day.

511
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:26,219
We're not a couple.

512
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,808
I know.

513
00:35:32,185 --> 00:35:36,450
I know that we're not a couple.
You haven't said yes.

514
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,509
And I know what you're
going to say today if I ask.

515
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:46,454
But I do it hoping I might
soften your heart a bit.

516
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,059
So...

517
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,059
When I am confident, I will ask you.

518
00:35:56,211 --> 00:35:57,819
Don't hurry to give your answer.

519
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,859
You do what you want again.

520
00:36:01,362 --> 00:36:02,699
What else can I do?

521
00:36:02,835 --> 00:36:04,699
I can only...

522
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,259
wait until you feel the same as I do.

523
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,859
You can be as strong-willed as you want.

524
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,339
I'll wait anyway.

525
00:36:19,432 --> 00:36:21,819
You know that?

526
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,352
That's all it takes to make you blush.

527
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:30,699
You pinch my cheek so it turns red.

528
00:36:33,037 --> 00:36:35,059
Let's take a picture.

529
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,355
My outfit works.

530
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,489
You said like you have hundreds of them.

531
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:53,859
More like thousands.

532
00:36:54,217 --> 00:36:57,189
It's good that I had Ren to help me choose.

533
00:36:57,214 --> 00:36:59,303
I wouldn't make it otherwise.

534
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,330
(Are you the same in all aspects?)

535
00:37:05,538 --> 00:37:08,368
Gorya, your phone.

536
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,798
About that...

537
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:15,899
Thinking about it more carefully,
I must've left it on the bus.

538
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:25,161
Really?

539
00:37:25,165 --> 00:37:31,549
The last time I used it, I was
talking to you at the shop.

540
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,579
Then, I took the bus home.

541
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,819
Didn't you make a stop to see someone?

542
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,259
No.

543
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:46,841
Don't buy another one for me.

544
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,802
I don't want to trouble you.

545
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,979
I'm going to the restroom.

546
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:27,219
Kaning's not my type. So bland.

547
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,730
Yeah.

548
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,672
I just wanted to switch for a change.
She seemed so gullible.

549
00:38:33,675 --> 00:38:36,419
But Kaning's friend... what's her name?

550
00:38:37,072 --> 00:38:40,419
Gorya or something. She's really cute.

551
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,996
If I'd met her first,
I would've gone for her.

552
00:38:43,997 --> 00:38:46,619
No Kaning for me. Thank you.

553
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,004
That's right.

554
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,339
I have to go.

555
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,339
What's with the face, boy?

556
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,894
You're not that into her, are you?

557
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:08,619
I bet you're like me. Nail and bail.

558
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,050
Hey.

559
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:15,032
This Gorya... can I do her next?

560
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,259
What did you say?

561
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:25,929
What did you say?

562
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,079
What did you just say?

563
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,099
Thyme!

564
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,549
How could you say that?

565
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,229
How could you say that about Gorya?

566
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,977
Thyme, stop! What's wrong?

567
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:38,989
Gorya, let's go.

568
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,179
Are you alright?

569
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:46,659
Thyme, wait.

570
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,040
Let go of me.

571
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,419
Thyme, let's talk it out first.

572
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,441
Why did you do that?

573
00:39:54,442 --> 00:39:57,059
I can't stand that guy and his foul mouth.

574
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,490
Tesla is just a guy who talks crap.

575
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,219
Couldn't you be a bit more patient?

576
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:05,219
Patient? Wasn't I patient
enough today, Gorya?

577
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,204
Do you know what he said about you?

578
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,259
Whatever he said didn't give
you the right to punch him.

579
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,699
You can't use violence
to solve every problem.

580
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:18,619
That punch was mercy. I could've
stomped him to the ground.

581
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,619
I used to think

582
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,739
that you're becoming a better person.

583
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:33,179
But it's a false hope.

584
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:38,251
You know why? Because
you're still the same.

585
00:40:40,191 --> 00:40:42,579
And I hate this kind of person.

586
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:32,610
(If it's important, you
should hold on to it.)

587
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,819
You broke up?

588
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,770
It's not your fault, Kaning.

589
00:41:41,056 --> 00:41:43,019
Tesla may have been upset.

590
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,007
This and that.

591
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,103
I don't know.

592
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,908
He may have wanted to break
up with me for a while.

593
00:41:51,322 --> 00:41:54,579
But if it's because of Thyme,
you can't blame yourself.

594
00:41:54,898 --> 00:41:57,505
How can I not?

595
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:01,539
I'm OK really. I'll get better soon.

596
00:42:03,278 --> 00:42:05,619
You also have to sort things out, OK?

597
00:42:07,711 --> 00:42:09,619
I have to go.

598
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,706
Talk later.

599
00:42:19,195 --> 00:42:21,099
Thanks.

600
00:42:24,177 --> 00:42:25,619
Hey,

601
00:42:26,897 --> 00:42:29,202
is Thyme that bad?

602
00:42:47,525 --> 00:42:48,859
Ouch!

603
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,890
Damn it!

604
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,659
Stop being upset over this, Thyme.

605
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,694
Shit!

606
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,219
Argh!

607
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:27,499
Take it easy. Here you go.

608
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,419
When are you going to
clear the air with Gorya?

609
00:43:40,352 --> 00:43:42,253
Gorya is something.

610
00:43:42,257 --> 00:43:44,419
Does she think she's the
only one who can get mad?

611
00:43:44,908 --> 00:43:47,259
She wouldn't listen
when I tried to explain.

612
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,259
She never sees me as a good person anyway.

613
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:54,410
I'd rather go back to the way I was.

614
00:44:04,628 --> 00:44:06,419
Shit!

615
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,025
What's this for?

616
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,849
You couldn't cool down.

617
00:44:15,874 --> 00:44:17,699
So we had to snap you out of it.

618
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,699
Be the same old you.

619
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,759
And make it up to Gorya.

620
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,939
Gorya has to make it up to me.

621
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,699
Professor, please teach him a lesson.

622
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:34,454
You know how you were back then.

623
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:38,001
It's not that surprising for
Gorya to misunderstand you.

624
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:41,979
But it doesn't matter who's
right or wrong anyway.

625
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:45,219
What really matters is
whether you love her.

626
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:50,059
When you love someone, you're
willing to approach them

627
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,059
no matter how angry or frustrated you are.

628
00:44:53,637 --> 00:44:55,059
Got it?

629
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:02,509
Certain things need to be talked through.

630
00:45:16,725 --> 00:45:18,720
If you don't,

631
00:45:18,745 --> 00:45:21,502
you'll never know what
the other person thinks.

632
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,099
Sometimes silence doesn't help.

633
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,579
You may not understand each other.

634
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,909
It doesn't mean you don't love each other.

635
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,419
Clear it up before it's too late.

636
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:37,179
Trust us on this.

637
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,139
You're good at saying something cool.

638
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,293
Of course.

639
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:48,179
So if she calls, you
should make it up to her.

640
00:45:50,491 --> 00:45:52,362
Thyme, is that Gorya?

641
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:54,099
- Gorya?
- Yeah.

642
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:03,355
Hi, honey. Where are you?

643
00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:04,455
You want to play?

644
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,562
Hello, Thyme.

645
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,450
(You guys are the worst!)

646
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,690
(Gorya, please be patient with Thyme.)

647
00:47:39,614 --> 00:47:46,530
Rumor has it that he bought
an apartment in Paris.

648
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:52,539
This is certainly something to
congratulate and be jealous of.

649
00:48:04,296 --> 00:48:06,419
Hey, you! You!

650
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:11,379
Don't you remember what I told you?

651
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,579
Be nice and win her back.

652
00:48:16,762 --> 00:48:19,579
Fine, I'll be back.

653
00:48:22,832 --> 00:48:26,545
How did we end up being
matchmakers for these two?

654
00:48:26,546 --> 00:48:28,305
I wonder.

655
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:35,719
News about the latest relationship
of the hottest actor Dominique Shun.

656
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,709
A paparazzi leaked some photos

657
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:41,070
saying that they've known
each other for over a year.

658
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,689
People speculate that they fell in love

659
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:47,730
when Dominique joined an immigration
campaign earlier this year.

660
00:48:55,561 --> 00:48:59,539
The Thai girl in focus is an ex-celeb

661
00:48:59,564 --> 00:49:03,345
Mira - Renita Asavarattanakul.

662
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:06,220
Oh no, Ren must have found out a while ago.

663
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,508
(Rumor has it that he bought
an apartment in Paris.)

664
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:10,370
Ren's phone is turned off.

665
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,179
So?

666
00:49:39,405 --> 00:49:41,179
You heard?

667
00:49:46,411 --> 00:49:49,059
You've known about it
for a while, haven't you?

668
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:52,619
I'm sorry.

669
00:49:53,644 --> 00:49:56,139
I shouldn't have urged you to follow Mira.

670
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:03,139
Being brave enough to face
the fact like you said

671
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:07,139
is surely better.

672
00:50:07,718 --> 00:50:09,939
But you got rejected.

673
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,500
No.

674
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:15,859
It's the opposite.

675
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,357
Because of you,

676
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:24,859
I learned how Mira truly felt.

677
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:39,549
We talked.

678
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,459
We opened our hearts.

679
00:50:41,768 --> 00:50:43,899
We spent time together.

680
00:50:46,014 --> 00:50:49,019
It's the best time of my life.

681
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,059
So what happened?

682
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,819
Love alone is not enough.

683
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,279
It showed me

684
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,219
how Mira and I were so different.

685
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:33,499
It started from a small feeling

686
00:51:34,351 --> 00:51:37,419
that I couldn't support her in any way.

687
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,899
And that feeling grew bigger.

688
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,979
It's strange...

689
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:53,499
we were so close.

690
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:00,819
Before I knew it,

691
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:07,779
I felt that she was drifting away.

692
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,859
Further and further.

693
00:52:24,927 --> 00:52:32,899
And one day I realized
that my world and her world

694
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:39,179
were certainly different.

695
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,819
It's true what they say.

696
00:52:53,312 --> 00:52:55,819
No matter how much you love someone,

697
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,459
it doesn't mean you belong together.

698
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:16,419
So I decided to walk out of her life.

699
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21,419
Truth hurts so much.

700
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,862
But it's good for her.

701
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,306
See?

702
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,339
She met someone better than me.

703
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:34,339
Don't say that.

704
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,819
It may be a misunderstanding.

705
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,619
No.

706
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:42,819
I'm not fooling myself this time.

707
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:59,040
(I wish you find new love
that's better than me.)

708
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:05,299
This is the truth.

709
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,339
But it's good.

710
00:54:22,754 --> 00:54:25,219
A worthless guy like me

711
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:30,219
will only hold Mira back.

712
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:32,668
Right?

713
00:54:32,671 --> 00:54:35,899
Don't say that you're worthless.

714
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,539
How can you be worthless?

715
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,979
Don't you remember that day?

716
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:50,610
If you hadn't been there,

717
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,859
who knows what would've happened to me?

718
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:10,859
Don't think you're worthless

719
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,859
just because she doesn't love you.

720
00:55:18,951 --> 00:55:23,259
I know that what I'm about to say

721
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:28,259
may not matter to you.

722
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:37,202
But you're precious to me.

723
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:40,005
If it weren't for you,

724
00:55:40,979 --> 00:55:43,819
I wouldn't be here.

725
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:51,445
You are never worthless,

726
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:54,219
at least that's how I feel.

727
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:58,419
Since the first day we met,

728
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:02,419
you've been an important person to me.

729
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:21,090
You're supposed to console
me but you're crying harder.

730
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,139
Let's just stay like this for a while.

731
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,219
The car is ready with your suitcase in it.

732
00:57:06,894 --> 00:57:11,419
You seem to particularly
like tulips lately.

733
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:16,099
It means 'you never forget
your first love', right?

734
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:20,099
No.

735
00:57:20,642 --> 00:57:23,859
Have you heard about tulip mania?

736
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,179
It's a tulip crisis.

737
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:32,259
From the most expensive flower,

738
00:57:33,263 --> 00:57:36,930
everything changed overnight.

739
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:42,739
I keep it to remind myself that
changes are always dangerous.

740
00:57:48,297 --> 00:57:50,459
The higher something rises to the top,

741
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:02,139
when it crashes,

742
00:58:05,802 --> 00:58:08,219
the more dangerous it will get.

743
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:17,669
Kavin, MJ.

744
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:18,890
I made up my mind.

745
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:21,090
Ren is out of F4.

746
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,819
Are you serious?

747
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,049
Are you really going to break up F4?

748
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:26,849
Stop ignoring us.

749
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:29,250
Why is it so difficult to
clear the air with Ren?

750
00:58:29,275 --> 00:58:30,320
Let me ask you something.

751
00:58:30,345 --> 00:58:33,090
If you have to choose between Thyme and me,

752
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:34,890
who would you choose?

753
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,285
Where are you going?

754
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:39,329
Ren asked me to meet at the school.

755
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:41,480
Great. I have something to talk to him.
