1
00:00:00,651 --> 00:00:02,020
Ren, what the hell are you doing?

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,412
I gave this girl a red card.

3
00:00:03,413 --> 00:00:04,889
Why do you keep helping her?

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,079
If you flew from France at 5 a.m.,

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,419
what time would you arrive in Thailand?

6
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,659
You got your answer wrong yesterday.

7
00:00:11,557 --> 00:00:13,539
You know Mira?

8
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:16,018
I'd like to be like her.

9
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,770
Have you heard a saying that goes "good shoes will take to good places,"?

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,554
Enough!

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,680
FLOWER OVER BOY

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,861
Stop, Potjanee.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,700
Let go of me.

14
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:42,654
No, not until you hear me out about yesterday.

15
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:46,300
A devilish man like you will charm me into submission.

16
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:48,761
Get out of my life.

17
00:00:48,786 --> 00:00:51,709
She talks a big game, but she'll end up with him.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,729
They have a big fight. How can they end up together?

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,329
Well, if you want a classic trope, it's fall and kiss.

20
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,929
Like it's an accidental fall.

21
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,191
There's nothing accidental about it.

22
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:07,609
You can see on their faces that they're in love. See?

23
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,259
The fall is just an excuse.

24
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,958
What are the chances of someone falling on top of someone

25
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,709
and their mouths touching?

26
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,789
There's no way.

27
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,610
Enough!

28
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:21,447
Speaking of which.

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,759
The golden moment. The golden moment.

30
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,520
There you go.

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,160
No!

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,879
See, dear? You can see on their faces that it's intentional.

33
00:01:46,904 --> 00:01:49,544
It's intentional.

34
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,769
It's intentional.

35
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,841
It's not intentional.

36
00:02:04,497 --> 00:02:06,143
She's into it way too much.

37
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,029
Strange.

38
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,525
It's intentional.

39
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,093
That girl intended to kiss me.

40
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:25,503
He seems to enjoy the yogurt way too much.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,400
I agree.

42
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,504
It's all over your mouth. You're a messy eater, Thyme.

43
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,699
Wow.

44
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,109
He's lost all his cool.

45
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,029
It's been a while, Thyme. Haven't you lost that rush?

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,709
Oh, I forgot. That was Thyme's first kiss.

47
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,200
It totally wasn't. Nonsense.

48
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,895
If it wasn't, where was your first kiss?

49
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,235
Yeah where?

50
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,450
It's none of your business. You don't need to know.

51
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,327
Don't mind that. Let's talk about what's important.

52
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:05,643
Now I know what kind of person Gorya is.

53
00:03:05,815 --> 00:03:07,026
What kind of person is she?

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,923
She's a hypocrite.

55
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,641
She says she doesn't like something, but she does.

56
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,266
She doesn't use expensive things and takes the bus.

57
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,203
But she wants me to approach her.

58
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,689
This kind of person is easy to handle.

59
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,848
She's in the palm of my hand.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,112
It's good that you know what Gorya is like.

61
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,449
But do you know how you're going to talk to Ren?

62
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,745
You've been at odds for too long.

63
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,391
I'm sick of it.

64
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,563
Aren't you going to apologize to him?

65
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,640
He should be apologizing to me. Why should I apologize to him?

66
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,313
Tell him if he doesn't apologize, don't expect us to talk in this lifetime.

67
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,039
(Guys, it seems like #F4 are having a fight.)

68
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,000
(That's what I heard too.)

69
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,480
(Only three of them are together today.)

70
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,640
(Sources say Ren and Thyme like the same girl #F4breakingup)

71
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,670
(Hot topic of gossip at the school #F4breakingup)

72
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,332
Ren, have you seen this? Your fans are saying you're fighting.

73
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,965
That was a few days ago.

74
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,673
It's been a while. I haven't seen you back with your crew.

75
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,649
You fight like children.

76
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:21,558
Are you waiting for Thyme to make the first move?

77
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,540
You know that Thyme doesn't do that.

78
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,410
As children, I was always the one who went to him to make up.

79
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,517
And?

80
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,184
We've grown . He should have figured it out.

81
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,389
So if you guys didn't talk again for the rest of your life,

82
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,736
would you be OK with that?

83
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,770
I'd be OK.

84
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,849
Have you given any thoughts on what you'll do after graduation?

85
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,769
You think about a future too?

86
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,145
If it's your future, I'm interested.

87
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:14,648
Interested how?

88
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,970
You have everything.

89
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,867
You can do everything,

90
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,604
business, modeling, advertising.

91
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:32,241
Whatever you choose, I'm ready to watch and support you.

92
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,298
What if all the options I have are not something I want?

93
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,396
What if everything I have is not the future I want?

94
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,154
What do you mean?

95
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,248
Ren,

96
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,889
I have something important to tell you.

97
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,879
Are you still upset about that?

98
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,131
Ren must've known the kiss was an accident.

99
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,130
I wasn't thinking about Ren.

100
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,752
How many years have we been friends?

101
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,048
No, that kiss was one thing.

102
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,073
I'm just worried about him.

103
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,302
I've never seen them fight like this before.

104
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,130
And I was in the middle of it.

105
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:57,941
If you're worried about him, talk to him.

106
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,180
There's no point being all upset in your head.

107
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,446
This can be your chance to clear the air about the kiss.

108
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:08,129
What can I do? I'm not that close to him.

109
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,836
Find another topic as an opener and then come to this subject.

110
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,851
Find something to talk like...

111
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,269
the handkerchief.

112
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,142
He gave you his handkerchief, didn't he?

113
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,456
Use this opportunity to return his handkerchief.

114
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,280
You'll have something to talk to Ren about.

115
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,400
Boo!

116
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,039
MJ!

117
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:08,954
What are you playing?

118
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:11,290
What? Are you still afraid of us?

119
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,609
We're not Thyme. We don't bite.

120
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,586
Right?

121
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:16,680
We're just passing through.

122
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,475
What about you? Sulking at the fire escape for hours.

123
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,980
Did you see that?

124
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,032
I can show you. Standing still like a mannequin.

125
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,799
Did you come to see Ren?

126
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,359
He's ditching school today.

127
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,318
Oh?

128
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,269
I just saw Mira posting about him coming over to her house.

129
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,017
You can check it out. He should still be there.

130
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,373
But are you sure you'll go?

131
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,789
Be careful. You may see some glaring images.

132
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,989
I just want to return something to him.

133
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,535
Really?

134
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,254
Did I make a right decision to come here?

135
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,224
Ren, hear me out.

136
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,224
Ren, listen.

137
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,539
You can always visit me if I'm over there.

138
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,489
You know it's not the same.

139
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,975
How is it not the same? Be reasonable, Ren.

140
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,676
Reasonable? You're about to give up everything you've built

141
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,598
and live a life without a care to anyone. Is this reasonable?

142
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,459
It's not that I don't care.

143
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,609
But what I choose will be beneficial to lots of people.

144
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,874
So?

145
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,340
You can do it from here too.

146
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,720
There are many ways.

147
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,935
Ren, I've made up mind to live in France and follow my dream.

148
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,436
It's very important to me.

149
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,180
Otherwise, I wouldn't leave home to live as an ordinary girl.

150
00:11:16,598 --> 00:11:18,996
I've found the future I want.

151
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,479
I know that the world I've experienced is not it.

152
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:25,760
Please understand me, Ren.

153
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:42,525
But the world you're about to leave behind has me in it.

154
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,347
You've made a decision to leave everything,

155
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:58,990
including my future with you.

156
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,289
Big news in Thailand's business scene today.

157
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:27,269
Mira - Renita Asavarattanakul, a model and socialite from a famous family,

158
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,989
made a sudden decision to leave the comfort of her home in Thailand.

159
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,370
Find out more in this interview clip.

160
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:39,479
I'm going to France this time to follow my dream.

161
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,164
To be a human rights lawyer?

162
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,489
Yes.

163
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,900
My family opposed it. They wanted to me study business law.

164
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,639
But I thought it through and asked myself,

165
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:54,511
"How can I be happy when people in Thailand and across the world

166
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:57,909
do not receive justice as human beings?"

167
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,699
That's why I want to support and push forward this agenda.

168
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,099
In the end, my family has come to an understanding.

169
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,829
Yes, I plan to stay there for a long period.

170
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,309
She's a real-life fallen angel.

171
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,141
From a perfect life...

172
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:11,931
Hey, I don't get Mira.

173
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,202
What is she thinking?

174
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,644
But I think it's so awesome

175
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,523
for her to do such a brave thing.

176
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,113
I think I should arrange another congratulations bouquet

177
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,926
to congratulate Gorya.

178
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,940
Congratulate me on what?

179
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,929
Don't you think it's a good opportunity now that Mira's gone?

180
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,389
Ren, who's your crush, will be available.

181
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,450
How did you draw that conclusion?

182
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,963
If you don't believe me, it's your business.

183
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,514
But if you don't act soon, someone will snatch that fine hunk.

184
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,689
I'm sure the eyes of all the girls at the school are sparkling right now.

185
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,551
Such a rare opportunity doesn't come often.

186
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,560
(Been waiting for so long, Ren.)

187
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,760
(I know I can't replace Mira. But I can be Ren's new love.)
(Ren is single? All the girls, get in line.)

188
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,592
A good opportunity?

189
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:49,720
What are you doing here?

190
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,729
Taking the bus to school. Haven't you tried it?

191
00:14:55,948 --> 00:14:57,447
Don't be a wisecracker.

192
00:14:57,472 --> 00:14:59,261
Why aren't you driving in your own car?

193
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:00,985
Why are you taking the bus?

194
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,109
Are you insane?

195
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,497
Who's insane?

196
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,370
I just... wanted to try new things.

197
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,004
This... bus happened to pass by so I got on.

198
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,503
Why? Can't I do a simple thing?

199
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,174
A simple thing?

200
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,130
Where's everyone else on the bus?

201
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,572
This bus is usually very crowded.

202
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
Huh?

203
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,423
It's usually crowded.

204
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,881
Fine, I bought it.

205
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,430
Bought?

206
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:46,699
Why, I've got money so I can spend it however I want it.

207
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,956
If I want to live like a secluse, it's my business.

208
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,153
Good thing I'm in a good mood.

209
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,109
I won't mind if you catch a ride with me.

210
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,379
You can tag along...

211
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,449
Recluse not secluse!

212
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,649
Why do you have to go so big?

213
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,849
It's nonsense.

214
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,169
For someone to wait for a bus to come,

215
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,959
do you know how long they have to wait?

216
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,319
What's with you?

217
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,765
I can do whatever I want. So what if I bought it?

218
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,849
Go closer to the bus in front.

219
00:16:12,906 --> 00:16:14,975
What? Other people can take another bus.

220
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,026
Why are you so selfish? I can't stand it any longer.

221
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,350
Gorya!

222
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,157
What's with you?

223
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,130
Step back.

224
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:24,690
I gave you luxurious things and you turned them down.

225
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:27,089
I give you simpler things and you won't take. What is it going to be?

226
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,209
Not like this. A rich guy like you doesn't get it.

227
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,789
Please pull over.

228
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,670
Do not pull over.

229
00:16:32,671 --> 00:16:34,579
We don't pull over between stops anyway.

230
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,869
Pull over at the next stop then.

231
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,870
Do not.

232
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,733
Why are you so stubborn?

233
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,317
Step back!

234
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:44,819
They said they wouldn't pull over. Stop ringing the bell.

235
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:47,850
What's happening?

236
00:16:51,027 --> 00:16:52,069
What kind of driver are you?

237
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,574
Someone cut us off, sir.

238
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,609
Open the door now.

239
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,679
Gorya, where are you going?

240
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,399
Gorya, stop it. Gorya, stop.

241
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,921
Gorya!

242
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:06,040
Gorya!

243
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,980
What the hell?

244
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,415
No way!

245
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,089
Tia!

246
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,604
Why didn't you tell me you're coming?

247
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,071
If I'd told you, I wouldn't have got a chance

248
00:17:31,072 --> 00:17:33,399
to take special care of my beloved brother.

249
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:35,408
You call kicking me in the chest 'taking care'?

250
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:38,849
You, ask yourself what kind of sick game you're playing.

251
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,900
Look, this cute girl is shivering in fear.

252
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:45,958
Don't worry. I'll give you a lift.

253
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,502
Tia, why are you messing...

254
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:48,766
Shut up!

255
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,269
Wait here.

256
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,789
Let's go. You can trust me.

257
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,790
It's OK.

258
00:17:54,351 --> 00:17:57,480
Don't worry. You can trust me.

259
00:17:58,128 --> 00:17:59,223
Please.

260
00:18:00,776 --> 00:18:05,016
Think of this as my apology. OK?

261
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,565
You are Gorya, right?

262
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,381
Pleasure to meet you.

263
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:17,429
Here's my name card.

264
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,297
You can contact me with anything.

265
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:26,280
I've never seen my brother chasing after a girl before.

266
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,840
Hang in there.

267
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,251
Please take Miss Gorya to school.

268
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,329
I think we should talk.

269
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,793
Please, miss.

270
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,635
Goodbye.

271
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,969
Goodbye.

272
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:11,874
Gorya, whose car is this?

273
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,922
Tia's. She's Thyme's sister.

274
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,954
That Tia.

275
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,420
That's nice.

276
00:19:19,421 --> 00:19:21,129
There's nothing nice about it.

277
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,727
It's total chaos. All because of Thyme.

278
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,720
Let's go. People are watching.

279
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,200
Hana, come on.

280
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,010
Thyme, it's not that I don't know what you've been doing.

281
00:19:40,617 --> 00:19:42,726
But it's not right. You know that, right?

282
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:44,352
Yeah, I know.

283
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,593
I believe that deep down you're not a bad person.

284
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,929
But you can be a better person.

285
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,146
'A better person'.

286
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,809
As a Paramaanatra, have we ever cared about that word?

287
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,333
So why didn't you tell me you're back?

288
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,995
I told you. I'm here to look after you.

289
00:20:10,996 --> 00:20:12,353
How about the truth?

290
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,959
I've got an urgent task.

291
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,892
Mom asked me to come back to sort it out.

292
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,683
Something big is coming to Paramaanantra.

293
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,639
That big, huh?

294
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,032
Mom is moving to Phase Two.

295
00:20:35,057 --> 00:20:36,574
From this moment onwards,

296
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:41,378
Parama Group wil be transforming to welcome the new era.

297
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,707
This, will be a greater than any of our previous projects.

298
00:20:46,732 --> 00:20:48,457
And starting this quarter,

299
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:51,613
we'll be expanding ourterritory to across Asia,

300
00:20:51,638 --> 00:20:53,868
with Singapore being the first.

301
00:20:54,732 --> 00:20:57,076
We will do whatever it takes.

302
00:20:57,302 --> 00:20:59,036
And we will not cease

303
00:20:59,061 --> 00:21:02,263
until we have achieve every milestone.

304
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,255
And when that day comes,

305
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:07,333
we shall celebrate our success together.

306
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:08,787
Thank you.

307
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Everything is undergoing a great change.

308
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,592
Things won't be the same.

309
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,134
You too. It's time for you to grow up.

310
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,349
The days when you're just playing for fun are winding down.

311
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,508
I know.

312
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,498
I know that my teenage days are running out.

313
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,601
For a life that seems so familiar

314
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,309
comes a day that will change everything.

315
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,566
I know that we have to grow up and step into a new world.

316
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,241
Bored?

317
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,033
Let's go somewhere quiet and find something fun to do.

318
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,820
In the end, you have to face it

319
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,769
and accept it.

320
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:15,094
It may take some time, but don't you worry.

321
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,242
I'll make it.

322
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,658
You may have grown up a bit.

323
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:30,699
Is it because of Gorya?

324
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:41,539
I'm not giving up on you.

325
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,077
Ren.

326
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,445
Guys, come and play.

327
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,626
What are you waiting for?

328
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:32,294
Hey, come on. Come on.

329
00:23:45,678 --> 00:23:50,689
Glakao, a person can hope, right?

330
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,239
Of course.

331
00:24:10,895 --> 00:24:12,858
I'm not giving up on you.

332
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,759
I wish to see Ren tomorrow.

333
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,687
What am I hoping for?

334
00:26:02,351 --> 00:26:03,624
Ren.

335
00:26:09,631 --> 00:26:11,434
I heard you came here every day.

336
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,893
What's up?

337
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,119
Are you OK? About Mira...

338
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,715
When I was young,

339
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,108
I was very weak.

340
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,537
So weak I couldn't do crazy things like the other three.

341
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:58,964
But when I knew Mira, she asked me to play with them.

342
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,688
She took care of me.

343
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,519
She made sure everything was adjusted to suit me.

344
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,472
So I'm very close to her.

345
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:22,591
So close that... whatever she does or speaks,

346
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,668
I understand them all.

347
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,308
And I know one of her bad habits is that

348
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,282
if she makes up her mind about something,

349
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,680
there's nothing you can say to change it.

350
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,332
I've always known

351
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,157
that this day would come.

352
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,231
I've been fooling myself all this time.

353
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:11,169
I've pictured having Mira by my side forever.

354
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,274
But it's time to move on.

355
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,301
It's over. There's nothing I can do.

356
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,622
Are you sure?

357
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,346
That's life.

358
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:52,034
Don't you think it's a good opportunity now that Mira's gone?

359
00:28:52,035 --> 00:28:53,762
Ren will be available.

360
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,349
What's wrong?

361
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,849
You look like you won't ever see Mira again.

362
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,996
Oh, she said she wanted to see you.

363
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,672
She has a gift for you.

364
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,020
Do you want to see her?

365
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,154
(I don't want you to go.)

366
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:45,504
(Don't want you to leave but good luck.)

367
00:29:49,927 --> 00:29:51,487
Here's your delivery.

368
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,118
Gorya.

369
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,605
Thanks, Ren.

370
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,806
I'll go see your mother.

371
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,273
Ren has told you I've got something for you, hasn't he?

372
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:05,851
Wait a moment.

373
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,875
Did you cut your hair?

374
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:19,430
Yes. It's my way of telling myself there's no going back.

375
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,350
It doesn't look funny, right?

376
00:30:27,351 --> 00:30:30,810
I think these suit you very well. Here you are.

377
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,679
I can't.

378
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,049
Please.

379
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,269
I won't wear them when I'm there.

380
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,615
I'd rather leave them with a person who could use them.

381
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:48,209
And it's my wish for you to go to good places.

382
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,017
You remember that, right?

383
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,991
Good shoes will take you to good places.

384
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,318
Let me grab a bag for you.

385
00:31:31,252 --> 00:31:33,742
If you flew from France at 5 a.m.,

386
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,785
what time would you arrive in Thailand?

387
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,939
Don't you think it's a good opportunity now that Mira's gone?

388
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,612
Ren, who's your crush, will be available.

389
00:31:43,841 --> 00:31:46,039
A person can hope, right?

390
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,749
Of course.

391
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,369
Such a rare opportunity doesn't come often.

392
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,489
It's over. It's time to move on.

393
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,080
There's nothing I can do.

394
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,569
No.

395
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,745
What's that?

396
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,428
Mira, I know it may sound stupid, but I have to tell you.

397
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,929
Please don't go to France.

398
00:32:27,484 --> 00:32:28,995
Wait, Gorya.

399
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,449
Why are you stopping me?

400
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,045
Because I don't want you to go.

401
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,011
None of us wants you to go,

402
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,033
especially Ren.

403
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,358
I know that you have a dream.

404
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,809
But being here doesn't limit you from reaching that dream.

405
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,375
I'm sorry,

406
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,179
but I've made up my mind.

407
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,658
But deep down,

408
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,504
you don't want to leave Ren, do you?

409
00:33:08,911 --> 00:33:13,194
You know, since the first I met Ren,

410
00:33:14,515 --> 00:33:18,424
he'd been waiting for you to come back.

411
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,689
And when I see these pictures...

412
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,929
I've never seen him smile like this to anyone beside you.

413
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,491
The smile is yours.

414
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,846
If you're gone, what would he do?

415
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,644
Please, I'm begging you, please don't go.

416
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:54,039
I know it's too much to ask and so selfish.

417
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,622
But I don't want Ren's smile to disappear.

418
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:15,081
Gorya, you know what?

419
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:20,877
I love that smile on Ren's face too.

420
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,170
But what I'm about to do

421
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,431
will make a lot of people smile.

422
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,237
I know my decision will hurt many people,

423
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:37,545
including Ren.

424
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:41,559
But I believe he's strong enough.

425
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,255
The important thing is a lot of people

426
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,859
are waiting for me to make them smile.

427
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,775
You understand me, don't you?

428
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,067
I'm sorry and I thank you.

429
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:05,292
I made the decision because of you.

430
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,785
Me?

431
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,506
I saw your strength.

432
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,829
You made me believe

433
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,209
that I can live such an awesome life too.

434
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,761
Look, while other girls are happy about Ren,

435
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,656
you're the only one who stops me.

436
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,668
And I know... I can see how much you like Ren.

437
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,472
You are so special, Gorya.

438
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:48,036
Mira.

439
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,929
Keep this strength with you.

440
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,693
Don't avert your eyes from a problem.

441
00:35:53,575 --> 00:36:00,864
As I said, you will one day make a difference.

442
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,581
Did I ask you to kneel in front of Mira and beg?

443
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,637
Did you think about how she'd feel about that?

444
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,169
Did you want her to think I forced you

445
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,985
to talk to her and keep her here?

446
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,729
Did you want her to think that?

447
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,976
You know, what you're doing is putting your nose where it doesn't belong.

448
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,637
Think about others' feelings for a change.

449
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,423
Don't just think about yours.

450
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,369
What about you?

451
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,996
How about your own feelings?

452
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,345
What are you saying?

453
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,689
I know that it's not my business

454
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,746
and I only care about my feelings.

455
00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:44,967
But you? Have you asked yourself what you want to do,

456
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,053
instead of telling yourself there's nothing you can do?

457
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,859
What can I do?

458
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,853
You can't, or are you just avoiding a problem?

459
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:10,343
Mira... she's awesome.

460
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,752
For what she believes in, she fights with all her might.

461
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,641
But look at you.

462
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,961
You keep saying that's how the world works.

463
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,921
You tell yourself to get over it,

464
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,976
but you haven't done anything to fight for it.

465
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:33,534
Because I know there's nothing I can do.

466
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,716
You haven't been able to change anything.

467
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:44,298
Although I've fought but cannot make a change,

468
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,539
I'm relieved that at least I've done something.

469
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,234
Because it matters to me, Ren.

470
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:08,406
If you really like her, deal with it.

471
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,915
At least, you'll know you've tried,

472
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,371
not just saying you can't fix it

473
00:39:17,372 --> 00:39:19,833
when you haven't done anything at all.

474
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,048
- Good luck.
- I'll see you later.

475
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,214
See you.

476
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,939
Thank you for coming to see me off. You had to wake up early.

477
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,549
No problem, Mira.

478
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,209
It's good we come here.

479
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,989
This place is full of beautiful ladies.

480
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,027
Better view than a sunrise.

481
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,237
We'll visit you sometime. Good luck.

482
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,649
You too. I'll be watching you.

483
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,961
Mira!

484
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,161
Thank you, Gorya, for coming here.

485
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,849
Where's Ren?

486
00:40:56,634 --> 00:40:58,045
I don't think he's coming.

487
00:40:58,644 --> 00:41:00,794
Tell him I say goodbye.

488
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,662
Don't forget what we talked about.

489
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,055
Don't avert your eyes from a problem.

490
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,409
Give it the best fight, Gorya.

491
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,729
I'll see you.

492
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,702
Safe travels.

493
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,309
See you.

494
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,642
See you, guys.

495
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,276
What were you doing? It's too late now.

496
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,821
Aren't you going to do something?

497
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,743
Who said I didn't do anything?

498
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,098
I'll follow Mira to France.

499
00:42:23,352 --> 00:42:27,575
I won't avoid a problem as I've always done.

500
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,525
Which way it's going to end up, I'll give it a try.

501
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,888
Because of you, I've gathered my strength to fight.

502
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:49,528
This is what I like most about you.

503
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:03,670
Thank you.

504
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,712
How can you do this?

505
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,047
Are you really going to leave me?

506
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,439
Didn't you think to tell us about something this big?

507
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:03,197
Did you ever think to consult with us?

508
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,365
We used to be together every day.

509
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,524
Are you really going to leave us?

510
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,622
It won't be F4 anymore.

511
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,131
Huh?

512
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,867
Take care, guys.

513
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,693
Damn it!

514
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:49,073
Ren, I haven't even apologized to you.

515
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,560
You don't need to.

516
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,677
If anyone bullies you, I'll deal with them.

517
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,179
There. There.

518
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,412
Is Thyme crying?

519
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:24,259
There. There. Don't cry.

520
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,862
I'm not crying.

521
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,309
There. There.

522
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:28,739
I'm not someone you can play with.

523
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,612
There. There.

524
00:45:29,613 --> 00:45:30,990
Jerks!

525
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,569
Are you messing with me?

526
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,129
Am I a joke to you?

527
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:49,293
Ren, good luck, pal.

528
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:50,845
Ren!

529
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:54,025
Come on, guys, or you'll miss him. Let's see him off.

530
00:45:54,297 --> 00:45:56,489
Ren.

531
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:58,340
Good luck.

532
00:45:58,341 --> 00:46:01,639
Ren, Ren, good luck, pal.

533
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,839
I don't think he can hear me. Help.

534
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,510
Ren!

535
00:46:06,511 --> 00:46:09,969
It hasn't been that long since I knew you guys.

536
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,725
But a short time can be an important moment.

537
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:19,178
Although there're pains, fear, and doubts,

538
00:46:19,827 --> 00:46:22,409
all that makes us grow,

539
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:26,671
even just a little but it's so clear in my mind.

540
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,529
Going forward, obstacles may come my way.

541
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,840
But, as Mira said, I won't avert my eyes from them.

542
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,329
For anything, if you look deep down into it,

543
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:49,569
you may find something good.

544
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:55,143
Finally, you may be able to make a change someday.

545
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,307
Are you hungry? Hungry, huh?

546
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,571
Come on, Dango, have a bite.

547
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,009
Doesn't it smell good?

548
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,300
You're eating a lot, Dango.

549
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,329
Eat a lot and you'll be fluffy.

550
00:47:32,764 --> 00:47:34,704
If you like it, I'll buy more to feed you.

551
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:37,849
Your fur will be shiny, and you'll be chubby.

552
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:40,065
Dango, Dango, Dango.

553
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:43,249
Thyme!

554
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,170
Have you seen the news?

555
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:52,725
From today on, Mom and I will spend a lot of time in Singapore.

556
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:53,904
We'll be very busy.
(Singapore to partner with Paramaanatra.)

557
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,605
So what?

558
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:01,847
It means you can do whatever you want.

559
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:06,274
If you want to pursue Gorya, go for it.

560
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,313
Pursue?

561
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,569
No.

562
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:17,355
So you don't want any advice from me, huh?

563
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:21,492
You can take care of yourself, huh?

564
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,872
Some advice would be nice.

565
00:48:27,862 --> 00:48:28,920
Hmm?

566
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,169
Some advice would be nice.

567
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,257
What's that?

568
00:48:33,282 --> 00:48:35,222
Give me some advice.

569
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,849
Ouch, that hurts.

570
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,977
That's all I need, you stubborn child.

571
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,640
It wouldn't be easy with Gorya.

572
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:47,009
She's not someone whom Mom would appreciate.

573
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,936
But if you're sure about her, you have my full support.

574
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:56,248
OK?

575
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,704
Where's the advice?

576
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,831
OK.

577
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,063
It's so easy.

578
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,428
From what I've seen, she doesn't like beating around the bush.

579
00:49:06,745 --> 00:49:09,788
Therefore, skip the step.

580
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,869
Whoa, skip to what step?

581
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,942
Cool it.

582
00:49:16,347 --> 00:49:19,129
I mean ask her out on a date.

583
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:23,249
Don't text, don't call. It's a waste of time.

584
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,363
Ask her out.

585
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,650
Mmm.

586
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,450
Will it work?

587
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,777
Thyme.

588
00:49:36,758 --> 00:49:40,829
Being an adult means you're ready to take on any problem.

589
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,606
You're grown up. You're not a child anymore.

590
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,689
Don't let me down, OK?

591
00:49:57,114 --> 00:49:58,757
I'm not a child anymore.

592
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:08,129
Gorya, how have you been?

593
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:10,270
What did you do over the weekend?

594
00:50:11,364 --> 00:50:14,870
Over the weekend, I went to see Mira off at the airport.

595
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:20,721
Huh? Are you that close to Mira and F4?

596
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,349
No, I'm not that close to them.

597
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:27,822
I'm close to you and always on your side.

598
00:50:29,785 --> 00:50:34,134
Jane, look at these F4 dolls. So premium.

599
00:50:34,205 --> 00:50:36,502
True, and they smell so good,

600
00:50:36,527 --> 00:50:39,459
not like the smell of a liar around here.

601
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:43,072
What are you looking at?

602
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,319
Don't forget we haven't settled a score with you.

603
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,605
You won't have a prince like Ren to protect you anymore.

604
00:50:48,606 --> 00:50:50,929
The rest of them are bad to the bone.

605
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:55,220
You'll see. It won't be long until Thyme gives you a big payback.

606
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:59,096
Jane, do you have anything to say to Gorya?

607
00:50:59,312 --> 00:51:01,859
Yes, it's coming to you.

608
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,849
Ahem.

609
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,409
Miss Thitara Jundee, are you watching?

610
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,386
I have an announcement for you.

611
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:19,831
Well...

612
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,369
Damn it!

613
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:23,992
This Saturday, come and see me at the clock tower

614
00:51:23,993 --> 00:51:25,543
near the Ferris wheel at Asiatique at 1 p.m.

615
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,800
OK?

616
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:29,728
That's all. Enough. Cut.

617
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,978
What is this?

618
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,719
Did Thyme just ask you out on a date?

619
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,409
That's crazy.

620
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:46,409
That was just... no, no, no.

621
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,130
He's just finding a way to bully me.

622
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:52,404
How can it be a date? It's certainly not a date.

623
00:52:02,401 --> 00:52:04,071
Gorya. Gorya.

624
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:08,637
Are you sure you're free today?

625
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,369
Yes. I don't have any plans today.

626
00:52:14,168 --> 00:52:16,047
Thank you for coming with me.

627
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,969
I told you I didn't want you to come here alone.

628
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:22,997
My phone is broken again so I want to find a place to fix it.

629
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:24,450
Shall we go?

630
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:25,541
Let's roll.

631
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,459
I'm hungry.

632
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,560
You just got here, and you're already hungry.

633
00:52:41,428 --> 00:52:42,536
Dessert?

634
00:52:42,561 --> 00:52:43,723
Looks yummy.

635
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:47,684
Here you go. We can wear them together.

636
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:49,229
That's nuts.

637
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:50,516
Or this one.

638
00:52:50,517 --> 00:52:52,701
We're not interested to go into the entertainment business at this time.

639
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:57,380
We talked about it, and we agreed that.

640
00:52:57,751 --> 00:53:00,880
Acting is a profession that requires a lot of commitment.

641
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,800
And we're not that good-looking.

642
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,711
So we'll focus on our family businesses.

643
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:12,210
Everywhere we turn, all we see is F4. So annoying.

644
00:53:12,215 --> 00:53:14,198
The more I see them, the more I dislike them.

645
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,010
Didn't you say he's handsome?

646
00:53:16,854 --> 00:53:19,509
No way. When did I say that?

647
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:24,819
How about the love life of Thyme - Akira Paramaanantra?

648
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,719
How popular is this handsome billionaire?

649
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:34,529
The man himself said he never had this kind of experience

650
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:37,649
but wouldn't close himself off from someone special.

651
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:38,400
Hmm... really?

652
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:40,509
Let's hear the interview.

653
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,522
This Saturday, come and see me at the clock tower

654
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:44,145
near the Ferris wheel at Asiatique at 1 p.m.

655
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:45,489
OK?

656
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:56,270
Love?

657
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:58,421
No.

658
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,309
I don't think any girl can stand me.

659
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,270
Gorya.

660
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:05,270
Huh?

661
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:06,875
OK?

662
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:09,355
I'm fine. I'm OK.

663
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,609
I mean... does this blouse look OK?

664
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,448
Where did you mind go?

665
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:17,089
I may get a bit hungry.

666
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,569
Fine, let's get something to eat.

667
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,956
What should we eat?

668
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:26,101
I have a lot of flaws.

669
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,616
I'm not a guy who chases after someone.

670
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:35,198
I don't like to pamper someone.

671
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:42,407
Others usually pamper me.

672
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:47,449
I got it for you.

673
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,537
Thank you.

674
00:54:48,736 --> 00:54:50,399
Why does it have to rain today?

675
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:54,370
That's right. I haven't got my phone fixed yet.

676
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,663
I have another flaw.

677
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:08,248
I'm hotheaded. I don't like to wait for anyone.

678
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,956
If you want to be with me, you have to be the one who waits.

679
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,609
Something like that.

680
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,978
If you want to be with me, you have to put up with me.

681
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,390
Hey, sorry but I need to go.

682
00:55:33,044 --> 00:55:34,130
Gorya!

683
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:39,184
It's just the way I am.

684
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:48,969
But maybe... if the girl is important,

685
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:55,882
she might... change me forever.

686
00:56:19,945 --> 00:56:23,309
Is this a date with F4 that everyone dreams of?

687
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:24,592
It's nothing like I expected.

688
00:56:26,054 --> 00:56:27,903
Are you going to be serious with Gorya?

689
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:32,249
Someone who keeps finding a way to earn extra money

690
00:56:32,274 --> 00:56:34,375
and the only son of the Parama Group.

691
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:36,400
Do you think your mom would be OK with it?

692
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:37,859
If we don't pay the interest,

693
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,937
they'll come to our house to collect.

694
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,869
Our lives are not the same as your life.

695
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:44,416
Let's not force it.
