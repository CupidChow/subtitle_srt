00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,100
In my round, two Plum cards
were drawn as well.

190
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,700
There are
only four Plum cards in total.

191
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,260
How could he possibly draw
a Plum card?

192
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,580
He lied to us

193
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,820
to make us leave first.

194
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,020
I don't think we need
to compare anymore.

195
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,940
I've drawn two Orchid cards,

196
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,740
so how could yours be better than mine?

197
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,940
Be patient.

198
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
I haven't finished drawing yet,

199
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,180
so it's not over.

200
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,340
Actually,

201
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,540
you were lying just now.

202
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,940
There are no Plum cards

203
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,220
left on the table,

204
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,260
so it's impossible for you

205
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,700
to have one.

206
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,660
Right now,
the Orchid card is the highest,

207
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:37,980
so I've won.

208
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,900
The truth is,

209
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,820
the lie you told

210
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,020
could have been easily uncovered

211
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,940
if those two had checked their cards.

212
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,180
But since they

213
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,420
haven't returned yet,

214
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,980
I suspect they're pretending
to be clueless,

215
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,700
leaving you

216
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,340
here alone.

217
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,460
People

218
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,540
are naturally selfish,

219
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,860
so don't take it personally.

220
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,180
I'll be here
to accompany you in the future.

221
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,140
Since I let them go,

222
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,660
I never intended for them to come back.

223
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,940
I still have one card left to draw.

224
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,460
If you're lying

225
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,580
and the cards in your hand

226
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,860
aren't actually two Orchids,

227
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,660
then I might still have a chance to win.

228
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,140
Cao Yanbing, you idiot.

229
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,980
Do you really think you're a hero?

230
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,780
Why are you two back?

231
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,860
You're asking us,

232
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,980
but we need to ask you the same.

233
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,420
How dare you lie to us?

234
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,860
We're not going anywhere.

235
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,660
We'll watch you draw the card.

236
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,580
Exactly.

237
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,740
If we can't leave, we'll just fight her.

238
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,460
All right.

239
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,740
I'll draw this card.

240
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:09,770
[Cao Yanbing: three points]

241
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,800
[Test Creator: six points]

242
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,900
You guys won.

243
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:26,980
You may leave now.

244
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,860
This trial

245
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,780
is meant to test

246
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,620
whether you will abandon
your companions

247
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,140
in the face of life-and-death decisions.

248
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,460
Once you exit the barrier,

249
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,740
you will find an ancient book.

250
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,220
you'll get the mark on reaching out,

251
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,140
which signifies

252
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:50,940
approval

253
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,380
from the ancestors
of the Wind-Treading Clan.

254
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,180
Thank you.

255
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,420
Thanks.

256
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,140
So, how about it?

257
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,220
I told you I was sure to win, didn't I?

258
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:09,780
You little brat,

259
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,740
how was that sure?

260
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,620
Let me tell you,

261
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,740
if you act on your own again,

262
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,420
Beiluo and I will not forgive you.

263
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,460
Got it.

264
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,060
You two hit really hard.

265
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,380
Do you think these people

266
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,780
can make it out of the trial?

267
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,860
I'm not sure.

268
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,460
Ruofu,

269
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,540
do you understand

270
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,020
why our ancestors created

271
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,980
this trial?

272
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,980
Isn't it meant to determine

273
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,020
who is worthy to be led

274
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,180
to the Ancient Tower?

275
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,100
The purpose is to seal this scroll
with the blood

276
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,580
of our Wind-Treading Clan members,

277
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,260
ensuring that those who take the trial

278
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,380
will be trapped inside forever.

279
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,460
Are you going to kill them?

280
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,580
Mother.

281
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,540
This is...

282
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,140
Ruofu,

283
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,580
if you want to protect Lingfeng Street,

284
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,780
sealing them is the only way.

285
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,420
I...

286
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,460
Ruofu,

287
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,300
do you actually want to become
the Spiritual Guardian or not?

288
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,140
Of course,

289
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,900
anyone in Spiritual Crossroads

290
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,300
would want to be the Spiritual Guardian.

291
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:30,980
Very well,

292
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,980
since you aspire
to be the Spiritual Guardian,

293
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,420
you can't afford to be indecisive.

294
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,740
Everything should be centered

295
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,900
around safeguarding Lingfeng Street.

296
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:42,940
I...

297
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:45,900
I'll do it myself.

298
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,580
All right,

299
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,380
the matter is settled.

300
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,500
Quickly bandage your hand

301
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,060
and go rest.

302
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,180
What's happening?

303
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
Is the trial over?

304
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,060
I thought there was supposed

305
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,020
to be a mark for those who passed.

306
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,060
Why don't I have one?

307
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,260
I don't have one either.

308
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,700
This courtyard seems strange.

309
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,500
This should be...

310
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,020
Qiao, wait for me.

311
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,420
Wait for me.

312
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,900
Qiao, wait for me.

313
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,140
Hurry up.

314
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,780
Qiao, wait for me.

315
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:06,900
What's wrong?

316
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,300
Ruofu.

317
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,140
Show me

318
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,460
those sword techniques again.

319
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,140
Okay.

320
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,100
Go and sit there.

321
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,580
Are you saying
that she's the young Yan Ruofu?

322
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:21,980
Yes.

323
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,540
You are so impressive.

324
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,300
What's going on?

325
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,020
Did we travel through time?

326
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,460
Bravo, Qiao.

327
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:32,940
Young General.

328
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,300
Young General?

329
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,860
They probably can't hear

330
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,700
or see us.

331
00:22:59,460 --> 00:22:59,980
Okay.

332
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,460
Looks like

333
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,580
we've entered

334
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,300
another illusion.

335
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,740
Another illusion?

336
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,380
Isn't the trial already over?

337
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:07,780
I don't know.

338
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,340
We'll see.

339
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,620
That was so impressive of you, Qiao.

340
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,780
That was nothing.

341
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,980
If we were faced
with some Malevolent Beings,

342
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,540
none of those techniques
would be useful.

343
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,980
Even your useless techniques

344
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,860
are better than my best effort.

345
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
I can't even summon

346
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,060
my Guardian Primordial Spirit.

347
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,860
You will be able to when you get older.

348
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,580
So what's the rush?

349
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,060
Oh, Qiao,

350
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,380
I heard it the other day

351
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,900
that our clan members were attacked.

352
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,940
Have you figured out who did it?

353
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,420
Is that why you went out

354
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,900
with Uncle this time?

355
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,220
I suppose.

356
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,380
Were the bad guys caught?

357
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,700
Tell me about it quickly.

358
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,580
Ruofu.

359
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,780
I'm going out for the whole day today.

360
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,660
Could you go to the room

361
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,700
and get me some nice food

362
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,620
to take with us

363
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,100
on the road?

364
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,540
Sure.

365
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,500
Wait for me.

366
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,380
I'll go right now.

367
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:08,900
You lied.

368
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,180
Both of them are gone.

369
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,140
What do we do now?

370
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,460
What else can we do?

371
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,500
We'll follow them.

372
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,460
What is this place?

373
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,100
Who is this Qiao

374
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,220
that Ruofu

375
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,140
is following?

376
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,500
I don't think we've met her

377
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,540
in Lingfeng Street.

378
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:29,740
I remember

379
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,940
Tianyue bringing up his daughter Qiao

380
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,260
when he was drunk.

381
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,100
He has a daughter named Qiao.

382
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,580
He also said that we

383
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,580
were in the same unfortunate situation.

384
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,980
What does it mean?

385
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,860
Was his daughter...

386
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,460
I'm not sure.

387
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,940
I asked him later,

388
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,220
but he was reluctant to talk about it.

389
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,780
Ruofu,

390
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,660
I told you not to come.

391
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,580
Why didn't you listen?

392
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:13,620
Go back.

393
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,380
Qiao.

394
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,380
Go back!

395
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,620
I just want to play with you.

396
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,740
I've been looking forward

397
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,060
to your visit.

398
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,420
Ruofu,

399
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,900
head back for now.

400
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,300
I'll come by to see you later, okay?

401
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,460
Who is it?

402
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,500
Who's outside?

403
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,580
Qiao.

404
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,300
There's someone inside the house.

405
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,860
Who could it be?

406
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:39,780
Ruofu,

407
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,260
I can tell you

408
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,220
who is in the house,

409
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,540
but you have to promise me

410
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,140
that you won't tell anyone

411
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,300
about what you saw today.

412
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,180
Is that okay?

413
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,060
Of course.

414
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,340
Qiao,

415
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,620
it really is you.

416
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,260
Qiao.

417
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,700
Who is she?

418
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,700
It's not safe for her to be here.

419
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,620
Fengzha, don't be afraid.

420
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,340
This is Ruofu,

421
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,820
who I've mentioned before.

422
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,660
She's our auntie's daughter.

423
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,740
Fengzha.

424
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,460
This is Fengzha,

425
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,260
my brother.

426
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,020
So he is Fengzha.

427
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,180
Wasn't he supposed to be sickly

428
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,180
and isolated since childhood?

429
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,420
How did he end up being locked up here?

430
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,300
Fengzha isn't sick.

431
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,220
He simply has a powerful beast

432
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,540
within him.

433
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,620
It's too strong to be controlled

434
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,140
before it even awakens.

435
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,060
Father locked him up here

436
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,140
to protect the clan.

437
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,660
Protect the clan?

438
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,300
Could the recent attacks on the clan

439
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,420
have been carried out by him?

440
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,460
That was an accident.

441
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,660
Fengzha would never

442
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,660
intentionally harm others.

443
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,340
He just

444
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,660
couldn't control himself before.

445
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,260
Actually, that fierce beast

446
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,900
is Fengzha's Guardian Primordial Spirit.

447
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,980
As long as Fengzha can control it,

448
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,260
everything will be fine.

449
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,700
It's okay.

450
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,140
I can't even summon

451
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,140
my Guardian Primordial Spirit,

452
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,500
so we're pretty much the same.

453
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:26,780
Oh, yes.

454
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,740
Shall we share this, Fengzha?

455
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,340
Sit down and eat.

456
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,100
Come.

457
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,020
Have a seat.

458
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,380
Yan Qiaoqiao is Yan Tianyue's daughter.

459
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,420
So this Fengzha

460
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,380
must be Yan Tianyue's son.

461
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,020
Has your old friend ever mentioned

462
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,140
that he had such a son?

463
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,500
No.

464
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,620
I guess Yan Tianyue

465
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,940
isn't as simple as you think he is.

466
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,260
This Lingfeng Street

467
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,380
is indeed full of secrets.

468
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,420
Be careful.

469
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:29,940
Qiao,

470
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,340
when will we come back again?

471
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,500
How about tomorrow?

472
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,980
I like Fengzha.

473
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,700
Ruofu,

474
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,860
do you still remember
that Spirit-hosted Human,

475
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,660
Tang Xiaoxiao?

476
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,180
How could I forget?

477
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,900
She saved both my mother and me.

478
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,340
Yes,

479
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,180
she not only saved you and your mother

480
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,700
but was also an old friend of my father.

481
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,620
They came

482
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,660
to Lingfeng Street this time

483
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,820
for the Luhua Ancient Tower.

484
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,740
My father asked me

485
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,020
to guide them tomorrow.

486
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,460
Luhua Ancient Tower?

487
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,060
I've heard the elders in the clan

488
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,500
talk about legends of the tower.

489
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,740
They say

490
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,500
there's a terrifying deity there.

491
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,300
It sounds very dangerous.

492
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,940
You must stay far away from him.

493
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:06,780
Ruofu,

494
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,340
if I don't make it back,

495
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,260
will you promise

496
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,580
to visit Fengzha regularly?

497
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,780
Why wouldn't you make it back?

498
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,100
No,

499
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,300
I misspoke.

500
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,380
I meant you should visit him regularly

501
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,500
when I'm not around.

502
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,140
No problem.

503
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,060
I'll bring food

504
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,620
to Fengzha every day.

505
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,940
We'll both be expecting your return.

506
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,100
As things stand,

507
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,820
it seems that it was Yan Qiaoqiao

508
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,940
who led my mother and the others

509
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,500
into Luhua Ancient Tower back then.

510
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,380
From what

511
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,780
Tianyue said,

512
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,100
it's very likely

513
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,180
that Yan Qiaoqiao didn't make it back.

514
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,900
Given the current situation,

515
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,100
Yan Qiaoqiao must know

516
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,540
that she probably won't be coming back.

517
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,980
Why is that?

518
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,820
We know

519
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,140
that Cao Yanbing's mother

520
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,340
was trapped in the Ancient Tower.

521
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,700
But what about Yan Qiaoqiao?

522
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,020
Where did she go?

523
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,460
Before we figure this out,

524
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,940
we need to first confirm

525
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,100
if what we're seeing is real.

526
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,860
Don't you

527
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,820
find it strange

528
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,580
that we're seeing these things

529
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,020
in this trial?

530
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,380
Where did they go?

531
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,340
What's happening now?

532
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,540
It seems the story has moved on

533
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,380
to a new day.

534
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,300
How about we check it out?

535
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,740
Let's head back to the stone house.

536
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,580
Are you ready?

537
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,780
You can reveal them first.

538
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,660
It's your turn.

539
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,700
What cards do you have?

540
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,780
I've lost.

541
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,220
This little yellow duck is yours now.

542
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,700
You don't like it?

543
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,460
What do you want then?

544
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,260
I want you
to bring my sister to visit me.

545
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,220
When will she be back?

546
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,420
Be good.

547
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,820
Qiao took some people

548
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,100
to the Voidwood,

549
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,580
and she'll be back soon.

550
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,660
You said it would be soon,

551
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,980
but it's been more than ten days now.

552
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,100
Come on and tell me.

553
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,500
What do you want for tomorrow?

554
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,660
I'll buy it for you.

555
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,820
I just hope to control the power

556
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,860
within my body quickly,

557
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,380
so I can go outside

558
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,980
and buy

559
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,820
whatever

560
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,980
I want.

561
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,620
How about this?

562
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,860
I'll come to see you every day
from now on.

563
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,260
We can train together.

564
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,300
So you'll master your power sooner,

565
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,100
and I'll summon
my Guardian Primordial Spirit earlier.

566
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:47,620
How does that sound?

567
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,260
Okay,

568
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,380
it's a deal.

569
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,700
When my sister comes back,

570
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,220
we'll surprise her.

571
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,060
It's settled then.

572
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:53,660
Pinky promise.

573
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,460
Pinky promise,

574
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,460
binding for a hundred years.

575
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,020
Ruofu, try this.

576
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,660
How disappointed and sad

577
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,700
would they be

578
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,660
if they knew Yan Qiaoqiao

579
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,940
would never return?

580
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:16,780
Fengzha,

581
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,260
you haven't been training all night,
have you?

582
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,580
I'm fine!

583
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,780
Have a rest.

584
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,060
We'll do more training tomorrow.

585
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,060
You may not be worried,

586
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,060
but I am.

587
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,260
My sister has been missing for a year.

588
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,020
If I don't go find her soon,

589
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,460
who will care about what happens to her?

590
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,700
But can we really succeed

591
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,420
if we rush to save her?

592
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,060
Not only do we lack the power,

593
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,660
but what if you lose control
on the way...

594
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,180
You want to say

595
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,300
that if I lose control

596
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,340
of my power on the way

597
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,900
and injure someone, what will we do?

598
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,660
Right?

599
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,780
I... I didn't mean it that way.

600
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,260
You're right.

601
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,820
It's all my fault for being useless.

602
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,340
I shouldn't have been born
in the first place.

603
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,660
Otherwise, my mother

604
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,820
wouldn't have died,

605
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,340
and Lingfeng Street

606
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,220
would have one less troublemaker.

607
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,340
What are you talking about?

608
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,940
I've already said
that's not what I meant.

609
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,180
Let's wait a bit longer.

610
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:09,780
Fengzha.

611
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:10,740
Fengzha, what's wrong?

612
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,420
Fengzha.

613
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,300
Fengzha.

614
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,140
Leave.

615
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,460
Leave.

616
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:16,980
Just leave!

617
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,500
Fine, I'll leave!

618
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,740
I won't come back again!

619
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:49,980
Let's go take a look.

620
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,340
Fengzha.

621
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,660
Fengzha.

622
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,940
It seems the beast within Fengzha

623
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,980
has completely awakened.

624
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,100
The Spirit-Locking Chain

625
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,180
can no longer restrain it.

626
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,740
Fengzha.

627
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,660
Tianyue, you are...

628
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,340
Fengzha is your son.

629
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,700
Not only am I his father,

630
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,420
but I am also the Spiritual Guardian
of Lingfeng Street.

631
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,020
No.

632
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,540
Tianyue.

633
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:43,860
Fengzha

634
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,140
is now the only guide

635
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,420
within our clan.

636
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,380
The guide

637
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,980
is ordained by the gods,

638
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,020
so we can't kill him.

639
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,700
We absolutely can't, Tianyue.

640
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,940
Uncle, please don't.

641
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,060
Ruofu.

642
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,180
Please spare Fengzha.

643
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,500
Lingyu,

644
00:35:59,020 --> 00:35:59,980
take Ruofu back now.

645
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,540
Go.

646
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,460
No.

647
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,540
Uncle.

648
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,740
Don't!

649
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,260
Let's go.

650
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:16,740
Uncle.

651
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,060
This is great.

652
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,940
You are finally out.

653
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,340
Have you seen

654
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,580
anything about the past

655
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,460
of Lingfeng Street?

656
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:35,780
As expected,

657
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,300
what we finally saw

658
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,620
wasn't an ancient scroll,

659
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:41,900
right?

660
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,820
Go get some rest now.

661
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,180
Zhuoying,

662
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,380
from now on, I need you

663
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,940
to recreate the ancient scroll

664
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,020
based on the scenes I envision.

665
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:29,860
Yes.

666
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,260
Those are all my memories

667
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:33,900
and

668
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,220
what I want to share with you.

669
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,580
That makes sense.

670
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,020
No wonder you're featured in every part.

671
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,860
Ruofu,

672
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,780
what is it you want to tell us?

673
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,220
And why are you using this method?

674
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:46,780
Indeed.

675
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,060
If you have something to say,

676
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,780
just say it directly.

677
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,660
What else could it be?

678
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,500
With all the effort

679
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,580
and roundabout ways,

680
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,380
are you just trying to tell us

681
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,540
that Yan Fengzha

682
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,740
is the real guide?

683
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:00,700
That's right.

684
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,740
Fengzha is the real guide.

685
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:04,740
Wait a second.

686
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,980
Aren't you also a guide?

687
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,860
I'm a fake one.

688
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,860
Shameless.

689
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,700
We've been following you

690
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,540
every day,

691
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,820
humbly begging for your help,

692
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,060
and it turns out you were lying to us.

693
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,220
It's no wonder you wouldn't guide us.

694
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,500
You're nothing

695
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,420
but a fake!

696
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,180
Cao Yanbing,

697
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,740
we don't have the full picture yet.

698
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,540
Don't rush to judge.

699
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,260
Ruofu,

700
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,340
let me ask you this.

701
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,340
Since you've been deceiving us

702
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:32,980
this whole time,

703
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,540
why are you

704
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,500
telling us the truth now?

705
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,260
What else could it be?

706
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,420
You're just worried

707
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,140
that if we pass the trial,

708
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,420
we'll be even more relentless.

709
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,900
Initially, I only pretended

710
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,700
to be the guide

711
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,140
to trick the Fire-Eater King.

712
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,900
And what about after that?

713
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,020
Was it not intentional?

714
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,140
Cao Yanbing,

715
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,100
if Ruofu was afraid of us pestering her,

716
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,660
she could have just avoided us.

717
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,460
There was no need to reveal the truth.

718
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,380
If she's willing to be honest,

719
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,620
it means she really cares.

720
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,300
All right,

721
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,860
regardless of the reason,

722
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,260
since you're willing

723
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,100
to be honest with us now,

724
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,260
I'll still consider you a friend.

725
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,220
So, what's the situation

726
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,820
with Yan Fengzha?

727
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,820
Back then, before I was dragged away,

728
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:22,900
I was still pleading

729
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,900
with my uncle not to kill him.

730
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,380
So did he end up taking his life?

731
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,140
Is Yan Fengzha dead or alive?

732
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,060
Later, I was taken back
to the General's Mansion.

733
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,620
My mother told me

734
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,740
that Fengzha had lost control,

735
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,740
broken free from the chains,

736
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,620
and my uncle had no choice
but to kill him himself.

737
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,780
A father killed his own son

738
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,860
with his own hands?

739
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,300
I showed you my memories

740
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,260
to let you know

741
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,820
that Lingfeng Street

742
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,780
no longer has a guide.

743
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,140
I was wrong

744
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,380
to keep it from you before,

745
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:09,980
and I apologize.

746
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,100
But what you want,

747
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,700
we truly cannot provide.

748
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,260
So please,

749
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,700
leave Lingfeng Street.

750
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,620
Cao Yanbing, where are you going?

751
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,540
If Yan Ruofu hid things from us,

752
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,180
I can reluctantly accept
that she had no choice.

753
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,420
But Yan Lingyu

754
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,980
clearly had ill intentions.

755
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:42,980
It was her who proposed

756
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:43,980
the trial

757
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,900
and promised

758
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,900
that her daughter would guide us.

759
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,460
Yan Ruofu,

760
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,260
I can overlook what you've done.

761
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,460
But I must confront Yan Lingyu

762
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,140
and hold her accountable.

763
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,180
Don't.

764
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:53,620
Cao Yanbing.

765
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,540
Cao Yanbing.

766
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,740
Ruofu,

767
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,740
does General Yan know

768
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,540
that you're telling us this?

769
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:14,940
Thank you.
