196
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,500
I've ever shot.

197
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,780
I've waited my whole life for this.

198
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,180
It is

199
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,100
just perfect.

200
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,820
Amazing!

201
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,300
So, it is here.

202
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,420
Is this...

203
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,060
Looks like we're lucky.

204
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,260
A tavern.

205
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,780
The perfect place
for gathering information.

206
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,540
I'm low on money

207
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,580
in the Human Realm,

208
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,980
but I still have

209
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,060
lots of Border Coins.

210
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,020
Come on.

211
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,580
Let's go.

212
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,270
[Wen's Tavern]

213
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:16,900
What are you looking at?

214
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,660
Why aren't you eating?

215
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,060
The busier the tavern,

216
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,300
the more

217
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,220
you can learn

218
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,620
about a place's customs and people.

219
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,500
Sir,

220
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,660
are you alright?

221
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,740
Look over there.

222
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,180
Come in.

223
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,380
Hey,

224
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,740
tell the kitchen

225
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,700
to make a bowl of noodles.

226
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,300
Got it.

227
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,420
No, Sir.

228
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,220
I'm just taking a break.

229
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,420
I can't eat for free.

230
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,060
Sir,

231
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,300
we are all Border Dwellers

232
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,540
on Hanxian Street,

233
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,340
and we all have tough times.

234
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,980
We should help those in need.

235
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,100
Thank you.

236
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,540
The shop owner is so nice.

237
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,740
People here are all kind.

238
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,380
Let's dig in.

239
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,220
Excuse me, Sir,

240
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,820
you haven't paid the bill.

241
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,500
Sir,

242
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,860
you can't leave

243
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,580
without paying.

244
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,220
You want money?

245
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,380
You want money?

246
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,020
You're asking me for money?

247
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,020
Look at my clothes.

248
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,940
Are they not enough to cover the bill?

249
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,660
Ouch!

250
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,940
How dare you!

251
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,500
Don't come any closer!

252
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,340
Ouch!

253
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,300
Boss.

254
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,100
Let's go.

255
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,740
Wait.

256
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,380
You haven't paid yet.

257
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,420
Pay up!

258
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:40,660
Money!

259
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,660
You...

260
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,260
Let's go.

261
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,300
Just you wait!

262
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,780
Bravo!

263
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,180
Thank you guys

264
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,140
for your help.

265
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,820
I don't know

266
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,860
how to express my gratitude.

267
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,900
No need for thanks.

268
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,100
Sir,

269
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,020
we just want to ask you something.

270
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,980
Do you know someone

271
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,100
named Xia Qifeng?

272
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,620
Xia Qifeng?

273
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,700
Xia Qifeng?

274
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,860
Why are you asking about him?

275
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,060
Do you know him?

276
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,140
My name is Xia Ling.

277
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,140
I'm his daughter.

278
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,660
His daughter?

279
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:25,860
Get out.

280
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:26,980
Get out of here!

281
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,900
You're the daughter of that coward?

282
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,140
You're not welcome here!

283
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,140
Get out of Hanxian Street!

284
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,260
Get out!

285
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,740
Why so aggressive?

286
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,220
I'm just asking about my father.

287
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,460
Is he your enemy?

288
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,380
Anyway,

289
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,300
Xia Qifeng's daughter

290
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,540
can't set foot on Hanxian Street.

291
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,380
Yes,

292
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,380
get out now!

293
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,140
Right.

294
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,660
Get lost!

295
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,460
Get out now!

296
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,580
Alright,

297
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,900
let me handle this.

298
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,620
Take a seat.

299
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,140
Sit.

300
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:52,780
Miss,

301
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,700
since you found this place,

302
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,940
you must know

303
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,860
that your father

304
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,420
was once the Spiritual Guardian

305
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,340
of Hanxian Street.

306
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,780
That'll be easier to explain

307
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,300
why everyone gets so angry

308
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,300
at the mention

309
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,660
of Xia Qifeng.

310
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,900
That's because

311
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,180
as the Spiritual Guardian here,

312
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,740
he abandoned us and escaped,

313
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,900
leaving Hanxian Street
to be ravaged by Malevolent Beings.

314
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,260
That's impossible!

315
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,460
He escaped?

316
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,740
You must be mistaken.

317
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,780
We didn't believe it either at first.

318
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,140
Without the protection
of the Spiritual Guardian

319
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,300
We Border Dwellers suffered a lot

320
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,100
for months.

321
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,140
We all hoped

322
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,420
your father would return.

323
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,580
But as the days

324
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,100
went by,

325
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,460
hope turned to despair,

326
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,420
and people became numb.

327
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,100
Many Border Dwellers

328
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,580
were devoured by Malevolent Beings,

329
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,300
and those
who couldn't survive the torment

330
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,620
turned into Malevolent Beings

331
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,620
under pain and despair.

332
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:51,940
My wife

333
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,860
was one of them.

334
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,220
I'm sorry.

335
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,220
I didn't know that.

336
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:02,820
But could this

337
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,460
be a misunderstanding?

338
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,340
There's no misunderstanding.

339
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,020
Your father

340
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,060
did abandon us.

341
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,300
Forget it.

342
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,900
It's over now.

343
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,020
Miss, you seem

344
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
to be a good person,

345
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,700
but we can't forget

346
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,700
what your father did

347
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,740
to us.

348
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,140
Off you go.

349
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,580
Scram, now.

350
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,180
Get out. Hurry!

351
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,300
Why don't you move?

352
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,220
Just go.

353
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,340
Hurry up.

354
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,460
Let's go.

355
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,180
Don't come back.

356
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,900
Don't show up again.

357
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,420
Just go.

358
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,220
Leave now.

359
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:44,940
Come on.

360
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,700
Give me a hand.

361
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,140
Tanghulu!

362
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,620
Move over a bit.

363
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,660
Miss, take a look.

364
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,620
Tanghulu.

365
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,920
[Hanxian Street]

366
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:50,620
General.

367
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,820
[Shen Yuanqing,
acting Spiritual Guardian]

368
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,940
[on Hanxian Street]
Why in such a hurry?

369
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,940
What's wrong?

370
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,020
General,

371
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,820
here's the thing.

372
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,660
Do you have something to say?

373
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,380
I'll come to the point.

374
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,740
Your father

375
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,780
might be a good father

376
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,620
to you,

377
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,260
but that doesn't mean

378
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,300
he is a good Spiritual Guardian.

379
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,940
From the moment a Spiritual Guardian

380
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,220
takes charge of a Spiritual Crossroad,

381
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,140
the Border Dwellers on that street

382
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,660
become his or her responsibility.

383
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,500
When facing hardship,

384
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,460
they can only

385
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,060
count on us.

386
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,700
So, no matter what,

387
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,060
never should a Spiritual Guardian

388
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,940
abandon his or her street and people.

389
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,820
Are you done?

390
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,420
Yep.

391
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,020
The fact is,

392
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,620
you don't understand my father at all.

393
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,420
I believe my father

394
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,180
isn't a coward they said.

395
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,740
But escaping on his own was wrong.

396
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:10,780
Well,

397
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,220
you're the son of a noble general,

398
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,100
and I'm the daughter of a coward, right?

399
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,180
That's not what I meant, Xia Ling.

400
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,860
Oh, really?

401
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,580
Then what did you mean?

402
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,140
I'm really angry right now.

403
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:20,900
I need some time to calm down.

404
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,220
Xia Ling.

405
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:24,940
Leave me alone!

406
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,140
Excuse me,

407
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,420
are you Miss Xia Ling?

408
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,580
And you are?

409
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,420
My apologies

410
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,660
for the delayed greeting.

411
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,220
My name is Shen Yuanqing.

412
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
I'm the acting Spiritual Guardian

413
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,700
of Hanxian Street

414
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,380
and was once

415
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,260
General Xia Qifeng's subordinate.

416
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,340
My father's subordinate?

417
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,940
Is that true?

418
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,940
Xueling flower?

419
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,260
Just as General Xia said,

420
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:17,620
Miss Xia,

421
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,340
you do like Xueling flowers.

422
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,860
My father...

423
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:31,860
Miss Xia,

424
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,980
you might have heard

425
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,340
some negative rumors about General Xia,

426
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,420
but please,

427
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,300
don't believe the nonsense

428
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,740
from those Border Dwellers.

429
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,020
In my eyes,

430
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,140
General Xia is
the best Spiritual Guardian.

431
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,020
Thank you.

432
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:01,660
Forget it.

433
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,060
She was just being impulsive.

434
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,580
I should go apologize.

435
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,060
She's alone here

436
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,860
and not welcome.

437
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,140
I can't just leave her

438
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:08,740
by herself.

439
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,300
I did speak

440
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,660
a bit harshly earlier.

441
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,900
Xueling flowers are unique

442
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,860
to Hanxian Street.

443
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,580
General Xia gave them to you, didn't he?

444
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,220
But I haven't seen them in years.

445
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:24,780
Who are you?

446
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,500
Didn't I say

447
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,660
I needed some time to calm down?

448
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,380
Why are you here?

449
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,420
That's what you said,

450
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,140
not me.

451
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,900
You haven't replied

452
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,020
to my question.

453
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,020
Who are you?

454
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,420
This is General Shen,

455
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,060
the acting Spiritual Guardian here.

456
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,940
He just told me

457
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,700
that my father

458
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,700
was a great Spiritual Guardian,

459
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,420
not the coward

460
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,340
those Border Dwellers claimed.

461
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,620
You owe me an apology.

462
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,540
You're an acting Spiritual Guardian?

463
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,180
My name is Shen Yuanqing.

464
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,420
May I ask

465
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,380
who you are?

466
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,180
I'm her friend.

467
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,500
It's getting late.

468
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,340
Miss Xia,

469
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,340
why don't you come
with me back to my residence?

470
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,380
You've come to Hanxian Street,

471
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,300
and I must give you

472
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,100
a proper welcome.

473
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,460
No, no,

474
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,380
that would be too much trouble.

475
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:21,900
Thanks, anyway.

476
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,860
It's no trouble at all.

477
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,580
I live in Xueling Pavilion,

478
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,940
which was General Xia's

479
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,780
former residence.

480
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,460
It'll feel

481
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,540
just like home.

482
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,460
Xueling Pavilion?

483
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,180
I want to pay a visit.

484
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,220
Please, follow me.

485
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,540
You still haven't apologized to me.

486
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,700
Fine.

487
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,020
I'm sorry, then.

488
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,140
No "then" after your apology.

489
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,260
Fine, I'm sorry. No "then".

490
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,180
That's better, then.

491
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,400
[Tingxue Hall]

492
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,060
I toast to both of you.

493
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,780
Welcome home, Miss Xia.

494
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,220
Welcome to Hanxian Street,

495
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,220
Mr. Cao.

496
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,100
Thank you, General Shen,

497
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,980
for your warm hospitality.

498
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,300
Miss Xia, you're

499
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,700
as good a drinker as your father.

500
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,620
You're both impressive.

501
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:19,780
Thank you.

502
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,540
General Shen, I heard

503
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,460
you were General Xia's subordinate,

504
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,780
but after all this time

505
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,020
with him gone,

506
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,380
do you feel

507
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,060
more worry,

508
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,540
resentment,

509
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,620
or relief?

510
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,140
Cao Yanbing,

511
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,060
stop it.

512
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,060
You think that way

513
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,300
because you don't know

514
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,780
my bond with General Xia.

515
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,140
I admired

516
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,700
every word and action

517
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,540
of his back in the days.

518
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,860
I was alone then

519
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,460
and lost on Hanxian Street.

520
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,140
Unable to use Primordial Spirit Power,

521
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,140
I was nearly devoured
by Malevolent Beings.

522
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,860
General Xia saved me,

523
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,460
took me to his residence,

524
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,220
and nursed me back to health.

525
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,060
You're awake?

526
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,260
How are you feeling?

527
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,620
When General Xia learned I was homeless,

528
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,700
he suggested I stay and help him.

529
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,740
From then on,

530
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,620
I became his subordinate.

531
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,060
I trained hard

532
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,740
and fought Malevolent Beings
for Hanxian Street.

533
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,020
Mom!

534
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,380
Mom!

535
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:45,620
Mom!

536
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,620
Mom...

537
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:49,860
Mom...

538
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,220
Mom, don't leave me!

539
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,020
Mom!

540
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,980
Mom!

541
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,140
Mom...

542
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,500
Don't be sad.

543
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,980
Your mother is at peace now.

544
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:12,980
No.

545
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,540
It's all your fault!

546
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
It's all your fault!

547
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,820
What did you say?

548
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,300
It's all your fault.

549
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,460
Since you were going to save me,

550
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,620
why didn't you come sooner?

551
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,260
Why couldn't you?

552
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,460
Why?

553
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,580
Why?

554
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,940
Calm down.

555
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,500
If you harbor resentment inside,

556
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,300
you'll turn into

557
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,500
a Malevolent Being.

558
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,300
He's already a Malevolent Being.

559
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,540
We should kill him now.

560
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,940
Look at his eyes.

561
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,540
There might still be hope.

562
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,300
I'll try using the Xia Family's
Soul-Resonance Spell.

563
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,300
Why are you doing this?

564
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,940
As long as he hasn't completely turned,

565
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,700
he's under our protection.

566
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,740
In the boundless nether world,

567
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,780
amidst the layers of Vajra mountains,

568
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,820
the boundless light of the sacred jewel,

569
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,060
pierces through the flames of torment.

570
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,140
Sins bound to the nether realms,

571
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,100
enshrouded by the clouds of incense.

572
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,300
Upon the lotus of serenity and wisdom,

573
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,500
the divine spirit ascends
to eternal peace.

574
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,820
He's beyond saving.

575
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,580
Just give up.

576
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,580
In the boundless nether world,

577
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,620
amidst the layers of Vajra mountains,

578
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,740
the boundless light of the sacred jewel,

579
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,940
pierces through the flames of torment.

580
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,100
Sins bound to the nether realms,

581
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,460
enshrouded by the clouds of incense.

582
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,700
Upon the lotus of serenity and wisdom,

583
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,940
the divine spirit ascends
to eternal peace.

584
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,460
General.

585
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,620
General,

586
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,780
this is the fifth time this year.

587
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,820
It's just a minor wound.

588
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,740
As a Spirit-hosted Human,

589
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,740
getting hurt is to be expected.

590
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,300
I'm not talking about the injury.

591
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,220
It's that you're once again stuck

592
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,580
dealing with Malevolent Beings

593
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,820
and was unable to see your daughter.

594
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,060
Oh, you're talking about that.

595
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,780
As much as you long for your daughter,

596
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,620
you keep getting entangled
in the Border Dwellers' issues.

597
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,260
Is it worth it?

598
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,220
Spiritual Guardians

599
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,300
have their responsibilities.

600
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,260
Protecting the Border Dwellers

601
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,340
on Hanxian Street is my duty.

602
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,980
How could you say I get entangled?

603
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,060
My bad, General.

604
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,220
Please forgive me.

605
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,620
You're right.

606
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,260
I do miss Ling,

607
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,820
but the Border Dwellers here

608
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,300
are also my family and friends.

609
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,140
I grew up

610
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,220
on Hanxian Street.

611
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,740
If my negligence
caused the Border Dwellers

612
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,580
to be devoured by or turn into

613
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,660
Malevolent Beings,

614
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,420
I could never forgive myself.

615
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,340
I guess

616
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,820
I'm not a good father.

617
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,940
I've let my daughter down.

618
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,660
General Xia,

619
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,220
don't say that.

620
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,500
Let's skip this topic.

621
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,860
If I ever

622
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,380
find someone

623
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,580
more reliable

624
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,060
to entrust with Hanxian Street,

625
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,060
I'll return to the Human Realm

626
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,220
and spend every day with my daughter.

627
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,500
I'll leave the Border Dwellers

628
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,460
and Malevolent Beings behind for good.

629
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,820
General Xia gave all the time

630
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,140
he should have spent with Miss Xia

631
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,700
to Hanxian Street.

632
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,380
That's why I say the Border Dwellers

633
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,220
have no right

634
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,340
to criticize him.

635
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,140
In my heart,

636
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,540
General Xia is
the best Spiritual Guardian.

637
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,660
I mean that.

638
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,100
General Shen,

639
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,620
thank you for telling me all this.

640
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,740
If it weren't for you,

641
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,300
I wouldn't have known this side

642
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,220
of my father.

643
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,860
If you don't mind,

644
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,820
please just call me Xia Ling.

645
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,140
Alright,

646
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,700
Xia Ling.

647
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,540
If it's alright with you,

648
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,780
you can call me Yuanqing.

649
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,220
Yuanqing.

650
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,660
You've barely known each other,

651
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,700
and you two are getting quite close.

652
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,420
General Shen,

653
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,500
you've said so much,

654
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,940
but I still haven't heard

655
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,020
a clear explanation

656
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,220
about General Xia

657
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,100
abandoning Hanxian Street.

658
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,900
Is it true,

659
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,180
or are the Border Dwellers

660
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:40,940
just spreading rumors?

661
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,180
All I can say

662
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,420
is that General Xia

663
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,060
must have had his reasons.

664
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,500
I've been guarding here

665
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,860
for ten years

666
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,660
because I believe

667
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,460
that one day,

668
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,300
General Xia will return.

669
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,380
Stop being hypocritical.

670
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,740
Why do you say that, Mr. Cao?

671
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,700
Don't you know

672
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,900
that General Xia
has already passed away?

673
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,220
What did you say?

674
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,500
Drop your act.

675
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,900
If you didn't know

676
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,180
that General Xia had died,

677
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,940
the first thing you would have done

678
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,980
when you saw Xia Ling

679
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,940
was to ask about his whereabouts,

680
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,780
instead of talking about him

681
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,700
like mourning a deceased until now.

682
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,580
So, tell me,

683
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,100
does his death

684
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,460
have anything to do with you?

685
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,340
Did you steal the General's Chain?

686
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,620
General Xia...

687
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,380
He's dead?

688
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,100
What was going on?

689
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,540
Stop pretending, okay?

690
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,660
Cao Yanbing,

691
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,020
don't jump to conclusions

692
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,900
before we know the whole story.

693
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,380
Yuanqing,

694
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,140
my father passed away

695
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,220
ten years ago,

696
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,460
but recently,

697
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,700
his grave was robbed,

698
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,500
and the General's Chain was stolen.

699
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,420
I came here

700
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,860
to find the General's Chain

701
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,180
and figure out what happened.

702
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,620
General Xia...

703
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,740
I can't believe it...

704
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,300
No wonder...

705
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,660
No wonder he hasn't returned
for ten years.

706
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,740
Don't be too sad.

707
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,300
After all, my father's death

708
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,580
was a long time ago.

709
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,500
Xia Ling,

710
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,580
don't worry.

711
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,140
Anything related to General Xia

712
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,740
is my responsibility.

713
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,420
Feel free to stay here.

714
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,820
I will get to the bottom

715
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,900
of the General's Chain.

716
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,260
Thank you, Yuanqing.

717
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,420
If you need our help, just let us know.

718
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,140
Mr. Cao.

719
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,660
It seems Mr. Cao still has

720
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,420
some misconceptions

721
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,500
about me.

722
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:12,820
Yuanqing,

723
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,060
let's talk about my dad.

724
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,620
Do you have any stories about him?

725
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,540
Sure.

726
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,380
Xueling flowers.

727
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,740
General Xia planted these back then.

728
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,820
They've just bloomed now.

729
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,220
Seems like they knew you were coming.

730
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,580
General Xia

731
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,820
lived in this room.

732
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,260
He took good care

733
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,980
of this Xueling tree every day,

734
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,820
which is why it's so lush now.

735
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,180
He used to say

736
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,380
both your names

737
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,460
contain

738
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,900
a "ling".

739
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:18,820
Even though he couldn't

740
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,180
accompany you as much as possible,

741
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,580
just looking at these flowers

742
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,820
made him feel like

743
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,700
you were with him.

744
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,380
So,

745
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,700
it wasn't just me
missing my dad back then.

746
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,060

771
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,180
After your father left Hanxian Street,

772
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,940
do you think
Shen Yuanqing had the patience

773
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,300
to nurture these delicate flowers

774
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,540
for a decade,

775
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,820
making them

776
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,940
flourish so?

777
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,860
You don't need to think hard

778
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,780
to realize he must have

779
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,220
transplanted them here recently

780
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,540
to fool you.

781
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,500
Mind your language.

782
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,140
I think Yuanqing is very kind.

783
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,620
He's been nothing but hospitable

784
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,460
and even agreed to help us

785
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,420
investigate the General's Chain.

786
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,060
You're just being overly suspicious.

787
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,340
If I weren't suspicious,

788
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,780
I'd be dead by now.

789
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,500
Helping us investigate

790
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,900
is just a disguise.

791
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,140
He's just

792
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,540
buying time.

793
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,460
I think he's up to something.

794
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,660
Shut your mouth!

795
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,780
Even if the flowers were transplanted,

796
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,460
so what?

797
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,700
It just shows

798
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,420
Yuanqing cares about my father

799
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,780
and genuinely wants to make me happy.

800
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,100
If he truly cared about you,

801
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,140
why did he put me

802
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,300
in a guest room so far away

803
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:18,940
and leave you alone

804
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,620
in this courtyard?

805
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,300
He's up to no good.

806
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,780
He deliberately kept me away

807
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,420
to make a move on you.

808
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,260
This was your father's bedroom, right?

809
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,340
I need to check it out inside.

810
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:28,780
No way.

811
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,820
This was my dad's room,

812
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,180
and now it's mine.

813
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,140
I won't let you mess around.

814
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,060
I'm going to sleep.

815
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,260
I...

816
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:37,660
Goodnight.

817
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,860
Goodnight, huh?

818
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,060
You ungrateful fool.

819
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,460
Unbelievable.

820
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,900
I've warned her so many times,

821
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,300
but she's still so gullible.

822
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,500
She needs

823
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,180
to learn the hard way.

824
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,540
Remember,

825
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,860
you owe me one for this.

826
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,060
General, why are you so angry?

827
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,420
Could it be...

828
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,980
we didn't succeed?

829
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,140
He was

830
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,660
shut out,

831
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,780
yet he still won't leave.

832
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,140
We've underestimated

833
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,740
Cao Yanbing.

834
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:52,660
General,

835
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,660
do you need me

836
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,420
to distract him now?

837
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,140
We can't make any bold moves tonight.

838
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,060
We need to come up with another plan.

839
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,380
Zheng,

840
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,660
how's the construction
of the Altar Platform?

841
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,780
It's going smoothly.

842
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,860
It should be completed in a few days.

843
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,180
So

844
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,860
it will be ready.

845
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,900
It's the will of Heaven.

846
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,100
Xia Ling,

847
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,260
your good luck

848
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,860
will come to an end today.
