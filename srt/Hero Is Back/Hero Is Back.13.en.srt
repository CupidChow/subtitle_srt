[Episode 13]

18
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,580
In fact, our clan has had

19
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,500
a long-standing rule:

20
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,820
anyone who wishes to enter

21
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,740
the Luhua Ancient Tower

22
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,820
must first undergo a trial

23
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,900
set by our ancestors.

24
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,820
Only those who pass the trial

25
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:49,980
are qualified

26
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,020
to enter the tower led by a guide.

27
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,460
All right. I will participate.

28
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,340
- Me too.
- Me too.

29
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,780
Mother, please have some tea.

30
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,420
Mother,

31
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,460
why did you mention

32
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,540
the trial to them today?

33
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,780
You know

34
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,820
that I'm not the guide.

35
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,180
What if they pass the trial

36
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,380
but I can't lead them?

37
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,380
How

38
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,860
will this end?

39
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,540
You don't need

40
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,820
to get involved in this.

41
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,820
I know how to handle it.

42
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,660
But the trial is incredibly dangerous.

43
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,100
What if someone among them

44
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,220
dies inside?

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,860
Wouldn't that just send them to die?

46
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,060
Are you feeling sorry for them?

47
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,900
I'm not.

48
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,340
I don't feel sorry for them.

49
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,180
I'm just

50
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,140
laying out the facts.

51
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,740
Whatever you're doing, I don't care.

52
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,060
But let me say this again:

53
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,260
What Cao Yanbing did today

54
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,900
has already proven

55
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,820
that he's very likely to do something

56
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,300
that would harm

57
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,500
our Lingfeng Street
and the Wind-Treading Clan

58
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,620
for the sake of getting the guide.

59
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,820
To me,

60
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,340
there's no difference

61
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,220
between him and the Fire-Eater King.

62
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,060
You must remember this.

63
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,220
Besides,

64
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,140
I didn't lie to them.

65
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,780
If they want to enter the Ancient Tower,

66
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,060
they must go through the trial.

67
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,860
Whether we have a guide or not,

68
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,100
this is a test

69
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,180
they have to face.

70
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,820
Got it?

71
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,740
You'll be in charge

of tomorrow's trial,

73
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,300
so start preparing.

74
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,100
Yes, Mother.

75
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,860
What Cao Yanbing did today

76
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,140

77
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,740
that he's very likely to do something

78
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,020

our Lingfeng Street
and the Wind-Treading Clan

80
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,140
for the sake of getting the guide.

81
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,980
Don't worry, I've got this.

82
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,940
I genuinely care about you,

83
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,300
but you say it's all phony.

84
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,260
Have you considered

85
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,500
that if we hadn't come here,

86
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,100
you wouldn't even be sitting here?

87
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,860
Do you really have nothing better to do?

88
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,620
I do.

89
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,100
I came specifically to apologize to you.

90
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,900
I was too harsh yesterday.

91
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,820
I hope you can forgive me.

92
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,860
Spare me the flattery.

93
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,740
Since you've accepted the trial,

94
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,060
rely on your own abilities.

95
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:57,980
Rest assured,

96
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,940
since we've agreed to this,

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,180
we'll definitely get it done.

98
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,860
But

99
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,540
when the time comes, we'll need you

100
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,420
to forgive us

101
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,180
and lead the way.

102
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,940
Do we have a deal?

103
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,100
What's this?

104
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,620
A high-five to seal the deal?

105
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,540
How old are you?

106
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,500
Wait.

107
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,740
Did I ever tell you the reason

108
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,740
I must enter the Ancient Tower

109
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,540
is that my mother is inside?

110
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,540
Ten years ago,

111
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,300
she was among those

112
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,780
who entered the tower.

113
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,420
So no matter how dangerous

114
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,420
the Ancient Tower is,

115
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,820
I have to go in

116
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,740
and rescue her.

117
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,180
You understand

118
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,180
how I feel, right?

119
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,100
Please promise me

120
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,860
that if we pass the trial,

121
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,060
you will definitely guide us.

122
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:03,780
Is that okay?

123
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,860
Just because my mother agreed

124
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,140
doesn't mean I will.

125
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,460
Let me make this clear.

126
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,540
Even if you pass the trial,

127
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,100
I will not guide you.

128
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,020
Save your energy

129
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,900
and go back

130
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,540
to where you belong.

131
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,460
Beiluo.

132
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:39,780
Xia Ling.

133
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,060
I told you to apologize to Yan Ruofu.

134
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:42,740
How did it go?

135
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,660
Her attitude

136
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,540
was extremely hostile.

137
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,380
Not only did it not improve,

138
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,500
but it actually got worse.

139
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,060
What's wrong with her?

140
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,260
How did she grow up

141
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:49,940
to be so unyielding

142
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,700
and deaf to all reasoning?

143
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,620
That sounds like you.

144
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,740
Rather than dealing with this now,

145
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,100
it's better to talk about it

146
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,660
after the trial.

147
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,620
There might be something

148
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,380
we're missing.

149
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,980
Actually, we don't need to wait
until the trial ends.

150
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,860
She's scheduled a duel with me today.

151
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,860
After the duel,

152
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,700
I'll have a chat with her.

153
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,860
Why not deliberately lose to her

154
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,740
and do her a favor?

155
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,500
No way!

156
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,780
I have my pride, you know?

157
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,180
Why are you acting like this?

158
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,540
Why is she also...

159
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:14,740
Beiluo,

160
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,260
she asked me

161
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,100
to build a good rapport with her.

162
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,780
Why the double standards?

163
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,300
Building a good relationship on purpose

164
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,140
and deliberately losing

165
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,900
are two different things.

166
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,260
I need to go now.

167
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:27,660
Beiluo,

168
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,020
where are you going?

169
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,620
Let me tag along.

170
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,020
This is the place.

171
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,100
Sir,

172
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,180
two jugs of liquor, please.

173
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,780
Coming right up.

174
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,260
Here's your drink, sir.

175
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,660
Thank you.

176
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,340
Please wait.

177
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,820
You must know

178
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,100
General Yan Tianyue,

179
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,020
right?

180
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,980
When did he last come here

181
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,780
to buy some liquor?

182
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,620
I'm a friend of his.

183
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,540
He used to bring me here

184
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,260
for drinks.

185
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,540
He even taught me

186
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,980
to enjoy flower cakes with liquor

187
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,820
and said that only your liquor

188
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,940
suited his taste the best.

189
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,060
The former General Yan

190
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,700
hasn't been around for years.

191
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,100
I heard he fell seriously ill

192
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,340
and could barely get out of bed.

193
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,900
Otherwise,
he wouldn't have handed things over

194
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,260
to General Lingyu.

195
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,540
Speaking of General Lingyu,

196
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,980
she's truly remarkable.

197
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,460
In recent years,
she's established a new team of guards,

198
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,620
developed Blaze Jade,

199
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,620
and revitalized the entire street.

200
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,020
We've made money

201
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,060
and are no longer afraid
of Malevolent Beings.

202
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,100
It's something

203
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,180
we wouldn't even have dreamed of before.

204
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,660
General Tianyue

205
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,260
should feel relieved now.

206
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,580
Enjoy your drink, gentlemen.

207
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,540
Thank you.

208
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,580
It seems that Tianyue is indeed ill.

209
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:55,980
Beiluo,

210
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,020
who is this Yan Tianyue

211
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,860
you're talking about?

212
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,820
Is he quite formidable?

213
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,540
You might not know this,

214
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,900
but I previously asked Yan Lingyu

215
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,780
to arrange a meeting with Tianyue.

216
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,220
However,

217
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,420
her words and the way she acted

218
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,620
suggested that she didn't want me
to meet him.

219
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,420
I sensed something was off,

220
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,100
so I came to investigate.

221
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,340
As for Tianyue himself,

222
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,980
he isn't formidable at all.

223
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,540
In fact, he's the least capable
Spiritual Guardian

224
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,900
I've ever encountered.

225
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,180
His taste is quite peculiar too.

226
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,860
He likes
to pair flower cakes with liquor.

227
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,740
Although I've only tried it once,

228
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,340
I can guarantee

229
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,460
that he's the only person

230
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,060
who enjoys that combination

231
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,180
in the world.

232
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,180
That person doesn't sound

233
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,780
like someone who could be friends

234
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,820
with you.

235
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,940
Have you ever known someone

236
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,700
who, despite their lack of power,

237
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,900
is willing to risk everything
to protect a place?

238
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
He is that kind of person.

239
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,580
So,

240
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,340
don't belittle

241
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,180
Yan Ruofu.

242
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,500
Her dedication to Lingfeng Street

243
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,420
is certainly no less

244
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,940
than your devotion to Rakshasa Street.

245
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,380
What's going on?

246
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,380
Is Yan Ruofu truly

247
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,500
as unreasonable as she seemed?

248
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,340
Or did I get it wrong last night?

249
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,580
Excuse me,

250
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,980
is anyone down there?

251
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,220
Let's begin.

252
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,540
I won't go easy on you.

253
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,620
Same.

254
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,300
Wait.

255
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,020
Just admit defeat.

256
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,980
Do you know why I won?

257
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,060
It's because I saw
you training yesterday.

258
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,700
So what?

259
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:04,780
So, I gave it my all

260
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,900
and trained diligently

261
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,300
throughout the night.

262
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,460
Ruofu,

263
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:10,940
I admit

264
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,860
that my previous care for you

265
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,700
was partly

266
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,980
due to you being the guide.

267
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,180
But from last night until now,

268
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,740
I see you as more than just a guide,

269
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,060
I see you

270
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,300
as a genuine opponent.

271
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,220
Enough with the sweet talk.

272
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,820
You can't possibly understand

273
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,780
the feeling
of never being taken seriously

274
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,060
and never receiving recognition,

275
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,740
no matter how hard you try.

276
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,820
I do understand.

277
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,300
I guess

278
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,980
I can share it with you.

279
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:47,900
Fine,

280
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:48,980
tell me then.

281
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,900
I'm curious to hear
what you have to say.

282
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,020
In the Human Realm,

283
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,100
I was just

284
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,500
an ordinary college student

285
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,220
majoring in architecture.

286
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,580
In my field,

287
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,180
I had to work very hard
and be extra diligent

288
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,900
to be considered on par with men.

289
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,500
When I first started my internship,

290
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,900
I

291
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,780
was mostly given

292
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,220
the least technical tasks.

293
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,460
My supervisor thought

294
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,340
women couldn't endure hardship

295
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,100
and suggested
I should just go home and get married.

296
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,860
Even after I came
to Spiritual Crossroads,

297
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,020
things didn't change much.

298
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,620
Although I have
a Guardian Primordial Spirit,

299
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,100
my own power is very weak

300
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,060
compared to Cao Yanbing and the others.

301
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,020
Cao Yanbing

302
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,180
also saw me as a burden

303
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,740
and didn't want to bring me along.

304
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,620
This is outrageous.

305
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,380
How can they be like this?

306
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,060
But now, as you can see,

307
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,180
we can become

308
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,340
teammates fighting side by side.

309
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,860
Everyone has their own strengths.

310
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,700
I know I have my flaws

311
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,940
and am open to accepting

312
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,860
their help.

313
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,580
They too have their weaknesses

314
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,300
and are willing to accept my assistance.

315
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,780
I don't think anyone is truly strong

316
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,140
in this world.

317
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,980
To become stronger,

318
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,180
one must face their weaknesses

319
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,340
and accept themselves.

320
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,980
So,

321
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,580
let me help with the issue

322
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,900
of your Guardian Primordial Spirit.

323
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,220
Do you

324
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,020
really have a solution?

325
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,620
Solutions come from people.

326
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,540
Let's work on it together.

327
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,620
So, you've never summoned

328
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,260
a Guardian Primordial Spirit?

329
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:40,860
Yes,

330
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,780
and it's precisely because of this

331
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,420
that I have never gained my mother's

332
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,300
and the clan's trust and approval.

333
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,660
Li Xuanyuan.

334
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:53,860
Master,

335
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,780
how may I be of service to you?

336
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,980
Here's the thing.

337
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,620
I'd like to ask you a question.

338
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,100
Is there any way

339
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,340
for a Spirit-hosted Human

340
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,060
to summon a Guardian Primordial Spirit

341
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,020
they've never met before?

342
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:07,900
Well,

343
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,340
you usually need to identify

344
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,460
what kind
of Guardian Primordial Spirit it is.

345
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,940
They are classified

346
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,260
into humans, demons, gods, and beasts,

347
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,140
which are different Warrior Forms.

348
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,420
And each category has a distinct way

349
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,140
of summoning.

350
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:16,980
If you don't know

351
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,180
the category,

352
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,300
it's hard to use the right method.

353
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,780
So,

354
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,780
is there any universal method,

355
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,140
something simple and straightforward?

356
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:30,780
When

357
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,220
the Spirit-hosted Human

358
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,460
is in serious danger,

359
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,420
the Guardian Primordial Spirit probably

360
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,340
will be triggered to protect them.

361
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,700
Yes, that's right.

362
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,900
At that time,

363
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,180
you were trapped inside my body,

364
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,060
which

365
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,860
was how I summoned you.

366
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,460
I was crossing the street that day

367
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,700
when a car suddenly came rushing at me.

368
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,500
I thought I was done for,

369
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,020
but then you appeared out of nowhere

370
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,220
and flipped the car over.

371
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,300
This is actually

372
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:53,980
a special case.

373
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,340
Normally, I wouldn't recommend

374
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,300
using this method,

375
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,860
as it can be very dangerous

376
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:58,980
if it fails.

377
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,180
Ruofu!

378
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,700
Li Xuanyuan, save her!

379
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,940
Ruofu?

380
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,540
Ruofu.

381
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,420
Let me check on you.

382
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,600
[Zhuoying]

383
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,100
Is this

384
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,860
your Guardian Primordial Spirit?

385
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,580
Yes,

386
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,620
I'm certain it's the one.

387
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,460
nearly lost my life.

388
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,340
to hit the ground,

389
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,020
and nearly lost my life.

390
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,060
Then, suddenly, my body felt lighter,

391
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,420
and before I figured it out,

392
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,900
wings had appeared on my back.

393
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,020
That's great!

394
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,260
It's wonderful!

395
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,020
You've made it!

396
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,740
You did it!

397
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,100
The divine beast Zhuoying

398
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,780
is a rather rare

399
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,420
Guardian Primordial Spirit.

400
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,780
You know her Guardian Primordial Spirit?

401
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,980
Her Guardian Primordial Spirit
is called Zhuoying,

402
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,580
a very rare divine beast.

403
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,300
According to ancient records,

404
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,220
it prefers solitude and avoids conflict.

405
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,100
It usually hides in the mountains

406
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,500
and sleeps for long periods.

407
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,260
Its feathers are extremely precious

408
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,260
and can be used to paint dreams,

409
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:28,980
but

410
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,340
it lacks combat ability.

411
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,140
Ruofu,

412
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,220
are you all right?

413
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:04,860
No worries.

414
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,260
I'll stay here for a bit

415
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,660
and then go back.

416
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,180
Are you hungry?

417
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,620
Do you have anything you want to eat?

418
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,940
You didn't try out everything last time.

419
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,780
Well,

420
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,340
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

421
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,140
What is it?

422
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,500
Is it okay?

423
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,020
Are you

424
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,340
sure?

425
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,620
Please help me.

426
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,620
All right,

427
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,060
but just so you know,

428
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,660
this is my first time painting it.

429
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,900
If it doesn't turn out well,

430
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,860
you can't blame me.

431
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,380
How could I ever blame you?

432
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:52,980
I promise I won't.

433
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:54,940
Okay, then.

434
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,300
Zhuoying.

435
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:23,860
Xia Ling.

436
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:24,820
Xia Ling.

437
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:25,860
Xia Ling.

438
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,220
Are you all right?

439
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,940
I'm more than all right!

440
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,860
Ruofu,

441
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,300
you're my goddess.

442
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,300
Is this really your first time painting?

443
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,700
Ouch.

444
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,060
This is amazing.

445
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,540
It's exactly how I imagined it!

446
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,220
Calm down.

447
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,220
I'll calm down.

448
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,540
Ruofu,

449
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,140
from this moment on,

450
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,260
I officially declare

451
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,620
that your Guardian Primordial Spirit

452
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,260
is the most awesome

453
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:52,940
in all of Spiritual Crossroads.

454
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,140
What's so great about it?

455
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,900
It's pretty much useless.

456
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,340
I'm serious.

457
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,180
Other Guardian Primordial Spirits
only know how to fight,

458
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,380
but yours

459
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:06,860
is different.

460
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,820
It can make dreams

461
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,060
come true.

462
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,020
It's practically a living saint

463
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,260
of the Spiritual Crossroads.

464
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:16,900
Thank you.

465
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:19,940
What did you say?

466
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,460
Nothing.

467
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,420
I mean,

468
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,900
aside from a dream
like the one just now,

469
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,340
do you have any other dreams

470
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,820
you want to make come true?

471
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,820
If possible,

472
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,140
I want

473
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,700
to see my dad again.

474
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,020
He already passed away.

475
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,740
When I was little,

476
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,540
he was always busy,

477
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,860
so I rarely got to see him.

478
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,540
The last time I saw him

479
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,020
was over ten years ago.

480
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,940
Later, I found out

481
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,740
he was actually a Spiritual Guardian.

482
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,740
While going through his belongings,

483
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,660
I discovered that just before he died,

484
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,860
he was investigating something

485
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,340
related to the Luhua Ancient Tower.

486
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,660
I believe his death
wasn't as simple as it seems.

487
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,420
So,

488
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:15,700
that's the reason

489
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,100
you want to enter
the Luhua Ancient Tower?

490
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,260
I must uncover

491
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,260
the truth

492
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,420
and let everyone know

493
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,860
that my dad was definitely not a coward.

494
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,860
But,

495
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,940
I mean if,

496
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,860
if you fail the trial,

497
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,140
there's a real chance
you could die in there.

498
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,460
It's okay.

499
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,260
Even if I can't make it by myself,

500
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,300
there's still Cao Yanbing

501
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:35,980
and Beiluo.

502
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,420
They'll definitely make it.

503
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,140
Speaking of which,

504
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,300
have you ever met

505
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,300
Cao Yanbing's mother?

506
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,420
About ten years ago,

507
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,660
she also visited Lingfeng Street.

508
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,340
His mother's name is Tang Xiaoxiao.

509
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,380
Tang Xiaoxiao?

510
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,220
Does that ring a bell?

511
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,700
At that time,

512
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,780
you should have been around ten or so.

513
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,540
No.

514
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,140
I don't really recall.

515
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,660
Fengzha.

516
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,740
[Yan Fengzha]

517
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,300
Auntie.

518
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,460
Are you training?

519
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,500
Auntie,

520
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,380
you used to come here
almost every night.

521
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,460
Why haven't you been around

522
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,420
these past few days?

523
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,340
Did something happen

524
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,100
in Lingfeng Street?

525
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,580
Tell me about it.

526
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,660
I've grown up

527
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,980
and can help brainstorm solutions.

528
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,340
What could possibly be wrong?

529
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,100
Here,

530
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,820
I've brought

531
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,060
all your favorite foods today.

532
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,060
Dig in.

533
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,460
Is it good?

534
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,100
By the way, Auntie,

535
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,340
have you heard any news about my sister?

536
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,260
Fengzha,

537
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,580
you've been asking about Qiao

538
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,980
every now and then.

539
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,940
You should know

540
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,020
she's been missing
for almost ten years now.

541
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,380
It's likely

542
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,380
the worst has happened.

543
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,300
No way, Auntie.

544
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,100
My sister is definitely still alive.

545
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,340
Back then,

546
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,060
she went missing

547
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,260
while guiding people
to the Ancient Tower.

548
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,620
What if she's been trapped there?

549
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,140
It's been ten years,

550
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,940
and the Ancient Tower
is about to reappear.

551
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,940
Maybe I'll get the chance

552
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:46,980
to rescue her.

553
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,820
What do you mean?

554
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,140
Auntie,

555
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,220
please let me out.

556
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,500
I am sure
I can bring my sister back safely.

557
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,140
No,

558
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,060
it's not the right time yet.

559
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,300
Then when will be the right time?

560
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,940
You said before

561
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,460
that I could leave

562
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,300
when I turned fifteen.

563
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,580
I'm all grown up now.

564
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,580
Fengzha,

565
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,260
as your father
is the Spiritual Guardian,

566
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,900
you are responsible

567
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,860
for Lingfeng Street.

568
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,820
I understand.

569
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,700
That's why I've been training diligently

570
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
every day,

571
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,300
hoping to control

572
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,180
the power inside me

573
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:18,940
as soon as possible.

574
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,420
I believe I can manage it now.

575
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,980
Every day,

576
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,140
I practice my breathing techniques
while facing the mountaintop,

577
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,260
and my voice reaches very far.

578
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,060
Your voice reaches very far?

579
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,460
Has anyone noticed you?

580
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,340
I...

581
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,500
Fengzha,

582
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,780
be honest with me.

583
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:35,820
Today,

584
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,780
a girl was shouting
from the mountaintop.

585
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,180
I shouted back,

586
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,820
and it seemed she heard me

587
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,220
because she responded.

588
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,140
Responded?

589
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,540
That means
you've already been discovered.

590
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,380
Don't worry, Auntie.

591
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,780
I only responded to her once.

592
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:51,780
When she asked

593
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,540
whether there was anyone down there,

594
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,340
I just ignored her.

595
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,620
Girl?

596
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,300
Fengzha,

597
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,380
how well can you control
your Primordial Spirit Power now?

598
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,660
If you leave this cave

599
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,420
guarded by the Spirit-Locking Stone,

600
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,500
how long can you maintain control
over your Primordial Spirit Power?

601
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,540
About three days.

602
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,020
That will do.

603
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,380
Hurry up and pack your things.

604
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,540
We need to leave immediately.

605
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,740
Why are we leaving so suddenly?

606
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,300
Is it because of the girl?

607
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,540
Auntie, I assure you,

608
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,020
she hasn't discovered me.

609
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,540
No,

610
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,900
we can't take any chances.

611
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,580
Especially in these few days,

612
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,940
we must be extremely careful.

613
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:24,860
What's happening recently?

614
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,860
Has something happened
on Lingfeng Street?

615
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:29,900
Stop asking questions

616
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,900
and pack up quickly.

617
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,820
We'll talk while we move.

618
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,260
Fengzha,

619
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,620
stay here

620
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,220
for the next few days.

621
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,620
I will come to get you

622
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,140
as soon as I've dealt

623
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,500
with those three people.

624
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:46,660
Got it.

625
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,700
You mentioned on the way

626
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,380
that the Luhua Ancient Tower
will reappear soon,

627
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,620
and three bad people

628
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:53,620
want to find me

629
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,420
and make me their guide.

630
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,380
Let them dream on.

631
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:58,500
Auntie,

632
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,100
just let me go out.

633
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,540
I'll help you teach them a lesson.

634
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,060
No,

635
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,580
I've already told you.

636
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,340
They've come to find the guide.

637
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,140
If you go out now,

638
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,260
it will only make it easier for them.

639
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,540
They are very formidable.

640
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,460
If they succeed in taking you,

641
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,100
how will I explain it to your father?

642
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:15,940
You know

643
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,100
how much he and I

644
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,220
expect from you.

645
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,620
We hope that one day

646
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,180
you'll completely master

647
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,220
that beast's power,

648
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,420
step up

649
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,780
to protect Lingfeng Street,

650
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,500
and change its fate.

651
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,100
Got it, Auntie.

652
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,500
I won't go out.

653
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,420
By the way, Auntie,

654
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,020
Feilian
is my Guardian Primordial Spirit.

655
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,980
Could you refrain

656
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,780
from calling it a 'beast'?

657
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,060
Also,

658
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,380
where is it being locked up?

659
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,620
How is it?

660
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,700
I want to meet it.

661
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,180
With my current abilities,

662
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,540
I think I can control it.

663
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,980
I'd like to give it a try.

664
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,700
Are you really confident

665
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,660
that you can control it?

666
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,100
Well,

667
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,900
it should be fine

668
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,700
to give it a try, shouldn't it?

669
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,140
Don't worry.

670
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,660
Feilian is well.

671
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,180
When you

672
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,380
are truly confident

673
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,540
in controlling

674
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,300
Feilian,

675
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,300
I will take you to see it.

676
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,580
- But...
- All right now.

677
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,060
Just stay here for now

678
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,580
and don't worry about anything else.

679
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,380
Be good.

680
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,540
I'll leave now.

681
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,540
Take good care of yourself,

682
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,020
and I'll come to pick you up
in a couple of days.

683
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:42,900
Okay.

684
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,860
Come and catch me!

685
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,220
Come and catch me!

686
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:25,940
I'll eat you up.

687
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,820
You're just two paper tigers.

688
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,260
Come and get me!

689
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:30,860
Come on!

690
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,820
Slow down.

691
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:33,820
Ming.

692
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,500
Slow down.

693
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,700
I'm coming!

694
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,020
Be careful.

695
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,100
I'm about to catch up with you.

696
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,020
Block him.

697
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,780
Paper tiger, come and get me.

698
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,900
Let's head back.

699
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,820
The rain is getting heavier.

700
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,620
I want to play a little longer.

701
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,220
You'll catch a cold if staying out here.

702
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:51,700
Okay, then.

703
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,620
Why are we going back already?

704
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,860
We can keep playing once we are home.

705
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,460
I'll eat you up!

706
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,620
Be careful, children.

707
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,620
It's me who will eat you up.

708
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,900
Slow down,

709
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,260
so you don't trip.

710
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,050
[Assembly Hall]

711
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,300
Mother.

712
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,140
How's your preparation going

713
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,900
for tomorrow's trial?

714
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,980
I've already retrieved

715
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,220
the ancestral scroll.

716
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,300
Mother,

717
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,180
can I discuss

718
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,340
something with you?

719
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:48,500
Go ahead.

720
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,580
Can we cancel

721
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,060
the trial tomorrow?

722
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,340
Why?

723
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,620
Mother,

724
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:01,940
I don't understand

725
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,820
why we can't tell Cao Yanbing

726
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,060
and the others the truth.

727
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,620
We should let them know

728
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,780
that there is currently no guide left
in Lingfeng Street.

729
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,940
I believe Cao Yanbing and his friends

730
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,260
are different from the Fire-Eater King

731
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,780
and might not cause us trouble.

732
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,740
Why should we make them

733
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,820
risk their lives

734
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,100
for some trials?

735
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,380
They might not cause us trouble?

736
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,620
On what basis do you say that?

737
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,100
Because their motive for entering

738
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,900
the Ancient Tower isn't selfish,

739
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,700
it's for their loved ones,

740
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,660
particularly Cao Yanbing.

741
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,300
This time, Cao Yanbing
is entering the Ancient Tower

742
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,260
to search for his mother,

743
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,140
Tang Xiaoxiao.

744
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,220
Tang Xiaoxiao once saved me

745
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,380
and other members
of the Wind-Treading Clan

746
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,980
from the hands of Malevolent Beings.

747
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:37,700
So?

748
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:39,660
Is that important?

749
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,940
Is that not important?

750
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,060
Mother,

751
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,020
ten years ago, Tang Xiaoxiao saved me

752
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,420
and also helped us in Lingfeng Street.

753
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,020
It's something you might forget,

754
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:51,820
but never can I.

755
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,700
Of course,

756
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,340
I remember this matter.

757
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,940
Ten years ago,

758
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,700
the Wind-Treading Clan

759
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,420
was attacked

760
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,260
by several high-level Malevolent Beings.

761
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,620
Back then,

762
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,780
our members were no match for them,

763
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,020
and it was Tang Xiaoxiao and her group

764
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,860
who saved us.

765
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,460
If you know all this,

766
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,380
why make things difficult for her son?

767
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,700
The Wind-Treading Clan

768
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,060
has always been weak,

769
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,300
so we must act with caution.

770
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,540
I remember

771
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,220
not only the invasion ten years ago

772
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,540
but also

773
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,460
every invasion,

774
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,820
especially the one five years ago

775
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,900
when our clan

776
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,820
nearly faced extinction.

777
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,060
The reason I am doing this today

778
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,340
is to prevent us

779
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,340
from repeating those past mistakes.

780
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,820
Mother.

781
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:10,860
I...

782
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:14,620
Kneel.

783
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,380
I told you to kneel.

784
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,820
Why?

785
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,460
What did I do wrong?

786
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,060
Do you really need

787
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,020
to ask me about this?

788
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,100
It was precisely because Tang Xiaoxiao

789
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,740
helped us back then

790
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,500
that your uncle sent Qiao

791
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,780
to guide their group.

792
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:28,780
But what happened?

793
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,580
Qiao never returned.

794
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,140
We have already repaid our debt

795
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,740
to Tang Xiaoxiao long ago.

796
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,380
Her son has nothing to do with me.

797
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,260
And you,

798
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,460
so confused and indecisive,

799
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,940
have been completely swayed

800
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,020
by a few flattering words

801
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,620
from some outsiders.

802
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,940
What about the safety
of our entire clan?

803
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,020
Can you truly bear

804
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,260
the title of Young General?

805
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:52,940
Mother,

806
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,100
you're right.

807
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,260
I was indeed confused

808
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,300
and didn't prioritize the safety

809
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,220
of the entire clan.

810
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,700
But I'm not entirely clueless.

811
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,020
At least I know

812
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:02,900
that Cao Yanbing and the others

813
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,060
have just helped us.

814
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,140
That's a fact.

815
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,060
However, if you believe

816
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,540
that simply revealing the truth

817
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,140
will make them a threat
to the Wind-Treading Clan,

818
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,540
that will be pure speculation.

819
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,140
Shut up!

820
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,580
You are so obstinate

821
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,420
and beyond redemption.

822
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,300
You will kneel here

823
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,540
all night.

824
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,020
Tomorrow morning, you will get up

825
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,140
and oversee the trial straight away.

826
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,620
So what if I have to kneel?

827
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,220
What's the big deal?

828
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:38,820
General,

829
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,860
you're not actually going
to make the Young General

830
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,420
kneel in there

831
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,980
all night, are you?

832
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,780
Human nature is hard to predict.

833
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,140
Since ancient times,

834
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:52,900
every person seeking

835
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,940
to enter the Ancient Tower

836
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,780
has gone to great lengths.

837
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:57,500
If this weren't true,

838
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,740
why would our ancestors

839
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,580
have set up this trial?

840
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,420
If she doesn't kneel today

841
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,580
and escapes this hardship,

842
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,740
she will

843
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,900
pay for it tenfold

844
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,740
in the future.

845
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:16,700
General.

846
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:18,940
General.
