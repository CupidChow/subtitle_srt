00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,220
Many Border Dwellers have turned

194
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,300
into Malevolent Beings because of it,

195
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,220
but he just doesn't care.

196
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,020
Yuanqing,

197
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,740
where's that person you mentioned?

198
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,620
Aren't we there yet?

199
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,620
Almost there.

200
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,820
Just up ahead.

201
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,340
If we refused,

202
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,580
he would have us

203
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,300
captured, beaten,

204
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,460
and forced into slavery.

205
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,820
I knew from the start

206
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,460
that Shen Yuanqing

207
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
was no good.

208
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,260
I wanted to warn

209
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,060
General Xia's daughter,

210
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,340
so I waited early this morning

211
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,900
outside the Xueling Pavilion.

212
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,540
But then she left

213
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,420
with Shen Yuanqing.

214
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,740
As soon as they headed out,

215
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,060
they went toward the Altar Platform.

216
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,660
Where is the Altar Platform?

217
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,580
Is the person

218
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,260
you mentioned here?

219
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,540
I don't see anyone.

220
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,740
I don't know why,

221
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,740
but I feel sick.

222
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,620
Feeling sick, are you?

223
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,740
That's how it should be.

224
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,380
This place is called the Altar Platform.

225
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,300
It amplifies the Primordial Spirit Power

226
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:25,900
of Spirit-hosted Humans

227
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,580
by about fifty percent.

228
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,980
Like me.

229
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,500
But for those who've lived

230
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,980
in the Human Realm for too long,

231
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,660
the sudden increase in power

232
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,060
causes chaos,

233
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,300
making it impossible to summon

234
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,180
their Guardian Primordial Spirits.

235
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,660
Just like you.

236
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,260
If you don't believe me,

237
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,460
you can give it a try.

238
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,100
Li Xuanyuan...

239
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,060
Are you leaving just like that?

240
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,340
Don't you want

241
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:04,900
the General's Chain anymore?

242
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,700
How could you have the General's Chain?

243
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,460
So it was you.

244
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,340
Yep.

245
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,860
I was the one

246
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,580
who had Xia Qifeng's grave robbed.

247
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,940
I just wanted

248
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,140
to get the General's Chain.

249
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,540
So you never had any leads.

250
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,980
You've been lying to me this whole time!

251
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,020
And you're only realizing that now?

252
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,300
Poor Cao Yanbing,

253
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,100
he tried to warn you over and over,

254
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,100
but you just didn't trust him.

255
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,060
You're too foolish.

256
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,420
Xia Ling,

257
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,660
wouldn't it be better for you

258
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,340
to stay in the Human Realm?

259
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,940
Why come to Hanxian Street

260
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,660
and challenge me?

261
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,020
Do you really think
getting the General's Chain

262
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,460
will give you control
over Hanxian Street?

263
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,060
In your dreams!

264
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,340
I never wanted

265
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,220
to take back Hanxian Street.

266
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,140
I just want

267
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,780
my father's belongings.

268
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,460
Enough!

269
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,660
Xia Ling,

270
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,420
you truly live up to be

271
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,660
Xia Qifeng's daughter.

272
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,620
You're truly

273
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,500
of the same bloodline.

274
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,780
You're both hypocritical!

275
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,620
Stop pretending.

276
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,700
From today onward,

277
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,020
Hanxian Street will have

278
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,020
only one Spiritual Guardian.

279
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,700
That's me,

280
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,740
Shen Yuanqing.

281
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,380
Fuhu, Send her

282
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,860
on her final journey.

283
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,660
Sorry,

284
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,700
I overslept this morning.

285
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,100
but it seems

286
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,940
I got here just in time.

287
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,940
Let me handle

288
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,300
that brat.

289
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:14,820
Wait,

290
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,140
I'll join you.

291
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,780
Can you still fight?

292
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,420
I can't summon Li Xuanyuan,

293
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,180
but I'll handle

294
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,660
the grave robber myself.

295
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,100
Alright,

296
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,740
let's do it together,

297
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,940
like old times.

298
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,060
Like old times.

299
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,380
♪Don't bother
with labels of good or bad♪

300
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,020

♪For the light that I maintain♪

310
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,300
It should return to its rightful owner.

311
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
I've been defeated.

312
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,660
Hanxian Street is yours now.

313
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,180
No,

314
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,580
you're wrong.

315
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,340
Hanxian Street

316
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,060
doesn't belong to anyone.

317
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,540
In fact,

318
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,420
it belongs to everyone

319
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,540
who lives here.

320
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,580
Say what you want.

321
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,460
The victor writes the story.

322
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,900
It doesn't matter anymore.

323
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,660
I just don't get it.

324
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,420
You dug up my father's grave

325
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,580
just for the General's Chain.

326
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,020
Everything you told me

327
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,700
about your bond with him

328
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,660
was all a lie?

329
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,340
Bond?

330
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,580
I'm not sure

331
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,740
if Xia Qifeng ever truly

332
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,620
had one with me.

333
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,700
How about

334
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,660
I tell you a story,

335
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,140
and you can decide for yourself?

336
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,020
Ever since I stayed on Hanxian Street,

337
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,860
I worked tirelessly without complaint.

338
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,420
I followed Xia Qifeng

339
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,100
to guard Hanxian Street for years.

340
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,500
Until one day...

341
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,660
General,

342
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,580
slow down.

343
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:07,780
General.

344
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,420
Help me sit down.

345
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:12,940
Alright.

346
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,420
Take it easy.

347
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:21,980
General,

348
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,540
are you okay?

349
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,020
I'm fine.

350
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,820
Yuanqing,

351
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,260
do you remember

352
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,780
when I told you I wanted to retire

353
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,700
and return to the Human Realm

354
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,940
to accompany my daughter?

355
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,300
General,

356
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:39,860
if you leave,

357
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,900
what will happen

358
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,500
to the Border Dwellers here?

359
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,780
I've been thinking about that.

360
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,860
I've been searching

361
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,940
for someone reliable

362
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,940
to entrust Hanxian Street to,

363
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,740
and I think...

364
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,340
I've almost found one.

365
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,260
General,

366
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,140
you mean...

367
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,900
Let's talk about it at home.

368
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,700
OK.

369
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:09,740
Slowly.

370
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,460
Shuang,

371
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,100
listen to me,

372
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,540
your father...

373
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,020
General!

374
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,260
You killed my father!

375
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,060
I'll kill you!

376
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,580
No!

377
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:53,900
General...

378
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,340
You...

379
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:03,980
Leave.

380
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,940
Since I started teaching you,

381
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,620
I've been stressing the rules

382
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,580
of Spirit-hosted Humans.

383
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,740
Do you still

384
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,260
remember them?

385
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,940
We can only kill Malevolent Beings,

386
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,100
and can't...

387
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,420
We can only kill Malevolent Beings

388
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,700
and can't hurt Border Dwellers.

389
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,100
That female Border Dweller

390
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,060
wasn't a Malevolent Being.

391
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,820
Why did you kill her?

392
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,980
She was trying to kill you!

393
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,700
Yuanqing,

394
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,460
I've told you before,

395
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,100
we Spirit-hosted Humans

396
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,340
are born with far more power

397
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,980
than Border Dwellers.

398
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,420
To limit that power,

399
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,380
we must

400
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,900
draw a line

401
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,100
to ensure it's used for protection,

402
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,380
not for evil deeds.

403
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,940
What you did today

404
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,860
has crossed that line.

405
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,540
General,

406
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,620
please give me another chance.

407
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,100
I promise I'll restrict myself next time.

408
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,940
You still don't understand.

409
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,820
There won't be a next time.

410
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,460
Hanxian Street can't trust
a Spirit-hosted Human

411
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,580
who kills Border Dwellers.

412
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,260
Your presence

413
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,100
will only bring them fear.

414
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,740
General.

415
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,140
General, I truly know I was wrong.

416
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,820
General!

417
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,500
I swear I won't ever hurt

418
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,860
any Border Dweller again.

419
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,380
Please don't send me away.

420
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,420
Yuanqing,

421
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,620
you're strong now.

422
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,500
Once you leave Hanxian Street,

423
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,340
no one will be able to bully you.

424
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,260
Just...

425
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,700
leave.

426
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,500
Is there really

427
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,180
no chance for me?

428
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,380
I beg you, please.

429
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,260
I've never asked you

430
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,580
for anything all these years.

431
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,780
Just this once.

432
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,420
Can't you forgive me?

433
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,220
Take care.

434
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,380
After that,

435
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,100
I returned to my life of wandering

436
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,540
through the Spiritual Crossroads.

437
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,220
That lasted three years.

438
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,980
Then one day,

439
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,860
I heard Xia Qifeng had disappeared,

440
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,380
and Hanxian Street was overrun
with Malevolent Beings.

441
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,180
Help me!

442
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:32,660
There...

443
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,540
There are...

444
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,100
Malevolent Beings chasing me!

445
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:35,660
They...

446
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,780
They're right behind me!

447
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,780
Where is General Xia?

448
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,780
General Xia...

449
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,260
He's...

450
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,700
I don't know where he is.

451
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,700
You...

452
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,620
You...

453
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,860
used to work for him, right?

454
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,700
I left Hanxian Street

455
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,580
a long time ago.

456
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,020
The things here

457
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,460
are none of my concern.

458
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,700
Please,

459
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:07,940
save me,

460
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,700
save Hanxian Street.

461
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,220
You...

462
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,740
You spent years on Hanxian Street.

463
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,100
Surely you don't want to see it

464
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,020
overrun by Malevolent Beings?

465
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,340
I can help you.

466
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,460
But only if I become

467
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,260
the Spiritual Guardian here.

468
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,620
But...

469
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,500
General Xia...

470
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,060
He...

471
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,700
He's the...

472
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,500
Xia Qifeng has long returned

473
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,820
to the Human Realm to enjoy his life.

474
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,540
He's not coming back.

475
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,860
That's impossible!

476
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,100
Why is it impossible?

477
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,900
I just returned from the Human Realm.

478
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,820
I saw him spending the winter holiday

479
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,780
with his daughter.

480
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,140
He's told me many times

481
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,860
that he wanted to retire

482
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,700
and return to the Human Realm.

483
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,060
Looks like he has finally

484
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,420
made up his mind

485
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,860
and decided

486
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,300
to abandon you guys for good.

487
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,100
So General Xia really

488
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,940
has abandoned us?

489
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,620
Help! Help!

490
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:18,860
Please save me!

491
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,220
You have two choices,

492
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,620
either to choose me,

493
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,660
or

494
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,420
to get eaten by them.

495
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,660
General, help, please!

496
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,100
Xia Qifeng has abandoned Hanxian Street

497
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,900
and returned to the Human Realm
to enjoy his life.

498
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,700
How could he do that?

499
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,140
Exactly.

500
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:48,980
He left us behind.

501
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,220
Could he really do that?

502
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,340
I didn't want

503
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,820
to get involved.

504
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,340
Though I was reluctant,

505
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,580
your plea

506
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,540
made me stay.

507
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,540
Clearing out the Malevolent Beings
has consumed

508
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,780
a significant amount
of my Primordial Spirit Power,

509
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,140
so you must

510
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,780
pay an equal price.

511
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,300
From today on,

512
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,820
you must obey me

513
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,500
and be at my service.

514
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,380
Anyone who resists

515
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,540
will be killed.

516
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,620
Er...

517
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,140
We will obey General Shen's orders.

518
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,340
[Xueling Pavilion]

519
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,100
It was he who asked me to stay

520
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,980
on Hanxian Street

521
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,260
and later drove me away.

522
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,260
He always talked

523
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,340
about rules

524
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,660
and boundaries,

525
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,620
but in the end, he just left.

526
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,100
Where was he when Hanxian Street

527
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,940
was under attack?

528
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,500
I was the one who defended it.

529
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,700
It was me!

530
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,780
So what if I hurt Border Dwellers?

531
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,180
So what if I enslave them?

532
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,300
The jungle law has always existed

533
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,220
on Spiritual Crossroads.

534
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,860
As long as I'm strong enough,

535
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,900
the whole street belongs to me.

536
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,540
It's mine!

537
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,420
Shut up.

538
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,260
Someone like you doesn't deserve

539
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,940
to be a Spiritual Guardian.

540
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,060
Shen Yuanqing,

541
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,220
you said earlier

542
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,980
that you saw my father

543
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,580
enjoy his life in the Human Realm.

544
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,380
You made that up, didn't you?

545
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,900
I made it up.

546
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,380
So what?

547
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,340
Isn't it true?

548
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,780
He ran away,

549
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,020
didn't he?

550
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,060
I believe my father had his reasons

551
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,620
for his sudden disappearance.

552
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,700
You can hate him,

553
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,900
and even replace him,

554
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:03,860
but you can't

555
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,980
hurt the Border Dwellers here.

556
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,740
Cao Yanbing was right.

557
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,300
You don't deserve
to be a Spiritual Guardian!

558
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,020
Spare me your lectures.

559
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,660
Right now, I'm at your mercy.

560
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,700
Kill me if you want,

561
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,820
or do whatever you please.

562
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,940
You're kind of a man.

563
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,300
Well, Xia Ling,

564
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,020
how do you want him to die?

565
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,260
Killing him just like this...

566
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,460
isn't that a bit too rash?

567
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,700
Rash?

568
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,660
Xia Ling,

569
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,420
don't you remember

570
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,500
he was trying to kill you?

571
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,060
Yes, I do.

572
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,820
But...

573
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,060
But what?

574
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,300
But you're hesitating.

575
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,260
Xia Ling,

576
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,020

that we have a choice right now

578
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,500
isn't because of his crimes

579
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,500

don't say so.

717
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,980
The fact is

718
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,260

- He didn't.

725
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,740

731
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,500
is that after my father
left Hanxian Street

00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,740
for the Human Realm,

733
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,780

735
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,020
But I'm certain

736
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,020
there's more to this story.

737
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,940
This time,

738
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,340
I'm going to investigate

739
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,420
and uncover the truth.

740
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,500
Once I do,

741
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,980
I'll return

742
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,340
and give you all an explanation.

743
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,740
OK.

744
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,460
Great.

745
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,580
We'll be expecting you.

746
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,020
OK.

747
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:21,900
Ling,

748
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,580
when you come back,

749
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,100
will you stay in Hanxian Street

750
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,420
and become the Spiritual Guardian?

751
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,180
Spiritual Guardian?

752
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:31,820
Me?

753
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,460
How could I ever

754
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,580
be a Spiritual Guardian?

755
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,740
I'm nowhere near capable

756
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,500
of protecting everyone.

757
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,460

758
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,940
in terms of power.

759
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,660
What we value most

760
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,980
in a Spiritual Guardian isn't power,

761
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,900
but genuine kindness

762
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,500
and a heart

768
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,020
Being a Spiritual Guardian

769
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,020
isn't that easy.

770
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,500
Let's give Xia Ling

771
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,300
more time.

772
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:13,860
I've already spoken

773
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,580
to the Spiritual Guardian

774
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,180
from the neighboring street.

775
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,500
For now,

776
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,300
he'll take over the management

777
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,580
of Hanxian Street.

778
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,460
When we finish our tasks,

779
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,820
I'll personally bring Xia Ling back.

780
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,220
Then,

781
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,460
she'll give you an answer.

782
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:26,660
Is that alright?

783
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,700
Alright.

784
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,780
We'll be waiting for you.

785
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:29,780
OK.

786
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,340
Ling,

787
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:32,700
we'll wait for you.

788
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,450
[Voidwood]

789
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,180
This map is incredible!

790
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,420
I've never seen anything like it.

791
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,300
Looks like Luhua Ancient Tower

792
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,980
is near Lingfeng Street.

793
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,380
Lingfeng Street?

794
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,340
Where's that?

795
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,140
I don't know either.

796
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,660
I've never heard

797
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,260
of that street.

798
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,860
If only we knew someone

799
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,860
like those characters in novels

800
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,540
who have traveled
all over the Spiritual Crossroads

801
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,060
and know everything,

802
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,180
just like

803
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:26,860
a know-it-all

804
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,180
or a knowledgeable

805
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:28,660
wanderer.

806
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,140
Someone who's traveled
all over the Spiritual Crossroads?

807
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,780
If we knew someone like that,

808
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,020
it would make things much easier.

809
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,300
You know what,

810
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,860
we do know someone.

811
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,460
Beiluo?

812
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,820
But

813
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,260
during the battle on Yulin Street,

814
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,860
Shui's Primordial Spirit Power
shattered.

815
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,580
Even though you defeated Nan Yufu

816
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,380
and saved Beiluo,

817
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,020
he still blames himself

818
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,700
for his daughter's fate.

819
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,420
I believe he'll get through it.

820
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,780
Don't forget

821
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,300
he was once the commander

822
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,260
of the Border Army,

823
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,700
the Spiritual Guardian of Bodhi Street,

824
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,820
and the legendary war god,

825
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,260
Commander Beiluo Shimen.

826
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,980
We should have some faith in him.

827
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,660
But the question now is

828
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,020
where we can find him.

829
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,660
After the battle on Yulin Street,

830
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,340
he said he wanted to wander around
and clear his mind.

831
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,300
He mentioned we could find him

832
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,180
on Leiquan Street.

833
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:21,700
Let's go.

834
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,540
We'll head there right away.

835
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,500
In such a hurry?

836
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,740
Let's write an update letter first.

837
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,020
We can send it while we're on the road.

838
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,380
Get packed now.
