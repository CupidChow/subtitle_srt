00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,180
instead of protecting me,

195
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,980
I hope you can

196
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,180
protect Liang

197
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,980
and Rakshasa Street.

198
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,340
Of course.

199
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,220
I'll work hard to get stronger.

200
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,060
From now on, you,

201
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,140
Liang,

202
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,540
and Rakshasa Street

203
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,940
will all be under my wing.

204
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,140
I believe in you.

205
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,370
[Liang's birthday]

206
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,970
[Rakshasa Street]

207
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,820
[Cao Xuanliang, the Spiritual Guardian
of Rakshasa Street]

208
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,060
Thank you.

209
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,780
General Liang,

210
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,220
happy birthday.

211
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,060
This is a gift

212
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,940
we prepared for you.

213
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,180
Thank you for protecting

214
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,860
Rakshasa Street so well.

215
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,340
It's my duty to protect Rakshasa Street.

216
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,300
You shouldn't give me any gifts.

217
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,340
Please accept it.

218
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:14,700
Thank you.

219
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,460
I'll get back to work.

220
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,060
General Liang.

221
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,000
[Wanted: Cao Yanbing]

222
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,780
General Cao,

223
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,580
happy birthday.

224
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,380
On such a special day,

225
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,260
your brother,

226
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,300
Cao Yanbing,

227
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,700
should be back, right?

228
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,500
Hey, can't you see?

229
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,180
What's wrong with you?

230
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,940
The Hall of Heroes is awesome.

231
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,980
I bet you can come up

232
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,100
with a smarter way to catch him

233
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,660
than just following me around,

234
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,460
right?

235
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,460
General Cao,

236
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,580
as I know,

237
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,140
you and your brother lost your parents

238
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,140
and have relied on each other

239
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,500
all these years.

240
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,740
Now,

241
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,100
your brother is a wanted criminal,

242
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,060
his whereabouts unknown.

243
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,380
Even if he doesn't come back today,

244
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,340
it doesn't bother us.

245
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,700
We can keep waiting.

246
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,420
But you must be

247
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,060
the most disappointed one.

248
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,620
You have to spend your birthday

249
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,500
all alone,

250
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,660
without a "happy birthday"

251
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,300
from your family.

252
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,940
You're so young.

253
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,180
That's pretty pitiful, don't you think?

254
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,140
How I spend my birthday

255
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,340
is none of your business.

256
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,420
I haven't chased you off

257
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,460
because I know
even if I chase off a batch,

258
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,300
another batch will come.

259
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,220
I just don't bother to do that.

260
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,140
But that doesn't mean

261
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,180
I won't kill some of you

262
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,300
if you annoy me enough.

263
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,540
Oh, please.

264
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,780
You're just a teenager.

265
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,260
Before you try threatening us,

266
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,100
think about who you're dealing with.

267
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,180
We're from the Hall of Heroes.

268
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,340
Think you can kill us?

269
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,340
Do you even dare?

270
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,140
Try me.

271
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,060
Why don't I dare?

272
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:02,900
Ling?

273
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,060
[Xia Ling]

274
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,180
All his accusations
about destroying Yulin Street,

275
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,180
killing Spiritual Guardians,

276
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,020
and even committing countless crimes,

277
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,340
did you even investigate them properly?

278
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,340
I think you're the ones

279
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,300
who can't tell right from wrong.

280
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,380
Who the heck are you?

281
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,420
Do you have a death wish?

282
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,100
How dare you
take down the wanted posters

283
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,700
by the Hall of Heroes?

284
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,300
They're talking nonsense.

285
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,180
Why can't I take them down?

286
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,180
Everyone in Rakshasa Street

287
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,420
knows Cao Yanbing.

288
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,940
You post the wanted poster

289
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,340
right at his doorstep.

290
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,740
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

291
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,060
That's exactly what I'm doing.

292
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,780
So what?

293
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,780
What's it to you?

294
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,780
Which street are you from?

295
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,540
Want me

296
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,260
to arrest you too?

297
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,460
Stop throwing your weight around.

298
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,900
Spirit-hosted Human as I am,

299
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,620
I'm not under
Spiritual Crossroads' jurisdiction.

300
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,020
Want to arrest me?

301
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,140
Come to the Human Realm.

302
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,020
No need for that.

303
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,140
I'll arrest you right now and here.

304
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,020
Buddies, get her!

305
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,220
Li Xuanyuan!

306
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,150
[Li Xuanyuan]

307
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,100
Master,

308
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,420
I've taken down all of them.

309
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,580
Any other orders?

310
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,260
Listen up, all of you.

311
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,220
General Liang isn't alone.

312
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,980
He has me, his sister.

313
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,780
He's not spending his birthday alone.

314
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,900
Take your posters

315
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,340
and get out of Rakshasa Street!

316
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:06,900
You...

317
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,140
I'll let you off today.

318
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,580
I got this

319
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,460
from a popular store.

320
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,180
I waited in line for a long time.

321
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,860
Ling,

322
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,780
you're so sweet.

323
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,500
I didn't expect you
to remember my birthday.

324
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,700
How could I forget it?

325
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,780
Make a wish.

326
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,900
Food from the Human Realm is the best.

327
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,260
Delicious, right?

328
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,580
If you like it,

329
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,580
I'll get you more next time.

330
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,260
They are my brother and mother.

331
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,620
Your mother is so stunning.

332
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,660
Your brother never told me

333
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,060
about your parents.

334
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,100
My father passed away

335
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,820
when I was one,

336
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,820
and my mother died

337
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,580
when I was three

338
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,620
because of the Malevolent Beings.

339
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,540
Since then,

340
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,540
it's just been me and my brother.

341
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,780
Liang,

342
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,460
I'm sorry.

343
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,500
It's okay.

344
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,300
I don't really remember

345
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,260
many of those things.

346
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,780
They all happened

347
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,140
when I was very little.

348
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,740
I only learned the stories
from my brother later.

349
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,580
As far back as I can remember,

350
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,100
I've been just living with Yanbing.

351
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,460
What's wrong, Ling?

352
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,180
Those guys from the Hall of Heroes
are so annoying.

353
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,580
Had Cao Yanbing

354
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,540
not been wanted,

355
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,540
you wouldn't have

356
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,660
to spend your birthday alone.

357
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,100
But I'm not alone.

358
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,380
You're here with me.

359
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,580
You remembered my birthday

360
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,420
and helped me deal with

361
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,340
those annoying guys.

362
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,540
They've been pestering me

363
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,020
every day in recent days.

364
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,700
I've been holding back

365
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,900
because of Rakshasa Street,

366
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,820
but it's been frustrating.

367
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,860
You gave them a hard beating,

368
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,540
and it felt so good.

369
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,220
That's nothing.

370
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,540
I've fought monsters

371
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,260
with your brother.

372
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,900
He's saved me more times

373
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,460
than I can count.

374
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,660
What I did just now

375
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,740
was nothing compared to that.

376
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,220
Ling,

377
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,980
do you know where my brother is?

378
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,460
Hasn't he contacted you?

379
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,140
He did once.

380
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,420
Right after when he was declared wanted

381
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,660
by the Hall of Heroes,

382
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,140
he sent me an update letter,

383
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,500
asking me
to take care of Rakshasa Street,

384
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,180
not to trust the Hall of Heroes

385
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,220
or respond to them.

386
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,060
After that,

387
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,780
no contact anymore.

388
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,820
What's wrong with Cao Yanbing?

389
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,660
It's bad enough he doesn't contact me,

390
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,780
but to barely keep in touch

391
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,940
with his own brother?

392
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,740
It's my fault.

393
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,060
I was busy with graduation stuff

394
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:58,940
back in the Human Realm,

395
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,460
so I separated from your brother.

396

Otherwise,

397
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,500
I'd have dragged him back

398
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,420
to celebrate your birthday.

399
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,580
It's fine.

400
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,940
It's better he doesn't come back now.

401

402
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,500
for him to walk into their trap.

403
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
Having you here

404
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,980
makes me happy enough.

405
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,220
Right, your brother is not here,

406

408
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,020
and finish the cake.

409

It's so good.

410
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,900
Ling, are you usually busy?

411
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,260
I'm swamped with work.

412

I don't even get weekends.

413
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,980
A corporate slave like me
doesn't deserve weekends off.

We've been neighbors for years.

It's been two years since we last met,

As your uncle,

441
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,620
I should celebrate it for you.

442
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,020
Uncle Wang, you're thoughtful.

443

I appreciate it,

but please

445

take the gift back.

Now, now,

you know the saying,

448
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,900
distant relatives are not
as helpful as close neighbors,

449
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,380
especially since
we're practically family.

450

You can't

Uncle Wang,

00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,180
it's getting late.

461
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,860
I won't bother you now.

462
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,100
Besides, my brother isn't here.

463
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,540

What am I up to?

474
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,740
You should be asking

475
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,700
what I want.

476
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,300

but you may don't know

481

my specialty is
