Elder Mei woke up once yesterday,

20

but after enduring much hardship

21
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,540

let's talk this out calmly.

35
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,340
You should calm down.

36
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,860
I'm very calm at the moment.

Since Ruofu

50
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,740
has already told you everything,

51
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,980

52
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,300

167

Instead, you had Ruofu pretend
to be the guide.

the Fire-Eating King?

171
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,500
Mr. Cao,

172
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,140
the blame for all these mistakes
lies with me.

173
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,460
Lingfeng Street isn't powerful enough,

174
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,740
and Ruofu's temporary lie

175
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,660

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,660
once he learns the truth

180
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,380
and realizes

181
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,020
that finding the Ancient Tower
is hopeless,

182
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,660
he might turn his rage

183
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,060
against Lingfeng Street.

184
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:23,860
General Yan,

185
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,660
what are you trying to say?

186
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,740
Do you think

187
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,460
that Cao Yanbing

188
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,580
is just like the Fire-Eater King?

189
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,380
I certainly hope he's not.

00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,380
Mr. Cao helped us

191
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,500
deal with the Fire-Eater King,

192
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,620
and I will reward him handsomely.

193
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,460
But for certain things,

194
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,660
there are limits

195
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,420
to what can be done,

196
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,860
and not everything

197
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,660
will turn out as we hope.

198
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
Mr. Cao, I hope you

199
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,780
can come to terms with this

200
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,100
and not be too insistent.

201
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,900
Impossible!

202
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,060
That phony woman.

203
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,220
Cao Yanbing,

204
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,060
she's definitely lying to you.

205
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,260
- That's right, just like that.
- Listen up, Yan Lingyu.

206
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,100
I don't believe

207
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,460
a single word you say.

208
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,260
You claim
that Yan Fengzha is dead, right?

209
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,740
Threaten her.

210
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,860
- Now, grab her neck.
- Then I need to see him,

211
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,140
whether he's alive or dead.

212
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,260
Excuse me?

213
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,980
How dare you trample on the dignity

214
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,660
of the Wind-Treading Clan!

215
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,620
So what if I've trampled on it?

216
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,460
Shut up!

217
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:12,780
Cao Yanbing.

218
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,180
Anyway,

219
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,260
I won't let this slide.

220
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,620
Just you wait.

221
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,300
Lingyu,

222
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,540
Cao Yanbing may have overreacted a bit

223
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,420
in this situation,

224
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,860
but his feelings

225
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,020
are understandable.

226
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,940
Don't blame him.

227
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,660
Overreacted?

228
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:46,980
You need to understand,

229
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,300
to me, your friend

230
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,060
is no different
from the Fire-Eater King.

231
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,740
I'm just worried

232
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,380
that Lingfeng Street

233
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,620
is about to suffer.

234
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,420
This is the place

235
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,500
my brother would give his life
to protect.

236
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,220
It won't happen.

237
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,660
Cao Yanbing isn't that kind of person.

238
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,860
Are you sure?

239
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,860
Don't worry.

240
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,420
As long as I'm here,

241
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,540
I'll never let him do anything

242
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,700
to harm Lingfeng Street.

243
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,060
Yan Ruofu.

244
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,020
General.

245
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,100
You ungrateful traitor!

246
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:54,860
Mother.

247
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,740
Stop calling me Mother.

248
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,740
I have no daughter like you.

249
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,420
General,

250
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,500
Cao Yanbing and the other two

251
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,340
passed the trial,

252
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,260
which is why I released them.

253
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,020
I'm not the real guide,

254
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,620
so I tried to explain the truth.

255
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,140
What exactly did I do wrong?

256
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,700
You, on the other hand,

257
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,620
deceived them first,

258
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,300
and then used the trial
as an excuse to kill them.

259
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,180
You even targeted
an old friend like Beiluo

260
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,660
and your benefactor's son

261
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,500
like Cao Yanbing.

262
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,500
You can't distinguish right from wrong.
You repay kindness with treachery.

263
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,340
Now tell me, who's really at fault?

264
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,140
Good, very good.

265
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,540
Since I'm not considered

266
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,740
a mother in your eyes

267
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,940
and you see me as an enemy,

268
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,700
then

269
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,300
there's no need

270
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,140
to hide anything anymore.

271
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,980
Just be honest with me.

272
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,460
You had them see Fengzha

273
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,460
in the trial

274
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,580
as the true guide.

275
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,260
How did you manage to do that?

276
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,500
Because I've summoned

277
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,260
my Guardian Primordial Spirit,

278
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,820
and its power is to paint dreams.

279
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,540
You can summon
the Guardian Primordial Spirit now?

280
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,460
Why didn't you tell me?

281
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,700
It's a Guardian Primordial Spirit

282
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,100
that only creates dreams
and has little combat power.

283
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,500
Even if I told you,

284
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,460
you wouldn't be interested.

285
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,740
Not necessarily.

286
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,940
You can summon it,

287
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,500
and I'll take a look.

288
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,260
You

289
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,380
want to see it?

290
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,660
Just summon it.

291
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,540
Zhuoying.

292
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,600
[Zhuoying]

293
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,140
No!

294
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,300
This is the consequence of betraying me

295
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,340
and our Wind-Treading Clan.

296
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:22,860
You

297
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,180
are now

298
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,460
utterly useless.

299
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,980
Leave Lingfeng Street

300
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,500
and don't ever return.

301
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,380
Fine,

302
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,260
if Lingfeng Street is so unwelcoming,
then so be it.

303
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,500
I know

304
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,100
that I've never met

305
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,060
your expectations,

306
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,020
but to me,

307
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,780
you've been equally disappointing.

308
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,540
Is Fengzha

309
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,660
really dead?

310
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,660
Get out!

311
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,340
Young General.

312
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,420
General,

313
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,780
Young General...

314
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,460
Do you need me to go and bring her back?

315
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,260
No need.

316
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,020
Let her go.

317
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,660
Lingfeng Street

318
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,460
will probably be in turmoil later.

319
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,300
Lang Da,

320
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,380
there's something

321
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,220
I need you to take care of immediately.

322
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,220
Why are you leaving?

323
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,380
She lied to you.

324
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,460
Are you going to just ignore it?

325
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,500
Go back.

326
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,780
Go back now!

327
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,700
Shut up!

328
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,900
If you could be calm and collected

329
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,060
in just a second,

330
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,060
I would shut up right away.

331
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,780
But can you really do that?

332
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,980
I'm warning you,

333
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,180
regardless of what you are,

334
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,780
get out of my body right now.

335
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,540
It's really hurtful

336
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,900
to hear you say that.

337
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,620
We've already met

338
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,820
twice before.

339
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,020
Don't you remember at all?

340
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,220
Nonsense!

341
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,780
I don't even know who you are.

342
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,740
Initially,

343
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,180
I helped you kill the Prison Guardian.

344
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,340
Then,

345
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,580
I assisted you in defeating
the Fire-Eater King.

346
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,660
And this time,

347
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,500
I'm awakened by the anger in your heart.

348
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,940
I'm ready to aid you again.

349
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,020
The Prison Guardian?

350
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,420
The Fire-Eater King?

351
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,500
I don't mind repeating myself.

352
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,740
I am you,

353
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,020
so I know

354
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,580
you're extremely angry

355
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,300
and anxious right now.

356
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,980
Here's a tip.

357
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,580
If you want someone to pay the price,

358
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,580
you must destroy

359
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,100
what she values the most.

360
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,620
Look at this Lingfeng Street.

361
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,620
It's so vulnerable.

362
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,900
If it were to be engulfed in flames,

363
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,220
Yan Lingyu would be devastated.

364
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,340
She would submit and comply.

365
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:16,980
What do you say?

366
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,420
Want to call forth my power?

367
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,940
The kind that can turn this place

368
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,420
into hell in a second.

369
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,060
I've told you the method,

370
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,060
killing intent.

371
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,300
Feel free to summon me anytime.

372
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,820
Remember the method:

373
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:33,940
killing intent.

374
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,220
It's you,

375
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,460
my demonic form.

376
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,260
You've finally remembered me.

377
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,860
This makes our conversation

378
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
much easier.

379
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,660
Do you really believe

380
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,180
that the guide is dead?

381
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,060
Of course, I don't believe it.

382
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,860
Only someone

383
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,740
trying desperately

384
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,380
to cover something up

385
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,140
would make

386
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,140
so many unnecessary moves,

387
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,220
just like Yan Lingyu.

388
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,140
Excellent.

389
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,780
You are indeed a smart one.

390
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,820
Just do as I say

391
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,540
and destroy Lingfeng Street.

392
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,460
Scram.

393
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,180
It's not your place

394
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,220
to tell me what to do.

395
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,260
You need to think carefully.

396
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,540
Your mother is waiting for you

397
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,340
at the Luhua Ancient Tower.

398
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,580
Let me help you.

399
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,540
What do you think?

400
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,180
Mom.

401
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,140
Cao Yanbing.

402
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,660
Why bother coming all this way for me?

403
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,700
I fear you might act on impulse

404
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,900
if you don't keep your cool.

405
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,820
My mother is at the Ancient Tower,

406
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,620
and we don't know
if she's alive or dead.

407
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,580
Yan Lingyu is full of lies.

408
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,620
How can I possibly stay calm?

409
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,300
All right then.

410
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,300
If Yan Lingyu is lying,

411
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,740
then we should hurry back,

412
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,340
search for clues,

413
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,700
and make every effort
to find Yan Fengzha.

414
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,620
Getting angry here

415
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,420
won't help.

416
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,260
Xia Ling,

417
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,220
get this straight.

418
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,300
We're in Lingfeng Street,

419
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,980
which is their turf.

420
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,180
If it hadn't been for Yan Ruofu today,

421
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,700
we might have left Lingfeng Street

422
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,820
without even realizing
we'd been deceived.

423
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:01,740
All right.

424
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,660
So what do you suggest we do?

425
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,180
Take some measures

426
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,220
to force them to tell the truth.

427
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,220
What do you mean
by taking some measures?

428
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,940
What kind of measures
are you thinking of?

429
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,580
It depends on what Yan Lingyu

430
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,260
cares about.

431
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,780
If she values people,

432
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,340
I'll capture people.

433
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
If she cares about the street...

434
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,500
What do you want to do?

435
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:29,940
Blow up the street?

436
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,500
Cao Yanbing,

437
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,620
have you considered

438
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,340
that this might harm

439
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,420
innocent members
of the Wind-Treading Clan?

440
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,620
I'll use any means necessary

441
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,300
as long as I can find Yan Fengzha.

442
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,220
I even assured Yan Lingyu

443
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,340
that you wouldn't harm

444
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,460
innocent members
of the Wind-Treading Clan.

445
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,980
It looks like I was wrong about you.

446
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,300
Let me warn you,

447
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,060
this is a place

448
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,860
safeguarded by Tianyue.

449
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,460
If you cause any trouble here,

450
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,180
I won't let you get away with it.

451
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,540
Beiluo Shimen,

452
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,700
you're something else.

453
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,220
Yan Tianyue is your friend,

454
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,860
but what about me?

455
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,220
I need to find the guide,

456
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,500
but you don't?

457
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,860
Let me ask you this.

458
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,420
Are you still going to save Shui or not?

459
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,780
Of course, I want to save her,

460
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,340
but I can't harm the innocent.

461
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,540
Cao Yanbing,

462
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,100
wake up.

463
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,220
You're going down the wrong path.

464
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,300
I don't care whether it's the right path
or the wrong one.

465
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,500
But some things are simply unacceptable.

466
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:48,940
It seems

467
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,100
that your love for Shui

468
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,980
is not as deep as you claim.

469
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,700
Cao Yanbing.

470
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,300
Beiluo Shimen,

471
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,540
you're unworthy of being a father.

472
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,740
If you want to take action
against Lingfeng Street,

473
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,060
you need to beat me first!

474
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,540
So you want to fight, huh?

475
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,220
I'll gladly oblige.

476
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,660
Calm down, you two.

477
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,420
Stop fighting.

478
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,900
What are you doing?

479
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,780
This is Beiluo.

480
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,900
Put down the King of Ten Halls.

481
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,460
I'll count to three,

482
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,940
and you better get out of the way.

483
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,220
You want to kill me?

484
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,420
Now is the time.

485
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,100
Embrace your killing intent,

486
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,860
and you'll immediately be able to summon

487
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,580
my power.

488
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,900
I told you to move aside!

489
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,780
Calm down!

490
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,220
All right, I'll leave.

491
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,820
Go to the Ancient Tower yourself.

492
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,140
But let me warn you,

493
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,700
if you harm anyone

494
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,540
in Lingfeng Street,

495
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,580
I will never forgive you
in this lifetime.

496
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,860
Let him leave.

497
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,580
It's better
if the person blocking your way

498
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,860
isn't around.

499
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,460
Cao Yanbing,

500
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,020
I advise you to calm down.

501
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,740
If you blow up Lingfeng Street,

502
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,740
you'll be no different

503
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,540
from the Fire-Eater King.

504
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,620
Think it over carefully.

505
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,260
Let's go, Cao Yanbing.

506
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,540
Remember

507
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,660
that you are not meant to have friends

508
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,260
when pursuing ultimate strength.

509
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,020
Now, we'll head

510
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,500
to the busiest square
in Lingfeng Street.

511
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,180
First, eliminate everyone there,

512
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,180
then raze the General's Mansion.

513
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,580
Let's see if Yan Lingyu
will tell the truth afterward.

514
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,220
Hurry up,

515
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,500
and go faster.

516
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,260
You audacious scoundrel,

517
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,140
how dare you bump into me! Take this!

518
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,180
I'll cut you to pieces.

519
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,860
I want your staff.

520
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,820
Give me your staff

521
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,980
and I'll spare your life.

522
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,220
I'll smash you to death!

523
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,740
I'll smash you to death!

524
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,260
I'll smash you to death!

525
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,220
I'll smash you to death!

526
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,260
I'll smash...

527
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,300
No.

528
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:04,740
No.

529
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,300
Don't.

530
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,700
Don't hurt my child.

531
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,980
Come on. Let's go.

532
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:24,820
Hurry.

533
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,740
What was that?

534
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,820
What was I doing?

535
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,140
What were you doing?

536
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,860
Why did you hold back?

537
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,820
We were just about

538
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,980
to wipe out Lingfeng Street.

539
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,820
Have you gone soft?

540
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,060
I...

541
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,500
Think about Yan Lingyu.

542
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,660
Despite you risking your life
to help her

543
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,340
defeat the Fire-Eater King,

544
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,540
she still distrusts you,

545
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,540
treats you like a criminal,

546
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,100
and deceives you.

547
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,100
You thought that guy
was your close friend,

548
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,300
but for a few words

549
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,060
from a woman,

550
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,380
he has turned against you

551
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,420
to defend someone else's territory

552
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,740
without the slightest hesitation.

553
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,420
Shouldn't they

554
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,220
be punished?

555
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,500
Think

556
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,420
about who truly cares for you.

557
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,620
Think about your mother.

558
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,620
Mother.

559
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:15,860
You little brat,

560
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,260
I've been telling you to grow stronger.

561
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,100
What does it mean to be strong?

562
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,220
It means being able
to bear the consequences

563
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,860
of being let down or betrayed,

564
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,180
and still hold onto your true self

565
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,500
through anger and resentment.

566
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,700
That's true strength.

567
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,220
What's going on?

568
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,820
Why is the anger in your heart

569
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,860
fading so quickly?

570
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,580
Aren't you going to find the guide?

571
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,900
Aren't you going to save your mother?

572
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,900
Stop bringing up my mother all the time.

573
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,020
I'm sick of hearing it.

574
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,020
How I find the guide is my business,

575
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,340
and I don't like your methods.

576
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,300
Back off.

577
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,180
How dare you speak to me like that!

578
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,220
Do you know who I am?

579
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,940
You are ancient,

580
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,900
yet you constantly bring up the past.

581
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,100
Don't you find it embarrassing?

582
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,220
Cao Yanbing, you...

583
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,220
Get this straight.

584
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,940
Since you claim to be a part of me

585
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,260
and have made your presence known,

586
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,860
you must follow my rules.

587
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,700
Didn't you say

588
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,980
you'd disappear

589
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,300
once I was calm?

590
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,060
Well, I'm as calm as can be now,

591
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,740
so you can get lost.

592
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,740
Don't get too confident too soon.

593
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,140
Not leaving, huh?

594
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,260
Then,

595
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,660
let me hear you call me "master".

596
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,820
I'll be back.

597
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,340
I can't blow up the streets

598
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,540
or coerce people.

599
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,340
Should I really go door to door

600
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,020
and ask them?

601
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,380
These common folks

602
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,380
know even less

603
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,780
about Yan Fengzha than I do.

604
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,740
Yan Tianyue.

605
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,940
Hasn't he already gone insane?

606
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,140
Beiluo, wait.

607
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,940
Cao Yanbing was just caught up
in the moment.

608
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,220
He wouldn't actually do

609
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:26,620
those things.

610
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,420
He'd rather turn on the world

611
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,380
than be turned on by it.

612
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,740
His attitude is already very clear.

613
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,140
Beiluo.

614
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:31,980
Beiluo.

615
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,380
We've made such an effort

616
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,260
to get to Lingfeng Street.

617
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,380
Can we please wait a little longer?

618
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,180
When I joined you,

619
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,860
I anticipated

620
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,900
all sorts of failures,

621
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,900
including not finding the guide.

622
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,260
However, I never expected

623
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:43,700
we'd part ways

624
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,540
like this.

625
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,460
Xia Ling,

626
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,100
if you want to stay and help him,

627
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,780
I won't stop you,

628
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,660
but don't expect me to stay too.

629
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:51,660
Beiluo,

630
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,260
hear me out first.

631
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,220
After I'm done,

632
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:54,940
if you still want to leave,

633
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:55,940
I won't stop you.

634
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,060
Okay.

635
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:00,980
Go ahead.

636
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,580
But I'll never

637
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,300
change my decision.

638
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,660
Do you know why I'm following you

639
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,700
instead of dealing with him?

640
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,860
It's because I believe

641
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,020
he would never do anything

642
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,060
to harm Lingfeng Street.

643
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,380
I don't need to worry about him.

644
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,540
You really do trust him.

645
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,700
I do trust him.

646
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,460
I admit

647
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,500
that he can be impulsive

648
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,980
and may say

649
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,900
ridiculous things

650
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,740
when he's agitated.

651
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,020
But have you considered

652
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,180
that he hasn't harmed

653
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,260
any innocent people?

654
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,580
Beiluo,

655
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,940
words

656
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,740
can be misleading,

657
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,620
but actions

658
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,220
speak the truth.

659
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,420
Even if Cao Yanbing

660
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,380
won't act rashly

661
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,140
as you've said,

662
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,340
I'm afraid we won't be able

663
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,860
to get to the Ancient Tower after all.

664
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,380
Do you also believe

665
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,220
that Yan Fengzha is dead?

666
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,860
When Yan Ruofu

667
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,780
heard about Yan Fengzha's death

668
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,820
from her mother,

669
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,300
she wouldn't have easily believed it.

670
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,420
Therefore,

671
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,020
this requires solid evidence.

672
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,140
Also, think about it.

673
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,420
The Fire-Eater King threatened

674
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,060
to slaughter the street,

675
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,540
and Yan Lingyu
valued Lingfeng Street so much.

676
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,540
However, she still chose
to let her daughter

677
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,580
pretend to be the guide

678
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,780
rather than hand over Yan Fengzha.

679
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,540
This indicates

680
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,300
that Yan Fengzha

681
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,460
might indeed be dead.

682
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,540
What you're saying makes a lot of sense,

683
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,820
but I still have the feeling

684
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,820
that something doesn't quite add up.

685
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:38,940
Xia Ling,

686
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,940
sometimes people's instincts

687
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,660
can be unreliable,

688
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,940
and hiding a person

689
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,180
is not so easy.

690
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:55,980
Xia Ling,

691
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,420
what's on your mind?

692
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,060
Nothing.

693
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,140
I probably misheard it.

694
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,300
Miss Xia.

695
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:06,940
General Yan.

696
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
I finally found you.

697
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,500
Can I help you with anything?

698
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,380
Since my brother

699
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,860
took Li Xuanyuan's pills,

700
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,780
his condition has gotten better.

701
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,260
He is awake now

702
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,220
and able to recognize me.

703
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,100
Are you saying
that Tianyue is all right now?

704
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,260
My brother was very happy

705
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,100
to hear you had arrived

706
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,820
and insisted on seeing you.

707
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,540
That's why I rushed over

708
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,540
to find you.

709
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,100
He even managed to remember Beiluo?

710
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,700
That's right.

711
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,740
It shows

712
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,180
that your Guardian Primordial Spirit
is quite remarkable.

713
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,260
Then let's head over now.

714
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:34,940
Let's go.

715
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,260
Let's go.

716
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:53,700
General.

717
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,100
General.

718
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,260
All right,

719
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,340
you can all go back now.

720
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,580
No need to guard this place anymore.

721
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,260
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

722
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,620
Could it be

723
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,500
that Yan Tianyue faked his insanity?

724
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,620
Since General Tianyue

725
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,140
has remembered Beiluo,

726
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,220
does that mean he has also recalled

727
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:58,980
other things in the past?

728
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,100
Miss Xia, I understand

729
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,860
that you want to inquire
about the guide.

730
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,940
I'll take you

731
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,700
to see my brother soon,

732
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,780
so you can ask him directly.

733
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,580
I hope his answers

734
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,140
will ease your concerns

735
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,500
and address

736
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,900
the past misunderstandings we've had.

737
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:11,980
But,

738
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,100
in any case,

739
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,940
it's really

740
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,100
thanks to your assistance

741
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,580
that my brother's condition

742
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,260
has improved.

743
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,060
If my hospitality

744
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,940
was ever lacking in any way,

745
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,780
please forgive me.

746
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,020
Not at all,

747
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,020
never mind it.

748
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,220
Let's go.

749
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:34,740
This way, please.

750
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,260
We'll go check on him.

751
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:36,780
Okay.

752
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,540
Tianyue?

753
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,100
Tianyue.

754
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,460
Tianyue.

755
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,380
Tianyue, wake up.

756
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:53,980
He's dead.

757
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,060
You did it.

758
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,620
