You've got to be joking.

The village we just saw

21
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,620
had a few hundred households,

22
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,780
yet this place has such a shabby
and worn-out gate.

23
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,340
How can the folks on Lingfeng Street

24
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,420
be living in such poverty?

25
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,580
It's not that they're poor.

26
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,940
It's that they're weak.

This place is on the outskirts

so Malevolent Beings often show up here.

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,580
Plus, the people here

34
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,740
have weak Primordial Spirit Power,

35
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,980

to fend off attacks,

A long-standing feud?

172
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,740
It looks like we've been caught up

That's possible.

176
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,820
They look terrified
at the mention of the guy,

177
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,420
so they probably can't defeat him.

178
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,620

179
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,220
just restoring the traps

180
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,860
isn't enough.

181
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,380
If someone accidentally
triggers them again

182
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,420
like earlier,

183
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,340
it could cause trouble.

184
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,700
We need to send another person

185
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,860
to lure the Fire-Eater King over.

186
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,180
Lang Da,

187
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,460
fetch me the Blaze Jade.

188
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:48,780
Go get it now.

189
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,100
What is Blaze Jade?

190
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,260
Blaze Jade is a highly sought-after

191
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,620
and expensive elixir

192
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,780
on the black market these days.

193
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:55,900
That's right,

194
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,420
consuming it

195
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,220
can significantly boost

196
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,380
the Primordial Spirit Power
of Spirit-hosted Humans.

197
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,740
Mother.

198
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,860
General, here's the Blaze Jade
you requested.

199
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:09,860
Give it to me.

200
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:10,540
Young General.

201
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,460
Young General!

202
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,700
Yan Ruofu,

203
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,380
what are you doing?

204
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,860
If we're going
to take on the Fire-Eater King,

205
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,100
both of us can go.

206
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,020
Have you lost your mind?

207
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,780
Stop her from going.

208
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,740
Mother,

209
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,020
why can't you

210
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,260
face reality?

211
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,300
Your internal injuries have recurred,

212
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,700
and now I've consumed the Blaze Jade.

213
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,180
I have a better chance of winning
than you.

214
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,460
Your words don't make any difference.

215
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,380
Hurry and take her away.

216
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,900
I dare you to do that!

217
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,860
Listen up, everyone.

218
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,660
Today,

219
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,020
I must go

220
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,820
because I am the guide
the Fire-Eater King

221
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,900
is looking for.

222
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,460
I am currently the only guide

223
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,780
on Lingfeng Street.

224
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,460
Because I am the guide,

225
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,100
even if I can't defeat

226
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,380
the Fire-Eater King,

227
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,020
he won't kill me.

228
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,940
Once the Fire-Eater King has the guide,

229
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,980
he won't trouble us

230
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,820
on Lingfeng Street anymore.

231
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,060
Therefore,

232
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,660
it's enough for me

233
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,060
to go alone

234
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,420
for this battle.

235
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,340
How naive.

236
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,140
The Fire-Eater King has coveted

237
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,180
Lingfeng Street for years.

238
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,740
A mere guide

239
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,740
is just an excuse.

240
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,540
But Mother...

241
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,180
Hold on a moment.

242
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:35,860
General.

243
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,020
If you're going to fight,

244
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,060
I can help out.

245
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,500
You will help me?

246
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
Upon further thought,

247
00:12:59,220 --> 00:12:59,980
your proposal

248
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,220
is also a feasible one.

249
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,300
I allow you to go and fight

250
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,020
the Fire-Eater King.

251
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,140
Guide him to the trap swiftly.

252
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,100
Just remember

253
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,660
not to be reckless.

254
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,340
Yes.

255
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,140
I'll go capture him now and show you.

256
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,260
Why are you leaving?

257
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,780
I meant it when I said

258
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,340
that I was willing to help.

259
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,660
Take these three away

260
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,500
and put them in the dungeon.

261
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,100
Didn't you hear

262
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,100
what I just said?

263
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,580
I said I could help you.

264
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,020
Do you understand Mandarin or not?

265
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:34,860
Get in.

266
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:36,860
Move!

267
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,340
Get in.

268
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,220
What are you looking at?

269
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,580
Just

270
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,660
Beilu,

271
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,980
confess honestly.

272
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,140
Have you done anything

273
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,700
to offend that female general?

274
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,540
You are being overly suspicious,

275
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,300
It's all baseless.

276
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,740
That's impossible.

277
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,860
Apart from this,

278
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,140
I can't think of any reason

279
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,420
why my overtures

280
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,500
were rejected.

281
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,020
You're a stranger.

282
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,820
It's reasonable for her
to question your motives,

283
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,140
doubt your abilities,

284
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,700
and ignore you.

285
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,580
It's reasonable for her to ignore me.

286
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,220
Is it reasonable to ignore you though?

287
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,180
I am a stranger.

288
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,940
But you are not.

289
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,540
Enough.

290
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,940
You don't need to say anything.

291
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,140
Xia Ling.

292
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,100
Intuitive Judgment.

293
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,020
No.

294
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,020
There's no need
for intuitive judgment at all.

295
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,100
Beiluo's expression clearly displays

296
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,100
the term 'guilt-ridden.'

297
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,300
Even Xia Ling could see it.

298
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:09,780
Beiluo,

299
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,380
just admit it honestly.

300
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,060
Tell me.

301
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,340
Did you beat her up?

302
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,420
Beat her up?

303
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,980
Do you think you're a boxer?

304
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,180
This is clearly an unforgettable,

305
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:24,900
lingering,

306
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,260
and hard-to-move-on love story.

307
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,260
Is love

308
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,260
the only story

309
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,300
in the world?

310
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,820
Use a little imagination, will you?

311
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,700
It's not that I lack imagination.

312
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,980
It's that you're immune to love

313
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,700
and lack insight.

314
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,180
That's why I can draw my sword quickly

315
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,220
and fire accurately.

316
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,340
You actually think that's something
you could brag about?

317
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,860
You've been single all your life.

318
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,460
As if you

319
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,220
are not the same.

320
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:44,940
Beiluo.

321
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:45,940
Enough.

322
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,260
You two can stop guessing.

323
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:50,820
Actually, there's nothing

324
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,300
between her and me.

325
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,220
- That's impossible.
- That's impossible.

326
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,100
Fine,

327
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,780
since you're so curious,

328
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,420
I don't mind telling you.

329
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,900
But it's not as exciting

330
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,740
as you think.

331
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,820
It's just a simple, ordinary story.

332
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,660
Eight years ago,

333
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,180
I came near Lingfeng Street

334
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,340
looking for Shui

335
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,420
and met Yan Tianyue,

336
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,540
the Spiritual Guardian here,

337
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,820
and his sister Yan Lingyu.

338
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,780
Tianyue,

339
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,460
you're finally back.

340
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,140
[Yan Tianyue]
Where have you been?

341
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,340
Didn't you say

342
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,540
you were only going out for a few days
to buy supplies?

343
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,580
How did you end up being gone

344
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,220
for more than half a month?

345
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,380
I couldn't even get in touch with you
through the update letters.

346
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,980
Do you know how worried everyone was?

347
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,700
Yu, it's my fault.

348
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,060
I lost the update letters.

349
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,740
I'll apologize to you later.

350
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,140
Today, we have a guest at home.

351
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,140
A guest?

352
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,660
Come here, Beiluo.

353
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,700
Let me introduce you to each other.

354
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,780
This is my younger sister, Lingyu.

355
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,020
This is Beiluo Shimen,

356
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,460
a good friend I made

357
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,540
on this trip.

358
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,700
Tianyue,

359
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,460
is it because of this person

360
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,460
that you've delayed so long

361
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,380
out there?

362
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,340
Actually...

363
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,260
What is his background and identity?

364
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,380
Why is he near

365
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,220
our Lingfeng Street?

366
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,820
Are you aware of all this?

367
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,740
Does he have any ill intentions

368
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,340
or hidden agenda?

369
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,540
You can't just

370
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,620
casually bring someone back like this.

371
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,540
Tianyue,

372
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,900
she's right.

373
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,820
I shouldn't have just shown up
like this.

374
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,460
Sorry for the intrusion.

375
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,500
Don't.

376
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,700
Please wait.

377
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:21,860
Yu,

378
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,860
he came to look for his daughter.

379
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,020
Look for his daughter?

380
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,220
Raise your sword a bit higher.

381
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,620
Your movements need to be precise

382
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,660
and swift.

383
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,620
You must have
a surge of energy inside you.

384
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,540
Your thrusts should be effective

385
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,860
and your momentum consistent.

386
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,500
Don't be so limp, okay?

387
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:47,860
Try again.

388
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,220
Stop.

389
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,220
Squat lower.

390
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,740
What's the matter?

391
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,420
Why can't you
even hold the sword steady?

392
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,180
Didn't I tell you to practice
with more effort?

393
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,820
I practice every day

394
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,100
and put a lot of effort into it.

395
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,780
That means you're still
not putting in enough effort.

396
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,940
As a Spirit-hosted Human,

397
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,380
you still can't summon

398
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,300
your Guardian Primordial Spirit.

399
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,100
If you don't continue to work hard

400
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,140
and strengthen your abilities,

401
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,580
how will you survive

402
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,420
on Rakshasa Street in the future?

403
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,660
Not this again.

404
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,500
It's always the same line,
and it's so irritating.

405
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,420
I'm not going to practice anymore.

406
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,380
Come back.

407
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,740
Stop bothering me.

408
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,980
I know you're the guest

409
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,820
brought back by my uncle,

410
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,940
but I'm in a bad mood

411
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,860
right now.

412
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,660
I thought the Tanghulu

413
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,860
were meant for me.

414
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,260
Why are you eating it?

415
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,500
It was originally for you,

416
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,620
but I changed my mind.

417
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,980
I want to show you

418
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,060
something more interesting.
Is that okay?

419
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,140
What is it?

420
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,940
That's so impressive!

421
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,260
That was nothing.

422
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,260
I was able to do it

423
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,260
even before I had

424
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:12,980
the Guardian Primordial Spirit.

425
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,020
You could do that

426
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,420
without having
the Guardian Primordial Spirit?

427
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,980
In Spiritual Crossroads,

428
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,740
having
a powerful Guardian Primordial Spirit

429
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,700
is definitely advantageous.

430
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,500
However, the strength
of the Spirit-hosted Humans

431
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,260
is also important.

432
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,460
Only when you become stronger

433
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,860
will your Guardian Primordial Spirit

434
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,860
grow stronger.

435
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,220
Do you understand?

436
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,420
Then I must become stronger.

437
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,860
You can definitely do it.

438
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,540
Just like that,

439
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,500
I stayed on Lingfeng Street

440
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,660
for over a month,

441
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,420
and there was still no clue about Shui,

442
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,220
so I decided

443
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,700
to leave Lingfeng Street.

444
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,700
Who is it?

445
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,460
Lingyu.

446
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,700
Beiluo,

447
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,660
do you really intend

448
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,980
to leave tomorrow,

449
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,020
or could you extend your stay a bit?

450
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,180
Previously, I came to Lingfeng Street

451
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,140
with Tianyue

452
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,700
simply to find my daughter.

453
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,940
Since she's not here,

454
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,340
I think I should leave.

455
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:21,940
Actually,

456
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,100
there are some things

457
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,900
I've never told you.

458
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,460
The past cannot be held onto,

459
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,940
and those who have gone
cannot be pursued.

460
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,340
You should think more

461
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,100
about yourself

462
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,980
and not cling to the past.

463
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,620
Maybe

464
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,940
starting a new chapter

465
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,940
in life

466
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,820
would be better.

467
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,500
My daughter means everything to me.

468
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,700
I will never abandon her.

469
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,540
Since that day,

470
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,500
I haven't returned here

471
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,180
or seen Yan Lingyu.

472
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,700
I'm also unsure

473
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,700
how she became

474
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,020
the Spiritual Guardian
of Lingfeng Street.

475
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,700
Profound and reserved,

476
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,780
with a tacit understanding.

477
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,380
That's how adult relationships are.

478
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,620
Cao Yanbing, I told you.

479
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,220
This must be a love story.

480
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,500
Beiluo.

481
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,020
I originally wanted to learn more

482
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,420
about Beiluo's connection
with the Wind-Treading Clan,

483
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,140
but the story turned out to be so long.

484
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,980
If I don't leave now,

485
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,140
I'll miss out on important matters.

486
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,140
Where will the Young General go

487
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,140
to fight the Fire-Eater King?

488
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,460
The gates.

489
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,300
Aren't you supposed
to be in the dungeon?

490
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,220
How come you're here?

491
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,620
Young General, don't get me wrong.

492
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,420
It's me.

493
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,020
We've met each other
in the dungeon earlier.

494
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:18,980
I'm Cao Yanbing.

495
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,220
I'm not planning to flee.

496
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,460
I don't care who you are.

497
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,660
I'm warning you.

498
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,700
Don't try anything funny,

499
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,220
or I'll take your life.

500
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,060
Young General,

501
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,260
let's talk this over calmly.

502
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,220
Forget everything else.

503
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,460
I'll help you deal

504
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,220
with the Fire-Eater King

505
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,300
if you can be my guide.

506
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,220
How does that sound?

507
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,620
If I go fight the Fire-Eater King now,

508
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,180
Lingfeng Street will be just fine.

509
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,780
If I agree to help you,

510
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,220
how is it different from agreeing

511
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:44,980
to help the Fire-Eater King?

512
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,700
The difference is huge.

513
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,700
First of all,

514
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,620
I'm a hundred times better

515
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,460
than the Fire-Eater King
in terms of character,

516
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,260
I won't use Lingfeng Street
as leverage against you.

517
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,860
I'll discuss things with you properly.

518
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,220
If you have concerns, I'll address them.

519
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,460
If you have conditions, I'll meet them.

520
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,980
If all else fails, I'll beg you

521
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,260
until you agree.

522
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:00,780
Also,

523
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,140
I heard you'd drink something

524
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,700
called Blaze Jade,

525
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,780
which indicates you lack confidence

526
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,660
in your own strength.

527
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,700
But I'm different.

528
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,380
My 优酷剧集英语 setting is powerful,

529
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,180
and I have a much better chance
of winning than you.

530
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,260
I'm telling you this to help you.

531
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,940
Bah!

532
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,980
You can't even avoid
my Spirit-Locking Chain

533
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,460
and you say you want to help me?

534
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,500
You should first assess

535
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,620
your own capabilities.

536
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,460
Cao Yanbing

537
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,900
broke the door lock

538
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,860
without saying a word to us

539
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,540
and just ran off alone.

540
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,540
Isn't that too much?

541
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,700
Cao Yanbing is most likely

542
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,860
going to look for Yan Ruofu.

543
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,900
I never expected

544
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,620
that Yan Ruofu

545
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,460
would actually be the guide.

546
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,860
The Yan Ruofu you mentioned,

547
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,140
she's the Young General, right?

548
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,700
Since we don't have

549
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,460
much to do here,

550
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,460
why don't we go and help?

551
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:07,980
Sure.

552
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,260
Let's go.

553
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,500
What are you up to?

554
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,540
Thinking of escaping?

555
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,980
One of you is missing.

556
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,700
Where is he?

557
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,180
Has he already escaped?

558
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,900
General,

559
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,300
I can explain.

560
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,020
We came to Lingfeng Street

561
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,460
to find the guide

562
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,460
for entering the Luhua Ancient Tower.

563
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,300
My friend

564
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,700
learned that the Young General
is the guide,

565
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:47,780
so

566
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,180
he should be heading over
to protect her now.

567
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,220
You can rest assured.

568
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,620
General?

569
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,820
Young General?

570
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,620
From the way you speak,

571
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,340
it seems like you're blaming me

572
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,500
for not recognizing you earlier.

573
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,340
So you mean

574
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,020
you've recognized me now, General?

575
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,540
Otherwise,

576
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,620
why would I have come here alone,

577
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,060
Beiluo?

578
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,220
So you've already

579
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,380
recognized me earlier.

580
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,660
I thought you...

581
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,300
You thought

582
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,420
that even though I clearly
recognized you,

583
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,980
I pretended not to know you,

584
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:33,940
right?

585
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,460
Why would I think like that?

586
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,620
After all, we've been apart

587
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,460
for eight years.

588
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,140
It's normal for our appearances

589
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,940
to change a bit.

590
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,460
Not recognizing each other upon meeting

591
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,620
isn't strange.

592
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,420
All right,

593
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,780
since the misunderstanding

594
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,220
between us

595
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,260
is cleared up,

596
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,740
I feel

597
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,140
comfortable asking you

598
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,100
for help now.

599
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,300
The Fire-Eater King

600
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,740
will arrive soon,

601
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,300
and I know

602
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,860
Ruofu won't stand a chance

603
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,580
against him,

604
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,140
so

605
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,180
I'd like to ask you to help her.

606
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,340
Of course,

607
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,780
my friend

608
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,060
should already be on his way.

609
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:16,580
That won't do.

610
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,700
I don't know that friend of yours.

611
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,020
I don't trust him.

612
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:21,980
I only trust you.

613
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:23,740
Lingyu,

614
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:24,860
stay calm.

615
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,580
Tianyue and I go way back,

616
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,620
and Ruofu is the guide.

617
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,020
Even if you didn't ask,

618
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,940
there's no way

619
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,300
I'd let the Fire-Eater King

620
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,100
cause chaos

621
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,260
in Lingfeng Street.

622
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:35,900
But

623
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,180
there's something
I've been meaning to ask.

624
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,700
Why haven't I seen

625
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,940
Tianyue today?

626
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,300
And why is everyone

627
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,460
calling you General?

628
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,540
Could it be that something
has happened to him?

629
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,060
Don't overthink it.

630
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,180
My brother's situation is a long story.

631
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,980
Once the Fire-Eater King is dealt with,

632
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,700
I'll explain everything to you.

633
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,580
But for now,

634
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,340
we should focus on handling the enemy,
don't you think?

635
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,220
You're right.

636
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,380
There's no time to waste.

637
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,420
Quickly unlock the handcuffs

638
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,580
on me and Xia Ling,

639
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,220
and we'll go find Ruofu immediately.

640
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,460
No.

641
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,260
I can't release her.

642
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,060
You can't release her?

643
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:11,940
Why?

644
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,620
I can't release

645
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,300
all three of you.

646
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,820
I'll have to keep one person here

647
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,540
as a hostage.

648
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,820
Hostage?

649
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,420
Yes.

650
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,460
That's right.

651
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,300
Hostage.

652
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,020
Are you sure you are asking me for help?

653
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,100
You are clearly threatening me.

654
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,100
Beiluo,

655
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,260
please don't hold it against me.

656
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,260
This concerns
the safety of Lingfeng Street,

657
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,540
and I need to make sure

658
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,020
nothing goes wrong.

659
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,380
Since I've agreed to help you,

660
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,620
I'll give it my all.

661
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
You've chosen to trust me,

662
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,140
so why do something so unnecessary?

663
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,580
Unnecessary, you say?

664
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,340
I would like to think so too.

665
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,460
But the world is dangerous now,

666
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,940
and after eight years apart,

667
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,420
how can I be sure

668
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,820
our hearts

669
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,620
are still the same as before?

670
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,420
Lingyu,

671
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,420
I never thought

672
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,620
you would say something like this.

673
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,180
If I had known,

674
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,740
I would have preferred
that you didn't recognize me.

675
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,940
So you mean

676
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,980
you will no longer help me?

677
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,060
I can help you.

678
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,620
But not like this.

679
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,540
Hold on a moment.

680
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,860
I have an idea.

681
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,540
Considering the imminent threat,

682
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,580
we shouldn't let

683
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,300
our differing opinions on the solution

684
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,780
keep us from working together.

685
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,820
How about

686
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,740
you let me go

687
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,540
and keep Beiluo here
as a hostage instead?

688
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,500
How does that sound?

689
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,220
You?

690
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,700
My Guardian Primordial Spirit
is Li Xuanyuan.

691
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,740
I'm a great fighter.

692
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:58,170
[Lingfeng Street]

693
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,980
Where is everyone?

694
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,660
Did the entire Wind-Treading Clan
get wiped out?

695
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,660
Yan Lingyu,

696
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,260
your Wind-Treading Clan

697
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,820
hasn't changed a bit.

698
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,580
It's still so afraid of death.

699
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,900
Do you think hiding away

700
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,620
will help you avoid calamity?

701
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,460
Dream on!

702
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,020
What are you doing? Let go of me!

703
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,660
I know

704
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,740
some of you

705
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,060
are watching from somewhere.

706
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,100
So, open your eyes wide

707
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,860
and listen carefully.

708
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,020
Today,

709
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,420
if you don't hand over the guide,

710
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,900
I'll cut off his head.

711
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,580
Stay put.

712
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,620
And hang it on your village gate.

713
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,700
Don't kill me.

714
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,300
How come it's still locked?

715
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,900
Seriously?

716
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,300
I will only count to three.

717
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,300
One.

718
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,540
Don't kill me.

719
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,580
Two.

720
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,580
Stop!

721
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,820
Let Elder Mei go.

722
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,060
I'll fight with you.

723
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,660
I was wondering who it was.

724
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,580
Isn't this the Young General

725
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,260
in her twenties who still can't summon

726
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,380
a Guardian Primordial Spirit?

727
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,900
Are you fighting me

728
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,740
in a flirtatious way?

729
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,060
Cut the nonsense.

730
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,860
Let Elder Mei go,

731
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,020
and I'll leave your body intact.

732
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,500
Young General, you're very amusing.

733
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,540
The Fire-Eater Clan
and the Wind-Treading Clan

734
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,580
are basically neighbors.

735
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,380
I can help your mother

736
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,940
teach you a lesson.

737
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,100
We're family,

738
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,460
so no need to thank me.

739
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,580
Young General, please go back.

740
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,180
You can't defeat him.

741
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,100
Go back now!

742
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,380
You are no match for him.

743
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:05,900
Elder Mei!

744
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,180
Your hands are pretty soft,

745
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,140
and your legs are decent too.

746
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,540
I'm done with this.

747
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,460
With your half-baked skills,

748
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,180
you're just like the Wind-Treading Clan

749
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,860
who's only fit to be a timid coward.

750
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,500
You're just a bandit.

751
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:29,980
You have no standing

752
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,020
to judge our Wind-Treading Clan.

753
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,540
I'm a bandit?

754
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,500
Back when the Malevolent Beings

755
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,540
invaded Lingfeng Street,

756
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,180
it was our Fire-Eater Clan

757
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,260
that fought at the front.

758
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,020
You Wind-Treading Clan

759
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,380
only dared to hide

760
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,100
behind us and survive.

761
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,500
You've developed well over the years,

762
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,860
and I'm just reclaiming

763
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,500
what originally belonged to me.

764
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,580
Is that wrong?

765
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,100
It's mere sophistry.

766
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,820
It was clearly my mother

767
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,620
who defended Lingfeng Street to the end.

768
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,260
Sophistry?

769
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,460
I didn't even unsheathe my sword

770
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,900
before I knocked you down.

771
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,140
What right do you have to lecture me?

772
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,060
You're just

773
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,580
your mother's little princess,

774
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,300
and you don't understand the ways

775
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,180
