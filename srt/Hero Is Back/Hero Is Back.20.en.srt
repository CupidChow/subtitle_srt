[Episode 20]

18
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,180
The Luhua Ancient Tower

19
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,180
will soon appear.

20
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,020
No matter what,

21
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,940
we must convince Fengzha to guide us.

22
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,820
But he's just been through

23
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,500
an emotional turmoil.

24
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,380
Should we ask him

25
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:09,980
to guide us now?

26
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,980
But when the Tower will appear

27
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,060
is beyond our control.

28
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,220
So whether it's appropriate or not,

29
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,460
we have to go for it.

30
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,420
Besides, it's just a matter

31
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,700
of leading the way.

32
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,780
It should be alright.

The chaos on Lingfeng Street

34
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,500
was our doing.

35
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,660
Will he agree to help?

36
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,220
At least we helped him

37
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,100
subdue Feilian,

38
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,420
gave him his freedom,

39
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,420
and revealed the truth

40
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,300
about his father,

41
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,300
even if that truth

42
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,900
is hard to bear.

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,460
All right.

44
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,020
Let's stop hesitating

45
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
and come up

46
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,340
with a tactful solution.

47
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:51,820
Come in.

Xia Ling,

50
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,020
I noticed you and Mr. Beiluo

51
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,860
weren't in your rooms.

52
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,260
So I figured you might be here.

53
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,900
Come grab a bite.

54
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,540
They look tasty.

55
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,100
How are you feeling?

56
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,380
I bet you've been busy recently.

57
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,580
I'm okay.

58
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,260
Elder Mei has been doing all the work,

59
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,460
and I haven't been able to help much.

60
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,340
You haven't fully recovered yet.

61
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,300
Make sure to get plenty of rest.

62
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,620
Should I have Li Xuanxuan

63
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,300
check on you?

64
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,860
That won't be necessary.
As a trained fighter,

65
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,780
I'm not that delicate.

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,020
That's good.

67
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,660
Well,

68
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,620
that's good to hear.

69
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,940
How's Fengzha doing?

70
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,380
How come he didn't

71
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,140
come along with you?

72
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,180
Tactful.

73
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,100
Fengzha is still very down.

74
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,300
He's been locking himself in his room

75
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,100
and is unwilling to come out.

76
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,900
Since it's his birthday today,

77
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:44,620
I'll make

78
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,180
some of his favorite snacks later

79
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,180
and see if I can get him
to open the door.

80
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,860
Today is his birthday?

00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,540

95
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,380
we didn't mean it that way.

96
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,060
We just wanted to celebrate

97
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,900
your birthday.

98
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,180
We also have some other things planned.

99
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,260
Do you want to check them out?

100
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,340
Fengzha!

101
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,860
So? Has he agreed?

102
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Look at us.

103
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,460
Does this look like he's agreed?

104
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,100
I've already told you.

105
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,300
Singing is okay,

106
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,620
but that dance shouldn't be included.

107
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,140
Maybe

108
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,500
I should cook something tasty for him.

109
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,060
This should help improve
our relationship

110
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,980
and make him agree

111
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,820
to lead the way for us.

112
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,700
I have an idea.

113
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,100
What idea?

114
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,740
Think about it.

115
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,540
What does Fengzha want the most

116
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,460
after being confined for so long?

117
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,460
Watch me.

118
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,740
I was planning
to take Fengzha to the Human Realm

119
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,900
and celebrate his birthday there.

120
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,700
Oh, well,

121
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,860
all our toil, it seems, was in vain.

122
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,260
Never mind.

123
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,340
Fengzha hasn't even been
out of Lingfeng Street.

124
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,700
If he goes to the Human Realm,

125
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,020
with all the overwhelming sights,

126
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,660
he won't be able to cope.

127
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:18,860
Yeah,

128
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,020
I guess we'll just have to go
by ourselves.

129
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,220
Here in Lingfeng Street,

130
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,180
whenever I think

131
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,420
about the movie theaters, food streets,

132
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,940
and amusement parks in the Human Realm,

133
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,460
I can't control my urge to go back.

134
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,020
No, this is it.

135
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,140
I can't wait anymore.

136
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,180
I'm too excited.

137
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,140
I have to go right now.

138
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,860
Let's go.

139
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,460
Let's go.

140
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,460
Let's go.

141
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,300
Where exactly is this Human Realm

142
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,060
you're talking about?

143
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:58,900
Come.

144
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,860
I'll take you there.

145
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:13,700
Fengzha.

146
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,780
This thing

147
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,820
is called a car.

148
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,140
It's like the horses you have.

149
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,460
This will take us outside the barrier
and go down the mountain.

150
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,140
Getting in this
is like mounting a horse.

151
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,940
In a moment, when I press the pedal,

152
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,260
it'll start moving

153
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,620
and take us to our destination.

154
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:32,780
Got it?

155
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,500
Safety belt.

156
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,700
This belt is pretty safe.

157
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,860
This is what we call
fastening a safety belt.

158
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,780
Cao Yanbing,

159
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,740
enough dawdling.

160
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,820
Just get the car moving already.

161
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,420
All right,

162
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:14,980
let's get going.

163
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,060
Fengzha,

164
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,700
this place is an amusement park.

165
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,860
Whatever you want to eat,

166
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,340
drink,

167
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:07,860
or try out,

168
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,580
just let me know

169
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,380
and I'll take care of it for you.

170
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,900
Check out that person in those clothes.

171
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,260
Is he here to shoot a movie?

172
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,860
It looks like

173
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,660
he's cosplaying.

174
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,820
Cosplay?

175
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,580
Hey there,

176
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,180
your outfit

177
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,220
is unique.

178
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:26,780
Mind telling me

179
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,340
which series

180
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,140
the character you're cosplaying is from?

181
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:30,940
Co...

182
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,580
Cos?

183
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:34,900
Hero Is Back.

184
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,900
He's cosplaying Yan Fengzha,
a character from it.

185
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,460
Hero Is Back?

186
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,820
Is it good?

187
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,420
It's good.

188
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,860
Very good.

189
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,900
Especially the male lead in it.

190
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,100
He's super handsome.

191
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,100
Really?

192
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,820
Then I'll check it out later.

193
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,940
Come on,

194
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,820
let's take another picture.

195
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:51,940
Fei...

196
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,180
Thanks. Bye.

197
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,140
Fengzha,

198
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,620
we're in the Human Realm now.

199
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,580
If you want to have a good time,

200
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,900
don't call Feilian again.

201
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,660
Got it?

202
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,420
What's this?

203
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,500
This is called Crazy Circus.

204
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,220
It's really fun.

205
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,100
I'll take you to try it out.

206
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,380
Let's go.

207
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:14,740
Let's go.

208
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,140
Let's go.

209
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,060
But this can be a bit intense.

210
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,140
Try not to be scared.

211
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,620
Fengzha, don't puke on me.

212
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:44,940
Xia Ling.

213
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,500
It's okay.

214
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,220
You'll be fine.

215
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,540
Look, it's not that fast.

216
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,740
No need to be scared.

217
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,260
Yeah, it feels fine.

218
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,580
Fengzha, are you all right?

219
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,620
What do you think? Is this fun?

220
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,540
Yes!

221
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,340
Cao Yanbing.

222
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,820
We've already been on the roller coaster

223
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,100
and the pirate ship.

224
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,380
The remaining options
are the drop tower,

225
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,180
the water slide, and the U-shaped slide.

226
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,660
Which one should we try next?

227
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,020
Cao Yanbing, what are you doing?

228
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,780
Don't be so childish.

229
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,700
Surprise!

230
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,460
Fengzha.

231
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,580
We wish you a...

232
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,340
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

233
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,180
What are you guys doing?

234
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,860
This is called a birthday cake.

235
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,500
In a moment, you'll put

236
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,420
a candle on it,

237
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,220
make a wish,

238
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,420
and then blow it out.

239
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,620
This is a classic birthday tradition

240
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,900
in the Human Realm.

241
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,020
Make a wish?

242
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,420
Can you help me make it come true?

243
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,100
That's right.

244
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,580
We'll do our best to help

245
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,980
with whatever we can manage.

246
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,260
Kid,

247
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,900
whatever wish you might have,

248
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,820
feel free to tell us.

249
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,980
We've been through a lot together,

250
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,980
so we're friends now.

251
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,300
And who knows?

252
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,620
We could

253
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,060
be traveling companions in the future.

254
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,540
Yes.

255
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,780
No need to hold back.

256
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:31,900
Traveling?

257
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,580
I understand now.

258
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,340
All this birthday celebration

259
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,860
and helping me

260
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,740
fulfill my wish

261
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,420
is nothing but a facade.

262
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,340
Your real aim

263
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,340
is to travel with me.

264
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,420
Fengzha,

265
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,740
you're right.

266
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,460
We…

267
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,140
It's good that you admit it.

268
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,420
If you want me to lead the way,
just say so.

269
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,980
There's no need

270
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,180
to go through all this trouble.

271
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,340
I'd rather be alone

272
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,460
than deal

273
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,660
with this fake concern and company.

274
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,300
I'm not used to eating this stuff,

275
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,260
so enjoy it yourselves.

276
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,820
It's over.

277
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,140
We messed it up.

278
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,820
My bad.

279
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,620
I shouldn't have mentioned

280
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,500
traveling together with him.

281
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,820
It's not really about who said what.

282
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,460
The real problem

283
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,740
is that our intentions were never pure.

284
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,500
But we truly

285
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,220
wanted to make him happy.

286
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,060
We truly wanted him

287
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,300
to be our guide too.

288
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,860
Never mind. I'll take care of it.

289
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,700
Why are you here?

290
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:52,940
I admit

291
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,660
our intentions were never pure.

292
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,220
and I apologize.

293
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,060
I'm sorry.

294
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,340
However,

295
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,340
the three of us

296
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,900
genuinely want you

297
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,340
to have a happy birthday.

298
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,060
Since you mentioned leading the way,

299
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,220
then let me be honest.

300
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,780
I sincerely

301
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,140
want to ask you

302
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,100
to guide me to Luhua Ancient Tower

303
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,140
because my mother is trapped inside,

304
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,980
and I need to rescue her.

305
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,380
Your mother
is inside Luhua Ancient Tower?

306
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,740
How did you know?

307
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,300
She came to Lingfeng Street
ten years ago

308
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,060
and entered the Ancient Tower.

309
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,780
Later, I saw her in the memory

310
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,660
of her Guardian Primordial Spirit.

311
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,220
I'm very sure

312
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,300
she's inside the tower.

313
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,260
Ten years ago?

314
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,380
Well,

315
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,860
did you see anyone else?

316
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,900
Not really.

317
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:49,900
What's the matter?

318
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,740
Fengzha,

319
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,180
I have a younger brother.

320
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:05,820
When our mom

321
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,660
had her accident,

322
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,260
he was just a little kid,

323
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,660
always following me around,

324
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,780
asking

325
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,500
where our mom was,

326
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,420
and

327
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,380
when she'd come back.

328
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,940
As he grew older,

329
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,340
he stopped asking.

330
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,060
I thought

331
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,420
he had come to terms

332
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,420
with what happened to our mom.

333
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,140
But one day,

334
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,420
he suddenly asked me,

335
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,420
"Yanbing,

336
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,140
do you still remember

337
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,300
what mom looked like?

338
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,900
I don't remember anymore."

339
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,460
I won't mention anything else for now.

340
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,700
Just on this matter,

341
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,500
how can I avoid
going to Luhua Ancient Tower?

342
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,660
Fengzha,

343
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,620
I hope you can help us.

344
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,780
It's okay

345
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,180
if you don't agree right away.

346
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,820
I'm very patient,

347
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,540
and until Luhua Ancient Tower appears,

348
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,100
I'll keep bothering you.

349
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,500
You won't be able to shake me off.

350
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,260
Who cares?

351
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,460
I'm exhausted. I'm heading home.

352
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,900
Liang,

353
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,780
how is everything
on Rakshasa Street recently?

354
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,940
He never asks me about stuff like this.

355
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,500
What's going on today?

356
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,900
He must be thinking of me

357
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,140
but is too shy to speak up.

358
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,100
Let's take a break.

359
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,060
I'm beat from walking around all day.

360
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,380
How did it go with Fengzha?

361
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,540
Is he willing to guide us?

362
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,820
He hasn't given me a clear answer yet,

363
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,380
but I've let him know

364
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,020
that I'll keep bothering him

365
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,700
until the Ancient Tower appears.

366
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,860
What else can I do?

367
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:31,900
I'll just have to go all out,

368
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,300
put my pride aside,

369
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,700
and plead with him.

370
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,820
Ruofu.

371
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,460
I heard

372
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,700
you took Fengzha

373
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,780
to the Human Realm for some fun today.

374
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,460
Thanks a lot

375
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,420
for the trouble.

376
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,740
That's no trouble at all.

377
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:55,820
I'm not sure

378
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,020
if he had a good time,

379
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,700
but

380
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,940
it must have been pretty unforgettable.

381
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,460
You took Fengzha out today,

382
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,460
and besides celebrating his birthday,

383
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,180
you probably

384
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,660
wanted to talk to him

385
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,100
about whether he could be your guide.

386
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,700
I'd like to talk to you

387
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,340
about this as well.

388
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,780
Please go ahead.

389
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,460
Based

390
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,660
on experience,

391
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,860
once the guide reaches the Voidwood

392
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,580
and points out the location
of the Ancient Tower,

393
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,060
they can return.

394
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,500
That's why my uncle

395
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,300
agreed to let Qiao lead the way.

396
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
But unexpectedly,

397
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,660
Qiao,

398
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,820
who is Fengzha's older sister,

399
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,580
never came back,

400
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,420
and everyone assumed

401
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,740
she was dead.

402
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,060
We suspect

403
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,540
something must have happened

404
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,460
in the Voidwood

405
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,380
that would endanger the guide's life.

406
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,580
That's probably why

407
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,980
my mother didn't want you

408
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,060
to find Fengzha.

409
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,060
You're going to the Ancient Tower

410
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,500
for your loved ones,

411
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,180
but for Fengzha,

412
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,620
it could mean risking his life.

413
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,900
I know

414
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,580
you came to Lingfeng Street

415
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,580
to find the guide,

416
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,100
but as Fengzha's cousin

417
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,980
and his only remaining family,

418
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,340
I urge you to reconsider.

419
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,420
Is it really necessary

420
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,020
for Fengzha to guide you?

421
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,420
What are you thinking about?

422
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,460
I'm thinking

423
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,420
about what my mom

424
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,260
would do in this situation.

425
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,620
Then I'll also think

426
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,180
about what

427
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,740
my dad would do.

428
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,180
I don't even need to think about it.

429
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,420
He would tell me

430
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,300
to hurry back

431
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,340
because it's too dangerous here.

432
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,100
Fair enough.

433
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,780
Well,

434
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,580
let's not worry about what our parents
would think.

435
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,220
After all, this is our issue

436
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,980
to deal with,

437
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,260
and ultimately,

438
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,500
we have to make the decision

439
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,420
ourselves.

440
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,980
I want to know

441
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,700
the reason behind my father's death,

442
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,020
why he left without saying goodbye,

443
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,380
and why his death was so mysterious.

444
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,940
All the answers can only be obtained

445
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,020
by entering the Ancient Tower.

446
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,460
You and Beiluo

447
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,620
have even more reasons to go there.

448
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,660
But

449
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,660
I do understand

450
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,180
why Ruofu doesn't want Fengzha
to take risks.

451
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,260
That's true,

452
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,540
but we've already considered

453
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,580
everyone's stance on this matter.

454
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,100
Wait,

455
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,980
there's one more person.

456
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,940
- Yan Fengzha.
- Yan Fengzha.

457
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,180
Yes,

458
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,780
your thoughts,

459
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,940
my and Beiluo's thoughts,

460
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,020
and Ruofu's thoughts

461
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,140
are all valid,

462
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,900
but they aren't Fengzha's thoughts.

463
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,660
Fengzha is the guide,

464
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,900
so whether or not

465
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,700
he will go to the Voidwood

466
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,260
should be up to him.

467
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,020
By the way, Xia Ling,

468
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,660
do you remember

469
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,180
that Fengzha had a wish he almost made

470
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:12,980
at the amusement park

471
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,060
but held back?

472
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,900
I think

473
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,940
he might have his plans.

474
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,460
Let's go

475
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,580
meet up with Beiluo.

476
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,420
Why?

477
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,980
Let's go find Beiluo

478
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,380
and analyze the thoughts and emotions

479
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,740
of the Wind-Treading Clan teenager,

480
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,900
as well as his adolescent mindset.

481
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,300
Qiao,

482
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,460
I went

483
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,420
to the Human Realm today.

484
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,780
There's a place

485
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
called an amusement park,

486
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,780
and it's really fun.

487
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,860
Qiao, what brings you here?

488
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,620
It's so early.

489
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,900
The sun's barely up.

490
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,460
Fengzha,

491
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,860
I'm about to leave.

492
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,220
I came to see you before I go.

493
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,180
Leave?

494
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,980
Where are you going?

495
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,180
I'm off to the Voidwood

496
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,340
to guide some people

497
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,060
and find the Luhua Ancient Tower.

498
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,300
Luhua Ancient Tower?

499
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,900
Isn't that the place

500
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,660
where Father said
terrifying deities reside?

501
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:23,940
Qiao,

502
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,500
when will you be back?

503
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,620
If it's just showing them the way,

504
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,140
it should only take a day or two, right?

505
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,740
Qiao,

506
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,340
what's wrong?

507
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,020
Why aren't you saying anything?

508
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,500
Fengzha,

509
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,460
you need to hear me out.

510
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,340
Even though I'm going

511
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,780
to assist others as a guide,

512
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,380
I have

513
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,980
additional plans.

514
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,980
I also want to explore
the Luhua Ancient Tower.

515
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,060
What?

516
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,460
Qiao, you can't go.

517
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,420
Fengzha,

518
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,420
your Guardian Primordial Spirit

519
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,620
is named Feilian.

520
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,460
Ancient texts record it

521
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,900
as a divine beast of my clan.

522
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,740
Although the deities
in the Ancient Tower

523
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,020
are terrifying,

524
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,420
they've been protecting our clan

525
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,660
for generations.

526
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,780
I don't think

527
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,300
they'll make things difficult for me.

528
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,660
If I can gain

529
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,460
their guidance,

530
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,260
you may have a chance

531
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,220
to gain your freedom.

532
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,020
You're doing all this for me.

533
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,540
Please don't go, Qiao.

534
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,980
Fengzha,

535
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,380
think about it.

536
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,140
If you can control Feilian,

537
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,500
you won't have to stay locked

538
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,660
in this small room

539
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,340
with chains every day

540
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,420
and have no freedom.

541
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,540
I don't want freedom anymore.

542
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,780
Qiao, please don't go.

543
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,060
Fengzha,

544
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,620
I promise you

545
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,460
that I will come back alive.

546
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,180
There, there,

547
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,340
stop crying now.

548
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,140
While I'm away,

549
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,060
focus on your training

550
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,060
and wait for my return,

551
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,220
okay?

552
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,460
It's settled then.

553
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,500
Qiao.

554
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,740
Qiao, don't go.

555
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:31,980
Fengzha,

556
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,260
however reluctant you are,

557
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,900
I'm going
to the Luhua Ancient Tower today.

558
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,460
It only appears

559
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,660
once every ten years,

560
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,100
and I don't want to miss it.

561
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,060
No.

562
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,500
Fengzha,

563
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,260
I'm giving you

564
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,420
this Moon and Star Pendant.

565
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,180
It has

566
00:26:59,180 --> 00:26:59,900
a little spell I cast

567
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,060
with my Primordial Spirit Power.

568
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,220
If it keeps glowing,

569
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,020
it means I'm still around.

570
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,900
Let it keep you company

571
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,620
while I'm away.

572
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,580
Qiao,

573
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,580
if possible,

574
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,220
I hope to take you

575
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,020
to an amusement park someday.

576
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,340
That

577
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,540
is my birthday wish.

578
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,620
Fengzha,

579
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:10,940
it's me.

580
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,300
I didn't come here today

581
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,740
to debate

582
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,660
about whether you should be our guide

583
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,780
but to talk about your sister.

584
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,460
I know

585
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,380
that ten years ago,

586
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,460
your sister went to the Voidwood

587
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,260
to lead the way

588
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,660
and never returned.

589
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,380
Everyone thinks

590
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,220
something went wrong

591
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,100
in the forest

592
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,260
and she lost her life.

593
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,220
Ruofu told me this

594
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,620
out of concern for your safety.

595
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,460
She didn't want you
to go to the forest and guide us.

596
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,020
But if I put myself in your shoes,

597
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,740
I think you probably

598
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,580
care more

599
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,220
about your sister's safety

600
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,740
than your own.

601
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,460
Otherwise,

602
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,340
you wouldn't have asked me
at the amusement park

603
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:46,980
if I saw anyone else

604
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,060
in the memory

605
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,180
of my mother's
Guardian Primordial Spirit.

606
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:50,940
So,

607
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,300
I guess

608
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,940
you've always suspected

609
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,940
that your sister

610
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,820
didn't just go to guide the way

611
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,340
but went into the Luhua Ancient Tower

612
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,900
and got trapped

613
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,820
with my mother's group.

614
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,460
So, Fengzha,

615
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,060
here's my suggestion.

616
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,380
If you

617
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,020
want to rescue your sister
from the Ancient Tower,

618
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,220
all three of us can help.

619
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:14,940
But

620
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,380
you'll need

621
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,180
to guide us.

622
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,740
I promise

623
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,500
I'll protect you

624
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,140
through any danger.

625
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,340
Whatever the difficulties

626
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,060
or challenges,

627
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,060
as long as your sister is alive,

628
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,340
I'll make sure

629
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,380
she gets out

630
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,700
and reunites with you

631
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,580
in Lingfeng Street.

632
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,540
I, Cao Yanbing,

633
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,340
always keep my promises.

634
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,620
Maybe I guessed wrong,

635
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,740
but it's okay.

636
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,660
Fengzha,

637
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,220
if you have any wishes,

638
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,660
feel free to tell us.

639
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,300
As long as we can make it happen,

640
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,980
we definitely will.

641
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,300
Could it be

642
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,100
that I guessed wrong?

643
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,740
Or was I not sincere enough?

644
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,300
I think he simply didn't hear
anything you said.

645
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,380
Let's just go inside.

646
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,300
Fengzha,

647
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,220
we're coming in.

648
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,300
Fengzha?

649
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,460
He's not here.

650
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,670
[Yan Fengzha]

651
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,300
Ruofu,

652
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,660
by the time you read this letter,

653
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,460
I will have already left Lingfeng Street

654
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,100
for Luhua Ancient Tower.

655
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,220
I'm sorry

656
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,620
I didn't tell you the truth.

657
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,260
Back then, my sister

658
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,700
didn't just go into the forest
to guide people.

659
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,940
She also went into the tower for me,

660
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,140
which is why she never came back.

661
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:16,820
Now

662
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,060
that I can control Feilian,

663
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,380
I must go find her.

664
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,700
I believe she's still alive,

665
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,500
and when I find her,

666
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,500
we can show her

667
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,020
how much we've grown

668
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,980
as we agreed.

669
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,700
She'll be so happy to see us.

670
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:38,900
Also,

671
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,660
if Cao Yanbing bothers you,

672
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,220
just tell him

673
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,540
I find him too annoying

674
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,340
and don't want to travel with him.

675
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,300
If they want to go to the tower,

676
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,060
they'll have to catch up by themselves.

677
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,300
So Fengzha

678
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,220
wants to go to Luhua Ancient Tower

679
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,500
to bring Qiao back.

680
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,380
If he doesn't at least try,

681
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,700
he'll probably never
be able to let it go.

682
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,700
In that sense,

683
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,180
he's a lot like you.

684
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,140
Exactly.

685
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:10,860
Otherwise,

686
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,380
how could I have guessed his thoughts

687
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,540
so accurately?

688
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,380
Since going to Luhua Ancient Tower

689
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,740
is his own decision,

690
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,020
I'll leave him in your care.

691
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:29,980
Don't worry.

692
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,460
Even though he didn't hear it,

693
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,380
I've already promised him

694
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,180
that I will bring him back safely,

695
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,620
regardless of the difficulties

696
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,500
and challenges.

697
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:40,940
It's a deal.

698
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,580
It's a deal.

699
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,260
High-fiving to seal the deal?
Are we kids or something?

700
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,860
Elder Mei, you are...

701
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,220
From now on,

702
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,780
General,
you will be the Spiritual Guardian

703
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,580
of Lingfeng Street.

704
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,060
This bow is my gesture
of respect to you.

705
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,060
The future of the Wind-Treading Clan

706
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,700
now rests on your shoulders.

707
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,700
This is the General's Chain

708
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,340
of Lingfeng Street.

709
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,180
Please accept it,

710
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,100
General Ruofu.

711
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:36,400
[Lingfeng]

712
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,220
- General.
- General.

713
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,180
Mother, rest assured.

714
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,500
I will certainly protect Lingfeng Street

715
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,780
and be a good Spiritual Guardian.

716
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,260
Xia Ling,

717
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,980
I will await your return.

718
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,060
Don't worry,

719
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:08,860
it won't be too long.

720
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,500
I'll come back and drink with you.

721
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,180
General.

722
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,500
- General.
- General.

723
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,860
You must all come back together.

724
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,140
[Tiangang Hall]

725
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:38,740
Chief,

726
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,900
Cao Yanbing and the other two

727
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,340
have set out today

728
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,700
for the Voidwood

729
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,860
to catch up with the guide.

730
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,860
They should soon arrive

731
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,380
at the final destination,

732
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,980
the Luhua Ancient Tower.

733
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,220
Great.

734
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,100
It seems their journey

735
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,100
is going quite smoothly.

736
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,540
He's just a pawn.

737
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,700
Without you

738
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,340
guiding him every step,

739
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,620
Cao Yanbing
would likely have been dead already.

740
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,900
As for the Luhua Ancient Tower,

741
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,020
Xuanma,

742
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,020
you'll enter with me.

743
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,460
We will proceed according to the plan.

744
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:16,940
Yes, Chief.

745
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:17,860
Also,

746
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,260
regarding the malevolent aura

747
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,140
surrounding Cao Yanbing,

748
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,940
be sure to keep a close watch

749
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,340
to avoid any unforeseen complications.

750
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,060
Understood.

751
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,220
Once we enter the Ancient Tower,

752
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,180
I'll make sure to monitor him closely

753
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,820
to prevent any unforeseen changes.

754
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,500
Let's look forward to what happens

755
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,460
inside the Ancient Tower.

756
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,980
The world

757
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,500
is about to change.

758
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,850
[Voidwood]

759
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,900
Beyond this point

760
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,340
is the Voidwood territory.

761
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,580
The forest is so enormous

762
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,620
that finding the Luhua Ancient Tower

763
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,100
still requires a guide,

764
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,500
even without any illusions.

765
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,940
We haven't seen Yan Fengzha

766
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,620
along the way.

767
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:19,780
What should we do?

768
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,780
Moreover, if we don't enter soon,

769
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,980
we'll run out of time.

770
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,580
Whether we have a guide

771
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,260
or not,

772
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,740
I am determined to find

773
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,580
the Luhua Ancient Tower.

774
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,620
Haven't you noticed

775
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,980
that since Fengzha obtained Feilian,

776
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,700
he's become unusually arrogant?

777
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,220
Doesn't he realize

778
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,980
that the power
of a Guardian Primordial Spirit

779
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,020
depends on the Spirit-hosted Human?

780
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,580
With his skills,

781
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,540
if he entered

782
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,380
the Luhua Ancient Tower alone,

783
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,700
he'd be killed in no time

784
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,420
and wouldn't even have time
to regret it.

785
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,860
Killed in no time?

786

Are you willing to come out now?

789
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:03,980
Fengzha,

790
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,580
why are you still at the entrance?

791
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,380
Didn't you set out

792

793
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,500
