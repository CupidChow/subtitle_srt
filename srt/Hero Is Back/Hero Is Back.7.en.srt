384
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,540
There's a wanted poster for you.

385
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,020
Look at him.

386
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,220
Now look at me.

387
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,050
[Cao Yanbing. Similarity: 0%]

388
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,460
No wonder you dare to walk in the street

389
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,460
without any worries.

390
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,780
I told you

391
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,580
Spiritual Crossroads are undeveloped.

392
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,300
Portraits instead of photos.

393
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,060
What's the point of issuing a warrant?

394
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,820
Then why are you hiding?

395
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,300
You could go anywhere.

396
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,820
There's one place I can't go.

397
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:54,780
Where?

398
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,540
Rakshasa Street.

399
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,860
There are so many Spiritual Crossroads.

400
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,140
I can go anywhere

401
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,220
except for Rakshasa Street.

402
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,140
I'd like to ask you a question.

403
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,300
Shoot.

404
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,820
Why can we also

405
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,500
eat food in the Border Realm?

406
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,260
You've been in Spiritual Crossroads

407
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,620
for quite a long time.

408
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,500
Why did that come up

409
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,540
all of a sudden?

410
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,940
Because I want to know

411
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,340
more about Spiritual Crossroads.

412
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,820
I mean if...

413
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,940
If I return to Hanxian Street,

414
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,460
I'd like to help out.

415
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,540
Okay.

416
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,940
Today, I will

417
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,300
fill you in on that.

418
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,820
Okay.

419
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,300
Look at this.

420
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,060
This looks like noodles.

421
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,460
It tastes delicious, too.

422
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,100
But after it goes

423
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,140
into our stomach,

424
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,340
it converts

425
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,340
into a small boost

426
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,700
for our Primordial Spirit Power.

427
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,700
The Primordial Spirit Power
we use every day

428
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,460
can be slightly supplemented

429
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,580
by eating these.

430
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,980
So it means that these noodles

431
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,780
contain zero fat and zero calories?

432
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,300
I won't get fat eating these?

433
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,740
This perspective

434
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,780
is quite unique.

435
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,620
Theoretically speaking,

436
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,260
it is true.

437
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,740
That's great.

438
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,940
Are you done with your questions?

439
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,620
Actually, I have

440
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,300
another question.

441
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,060
Why do I see

442
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,220
people wearing

443
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,740
different types of clothes

444
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,740
on each Spiritual Crossroad?

445
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,380
They even look like

446
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,820
they're from different eras.

447
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,060
Of course.

448
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,060
Spiritual Crossroads are

449
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,220
just like the Human Realm.

450
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,340
On every street,

451
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,620
there are their own customs.

452
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,060
Gradually, they all find

453
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,860
their own style.

454
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,100
And the style of the street tends

455
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,780
to be influenced
by its Spiritual Guardian.

456
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,500
Some of the Spiritual Guardians

457
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,780
have lived on Spiritual Crossroads
for generations.

458
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,540
They've been away from the Human Realm

459
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,780
for hundreds of years.

460
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,780
Naturally, each street gives

461
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,500
the impression of a different era.

462
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,540
All Right.

463
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,300
Time to get back to work.

464
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:28,820
Are you sure?

465
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,460
Another update letter?

466
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,500
On our way here,

467
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,780
we've sent many update letters.

468
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,060
Beiluo never replied.

469
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,780
I think we should ask someone.

470
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,780
Maybe he didn't see our update letters

471
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,620
for some reason.

472
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,060
Let's try again.

473
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,380
We'll see.

474
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,140
Beiluo Shimen.

475
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,740
I've told you.

476
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,900
We should ask someone.

477
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,660
What if Beiluo

478
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,660
accidentally lost

479
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,380
his update letter?

480
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,740
He didn't reply to any of my letters.

481
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,700
That is weird.

482
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,860
By any account,

483
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,060
inquiring with others

484
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,700
seems a safer bet.

485
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,860
Think about it.

486
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,100
Beiluo loves drinking so much.

487
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,580
We should find a tavern.

488
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,140
The tavern keeper

489
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,300
must know something about it.

490
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,100
This tavern serves

491
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,460
so many people every day.

492
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,180
What can the keeper possibly remember?

493
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,260
I think we should

494
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,620
ask some wanderers.

495
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,060
For example...

496
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:57,940
He is...

497
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,860
Come on, let's go.

498
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,740
Consider those wanderers,

499
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,340
who seem to have faced challenges.

500
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,500
They may know the answer.

501
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,340
Will that work?

502
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:21,780
Let's go.

503
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,860
Their food tastes good.

504
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,740
Let's come again.

505
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,620
Okay.

506
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,660
Very tasty.

507
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,540
Here.

508
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,300
Sir, please come inside.

509
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,940
Who are you?

510
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,020
Misters,

511
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,500
fate brought us together.

512
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,540
Let's be friends.

513
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,660
We are from other places.

514
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,300
We don't know much of Leiquan Street.

515
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,460
You two look like

516
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,700
you know this place

517
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,780
and your way around.

518
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,260
Here,

519
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,220
misters.

520
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,580
This money is my gift

521
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,220
for you to buy a drink.

522
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,060
Flattery without reason

523
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,620
is either a trick or a trap.

524
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,900
If you need something, just say it.

525
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,300
We can afford

526
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
our own drinks.

527
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,300
Misters,

528
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,940
that's very kind

529
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,020
and moral of you

530
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,540
to help us for nothing.

531
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,580
Xia Ling,

532
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,140
tell these misters

533
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:43,980
about the man we're looking for.

534
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,700
Here is the thing.

535
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,500
The friend we're looking for

536
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,020
is

537
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,420
a man in his forties.

538
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,100
He is tall and burly

539
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,700
and new to Leiquan Street.

540
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,780
Have you seen him?

541
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,260
No idea.

542
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:57,900
Doesn't ring any bell.

543
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,380
Piss off.

544
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,460
Don't rush us out just yet.

545
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,500
She wasn't specific enough.

546
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,780
Allow me to add more details.

547
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,620
Our friend

548
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,580
is a Spirit-hosted Human,

549
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,380
whose Guardian Primordial Spirit

550
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,340
is a big monkey.

551
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,900
Does it ring any bells?

552
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:18,980
Are you

553
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,460
new here?

554
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:21,620
Yes.

555
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,180
Why do you want to find that friend?

556
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,500
Here is the fact.

557
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,820
The street we used to live on

558
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,060
is taken by Malevolent Beings.

559
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,420
We have no choice

560
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,580
but to ask him for help.

561
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,060
The friend you mentioned

562
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,140
sounds familiar.

563
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:42,860
We remember him.

564
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,380
Really?

565
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,180
So can you take us to him?

566
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:47,900
The road is a bit winding.

567
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,340
It's a little far.

568
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,420
You know what?

569
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,780
If you buy us drinks,

570
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,300
we will help you

571
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,620
and take you to him.

572
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:55,900
No problem.

573
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,020
Sir,

574
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:57,780
more brew here.

575
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,540
Coming.

576
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,100
Dude, brew.

577
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:01,580
Okay.

578
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,140
Misters,

579
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,260
we've been walking for so long.

580
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,180
We still haven't arrived yet?

581
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,500
Stop nagging with questions.

582
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,740
Do you want to find him or not?

583
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,580
Exactly.

584
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,620
I do. I want to find him.

585
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,980
If you do, then don't nag.

586
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,060
Just follow us.

587
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,500
Okay.

588
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:37,780
This is it.

589
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,420
Go inside.

590
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,860
All right. Thank you.

591
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,820
Misters,

592
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,260
where are we?

593
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,100
There's no such thing as a free favor.

594
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:02,540
Sir,

595
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,860
would you mind turning around first?

596
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,020
There's no such thing as a free favor.

597
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,100
If you want news

598
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,540
of your friend,

599
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,340
first hand over

600
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,100
whatever is valuable on you.

601
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,820
Hand over.

602
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:19,860
Sir,

603
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,140
please don't do this.

604
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,180
I don't have any money.

605
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,060
No money at all.

606
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,740
No money?

607
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,820
If you don't have money,

608
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,180
we won't go easy on you.

609
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,580
Hey man,

610
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,980
that guy is

611
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:31,540
yours to handle.

612
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,060
I'll deal

613
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,500
with the girl.

614
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,500
Are you sure you want to fight me?

615
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,300
I...

616
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,020
I'm sure.

617
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,180
Are you sure?

618
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:45,820
Yeah.

619
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,980
We've said everything.

620
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,580
Everything.

621
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,660
- Really.
- Everything.

622
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,300
We've said everything.

623
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:55,740
We've said everything.

624
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,580
These two guys

625
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,500
are way

626
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,740
too weak.

627
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,100
And you got addicted

628
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,740
to playing along with them.

629
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,820
We've wasted so much time

630
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,060
on these two punks.

631
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,980
It's rare to see someone so stupid.

632
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,420
They have been beaten

633
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,100
by Beiluo.

634
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,260
They didn't learn whatsoever.

635
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,740
How dare they lie to us!

636
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,380
They deserved another beating.

637
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,340
How do you know

638
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,580
they know where Beiluo is?

639
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,020
It's obvious.

640
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,100
You know how Shi Lingming

641
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,900
usually fights.

642
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,420
Once he gets excited,

643
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,540
he likes to hold people by the arm

644
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,660
and shake around.

645
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,260
That arm is going to break for sure.

646
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,100
The so-called

647
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,180
wanderers.

648
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,340
All this time,

649
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,580
you were messing with me.

650
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,300
We've got the answer, haven't we?

651
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,180
Come on.

652
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,300
Leigong Temple. That's where Beiluo is.

653
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,100
Do you mean

654
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,020
he left

655
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,020
and never came back?

656
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,260
After he saved us yesterday,

657
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,580
he took the brew and went out.

658
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,180
He never came back.

659
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,820
Looks like the trail went cold.

660
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,900
We'll have to wait here.

661
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:57,980
You just said

662
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,180
that he left with the brew.

663
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,860
Has he been drinking lately?

664
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,820
He's drunk every day.

665
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,820
He goes to taverns for drinks every day.

666
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,100
Did you hear that?

667
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:08,980
Taverns.

668
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,740
The big guy you talk about

669
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,020
sounds familiar.

670
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,420
He is dressed in rags

671
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:20,820
like a vagrant,

672
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,620
but he has money for drinks every day.

673
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,980
He comes here for drinks

674
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,740
every day.

675
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,860
Dressed in rags

676
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,860
like a vagrant?

677
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,140
Does it sound like Beiluo to you?

678
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,260
We'll know when we see him.

679
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,140
Sir,

680
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,580
will this man come later?

681
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,820
That's weird.

682
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,540
Normally,

683
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,300
he comes here every day.

684
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,180
Why hasn't he come yet?

685
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:06,180
[Mengquan Pavilion]

686
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,340
Why don't you two

687
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,380
take a rest here

688
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,780
and try our specialty,

689
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,300
Mengquan Brew?

690
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,420
It is very mellow

691
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,820
and has

692
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,820
a special effect.

693
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,020
Special effect?

694
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,300
The brew is made

695
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,580
with the Mengquan water

696
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,860
of Leiquan Street.

697
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,820
The water

698
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,540
is very amazing.

699
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,420
The water is only available
during these days.

700
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,540
Whoever

701
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,340
drinks the Mengquan water

702
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,860
will have very nice dreams.

703
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,100
The more one drinks,

704
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,340
the longer the dream lasts.

705
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,100
Dad, look over there.

706
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,580
I'll want that balloon later.

707
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,420
All right.

708
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,220
Dad,

709
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,620
you said

710
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,660
you'd spend your whole day

711
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,780
with me today.

712
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,860
Do you mean it?

713
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:47,780
Of course.

714
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,220
Not just today.

715
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,380
I promise I'll spend

716
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:50,980
every day with you.

717
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,860
That's great.

718
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,060
Then

719
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,780
later I want to go play

720
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,460
the pirate ship and roller coaster.

721
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,860
The pirate ship and roller coaster?

722
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,700
No problem.

723
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,900
Today we will play

724
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,740
all the facilities

725
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,500
they have.

726
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:03,780
Make it twice.

727
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,740
Thrice.

728
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,100
Okay.

729
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,500
But one can't drink too much.

730
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,700
After all, if not waking up
from the dream,

731
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,060
he would die.

732
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,860
Guys,

733
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,140
[Meng]
would you like to try it?

734
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,740
I promise you'll like it.

735
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,740
Cao Yanbing, the update letter.

736
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,460
It's Beiluo.

737
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,460
Meet me at Mengquan.

738
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,260
He's at Mengquan.

739
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,100
Let's go find him now.

740
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:15,900
It's Beiluo.

741
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,100
Beiluo.

742
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,500
Beiluo.

743
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,780
He doesn't look hurt.

744
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,780
I think he just passed out.

745
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,380
Did he really drink

746
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,380
the Mengquan water?

747
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:43,620
Beiluo.

748
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,060
Beiluo, wake up.

749
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,620
Can you hear us?

750
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,300
Beiluo.

751
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,100
Beiluo.

752
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,420
Beiluo, wake up.

753
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,940
Cao Yanbing,

754
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,060
