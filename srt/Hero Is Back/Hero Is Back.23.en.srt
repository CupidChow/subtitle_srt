00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,500
those Spiritual Guardians.

193
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,940
So this eternal nightmare…

194
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,580
The other three Lords

195
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,780
harbored a strong hatred for humans,

196
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,500
and my aid to Xia Qifeng

197
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,580
provoked their wrath.

198
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,020
At the same time,

199
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,180
Xia Qifeng's deep remorse and pain

200
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,580
upon discovering that all his companions

201
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,100
had been turned to stone

202
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,660
was used by the three Lords

203
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,860
to create the nightmare

204
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,220
and trap me.

205
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,900
And Xia Qifeng,

206
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,860
as the owner of the nightmare,

207
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,820
remained asleep here.

208
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,620
So it turns out that not only my mother

209
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,500
but many others

210
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,500
were also turned into stone back then.

211
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:40,820
Anyway,

212
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,460
Flower Lord,

213
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,780
I still want to say thank you.

214
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,740
Thank you for saving my dad.

215
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,260
The matter here is settled.

216
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,860
It's time for you to go downstairs

217
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,660
and reunite with your friend.

218
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,260
Beiluo.

219
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:58,940
Beiluo.

220
00:10:59,340 --> 00:10:59,700
Beiluo.

221
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,620
Cao Yanbing. Xia Ling.

222
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,020
How are you doing?

223
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:03,820
Are you all right?

224
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,700
We're fine.

225
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,620
What about you?

226
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,820
Has the poison been neutralized?

227
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,580
It's been neutralized.

228
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,660
I've already heard

229
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,860
from the Flower Lord
about the nightmare.

230
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,340
Thanks to both of you,

231
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,060
the nightmare has been resolved.

232
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:13,900
Otherwise,

233
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,980
dying mysteriously in a dream

234
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,180
would have been truly tragic.

235
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,220
By the way, Xia Ling,

236
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,900
I've also heard

237
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,900
about your father's situation.

238
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,900
How is he now?

239
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,460
My dad's Primordial Spirit Power

240
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,060
was depleted,

241
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,420
and he was almost beyond saving.

242
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,340
Thankfully,
the Flower Lord stepped in to help.

243
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,100
I should be able

244
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,980
to reunite with him soon.

245
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:30,820
That's great.

246
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:33,980
Beiluo,

247
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,780
I have already found my dad.

248
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,700
You will certainly be able
to save Shui as well.

249
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,220
We'll accompany you

250
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,340
to open Penglai together.

251
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,340
Okay.

252
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,780
Open Penglai?

253
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,620
Did you come to the Ancient Tower

254
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,780
for Penglai?

255
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,060
Flower Lord,

256
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,420
we've heard that within Penglai,

257
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,060
there is divine power
that can revitalize all things.

258
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,660
Beiluo wants to use this power

259
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,300
to heal the shattered Primordial Spirit

260
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,220
of his daughter.

261
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,580
Heal Primordial Spirit?

262
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,820
But

263
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,340
what's inside Penglai

264
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,980
cannot accomplish this.

265
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,060
What?

266
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,940
Are the tales of Penglai

267
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,740
entirely untrue?

268
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,820
I can only say

269
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,500
that you're in the wrong place.

270
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,060
What's inside Penglai

271
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,060
is something we are assigned to guard,

272
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,900
and it's not a good thing.

273
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,580
Forget it.

274
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,540
It seems that my luck

275
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,180
hasn't improved on this trip.

276
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,100
So what about you?

277
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,140
Why are you here at the Ancient Tower?

278
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,140
To be honest,

279
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,780
my mother

280
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,260
was one of the people who entered

281
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,220
the Luhua Ancient Tower

282
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,100
ten years ago.

283
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,420
I came here

284
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,780
to rescue her.

285
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,460
Are you aware

286
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,540
that your mother

287
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,220
has been turned into stone
by the Moon Lord?

288
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,900
I am aware.

289
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,740
Even though she's been turned
into stone,

290
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,100
there should still be a chance
to reverse it,

291
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,020
right?

292
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,460
This is no easy task.

293
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,060
To counter

294
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,300
the Moon Lord's Petrification Power,

295
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,260
you must defeat him.

296
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,980
But with your current strength,

297
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,780
you'll be turned into stone

298
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,420
by his deathly gaze

299
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,180
before you even reach him.

300
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,380
There is, however,

301
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,740
one person who might help you both.

302
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,380
She has the power

303
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,180
to battle the Moon Lord

304
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,300
and can assist

305
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,900
in restoring
a Border Dweller's Primordial Spirit.

306
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,700
Who is this person then?

307
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,700
The Wind Lord.

308
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,140
Then let's go seek the Wind Lord's help.

309
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:22,900
That's impossible.

310
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,460
Her hatred for humans

311
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,380
surpasses

312
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,700
even that of the Moon Lord.

313
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,700
She used to take pleasure

314
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,500
in enslaving humans,

315
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,500
and ten years ago,

316
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,420
she coveted

317
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,380
a young and beautiful girl

318
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,300
who entered the Ancient Tower

319
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,420
and took over her body.

320
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,580
I know who the girl

321
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,860
whose body was taken is.

322
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,180
It's Yan Qiaoqiao.

323
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,700
Who is it?

324
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,580
Wind Lord,

325
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,180
I trust you've been well.

326
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,780
Flower Lord.

327
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,740
How could this be?

328
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,900
It's impossible.

329
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,540
There's no way you could have escaped

330
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,180
from the Endless Nightmare.

331
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,460
Cut the chatter.

332
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,140
My ten-year grudge
will be avenged today,

333
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,660
and I'll make you pay twice as much.

334
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,060
Flower Lord?

335
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,020
How does he…

336
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,100
The winner is yet to be determined.

337
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,100
Where are you going, Moon Lord?

338
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,820
Where I go

339
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,300
is none of your concern.

340
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,220
Are you admitting defeat?

341
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:04,940
Or

342
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,460
is the presence of the people I sent

343
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,820
making you so restless

344
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,620
that you can't wait

345
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,420
to meet them?

346
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,220
I just wanted

347
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,100
to meet

348
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,340
an old friend.

349
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,820
As for the people you sent,

350
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,940
I don't care at all.

351
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,220
Because killing you humans

352
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,820
is as easy

353
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,220
as crushing an ant.

354
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,620
You'd better be careful

355
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,180
not to lose the game

356
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,460
and end up being the first ant I crush.

357
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,340
There might be

358
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,420
a method

359
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,300
to help you

360
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,300
obtain the Wind Lord's power

361
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,340
to challenge the Moon Lord,

362
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,620
but it requires

363
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,980
all three of you

364
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,820
to work together.

365
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,580
How should we work together?

366
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,500
First,

367
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,100
the most important thing is to seize

368
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,460
the jar
storing Yan Qiaoqiao's Primordial Spirit.

369
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,620
This is where the Wind Lord

370
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,940
stores Primordial Spirits.

371
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,820
According to the Flower Lord,

372
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,820
every item here

373
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,580
holds a Primordial Spirit

374
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,620
that the Wind Lord has taken.

375
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,620
But with so many items here,

376
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:41,820
how can we tell

377
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,700
which one is linked to Yan Qiaoqiao?

378
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,340
Then we'll have to look for items

379
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,820
related to the Wind-Treading Clan.

380
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,220
We don't know how long

381
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,220
the Flower Lord
can distract the Wind Lord.

382
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,820
You think such petty tricks
can help you get revenge?

383
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,740
Flower Lord,

384
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,420
you must still be dreaming.

385
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,260
It's you two.

386
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,860
Ladies,

387
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,060
We came here

388
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,220
to find the Primordial Spirit Jar

389
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,300
of the Wind-Treading Clan's
Yan Qiaoqiao.

390
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,020
It's very important to us.

391
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,620
Can you

392
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,060
help us?

393
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,020
I meant to spare your life,

394
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,620
but now,

395
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,460
it's my turn.

396
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,460
Infinite Fear!

397
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,700
Cao Yanbing, now!

398
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,260
We did it.

399
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,380
Who are you?

400
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,860
Hello, Yan Qiaoqiao.

401
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,540
We are friends of Fengzha.

402
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,540
Fengzha?

403
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,460
Unfortunately, you've lost.

404
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,620
You'll soon

405
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,700
have a spot

406
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,180
in the stone formation over there.

407
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,980
Thank you for the game, Moon Lord.

408
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,420
I admit defeat.

409
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,460
I've never encountered someone

410
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,740
as forthright as you before.

411
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,500
Very well.

412
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,180
Prepare yourself

413
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
to experience

414
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,620
my Petrification Power.

415
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,460
There are humans here.

416
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,700
Hold on.

417
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,420
It looks like you have visitors.

418
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,180
Maybe you should deal with them first

419
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,460
before worrying about me.

420
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,460
Huangfu Longdou,

421
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,660
do you even realize

422
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,220
what you're doing?

423
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,460
You're walking straight

424
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,540
into destruction.

425
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,700
How do you know

426
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,700
that destruction

427
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,620
isn't what I want?

428
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,220
Huangfu Longdou,

429
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,660
I swear,

430
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,900
I won't let you succeed.

431
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,980
The Flower Lord

432
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,660
and those humans

433
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,940
dared to seize

434
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,100
my body and power.

435
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,260
I will make them

436
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,940
pay for this!

437
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,700
This is it.

438
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,820
This is the place I saw

439
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,020
in Wuxin's memories.

440
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,500
My mother was turned into stone

441
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,340
right here.

442
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,300
If that's the case,

443
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,620
Cao Yanbing's mother

444
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,780
should be among these statues.

445
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,140
Fengzha as well.

446
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,820
We haven't seen him
in the Kingdom of Snow,

447
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,700
Flower Valley,

448
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,540
or City of the Wind.

449
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,660
He's most likely

450
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,940
here in the Moon Palace.

451
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,340
If the Moon Lord went after him,

452
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,620
he might already be...

453
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,420
Defeating the Moon Lord

454
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,940
is the only way
to reverse the petrification.

455
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,420
I'll take the lead

456
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,220
in the battle against him.

457
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,060
My body contains
the power of the Wind Lord

458
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,940
that can counter
the Moon Lord's abilities.

459
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,100
Today, I am going to rescue Fengzha

460
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,660
no matter what.

461
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,620
Up ahead

462
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,940
is the Moon Lord's Hall of Tranquility.

463
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,700
Even though Yan Qiaoqiao

464
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,780
has the Wind Lord's power,

465
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,620
she can't look out for everyone.

466
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:07,940
You must be cautious

467
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,100
of the Moon Lord's eyes

468
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,420
when we get there.

469
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,140
This is absurd.

470
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,140
Flower Lord,

471
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,700
just how far

472
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,820
are you willing to go

473
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,060
to challenge me

474
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,340
for the sake of these mere humans?

475
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,380
Everyone, watch out.

476
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,500
Beiluo.

477
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,500
Xia Ling.

478
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,100
How dare you protect humans.

479
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,100
Wind Lord,

480
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,340
even you have betrayed me.

481
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,340
Look carefully.

482
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,380
The person before you
is not the Wind Lord,

483
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,860
but Yan Qiaoqiao
of the Wind-Treading Clan.

484
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,540
Where is my brother?

485
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,020
Hand him over at once.

486
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,340
Sadly,

487
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,500
you came too late.

488
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:13,940
Moon and Star Pendant?

489
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,580
What have you done to my brother?

490
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,740
He must have turned him

491
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,580
into stone

492
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,340
just like Xia Ling and Beiluo.

493
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,420
You must be the human

494
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,500
who managed to take on
the three territories in one go.

495
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,540
Ten years ago,

496
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,140
you turned my mother into stone.

497
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,020
Now you've petrified

498
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,820
all my friends.

499
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,140
With old scores and new enmities,

500
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,620
I will

501
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,420
make you pay today.

502
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,940
Ten years ago?

503
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:41,860
I see.

504
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,140
It turns out
you are with them after all.

505
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,620
How dare a mere mortal like you

506
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,740
covet the divine power

507
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,940
in Penglai?

508
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,660
Today,

509
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,100
you will be the first

510
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,700
to die.

511
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,260
If you have a problem, come at me.

512
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,060
Since my brother has received

513
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,700
your hospitality,

514
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,020
I, as his sister,

515
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
will certainly repay you
with all my might.

516
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,500
You're just a mere mortal,

517
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,740
far inferior to even a fraction

518
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,980
of the Wind Lord's power.

519
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,060
Today, I'll show you

520
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,380
what true fear is.

521
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,020
Storm Power!

522
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,540
Cao Yanbing.

523
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:00,980
Cao Yanbing.

524
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,620
This Black Death Light

525
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,540
is a curse of death.

526
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,780
Anything it touches

527
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,060
is doomed to die.

528
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,380
Human,

529
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,540
today is your time to die.

530
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,500
As for you,

531
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,340
I've already said,

532
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,300
you're far inferior

533
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,620
to even a fraction
of the Wind Lord's power.

534
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,940
Qiao.

535
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,460
No,

536
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,300
this can't be possible.

537
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,380
My Black Death Light

538
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,180
is invincible and unmatched.

539
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,060
How could a mere human

540
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,300
possibly withstand it?

541
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,420
Because I am not a human,

542
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,100
but a demon.

543
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,140
Old geezer,

544
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,060
it's you again.

545
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,860
Kid,

546
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,980
if I hadn't shown up,

547
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,340
you would have been finished.

548
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,460
And since I've run into
an old acquaintance,

549
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,940
I have to say hello.

550
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,700
Don't you agree,

551
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,580
Shebishi?
[*a creature in Chinese mythology]

552
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,220
Human,

553
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,580
I wondered why you were so arrogant.

554
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,780
It turns out you possess a demonic aura.

555
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,740
Your aim

556
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,100
is not only to obtain

557
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,500
the divine power from Penglai,

558
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,420
but also to revive the Demon Lord.

559
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,940
Revive the Demon Lord?

560
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,740
Kid,

561
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,660
aren't you curious

562
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,100
why I can appear

563
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,220
and disappear

564
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,620
at will

565
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,740
once inside this ancient tower?

566
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,340
It's because I'm now

567
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,500
close to Penglai,

568
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,820
and in there,

569
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,020
the so-called divine power

570
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,700
is my heart,

571
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,740
which did not perish after my death

572
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,420
and is key to my resurrection.

573
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,620
Is your real goal

574
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,700
to unlock Penglai,

575
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,740
reclaim your heart,

576
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,060
and come back to life?

577
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,620
Yes,

578
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,260
and I will need

579
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,060
your assistance to achieve it.

580
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,180
Old geezer,
you're taking control of me again.

581
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,300
Kid,

582
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,900
you want to take down the Moon Lord,
right?

583
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,740
Leave it to me,

584
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,140
and you'll soon witness

585
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,660
true dominance.

586
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,420
Even the Demon Lord from back then

587
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,460
was defeated

588
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,300
by our Divine Lord.

589
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,620
You're nothing more
than a lingering remnant

590
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,060
of the Demon Lord's power,

591
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,180
yet you still dare
to be so audacious in front of me.

592
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,820
And what about you?

593
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,540
A small pet under the divine authority

594
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,980
of the Demon Slayer Patriarch,

595
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,540
a mere beast

596
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,620
daring to call itself a Lord?

597
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,060
Then let's see

598
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,300
who's more formidable.

599
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,580
Dark Astral Burst!

600
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,780
Has he been defeated just like that?

601
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,420
Why so surprised?

602
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,860
Once revived,

603
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,860
I'll be far stronger than now.

604
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,780
So, Cao Yanbing,

605
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,900
are you tempted?

606
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,420
If you are,

607
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,420
surrender your entire consciousness,

608
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,700
so I can fully take over your body.

609
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,300
This is the only way for me

610
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,460
to reclaim my heart,

611
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,340
and you

612
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,380
will also share in this supreme power

613
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,940
with me.

614
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,500
Did you hear what the old geezer said?

615
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,540
If you don't want him

616
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,220
to regain his power

617
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,140
and destroy this Ancient Tower,

618
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,700
then revive all my friends

619
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,620
and everyone

620
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,460
who entered the tower

621
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,180
ten years ago.

622
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,820
Only then will I refuse the old geezer,

623
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,460
take him away,

624
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,580
and make sure he never comes back.

625
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,340
You cunning human,

626
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,460
you've schemed meticulously

627
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,180
to bring demonic aura
into the Ancient Tower,

628
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,220
and just as success is within reach,

629
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,300
you suddenly say you want to leave.

630
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,860
Do you think I'm so easily deceived?

631
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,460
You can either believe it or not,

632
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,660
but do you have any other choices?

633
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,660
Cao Yanbing,

634
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,700
you're such a letdown.

635
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,380
A source of immense power

636
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,340
is right before you,

637
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,700
and you're willing to give it up.

638
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,460
Stop resisting.

639
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,820
You can't escape my grasp.

640
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,500
Who are you?

641
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,460
State your name.

642
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,100
Master,

643
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,500
I am late.

644
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,820
Please forgive me.

645
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,820
Not at all.

646
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
You've arrived just in time.

647
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,740
Help me persuade

648
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,540
this stubborn kid.

649
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,780
Cao Yanbing,

650
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,900
I advise you to think carefully.

651
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,660
Following Master

652
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,140
is your best option right now.

653
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,620
Otherwise,

654
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,020
you will end up

655
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,500
in Huangfu Longdou's hands.

656
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,020
Huangfu Longdou?

657
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,020
How is he related to this?

658
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,780
Here's the truth.

659
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,340
From the very moment

660
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,060
you first encountered Wang Meng,

661
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,620
you were already

662
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,540
part of Huangfu Longdou's plan.

663
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,980
He needs you

664
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,140
to obtain

665
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,180
the divine power of Penglai
he has always yearned for.

666
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,220
He needs me?

667
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,340
Do you think

668
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,660
his failure ten years ago

669
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,260
was due to a lack of strength?

670
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,940
It was because there was a seal

671
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,500
within Penglai

672
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,060
that locked the divine power.

673
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,100
To break the seal,

674
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,140
he needed to gather
the Four Lords' Soul-Locks

675
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,860
and merge them

676
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,740
in a container.

677
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,860
And your Divine Warrior's Physique

678
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,740
is perfect for that.

679
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,220
So you mean

680
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,380
Huangfu Longdou sees me

681
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,580
as a human vessel

682
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,940
and intentionally brought me
to the Luhua Ancient Tower?

683
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,340
But how do you know

684
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:38,940
all this?

685
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,380
And why should I trust you?

686
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,540
Because I'm here to help you.

687
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,100
This is...

688
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,300
To help you undo the petrification.

689
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,580
Isn't this exactly what you want?

690
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:21,940
Xia Ling.

691
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,260
Beiluo.

692
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,540
Xia Ling!

693
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,060
Sevenfold Soul-Resonance Bell!

694
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,260
Sevenfold Soul-Resonance Bell!

695
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,100
Is this how you treat
those who help you?

696
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,260
It's you.

697
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,620
Ten years ago...

698
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,100
- Flower Lord.
- Flower Lord.

699
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:13,820
Flower Lord.

700
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,940
Now that all Four Lords' Soul-Locks
are gathered,

701
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,460
the illusions of the four territories
can be dispelled.

702
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,580
And you

703
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,340
are about to witness the ultimate secret

704
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,620
of the Border Domain.

705
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,580
Penglai

706
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,180
has finally appeared.

707
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,260
What exactly

708
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,260
is the ultimate secret
of the Border Domain

709
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,060
that you just mentioned?

710
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,020
Is it just Penglai?

711
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,620
If it's the ultimate secret,

712
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,060
how could it be so boring?

713
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,340
Fengzha. It's Fengzha.

714
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,660
Fengzha.

715
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,180
Fengzha.

716
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,220
Is it you?

717
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,060
I'm your sister.

718
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,420
Qiao.

719
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,780
You are my sister.

720
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,700
It is me.

721
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:26,980
Qiao.

722
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,460
I miss you so much.

723
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,300
I think about you every day.

724
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,500
I miss you too.

725
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,700
Let me take a look.

726
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,060
You've grown so much

727
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,100
that I can hardly recognize you.

728
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,340
Cao Yanbing,

729
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,940
since Fengzha has already recovered,

730
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,140
those in the stone formation

731
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,500
should also recover, right?

732
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,500
Cao Yanbing,

733
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,980
something doesn't seem quite right.

734
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,500
What are these?

735
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,620
Malevolent Beings?

736
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,300
Could it be another spell

737
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,060
from the Ancient Tower?

738
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,580
Probably not.

739
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,460
These appear

740
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,460
to be high-level Malevolent Beings,

741
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,380
and they're not easy to deal with.

742
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,340
