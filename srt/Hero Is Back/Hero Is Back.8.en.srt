196
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:28,780
why don't we

197
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,220
just let them know

198
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,460
where Lingfeng Street is?

199
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,140
I can arrange it now.

200
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,340
No.

201
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,700
Today

202
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,740
we've got his attention.

203
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,660
More actions

204
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,860
might backfire

205
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,940
and make him doubt us.

206
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,740
Besides,

207
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,020
people always value

208
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,820
what they've worked hard for,

209
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,500
whether it's truth or clues.

210
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,220
Let him do his work.

211
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,340
Okay.

212
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,740
Li Gucheng isn't after us, is he?

213
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,020
No.

214
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,020
I saw him trapped

215
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,780
by a sword qi.

216
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,500
I don't think he knows

217
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,580
where we were heading.

218
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,460
A sword qi?

219
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,300
And I felt an aura

220
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,340
of Divine Warrior's Form.

221
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,500
Do you mean

222
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,580
other Spirit-hosted Humans

223
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,420
were helping us?

224
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,980
Not necessarily helping us.

225
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,780
Hall of Heroes has so many enemies.

226
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,460
Maybe they were looking for revenge.

227
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,260
Beiluo.

228
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,500
How's your leg?

229
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,100
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,500
There was an emergency.

231
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,900
Don't blame me.

232
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,980
Our Commander Men is no ordinary human.

233
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,460
He has super Primordial Spirit Power.

234
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,780
That wound healed already.

235
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,100
You might as well

236
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,780
buy him a pair of pants.

237
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,020
Why do I have to buy him pants?

238
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,260
You told me to stab him.

239
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,140
And you just did what I said?

240
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:57,940
If I don't listen to you...

241
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,580
Since you and Xia Ling

242
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,260
are fine now,

243
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,380
I'll be on my way.

244
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:02,900
Beiluo,

245
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,420
we came to Leiquan Street

246
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,340
especially to see you.

247
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
To see me?

248
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,300
Why?

249
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,300
It's a long story.

250
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,380
How about we sit down

251
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,580
and talk it over?

252
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,340
That's about it.

253
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,260
We only know that Luhua Ancient Tower

254
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,300
is near Lingfeng Street.

255
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,300
But we don't know

256
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,220
how to get to Lingfeng Street

257
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,140
or where it is.

258
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,620
I see.

259
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,700
Do you have a pen and paper?

260
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,140
I'll draw you

261
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,500
where the entrance
to Lingfeng Street is.

262
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,780
I do.

263
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,660
It's an eyebrow pencil though.

264
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,620
Will this work?

265
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,340
Here.

266
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,420
Here.

267
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,140
Thank you, Beiluo.

268
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,380
I knew you were the right guy to go to.

269
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,460
Beiluo,

270
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,620
this Lingfeng Street

271
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,300
seems hard to find.

272
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,380
I need you to come with us.

273
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,660
Beiluo!

274
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,020
Anything else?

275
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,740
Can't I just chat with you
for no reason?

276
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,380
What is wrong with you?

277
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,460
When we parted

278
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:37,980
in Yulin Street,

279
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,820
you were all right.

280
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,900
It's only been a few months.

281
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,100
Why have you fallen so low?

282
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,980
I was a fool

283
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,780
to think I could reunite

284
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,020
Shui's Primordial Spirit.

285
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,740
Shui's Primordial Spirit?

286
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,620
So this is...

287
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,820
It is a treasure
that collects and saves

288
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,180
fragments of Primordial Spirit,

289
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,180
the Starspirit Bottle.

290
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,580
So it means

291
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,700
Shui can still be saved.

292
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,660
Even more reason to cheer up.

293
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,340
We'll help you save Shui.

294
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,620
I've tried every method said

295
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,380
to be able to gather Primordial Spirit.

296
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,060
They all didn't work.

297
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,140
What's worse,

298
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,820
these methods,

299
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,940
to varying degrees,

300
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,180
damage the Primordial Spirit.

301
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,100
I don't want to try again.

302
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,780
Otherwise,

303
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,940
Shui will be gone

304
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,580
forever.

305
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,860
Just let her stay in the bottle

306
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,140
safely and peacefully.

307
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,580
At least,

308
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,340
she can still be by my side.

309
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,980
My life is over.

310
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,220
Leiquan Street

311
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,620
is where I found

312
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,540
Shui's Primordial Spirit.

313
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,420
Let me just fend

314
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,460
for myself here.

315
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,060
Beiluo.

316
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,300
You're a Spiritual Guardian.

317
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,420
You can be sad.

318
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,020
But not so much

319
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,220
that you give up on yourself like this.

320
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,540
Spiritual Guardian.

321
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,580
On Bodhi Street,

322
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,020
thousands of Border Dwellers

323
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,900
and Shui.

324
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,700
They're all dead.

325
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,140
I'm the only one still alive,

326
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,460
shamelessly.

327
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,100
If I hadn't trusted Nan Yufu,

328
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,620
and allow him to invade,

329
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,020
they wouldn't have been killed.

330
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,340
Fine.

331
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,220
You don't have to go with us.

332
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,940
What's your next move?

333
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,820
Heading back to your temple,

334
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,340
seeking

335
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,140
another one,

336
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,380
or maybe go drink

337
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,460
that Mengquan water again?

338
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,820
I shouldn't have rescued you

339
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,780
if I knew you'd be

340
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,180
such a coward.

341
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:42,860
Yes.

342
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,700
You should never have rescued me.

343
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,060
Though I only have sheer strength,

344
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,740
I lack the acumen to discern character.

345
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,300
Again and again,

346
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,700
I harmed Shui.

347
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,540
And what did Shui do?

348
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,700
In order to save me,

349
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,220
her primordial spirit
was shot by an arrow.

350
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,660
But she was still smiling at me,

351
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,060
saying she wanted me to live,

352
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,340
and not to be sad.

353
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,100
I, Beiluo Shimen,

354
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,900
don't deserve to be her father.

355
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,980
How should I proceed with my life?

356
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,060
Do you think,

357
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,060
if I could

358
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,100
stop Shi Lingming

359
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,020
from trying to protect me,

360
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,500
I'd allow myself to be

361
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,220
standing here alive

362
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:23,980
In front of you?

363
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,180
Or if you guys

364
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,700
hadn't forced me to wake up,

365
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,060
how would I be standing here

366
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,220
and listening to your nonsense?

367
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,060
If you think

368
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,020
saving me was wrong,

369
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,820
take my life

370
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,540
right now.

371
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,900
I'll give you a proper thanks.

372
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,820
If you wouldn't kill,

373
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,260
then leave me alone.

374
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,220
I'm going to get some brew.

375
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,800
[Hongbin Restaurant]

376
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,700
Beiluo,

377
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,500
I'm sorry.

378
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,540
I was being too harsh on you.

379
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,340
I failed to think about your feelings.

380
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:00,780
I

381
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,340
will make amends with brew.

382
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,220
A pot for myself.

383
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,000
[Meng]

384
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,700
No need to apologize.

385
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,500
Leave Leiquan Street.

386
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,260
No one

387
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,180
can really get

388
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,260
what someone else is feeling.

389
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:23,500
I can't

390
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,780
fully understand your feelings.

391
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,740
But I know mine.

392
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,060
Pain and remorse.

393
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,740
Not for months,

394
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,700
but for ten years.

395
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,660
If I hadn't known

396
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,740
my mother was still alive

397
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,180
and trapped in the Luhua Ancient Tower,

398
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,740
I'm afraid, for my whole life,

399
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,300
I would think I killed her.

400
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,220
But I also remember

401
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,940
what my mom

402
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,020
used to say.

403
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,980
She said

404
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,740
your trust and kindness are right.

405
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,700
It was he who failed you.

406
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,020
Exactly because

407
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,100
I remembered this,

408
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,500
however I regret something after that,

409
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,340
I held back.

410
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,740
I didn't let the pain consume me.

411
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,340
I put all my energy

412
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,180
into becoming stronger.

413
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,020
Strong enough

414
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,260
to be able

415
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
to do what my mom said,

416
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,020
never letting it happen again.

417
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,740
My suffering is

418
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,820
nothing.

419
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,260
I have such a

420
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,300
loving mother.

421
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,540
I have to live a good life

422
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,780
to be worthy of her love.

423
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,060
Beiluo.

424
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,420
You said Shui saved you

425
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,580
with her Primordial Spirit shot.

426
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,060
Still, she was smiling at you

427
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,260
telling you not to be sad

428
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,660
and live a good life.

429
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,420
If I had

430
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,500
a daughter like her,

431
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
despite my

432
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,940
unbearable pain,

433
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,260
even if the world deemed me

434
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,420
unworthy of life,

435
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,100
I'd strive

436
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,300
to live well,

437
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,740
so Shui may find peace.

438
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,060
All right.

439
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,180
I've said everything I needed to.

440
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,020
Xia Ling and I are going to

441
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,260
look for Luhua Ancient Tower now.

442
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:23,940
What to do next

443
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,220
is up to you.

444
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,660
Beiluo,

445
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,500
Spiritual Crossroads are so big.

446
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,460
I believe there must be a way

447
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,940
to heal Shui's Primordial Spirit.

448
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,780
Don't ever give up.

449
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,660
Also don't forget

450
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,500
you have two partners.

451
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,980
You can always count on us.

452
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,540
Please wait, the two of you.

453
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,020
I think I heard you talking

454
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,900
about Luhua Ancient Tower.

455
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,780
Did you say Luhua Ancient Tower?

456
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:16,580
Yeah.

457
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,380
This place is always bustling
with people,

458
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,620
so I hear all kinds of news.

459
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,100
However,

460
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,020
if you want any specific news,

461
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,900
you need to...

462
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:27,980
How much?

463
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,380
One Border Coin?

464
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,540
One bar of gold.

465
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,140
Why don't you just rob me?

466
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,700
Don't get upset.

467
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,420
My prices are upfront

468
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,100
and fair to all customers.

469
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,620
By the way,

470
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,100
what you just said

471
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,500
about healing the Primordial Spirit,

472
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,940
there is a way

473
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,260
to do it in the tower.

474
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,740
He can sell twenty pieces

475
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,660
of fake information like that a day.

476
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,180
Don't be ridiculous.

477
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,540
My information

478
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,900
is from the Border King

479
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,500
when he was passing

480
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,460
through Leiquan Street.

481
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,900
That's real firsthand information.

482
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,740
Do you hear?

483
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,980
I'm buying this information.

484
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,580
Sir,

485
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,500
go on.

486
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,660
Here it is.

487
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,580
Why is the tower a Divine Realm?

488
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,020
First,

489
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,740
here dwell the ancient immortals.

490
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,300
Second,

491
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,580
there's a place

492
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,540
called Penglai

493
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,380
where the Divine Power is nurtured.

494
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,380
This power

495
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,140
can purify the evil

496
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,260
and rejuvenate all things.

497
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,940
If it can do that,

498
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,140
isn't healing Primordial Spirit

499
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,820
easy as pie?

500
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,060
So Shui can still be saved.

501
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,900
Li Gucheng

502
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,820
has also mentioned

503
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,580
the power in the Luhua Ancient Tower.

504
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,060
It must be true.

505
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,660
Beiluo.

506
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,340
You heard what the keeper said.

507
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,300
The power in Luhua Ancient Tower

508
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,660
might be able to save Shui.

509
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,340
No.

510
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,700
I will never believe in legends again.

511
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,980
You don't believe it,

512
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,140
or you don't want to believe it?

513
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,500
Beiluo Shimen,

514
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,180
are you really willing to accept this?

515
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,860
Don't you want

516
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,820
to try again for Shui?

517
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,700
Did Shui save you

518
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,420
only to see you

519
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,660
get so depraved?

520
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,780
Do you deserve

521
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,700
Shui's sacrifice?

522
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,100
If I had

523
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,220
a daughter like her,

524
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:28,940
despite my

525
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,460
unbearable pain,

526
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,980
even if the world deemed me

527
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,340
unworthy of life,

528
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,260
I'd strive

529
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,020
to live well,

530
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,540
so Shui may find peace.

531
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,540
Are you really willing to accept this?

532
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,540
Don't you want

533
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,580
to try again for Shui?

534
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,860
Coffee for two.

535
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,060
Thank you.

536
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,300
I know

537
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,740
seeing the way Beiluo is now,

538
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,100
you're a little disappointed.

539
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,060
Why should I be disappointed?

540
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,780
I have known

541
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,620
where Lingfeng Street is.

542
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,900
I'm beyond happy.

543
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,020
Just admit it.

544
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,020
I actually can

545
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,940
understand Beiluo.

546
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,980
As a man

547
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,500
of real goodness and integrity,

548
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,380
he found it hurt so much.

549
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,260
If he survives,

550
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,020
he'll carry the sorrow for the fallen.

551
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,420
If he doesn't,

552
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,140
he fears

553
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,940
letting down those who love him.

554
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,420
Don't you think

555
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,780
forcing him to cheer up

556
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,460
is a little harsh?

557
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,540
Harsh or not,

558
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,140
we'll find out tomorrow.

559
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,020
Let's set out

560
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,140
for Lingfeng Street.
