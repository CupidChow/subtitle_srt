00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,380
not always there for you.

194
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,980
Do you blame me?

195
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,460
No.

196
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,580
Because every time you come back,

197
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,660
you would take me out to have fun.

198
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,500
I am very happy.

199
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,580
Not like Mom.

200
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,700
She only wants me to study.

201
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,940
Your mother wants you to study

202
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,140
for your own good.

203
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,420
And then,

204
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,180
my mom and dad got divorced.

205
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,420
I saw him even less.

206
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,540
He did come back to see me,

207
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,140
but it was always in a hurry.

208
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,340
He wouldn't stay long.

209
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,100
Then,

210
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
how did he die?

211
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,420
I heard it from my mom.

212
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,900
When at sea,

213
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,940
he caught a typhoon.

214
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,140
The boat capsized.

215
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,380
He was swept away by the waves.

216
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,260
We never found his body.

217
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,260
Later we heard from a friend

218
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,260
about his death.

219
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,540
Several relics were found

220
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,580
and we managed to build a grave.

221
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,820
So,

222
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,740
could there be any clue?

223
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,060
The notebook is blank.

224
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,940
The box couldn't be opened.

225
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,020
Nothing at all.

226
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,020
Don't you think it's weird?

227
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,500
In this notebook,

228
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,620
there is nothing,

229
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,780
but it feels like
it's been flipped over many times.

230
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,660
Before I say thank you,

231
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,660
I want to know

232
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,780
who you really are

233
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,700
and why you help me.

234
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,580
You have no trace of humanity.

235
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,980
You must be a Border Dweller.

236
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,020
All the Meal Deliverers here
in the Shadowbound Prison

237
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,580
seem to be Border Dwellers.

238
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,820
But you're no ordinary Border Dweller.

239
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
You can even

240
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,580
hide my aura.

241
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,500
Who exactly are you?

242
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,620
What do you mean?

243
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,620
I knew the cell zero isn't easy to find.

244
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,260
But there're too many cells.

245
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,700
Where do I start looking?

246
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,980
Aren't you coming with me?

247
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,340
The top floor?

248
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,740
Is that where you want me to go?

249
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,100
Do you know who I'm looking for?

250
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,100
I'm looking for

251
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
someone named Tang Xiaoxiao.

252
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,660
All right.

253
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,140
Regardless of your motive

254
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,900
for making me go there

255
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,260
or your purpose

256
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,100
in helping me,

257
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:47,820
thanks

258
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:49,980
anyway.

259
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,500
Did the Meal Deliverer

260
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,940
want me to see this?

261
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,140
Who is it

262
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,420
to end up in a place like this?

263
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,100
Who is at the door?

264
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,460
I asked you a question.

265
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,300
Why don't you answer?

266
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,580
Excuse me.

267
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,060
I am a common prisoner

268
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,100
who just got arrested.

269
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,460
I came here

270
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:46,980
looking for someone.

271
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,260
Looking for someone?

272
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,140
You came to the Shadowbound Prison
to look for someone.

273
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,100
I have never heard

274
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,340
of anything sillier.

275
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,460
I have no choice

276
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,380
but to come.

277
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,540
I came to find someone

278
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,340
named Tang Xiaoxiao.

279
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,700
Do you know

280
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,580
where she is being held?

281
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,820
Judged by your voice,

282
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,660
you are still quite young.

283
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,220
But you made it

284
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,980
to the Shadowbound Prison,

285
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,780
which means you're quite resourceful.

286
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,500
Sir,

287
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,660
don't you think
talking through the door

288
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,340
is inconvenient?

289
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,060
Now it's time to unlock the ones on you.

290
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,980
As far as I know,

291
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,460
there's only one person
who can unlock this

292
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,540
with such speed

293
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,020
in this world.

294
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:14,740
Kid,

295
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,460
who are you?

296
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,900
Why are you so eager to know

297
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,820
who I am?

298
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,020
Because only after you tell me,

299
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,500
can I decide

300
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,220
whether to help you or not.

301
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,980
Sir, you mean

302
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,740
you can help me find her?

303
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,220
Okay.

304
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,460
Then I can tell you.

305
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,780
My name is Cao Yanbing.

306
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,060
Tang Xiaoxiao who I was

307
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,740
telling you about

308
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,580
is my mother.

309
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,660
So you are Xiaoxiao's son.

310
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,260
No wonder.

311
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,060
Looks like you totally inherited

312
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,820
the lock-picking skills
of the Tang Family.

313
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,060
You know my mother?

314
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,780
We go way back.

315
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,380
To tell you the truth,

316
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,700
I'm the former Chief of Staff

317
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,420
of the Hall of Heroes,

318
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,060
one of The Four Eminent Warriors,

319
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,660
Li Gubai.

320
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,980
[Li Gubai, former Chief of Staff
of the Hall of Heroes]

321
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,740
Your mother was

322
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,700
also a member of the Hall of Heroes.

323
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,700
My mom was

324
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,940
a member of the Hall of Heroes?

325
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,580
How is that possible?

326
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,700
Though

327
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,140
she served

328
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,500
the Hall of Heroes with us,

329
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,940
we were in the front

330
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,340
in charge of the fights.

331
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,820
She was in the dark

332
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,220
in charge of assassinations

333
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,100
and other secret missions.

334
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,540
Her identity was a secret.

335
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,500
She only served the chief,

336
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,380
Huangfu Longdou.

337
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,460
Huangfu Longdou?

338
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,020
The wanted man?

339
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,660
Mom used to work for him?

340
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,460
Okay Sir, let's put that aside.

341
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,820
Could you please tell me

342
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,740
where my mom is being held?

343
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,780
I need to save her

344
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,620
and then we can leave

345
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,220
together.

346
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,780
Don't bother, kid.

347
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,500
Your mother is not even

348
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,220
here.

349
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,100
Not here?

350
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,780
How is it possible?

351
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,300
I heard

352
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:58,780
she was held

353
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,580
in the Shadowbound Prison.

354
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,500
I can share with you

355
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,700
an image of her.

356
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,380
Because of this image,

357
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,700
I'm sure

358
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,380
she's not here now.

359
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,340
Then please show it to me, Sir.

360
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:13,780
But

361
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,100
how do you show it to me?

362
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,900
Though I am blind,

363
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,740
I can share with you

364
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,500
via the eyes
of the Guardian Primordial Spirit.

365
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,380
Then the image

366
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,740
can be transmitted to your mind.

367
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,660
This will be traumatising

368
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,300
to your spirit.

369
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,140
You need to think it over.

370
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,500
Master,

371
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,700
I found that on every page

372
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,300
of this notebook,

373
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,380
there are traces
of weak Primordial Spirit Power.

374
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,060
If I'm not wrong,

375
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,340
it's not like there's nothing there.

376
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,660
Someone did something to it.

377
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,740
Only using Primordial Spirit Power on it

378
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,060
can you see what's in it.

379
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,340
No need to think it over.

380
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,620
I can take it.

381
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,540
Do you mean

382
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,180
my dad was a Spirit-hosted Human?

383
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,740
But you have to promise me.

384
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,620
No matter what you see,

385
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,900
keep control of your feelings.

386
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,140
I promise you.

387
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,260
Just transmit the image.

388
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,580
Did you say

389
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,740
I needed to use
Primordial Spirit Power on it?

390
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,660
Yes.

391
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,580
Master, you might as well give it a try.

392
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,700
Come here.

393
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,940
[Huangfu Longdou. Divine Power.
Luhua Ancient Tower]

394
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,580
Celestial Eye.

395
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,380
Open.

396
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,980
You want to kill me?

397
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,780
Not that easy.

398
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,220
Jing Shisan.

399
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:25,980
Shisan!

400
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,620
Shisan.

401
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,860
General Zhao,
Hall of Heroes shall claim your life.

402
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,060
You band of murderous shadows,

403
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,260
cowering from the light.

404
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,780
I simply didn't

405
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,700
obey orders.

406
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,420
You put a charge on me

407
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,500
and try to kill me secretly.

408
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,100
Hall of Heroes is

409
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,900
nothing but a stooge
to the Border Realm.

410
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,540
You've lost your soul

411
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,900
and serve as the henchman
of malevolence.

412
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,540
Your vile actions

413
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,100
will cast a long shadow

414
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,420
over your offspring.

415
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,500
Xiaoxiao,

416
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,740
don't listen to him.

417
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,060
Just kill him.

418
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,180
So we can complete our mission.

419
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:07,980
Forget it.

420
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,340
Having lost
his Guardian Primordial Spirit,

421
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,300
he's already a dead man.

422
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,300
Let's throw him
out of the Spiritual Crossroads

423
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,020
and leave him to his own devices.

424
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:32,820
Xiaoxiao,

425
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,860
the orders we got were

426
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,780
to execute him on the spot.

427
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,540
If you let him go,

428
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,980
how do we explain this to the hall?

429
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,420
About this,

430
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,180
I will explain this to Chief Huangfu.

431
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,900
You little rascal,

432
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,100
why do you keep staring at your brother?

433
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,940
He is small,

434
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,900
and soft.

435
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,220
I worry I'll break him if I touch him.

436
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,260
When will he grow up?

437
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,380
You're a big brother now.

438
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,420
Now,

439
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,020
you must take good care of your brother.

440
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,460
Take care of him?

441
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,380
Just like dad
takes care of Rakshasa Street?

442
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,660
There are many Border Dwellers
in Rakshasa Street.

443
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,900
To keep them from falling into darkness

444
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,940
and becoming evil,

445
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,500
Spiritual Guardians are needed

446
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,300
to keep this place safe

447
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,060
and peaceful.

448
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,220
This is the responsibility
of the Spiritual Guardians.

449
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,420
Responsibility?

450
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,220
What is responsibility?

451
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,020
We are a family.

452
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,220
So you love us.

453
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,500
You love our home

454
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,420
and Rakshasa Street.

455
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,620
What we're protecting is love.

456
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,660
That is our responsibility.

457
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,740
Love is our responsibility.

458
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:08,900
Yanbing.

459
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:09,860
Yanbing.

460
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,740
A Border Dweller became evil.

461
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,820
I need to take care of it.

462
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,100
Take care of the house and Liang.

463
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,100
Wait for me.

464
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:35,940
Sirs,

465
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,060
you came
to Rakshasa Street so late at night.

466
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,140
What can I do for you?

467
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,340
[Su, the Right Envoy.
Qi, the Left Envoy]

468
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,340
You know us?

469
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,620
When I visited Chief Huangfu,

470
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,660
I met you.

471
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,580
Since you know who we are,

472
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,740
we won't play around with you.

473
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,740
Tang Xiaoxiao,

474
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,780
I need you to come with us.

475
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,220
Where to?

476
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,540
What for?

477
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,940
Later,

478
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,100
you will know.

479
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,060
What if I say no?

480
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,740
You should know.

481
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,980
With our strength,

482
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,940
destroying this street is

483
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,180
easy as pie.

484
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,940
Even if you don't think for yourself,

485
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,260
you must think for your kids.

486
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,860
That's right.

487
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,380
Mom, where are you?

488
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:52,860
Mom?

489
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,900
Mom!

490
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,020
Mom's body was fake.

491
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,100
Kid, stop it now.

492
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,540
Unleashing your Primordial Spirit Power
like this,

493
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,780
your body will fail.

494
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,900
Stop it!

495
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,980
Cao Yanbing,

496
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,660
get out of here.

497
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,620
I know you're here.

498
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,740
It seems

499
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,100
I was too kind to you.

500
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,580
Here he comes.

501
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,500
He sensed your Primordial Spirit Power.

502
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,460
Impossible.

503
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,420
That's not true.

504
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,700
Sir,

505
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,500
please tell me.

506
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,180
What you just showed me,

507
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,700
is it reliable?

508
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,820
That was your mother's
Guardian Primordial Spirit.

509
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,300
Her Guardian Primordial Spirit?

510
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,660
You mean Tang Wuxin?

511
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,980
Why do you have his memory?

512
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,460
Have you seen him anywhere?

513
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,180
And where is that place

514
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,340
you just showed me?

515
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,660
Get out of here.

516
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,740
I'm running out of patience.

517
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,420
It's no use hiding.

518
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,580
I smell you.

519
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,980
It's too late.

520
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,500
Even if you find Tang Wuxin

521
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,540
and the place in the image,

522
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,580
you won't

523
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,900
be able to escape Shadowbound Prison.

524
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,580
For hundreds of years,

525
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,740
no one has ever defeated

526
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,340
the Prison Guardian.

527
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:55,860
No.

528
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,260
There is a first time for everything.

529
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,540
No one has made it in hundreds of years.

530
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,660
It doesn't mean I can't either.

531
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,940
There has to be some way.

532
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:04,900
Kid.

533
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,180
There has to be some way.

534
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:06,940
Kid.

535
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,940
There has to be.

536
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,460
Cao Yanbing,

537
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,660
this time I want you dead.

538
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,700
The Patriarch asked me
to eliminate evils here.

539
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,740
I have eliminated so many already.

540
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,660
Instead of behaving yourselves,

541
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,020
you became more and more audacious.

542
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,900
The Patriarch promised

543
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,260
to pick me up in five hundred years.

544
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,140
But it has been

545
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,340
eight hundred and thirty-nine years.

546
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,780
Once I eliminate one evil,

547
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,300
ten more are born.

548
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,140
The more I eliminate,
the more there are.

549
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:43,980
Because of the existence

550
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,460
of evil beings like you,

551
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,060
this hell

552
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,660
will never be empty.

553
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,900
How pathetic.

554
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,580
What did you say?

555
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,420
It's been eight hundred years.

556
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,540
Your Patriarch

557
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,020
has abandoned you.

558
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,580
Cao Yanbing,

559
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,780
if you were

560
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,620
trying to provoke me,

561
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,780
good job.

562
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,980
