00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,540
I promise you.

195
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,220
Xia...

196
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,700
Xia Ling.

197
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,420
This is a work note.

198
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,770
[Hanxian Street]

199
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,100
Hanxian Street.

200
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,420
Dad was not only a Spirit-hosted Human,

201
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,820
but also a Spiritual Guardian.

202
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,460
Hanxian Street

203
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,580
was the one in his charge.

204
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,500
[Hanxian]

205
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,570
[Guardian]

206
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,060
What a special medal!

207
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,020
Can I have it?

208
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,060
No.

209
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,980
Then why did you take it out?

210
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,020
This necklace

211
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,380
can't be given to anyone.

212
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,900
But I can make

213
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,100
something else for you.

214
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,380
I promise you'll like it.

215
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:13,980
Fine.

216
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:22,940
Ling.

217
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,220
It's amazing.

218
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,020
It is so beautiful.

219
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,220
Dad, can you do magic tricks?

220
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,580
What I did was magic itself.

221
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,660
Because I'm

222
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,980
from the world of magic.

223
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,140
World of magic.

224
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,580
Did he mean Spiritual Crossroads?

225
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,500
General,

226
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,540
all the escaped prisoners

227
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,180
have been captured,

228
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:47,900
except...

229
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,820
Except what?

230
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,700
Except for the four in cell zero.

231
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,660
The former Hall of Heroes masters.

232
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,660
The other prisoners don't matter.

233
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,180
It's those four that matter.

234
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,940
I can't believe

235
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,180
this happened on my watch.

236
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,220
I should have

237
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,660
kept more men.

238
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,860
Now I wouldn't be so short in men

239
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,900
that this happened.

240
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,540
Forget it.

241
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,460
Cao Yanbing doesn't matter.

242
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,260
If I can't get those four back,

243
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,460
there will be consequences.

244
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:28,820
On my orders,

245
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,060
widen the search area.

246
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,340
I want everyone to look for them.

247
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,940
As for Cao Yanbing,

248
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,140
re-issue the arrest warrant.

249
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,500
Wait until Madam gets back first.

250
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,020
- Okay.
- Okay.

251
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,420
Chief.

252
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,820
Why are you in such a hurry?

253
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,300
It's Cao Yanbing.

254
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,980
He escaped from the Shadowbound Prison.

255
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,380
Are you sure?

256
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,340
Hall of Heroes
has issued his arrest warrant.

257
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,540
He did escape.

258
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,780
Not only did he escape,

259
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,340
but he also killed the Prison Guardian

260
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,300
and heavily damaged the defenders.

261
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,540
Cao Yanbing did not disappoint me.

262
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,660
He survived this,

263
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,860
which proves he deserves

264
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,700
to be part of my plan.

265
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,660
From now on,

266
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,700
he's a pawn

267
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,700
completely controlled

268
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,860
by your hand.

269
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,220
Kid.

270
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,060
Who is it?

271
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,020
Who am I?

272
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,740
That's a good question.

273
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,060
Let's talk about

274
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,260
who you are first.

275
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,380
Why do I need

276
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,820
to tell you my identity?

277
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,300
Looks like you not only
have the Divine Warrior's Physique,

278
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,260
but you also have a temper.

279
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,660
Fine.

280
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,420
I like it.

281
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,940
Who on earth are you?

282
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,180
How do you know
I have the Divine Warrior's Physique?

283
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,700
Of course, I know.

284
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,420
If it's not the case,

285
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,620
how could I have a form?

286
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,580
Why do you talk so much?

287
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,380
Come out if you can.

288
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,700
Let's have a good fight.

289
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,460
Let me out of here afterward.

290
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,740
I have to find

291
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,820
Luhua Ancient Tower.

292
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,140
You're going to Luhua Ancient Tower?

293
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:25,820
So what?

294
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,580
Do you know where it is?

295
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,260
Nice.

296
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,900
Very nice.

297
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,540
Perfect.

298
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,780
So noisy.

299
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,700
What's wrong with you?

300
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,420
Shut up.

301
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,100
Wake up, Cao Yanbing.

302
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,500
Cao Yanbing.

303
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:46,980
Xia Ling?

304
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,540
Cao Yanbing.

305
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,900
I remember your name now.

306
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,700
We'll meet again soon.

307
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,860

308
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,420
enshrouded by the clouds of incense.

309

Upon the lotus of serenity and wisdom,

310
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,620
the divine spirit
ascends to eternal peace.

311
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,860
Sins bound to the nether realms,

312
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,020
enshrouded by the clouds of incense.

313
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,900
Upon the lotus of serenity and wisdom...

314
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,140
You're awake.

315
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,140
How are you feeling?

316
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,220
Xia Ling.

317
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,540
What happened to me?

318
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,940
I want to ask you the same thing.

319
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,260
I was at home

320
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,140
when I received

321
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,980
your update letter.

322
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,820
When we arrived,

323
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,340
you were lying in the alley alone.

324
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
What was going on?

325
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,900
I only remember

326
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,860
that someone

327
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,180
kept talking to me.

328
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,540
General Cao,

329
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,260
by the time we got there,

330
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,620
you were covered

331
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,260
with a thick black aura.

332
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,220
Your Primordial Spirit Power
was unsettled

333
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,020
and was attacking your viscera.

334
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,340
All look like

335
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,300
symptoms when your Primordial Spirit is

336
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
attacked by Demonic aura.

337
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,340
Thus,

338
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,740
just now I used

339
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,820
my master's
Sevenfold Soul-Resonance Bell

340
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,020
which has the power to ease the mind
and remove demons.

341
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,820
Now it seems the demonic nature

342
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,340
has been suppressed by the bell.

343
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:10,820
However,

344
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,260
it also proves your internal injuries

345
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,980
were caused by the demonic nature.

346
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,220
General Cao,

347
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,580
did you come into contact

348
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,780
with any demonic creatures recently?

349
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,060
Demonic aura?

350
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,220
I remember

351
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,980
back in the Shadowbound Prison,

352
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,540
the Prison Guardian attacked me.

353
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,740
Then I woke up.

354
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,320
[Luhua Ancient Tower]

355
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,780
Wuxin saved me.

Wuxin.

357
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,860
Li Xuanyuan,

358
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,660
come back first.

359
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,460
Can you tell me

360
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,780
what happened?

361
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,620
We're teammates.

362
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,460
I'm really worried about you.

363
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,340
I'm going back to Spiritual Crossroads

364
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,060
to find Luhua Ancient Tower.

365
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,060
Luhua Ancient Tower?

366
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,100
Is this what you mean?

367
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,340
Luhua Ancient Tower.

368
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,220
[Luhua Ancient Tower]

369
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,780
It actually exists.

370
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,460
Whose notebook is this?

371
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,940
It's complicated.

372
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,500
I need to sort things out
before I tell you.

373
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,260
My last three days

374
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,820
were quite complicated as well.

375
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,020

Tang Wuxin.

380
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,660
Your father was a Spiritual Guardian.

381
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,460
Who would have thought

382
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,700
that an office worker

383
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,020
and a delivery guy

384
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,900
went through these things

385
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,140
in the last three days?

386
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,660
We are a miserable couple.

387
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,380
Fellows in distress?

388
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,860
Your father was a Spiritual Guardian.

389
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,100
My mother was also a Spiritual Guardian.

390
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,100
They all had something to do

391
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,700
with the Luhua Ancient Tower.

392
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,060
This can't be a coincidence.

393
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,340
By the way,

394
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,420
among your father's relics,

395
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,220
is there a General's Box?

396
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,260
What is a General's Box?

397
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,140
A General's Box

398
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,700
is a box that Spiritual Guardians use

399
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,820
to store information.

400
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,220
Only the General's Chain

401
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:57,900
can open it.

402
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:58,660
I suppose

403
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,140
your father

404
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,500
left key information

405
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,980
about Luhua Ancient Tower in it.

406
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,780
Is this what you're talking about?

407
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,260
Yes, that's it.

408
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,260
And the General's Chain?

409
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,540
I forgot to tell you.

410
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,500
When my dad's grave was robbed,

411
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,340
nothing went missing

412
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,700
except a necklace.

413
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,180
According to your words,

414
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,620
that must be the General's Chain.

415
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,500
Without the General's Chain,

416
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,380
we can't open the box.

417
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,500
But it was lost

418
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,820
before we knew it.

419
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,820
Where are we supposed to find it?

420
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,860
Not necessarily.

421
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,180
A General's Chain symbolizes
a Spiritual Guardian's

422
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,180
identity and qualification.

423
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,660
One street, one chain.

424
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:42,940
Whoever stole

425
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,700
your father's chain

426
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,380
must have something
to do with Hanxian Street.

427
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,780
Searching for it on Hanxian Street

428
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,300
is our best solution.

429
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,300
Xia Ling,

430
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:55,780
do you trust me?

431
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,020
Of course.

432
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,180
Then give me this box.

433
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,260
I will go to Hanxian Street

434
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,140
to search for the General's Chain.

435
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:02,820
No.

436
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,780
Because I'm coming, too.

437
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,140
Xia Ling,

438
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,500
hear me out.

439
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,900
This is not as simple as you think.

440
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,140
Whoever stole

441
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,900
the chain

442
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,140
must be a big deal

443
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,140
on Hanxian Street.

444
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,820
To take it back,

445
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,380
I probably need to risk my life.

446
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,100
Cao Yanbing.

447
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,580
It is my dad's box.

448
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,340
And it is

449
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,660
also my dad's chain.

450
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,780
And Hanxian Street

451
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,180
was the place where my dad died

452
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,340
trying to protect.

453
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,020
This time,

454
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,620
I must do it myself.

455
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,020
Besides,

456
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,500
aren't we partners?

457
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,980
If I were to risk my life,

458
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,540
would you rest assured

459
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,700
and wait for me in the Human Realm?

460
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,340
Of course, I wouldn't.

461
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,300
But...

462
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,460
No buts.

463
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,820
I know.

464
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,780
You think I've started a brand new life

465
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,340
with a new job

466
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,300
in the Human Realm,

467
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,300
and shouldn't get involved

468
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,580
in the fray of Spiritual Crossroads.

469
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,420
But have you ever thought

470
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,900
that it isn't the life

471
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,620
I truly desire?

472
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:02,860
Ever since I know

473
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,340
that I am a Spirit-hosted Human,

474
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,780
I feel like

475
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,940
my life isn't just about this.

476
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,580
It must have been blessed

477
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,460
with a mission.

478
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,260
And now,

479
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,740
I found out

480
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,460
that my father was a Spiritual Guardian.

481
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,940
Mysteries

482
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,020
are waiting for me to solve.

483
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,540
I have to go this time.

484
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,180
You and I together,

485
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,100
just like before.

486
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,420
Just like before.

487
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,180
But now what's crucial

488
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,220
is to find out

489
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,580
where the entrance

490
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,100
to Hanxian Street is.

491
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,820
That's not hard.

492
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,100
You told me once

493
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,740
that your father worked

494
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,500
at a bar in town.

495
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,100
Spiritual Guardians like us

496
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,180
who have a job
in the Human Realm

497
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,180
tend to work

498
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,300
near the entrance

499
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,220
to the street.

500
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,100
Then let's go there

501
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,740
and start searching.

502
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,420
That should do.

503
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:03,980
We'll leave early tomorrow morning.

504
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:04,500
Okay.

505
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,740
We'll leave first thing in the morning.

506
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,220
Go to bed early.

507
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:06,860
Go to bed early.

508
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:07,780
- Good night.
- Good night.

509
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,900
This hotel

510
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,380
only has

511
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,620
this one last room.

512
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,340
We'll be fine for this one night,
won't we?

513
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,700
It's not awkward, is it?

514
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,260
Yes, it is.

515
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,940
We are partners.

516
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,820
It won't be awkward.

517
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:34,700
Good night.

518
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,420
Good night.

519
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:48,940
Uhh...

520
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,420
Gladly it's a standard room.

521
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,660
Two beds.

522
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,220
Just one for each.

523
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,220
It won't matter
even if there's just one bed.

524
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,900
One bed...

525
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,580
One bed might

526
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,180
be inappropriate.

527
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,020
Don't be so picky.

528
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,620
When I traveled with my classmates,

529
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,780
five of us shared one room.

530
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,420
Thank you,

531
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,180
Xia Ling.
