You bunch of Spirit-hosted Humans,

41
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,640
just because
your Guardian Primordial Spirits

42
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:42,860
are strong,

that your Guardian Primordial Spirit

Stop the act

49
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,380
and summon it already!

51
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,140
not to act all high and mighty?

52
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,860
Besides, so what if I have
a Guardian Primordial Spirit?

53
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,940
We should both summon them.

I'm afraid

99
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,460
your concern is just an excuse.

105
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,700

108
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,460
I'm okay. It's not your concern.

I can help relieve the pain temporarily,

112

but the Primordial Spirit Power

113
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,540
I can use is limited

114
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,500

your Primordial Spirit Power

119
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,780

You really aren't planning to run away?

124
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,460
I don't know why you think

125
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,260
my friends and I

126
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,460
would harm Lingfeng Street.

127
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,940
However, trust

128
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,180
isn't something we can guarantee.

129
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,060
If you're worried,

130
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,500
you can wait

131
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,460
until I finish helping you heal,

132
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,220
and then we can go together.

133
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,780
That way,

134
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,100

135
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,980

at the moment?

170
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,100
It's because you have

00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,140
no killing intent.

172
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,660
Even when you're being trampled on,

173
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,300

Don't!

191
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,980
Be good

192
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,700
and go play somewhere else.

193
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,540
Enjoy

194
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,100
the wonderful freedom.

195
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,540
Master.

196
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,340
What's going on with him?

197
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,580
Is he...

198
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,340
Cao Yanbing,
what are you planning to do?

199
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,340
Sevenfold Soul-Resonance Bell!

200
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,460
In the boundless nether world,

201
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,220
amidst the layers of Vajra mountains,

202
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,900
the boundless light of the sacred jewel,

203
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,820
pierces through the flames of torment.

204
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,620
Sins bound to the nether realms,

205
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,500
enshrouded by the clouds of incense.

206
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,220
Upon the lotus of serenity and wisdom,

207
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,020
the divine spirit
ascends to eternal peace.

208
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,180
Xia Ling,

209
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,820
what happened to Cao Yanbing?

210
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,980
Why would he have done such a thing?

211
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,700
He must have been consumed
by something evil,

212
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,260
and it's even more severe than before.

213
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,660
Consumed?

214
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,540
It's not something
that can be easily explained.

215
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,980
Hurry and take him to get treatment.

216
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:05,980
Okay.

217
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,460
Ruofu,

218
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,980
quickly take the guest

219
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,940
to a safe place to get treated.

220
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,540
Yes, Mother.

221
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,900
It must be Master,

222
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,340
but he clearly...

223
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,860
Don't come looking for me again.

224
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,660
Could it be

225
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,740
that Master has never truly perished

226
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,380
and has remained in this world
all along?

227
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,900
Kneel.

228
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,820
Do you understand what you did wrong?

229
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:47,980
I don't.

230
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,180
You want to be a hero,

231
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,340
even going so far
as to impersonate a guide

232
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,620
and risk your life
against the Fire-Eater King.

233
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,180
Isn't that wrong?

234
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,940
If I didn't pretend to be the guide,

235
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,620
do you want me
to tell the Fire-Eater King

236
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,540
that our Lingfeng Street's guide

237
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,180
has already...

238
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:02,740
Silence.

239
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,740
How dare you say that?

240
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,940
If I hadn't arranged for someone
to clean up your mess,

241
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,740
you'd be dead by now.

242
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,460
I know

243
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,700
you think I'm useless

244
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,060
and can't help with anything.

245
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,900
You're simply

246
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,460
more of a hindrance than a help.

247
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,500
It's true those three

248
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,420
killed the Fire-Eater King,

249
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,660
but we also owe them

250
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,460
a favor.

251
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,340
Don't forget

252
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,860
that they were also looking for a guide

253
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,220
to enter Luohua Ancient Tower.

254
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,300
What do you want me to do now?

255
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,580
What's the big deal?

256
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,820
Just don't give it to them
if you don't want to.

257
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,660
Don't give it to them?

258
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,180
Do you really think

259
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,180
it's that simple?

260
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,820
Have you forgotten

261
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,620
how that perfectly good house

262
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,100
turned into ruins in an instant?

263
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,100
If we really refuse,

264
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,820
can you guarantee

265
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,180
that the same won't happen to us?

266
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,940
We've already endured

267
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,900
a massacre five years ago.

268
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,380
I don't want to take any more risks.

269
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,060
I hadn't considered this aspect.

270
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,540
So

271
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,380
what should we do now?

272
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,820
Get up first.

273
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:30,860
Were you injured

274
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,620
just now?

275
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,220
I'm fine with no serious injuries.

276
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,820
Stay out of it now.

277
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,180
Leave the rest

278
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,780
to me.

279
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,460
Mother,

280
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,820
you want me to stay out of it again.

281
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,860
Am I really unable

282
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,660
to be of any help?

283
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,580
If you really wish to help,

284
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,660
it can be arranged.

285
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,740
Is it really that simple?

286
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,100
What's the point of doing this?

287
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,540
No more questions.

288
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,980
Just get it done.

289
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,180
Yes.

290
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,620
Cao Yanbing,

291
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,300
we've finally met.

292
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,220
Who are you?

293
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,660
I've told you.

294
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,340
I

295
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,900
am you.

296
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,740
If you are me,

297
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:04,900
why haven't I

298
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,620
seen you before?

299
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,660
Do you remember the Prison Guardian?

300
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,060
Thousands of years ago,

301
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,420
he suppressed a demonic aura

302
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,820
that was a remnant

303
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,260
of the Demon Lord's power
after his death.

304
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,900
What demonic aura? What Demon Lord?

305
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,540
What are you talking about?

306
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,900
What's it got to do with me?

307
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,660
How can it have nothing to do with you?

308
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,300
The Prison Guardian

309
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,500
accidentally opened the seal

310
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,460
while dealing with you,

311
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,460
causing the demonic aura to leak out

312
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,740
and invade your body.

313
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,580
It then found the darkest part

314
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,700
of your heart

315
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,860
and manifested as my demonic form.

316
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,460
Did I bring you into existence?

317
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,380
Yes,

318
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,500
I am the dark side

319
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,980
of your Primordial Spirit.

320
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,860
What do you want to do?

321
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,380
Of course,
it's to dominate together with you

322
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,660
and grant you supreme power.

323
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,660
Power?

324
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:58,980
What do you mean?

325
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,340
Did you forget

326
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,500
that I was the one who helped you defeat

327
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,700
the Fire-Eater King just now?

328
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,100
Don't!

329
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,900
I also gave a little demonstration

330
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,260
of my power.

331
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,740
The building that got blown up.

332
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,620
So?

333
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,540
Do you like it?

334
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,580
It's too brutal and inhumane.

335
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,420
I'm not interested
in this kind of power.

336
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,940
How can you accuse me of being inhumane?

337
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,580
Are you dumb or something?

338
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,500
I'm not human,

339
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,780
so I don't have to worry about humanity.

340
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,020
Besides,

341
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,740
it wasn't me who let that demonic beast

342
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,340
bite off its master's head.

343
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,660
It was you.

344
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,020
No way.

345
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,740
Cut out the gossip.

346
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,020
Think it over carefully.

347
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,100
If you hadn't shown killing intent,

348
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,700
I wouldn't have been able
to use my power.

349
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,380
All of my actions

350
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,940
are actually determined by you.

351
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,620
Cao Yanbing,

352
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,300
this is Spiritual Crossroad,

353
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,460
where only those with absolute power

354
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,380
can realize their wishes.

355
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,300
Think about your mother.

356
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,220
The Luhua Ancient Tower

357
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,380
is not an easy challenge.

358
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,260
Your strength alone

359
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,540
is utterly insufficient.

360
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,980
You need me.

361
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,260
And only I

362
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,580
can assist you.

363
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,660
Consider this carefully.

364
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,580
Cao Yanbing,

365
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,620
feel free to summon me
whenever you wish.

366
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,060
Remember:

367
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,700
killing intent.

368
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:39,860
In the boundless nether world,

369
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,780
amidst the layers of Vajra mountains,

370
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,700
the boundless light of the sacred jewel,

371
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,620
pierces through the flames of torment.

372
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,500
Sins bound to the nether realms,

373
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,420
enshrouded by the clouds of incense.

374
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,300
Upon the lotus of serenity and wisdom,

375
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,300
the divine spirit
ascends to eternal peace.

376
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,260
In the boundless nether world,

377
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
amidst the layers of Vajra mountains,

378
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,140
the boundless light of the sacred jewel,

379
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,820
pierces through the flames of torment.

380
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,740
Sins bound to the nether realms,

381
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,500
enshrouded by the clouds of incense.

382
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,300
Upon the lotus of serenity and wisdom,

383
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,180
the divine spirit
ascends to eternal peace.

384
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,460
the boundless light of the sacred jewel,

385
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,420
pierces through the flames of torment.

386
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,060
Sins bound to the nether realms,

387
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:56,980
enshrouded by the clouds of incense.

388
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,620
Upon the lotus of serenity and wisdom,

389
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,620
the divine spirit
ascends to eternal peace.

390
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,820
I've already chanted

391
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,700
the Soul-Resonance Spell ten times.

392
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,420
Why does he still appear

393
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,340
so frail?

394
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,020
Does this mean he's actually okay now?

395
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,060
Based on my past experience,

396
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,260
he needs to fully awaken
to be considered okay.

397
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,300
This time, his condition
is even more severe

398
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,140
than last time,

399
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,100
and I'm also not sure what will happen.

400
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,660
You mentioned
that this kind of condition

401
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,260
already occurred when you

402
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,180
were at the Shadowbound Prison

403
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:23,900
last time.

404
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,300
Did he possess

405
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,180
the same incredible power back then

406
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,620
as he does today?

407
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,660
I'm not too sure about this either.

408
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,020
It's the first time

409
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,100
I've seen him

410
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,300
being consumed during a fight.

411
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,420
It

412
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,260
was really terrifying.

413
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,100
Thankfully,
it was brought under control,

414
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,500
or I don't know
what might have happened.

415
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:47,820
Come in.

416
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,980
How is he?

417
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,300
There's no immediate danger
to his life right now.

418
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,460
Did you come here just to check on him?

419
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,100
I've come to deliver a message
from my mother.

420
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,860
She acknowledged

421
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
your efforts

422
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,740
in eliminating the Fire-Eater King

423
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,100
for the Wind-Treading Clan.

424
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,740
My mother has prepared a banquet at home

425
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,420
and would like to invite Mr. Beiluo over
for a catch-up.

426
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,460
Your mother invited me?

427
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,460
Is she only inviting Beiluo?
What about me?

428
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,620
I'm not sure about the specifics,

429
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,140
but I know

430
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,580
that my mother wants to apologize

431
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,820
to Mr. Beiluo
for her actions earlier today.

432
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,060
I understand.

433
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,060
There was a misunderstanding
earlier today.

434
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,140
It won't be appropriate if I'm present.

435
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:36,980
You can go ahead.

436
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,020
I'll stay here with him.

437
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,860
My mother said

438
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,580
that since they'll be drinking
and chatting,

439
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,460
you might get bored.

440
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,220
She suggested
I show you around Lingfeng Street

441
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,420
and make sure you're well entertained.

442
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,660
Would you like to join me?

443
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,980
He's quite safe here.

444
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,220
All right, I'll follow your suggestion.

445
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,540
Thank you for your trouble.

446
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,180
I'm only obeying the order.

447
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:03,820
Let's go.

448
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,060
Come on.

449
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,420
I'll pour you a drink.

450
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,220
Here.

451
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,300
Beiluo,

452
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,020
I apologize

453
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:26,860
for any offense caused before.

454
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,420
Consider this drink

455
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,700
as my way of making amends.

456
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,060
Since the matter is in the past,

457
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:31,900
there's no need to bring it up again.

458
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:32,540
Sounds good.

459
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,380
Let's toast

460
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,620
to Lingfeng Street's turn
from peril to peace.

461
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:37,460
Okay.

462
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,820
Try these dishes.

463
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,060
They

464
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,620
used to be your favorites
when you were younger.

465
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,260
Here, taste them.

466
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,340
Thank you.

467
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,020
I remember these flower cakes

468
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,380
used to be Tianyue's favorite.

469
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,260
When I asked you about him

470
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:01,940
while I was in the cell,

471
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,780
you hesitated

472
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,100
and said you would explain later.

473
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,140
Has something happened to him?

474
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,420
My brother

475
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,620
has been seriously ill in recent years,

476
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,460
and he rarely goes out now.

477
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,260
He's seriously ill?
What kind of illness is it?

478
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,180
The Malevolent Beings
are entirely to blame.

479
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,100
Five years ago,

480
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,940
Lingfeng Street was attacked

481
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,460
by a Malevolent Beings legion.

482
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,380
At that time,

483
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,460
many of our clan members
were either killed or wounded,

484
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,140
and we nearly faced extinction.

485
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,020
My brother felt immense guilt

486
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,500
and was deeply concerned

487
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,020
about the future

488
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,140
of our Wind-Treading Clan.

489
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,420
He was already severely injured,

490
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:41,620
so

491
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,820
he fell seriously ill afterward.

492
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,180
Over the recent years,

493
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,300
his condition continued to worsen

494
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,340
and he has been unable
to manage clan affairs.

495
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,060
Consequently,
I had to reluctantly assume the role

496
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,860
of acting Spiritual Guardian.

497
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,580
Then,

498
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,980
where is he at the moment?

499
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,220
Can I visit him?

500
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,660
Beiluo,

501
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,780
you and my brother go way back.

502
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,220
I truly appreciate your concern

503
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,780
for my brother

504
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,260
and your desire to visit him.

505
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,260
However, he spends

506
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,420
most of his time

507
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,300
in a deep sleep

508
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,140
and is quite incapacitated.

509
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,820
Even if you go to see him,

510
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,300
it's unlikely that you'd be able

511
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,100
to catch up with him.

512
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,780
I think

513
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,060
it's best if you don't visit him.

514
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,220
I don't need to talk to him.

515
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,420
I just want to visit and see him.

516
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,140
Okay,

517
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,260
I'll see how my elder brother is doing.

518
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,540
If he feels a little better

519
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,220
in the coming days,

520
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,540
I'll arrange for you to visit him.

521
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,660
Sure.

522
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,100
Come on.

523
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,140
Have another drink.

524
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,140
I'll pour you some more.

525
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,620
Thank you

526
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,180
for coming out with me in this weather.

527
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,300
This place is really beautiful,

528
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,060
and I'm glad it wasn't taken
by the Fire-Eater King.

529
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,500
All right,

530
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,780
I know you've put in effort.

531
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,020
Just tell me
what you'd like to eat later,

532
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:58,980
and I'll treat you.

533
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,860
I'm not eating anymore.
I'm already stuffed.

534
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,020
I just hope
you don't find my hospitality lacking.

535
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,980
I think the hospitality
has been excellent.

536
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:06,980
You know,

537
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,460
since I graduated from college,

538
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,020
I haven't had such a leisurely time

539
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,940
eating and strolling.

540
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,260
What's that over there?

541
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,100
Let's go check it out.

542
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,740
Take a break.

543
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,500
Aren't you tired from all the walking?

544
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,260
By the way,

545
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,660
did you get hurt today?

546
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,740
Have you checked your injuries?

547
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,660
I'm perfectly fine.

548
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,500
You don't need to worry about it.

549
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:36,780
I saw today

550
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,220
that the Fire-Eater King's sword qi

551
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
blasted you quite far.

552
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,700
Are you sure you're okay?

553
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,940
Should I ask Li Xuanyuan

554
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,540
to take a look?

555
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,060
He's my Guardian Primordial Spirit.

556
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,140
He can not only fight

557
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,060
but also concoct elixirs and make pills.

558
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:56,900
Sorry,

559
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,980
I didn't think much before...

560
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,100
Actually,

561
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,460
I only recently managed

562
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,100
to summon my Guardian Primordial Spirit.

563
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,820
I have some experience with this.

564
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,940
If you tell me about it,

565
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,340
maybe I can help you.

566
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,180
Sir,

567
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,380
give us a jug of liquor.

568
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,900
Go ahead and tell me.

569
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,380
And two appetizers, please.

570
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,020
Just tell me about it. After all...

571
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,660
No, thanks.

572
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,180
So I can't summon
my Guardian Primordial Spirit.

573
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,180
What does that have to do with you?

574
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,860
Are we that close?

575
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,620
Don't be so worked up.

576
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,300
I just want to show you that I care.

577
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,380
I don't need your care.

578
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,500
I know

579
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,540
that you are only so nice to me

580
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,260
because I'm the guide

581
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,700
and you want me to assist you.

582
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,700
It's all just phony,

583
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:38,940
and I'm not falling for it.

584
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,180
I genuinely care about you,

585
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,500
but you say it's all phony.

586
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,540
Have you considered

587
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,740
that if we hadn't come here,

588
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,340
you wouldn't even be sitting here?

589
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:49,740
I...

590
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,300
Here's your liquor.

591
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,460
Here we go.

592
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:04,540
Please enjoy.

593
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:05,860
Thanks.

594
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,500
You may leave now.

595
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,060
I...

596
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,020
I was just careless that time.

597
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,180
If we compete again,

598
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,420
I'll definitely be just as good as you.

599
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,100
You want to compete with me?

600
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,820
You must be addicted to fighting.

601
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,660
I'm not going to play along.

602
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,700
Instead of a fight,

603
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,140
we'll have a drinking contest.

604
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:25,900
Are you up for it?

605
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:31,900
Cheers.

606
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,420
Cheers.

607
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,500
Come on. Have another one.

608
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,460
- Fifteen, twenty...
- Fifteen, twenty...

609
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:39,940
- Ten!
- Five!

610
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,300
Drink up.

611
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,140
- Fifteen, twenty...
- Fifteen, twenty...

612
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,660
- Five!
- Five!

613
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,780
Come on, bottom's up.

614
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,740
- Fifteen...
- Fifteen...

615
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:50,660
Your turn to drink.

616
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,300
I've been feeling thirsty.

617
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,260
Come on, we'll drink

618
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,380
till we drop today.
