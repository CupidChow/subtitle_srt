00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,020
like the plague,

193
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,820
and you're rushing in!

194
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,780
Enough!

195
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,740
My mom is in there.

196
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
Even if it's hell,

197
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,980
I'll go

198
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,700
get her out.

199
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,740
But if you can't come back,

200
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,940
then I'll...

201
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,100
So,

202
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,740
you'd better hope I do come back.

203
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,420
I...

204
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,660
Get lost!

205
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,340
Hold on.

206
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,780
I'll give you a chance for revenge.

207
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,300
When you get back to Xihu Street,

208
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,180
report me to the Hall of Heroes.

209
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,580
Tell them Cao Yanbing
is on Rakshasa Street.

210
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,020
Er...

211
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,100
You know what to say

212
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
and what not to say, right?

213
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,540
If I find out

214
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,180
you said anything you shouldn't have,

215
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,900
don't expect any antidote from me.

216
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,060
Got it.

217
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,060
Yanbing?

218
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,620
You're back!

219
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,740
What about Wang Meng?

220
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,620
Don't worry,

221
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,620
I've dealt with him.

222
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:04,900
Yanbing,

223
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,860
is it safe for you to be back now?

224
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,380
The Hall of Heroes

225
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,500
is looking for you everywhere.

226
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,660
But I have to come back

227
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,660
for your birthday.

228
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,620
Look,

229
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,860
I bought

230
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:20,860
this cake

231
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,140
from a popular shop.

232
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,260
I had to wait in line forever.

233
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,900
Happy birthday!

234
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,620
How is it?

235
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,460
Hey,

236
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,260
look there.

237
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,780
Liang,

238
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,460
even though your memories

239
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
of Mom are faint,

240
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,980
never forget

241
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,140
that she loved you very much.

242
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,980
The one thing she always told me

243
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,540
was to protect you well.

244
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,500
I'll remember that.

245
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,860
Yanbing,

246
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,740
I just remembered

247
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,220
this afternoon,

248
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,380
Ling helped me teach a lesson

249
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,500
to some guys from the Hall of Heroes.

250
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,260
They got really angry.

251
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,500
I guess they'll probably come back soon.

252
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,260
You should leave

253
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,780
before they see you.

254
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,500
Alright.

255
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,900
Take good care of the house.

256
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,140
I'll get going now.

257
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,620
You can count on me.

258
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,220
I'll ensure the safety
of Rakshasa Street.

259
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,020
If anything happens, contact Xia Ling.

260
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:51,980
I'm off.

261
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,460
If you don't finish the cake,

262
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,500
put it in the fridge.

263
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,500
And the water
in the fish tank needs changing.

264
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,740
Got it.

265
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,270
[Rakshasa Street]

266
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:37,980
Who's there?

267
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,300
Cao Yanbing.

268
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,900
Seize him!

269
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,820
So, you really returned
to Rakshasa Street.

270
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,220
You've got guts.

271
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,540
You'll suffer a lot
in Shadowbound Prison.

272
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,920
[Xuanma, Celestial Dragon League]

273
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,370
[Reincarnation City]

274
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:23,620
Chief,

275
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,980
everything went smoothly.

276
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,340
Cao Yanbing fell for Wang Meng's words

277
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,820
and walked right into our trap.

278
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,940
He's been taken to Shadowbound Prison.

279
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,900
[Huangfu Longdou,
Chief of Celestial Dragon League]

280
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,660
Well done.

281
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,660
The show is finally about to begin.

282
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,580
But I've heard

283
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,780
that Shadowbound Prison
is extremely dangerous.

284
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,220
What if Cao Yanbing doesn't make it out?

285
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,260
Won't that ruin our plans?

286
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,380
Xuanma,

287
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,980
[Ying Chengfeng]
it's a fact.

288
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,580
Shadowbound Prison

289
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,700
is constructed entirely

290
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,660
from the Iron Behemoth's carcass,

291
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,660
one of the hardest creatures
from the Border Realm.

292
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,500
It's the most impregnable place

293
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,980
in all of the Spiritual Crossroads.

294
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,980
Surrounded by lava

295
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,580
with scorching temperatures,

296
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,380
it's a place

297
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,700
with neither sunlight

298
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,900
nor communication.

299
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,460
Once you're arrested,

300
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,300
there's no release.

301
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,620
No one cares

302
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,220
about the prisoners' lives.

303
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,500
Water, please.

304
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,660
Water...

305
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,180
Give me some water.

306
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,700
Or just kill me!

307
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,100
Give me some water.

308
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,620
Its guardian

309
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,820
has been the same person for centuries.

310
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,180
That's a nightmare
for Spirit-hosted Humans

311
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,940
and the Guardian Primordial Spirits.

312
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,620
Prison break

313
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,300
is impossible.

314
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,060
No,

315
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,780
it's almost impossible.

316
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,020
So, does that mean

317
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,380
Cao Yanbing

318
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,620
is definitely not getting out?

319
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,100
That can't happen.

320
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,700
Chief's plan

321
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,420
requires his

322
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,380
Divine Warrior's Physique.

323
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,900
Xuanma's right.

324
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,260
Cao Yanbing is a part of my plan.

325
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,300
Chengfeng's also correct.

326
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,860
Shadowbound Prison

327
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,340
is impregnable.

328
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,180
No one inside there can get out.

329
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,900
But if Cao Yanbing

330
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,060
can't even pass the test

331
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,180
of Shadowbound Prison,

332
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,780
how can he work for me?

333
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:35,700
Besides,

334
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,620
he needs to enter

335
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,020
Shadowbound Prison himself

336
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,580
to uncover what really happened

337
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,180
to his mother.

338
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,620
New prisoners from the Hall of Heroes.

339
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,340
Prison Guardian, come and take them in.

340
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,540
Li Gucheng,

341
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,620
if you bother me again,

342
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,180
I'll leave you
in Shadowbound Prison too.

343
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:25,860
Good.

344
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,540
After collecting so many weapons,

345
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,940
I finally have something useful.

346
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,340
Madam.

347
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,100
You're here.

348
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,220
I heard you

349
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,860
captured Cao Yanbing last night.

350
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,620
Well done.

351
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,140
It's just my duty.

352
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,740
And we had

353
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,580
a sudden lead.

354
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,260
Did you hand him over
to the Prison Guardian?

355
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,020
Yes.

356
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,780
I personally saw the Prison Guardian

357
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,820
take Cao Yanbing into custody.

358
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,060
But the Prison Guardian

359
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,860
was arrogant.

360
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,220
He didn't even process

361
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:19,900
the paperwork

362
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,820
and just left us hanging.

363
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,780
It seemed like
he wasn't too committed to his duty.

364
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Li Gucheng,

365
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,940
do you know how long the Prison Guardian

366
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,460
has been watching

367
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,740
over Shadowbound Prison?

368
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,660
At least 800 years.

369
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,020
So,

370
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,820
as long as that guy is there,

371
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,620
no one who enters Shadowbound Prison

372
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,140
will ever cause any trouble.

373
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,180
Got it?

374
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,460
Alright, enough of that.

375
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,420
Deploy 60% of the forces

376
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,580
in the hall for me.

377
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,060
I'm taking them

378
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,740
on a mission.

379
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,500
60%?

380
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,980
Isn't that a bit much?

381
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,740
Many Fiend Beasts have been spotted

382
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,780
in the Border Sea lately.

383
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,340
The chief has important matters
to attend to,

384
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,340
so the Border Domain sent me

385
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,860
to handle it with extra manpower.

386
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,620
You will

387
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,860
stay here with the remaining forces

388
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,780
and guard the hall.

389
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,700
Yes, Madam.

390
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,420
But...

391
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,740
Speak.

392
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,100
Even though Cao Yanbing
is in Shadowbound Prison,

393
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,860
he seems to have another motive.

394
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,740
I'm concerned he might cause trouble.

395
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,940
Should we leave more forces here?

396
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,180
Li Gucheng,

397
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,260
you're being overly cautious.

398
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,940
As long as Cao Yanbing

399
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,180
is in Shadowbound Prison,

400
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,660
he's no threat to us.

401
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,500
Leave him to the Prison Guardian.

402
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:43,900
Now,

403
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,980
go and deploy the troops.

404
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,500
Yes.

405
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,020
I told you many times.

406
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,300
[Company Goals]
Change the client's mind

407
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,020
with a single title.

408
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,780
Look what you wrote.

409
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,780
What's your underlying logic?

410
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,580
What about the top-level design?

411
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,140
What's the final value?

412
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,780
And the key steps

413
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,020
in the process?

414
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,620
How do you ensure

415
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,860
the closed loop in your answer?

416
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,540
When I graduated,

417
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,220
I could write

418
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,380
eight presentations like this

419
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,100
just during a bathroom break.

420
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,740
And you?

421
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:24,820
You had eight bathroom breaks

422
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,140
during doing one.

423
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:26,780
I'm counting every time for you

424
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,460
from the office.

425
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,260
What are you even doing?

426
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,300
How long has it been
since you graduated?

427
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,140
Three months, right?

428
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,300
You should have adjusted by now.

429
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,940
Why can't you understand
my instructions?

430
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,100
Maybe you should reflect

431
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,340
on your learning ability.

432
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,060
You need to adapt to the environment,

433
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,820
not wait for the environment
to adapt to you.

434
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,340
I've never seen

435
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,300
such a poor-performing graduate.

436
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,700
Fix it.

437
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,380
But boss,

438
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,620
it's due tomorrow.

439
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,580
You know it's due tomorrow?

440
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,780
That's why I'm telling you

441
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,860
to pull an all-nighter and fix it.

442
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,940
Or do you think

443
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,380
we'll have tea
while working on it tomorrow?

444
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,100
You're driving me crazy.

445
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,260
Everyone,

446
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,620
stop what you're doing for a moment.

447
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,220
Back in my day,

448
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,220
we worked

449
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,740
to make our boss happy.

450
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,860
But now,

451
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,460
you all just focus
on making yourselves happy.

452
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:19,860
Master,

453
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,540
I can't take this anymore.

454
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,540
Is your work

455
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,060
supposed to be for me?

456
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,540
Today,

457
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,060
I must teach him a lesson.

458
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,780
Keep silent.

459
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,780
Talking back, huh?

460
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,940
You think you're the boss, right?

461
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,300
No,

462
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,100
I didn't mean that.

463
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,860
Xia Ling, listen.

464
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,980
I used to think

465
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,860
you were just incompetent,

466
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,140
but now I see you're also impolite.

467
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,380
Didn't your parents ever teach you

468
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,500
not to talk back

469
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,540
to your superiors?

470
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,140
You're so rude.

471
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,060
You scoundrel!

472
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,980
You've gone too far!

473
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,340
Hot.

474
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,820
It's so hot.

475
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,970
[Help]

476
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,540
Seems like

477
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,820
this is Shadowbound Prison.

478
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,980
Great.

479
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,260
Why hasn't it been unlocked?

480
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,820
No way.

481
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,420
Mom,

482
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,260
are you messing with me?

483
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,380
I'm doing exactly

484
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,700
what you taught me,

485
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,940
but the lock isn't budging at all.

486
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,620
It's been three hours.

487
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,820
Can you do it or not?

488
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,140
Maybe I should

489
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:27,900
show you again?

490
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,700
Hold on.

491
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,500
Let me try. I'm about to get it.

492
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,660
Did you follow

493
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,020
what I taught you?

494
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,860
You didn't remember

495
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,020
the most important step.

496
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,420
What's the most important step?

497
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,220
It's staying calm.

498
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,700
When you get anxious,

499
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,740
you can't think straight,

500
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,460
and your movements become less precise.

501
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,340
Of course, the lock won't open.

502
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,100
All the locks are the same.

503
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,540
The first step

504
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:01,820
is to take a deep breath.

505
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,380
Imagine only you and the lock

506
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,380
exist in the world.

507
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,060
Gently turn the pick

508
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,540
and the slightly curved part

509
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,860
to feel the space inside the keyhole,

510
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,540
especially the lower part.

511
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,940
Apply slight pressure

512
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,420
to turn the lock
in the correct direction.

513
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,260
Feel the pins inside

514
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,060
and overcome them.

515
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,820
Add more force

516
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,820
bit by bit.

517
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,820
Lift each pin

518
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,140
into the right place.

519
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,500
Stay quiet, even quieter.

520
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,620
When you're calm enough

521
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,300
to hear

522
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,700
your own heartbeat,

523
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:42,900
no lock

524
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,900
can hold you back.

525
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,980
Then you'll feel

526
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,060
a slight give

527
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,220
and hear

528
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,340
a faint click.

529
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,700
Thank you,

530
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,940
Mom.

531
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:38,620
Water!

532
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,100
I need water!

533
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,660
Dude.

534
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,020
Dude.

535
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,300
He's gone mad.

536
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,740
He's dried up like a mummy.

537
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,980
No one even cares.

538
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,620
This place is really inhuman.

539
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,300
He's living?

540
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:01,940
Who are you?

541
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,420
It doesn't matter.

542
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,140
I just want

543
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,900
to ask you something.

544
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,780
Among the people brought here,

545
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:10,940
is there anyone

546
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,700
named Tang Xiaoxiao?

547
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,500
Brought here?

548
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,300
Yeah,

549
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,820
I was brought here too.

550
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,740
It's been five years...

551
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,420
Or seven...

552
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,340
I don't remember.

553
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,700
I don't remember.

554
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,500
I really don't.

555
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,180
Alright,

556
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,340
sorry to bother you.

557
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,460
Hey,

558
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,780
can you talk to me for a while?

559
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,740
My Guardian Primordial Spirit

560
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,020
is locked by this Spirit-Locking Stone.

561
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,020
It's been so long

562
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,100
since I've spoken to anyone.

563
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,180
There used to be some noise here,

564
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,140
but now it seems like everyone's dead.

565
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,540
Please, just talk to me for a while.

566
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,660
Please, talk to me.

567
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,140
Sorry,

568
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,900
I feel for you,

569
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,580
but I don't have time for small talk.

570
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,940
I need to ask someone else

571
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,300
around here.

572
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,180
Sorry.

573
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,580
Then could you

574
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,940
at least unlock this for me?

575
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,540
You managed to get in here,

576
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,980
so you must be able
to pick a lock, right?

577
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,060
I just want to talk
to my Guardian Primordial Spirit

578
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:11,580
for a bit.

579
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,380
I'm begging you.

580
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,420
Alright,

581
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,300
but keep it quiet.

582
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:23,780
Don't worry,

583
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,260
I won't dare to escape.

584
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,540
If I get caught by that person...

585
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,300
No, I won't.

586
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,860
My Primordial Spirit Power
is back now.

587
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,060
Take care of yourself.

588
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,060
Sir.

589
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,380
You've done me a great favor.

590
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,500
I don't know the answer

591
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,580
to your question,

592
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,260
but I can tell you

593
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,540
a secret I've learned.

594
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,700
A secret?

595
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:05,660
Come here.

596
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:08,860
I heard from the previous prisoners

597
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,060
on this level

598
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,740
that besides

599
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,140
the cells numbered

600
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,940
from one onward,

601
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,900
there's also a cell zero.

602
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,260
Those special prisoners

603
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:18,980
who were secretly captured

604
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,860
are all kept there.

605
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,660
Secretly captured?

606
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,020
He's coming.

607
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,340
My Primordial Spirit Power

608
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,780
must have caught his attention.

609
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:35,780
Don't let him take me!

610
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,060
Don't let him take me!

611
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Who is he you're talking about?

612
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,700
Run, run!

613
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,140
Run now!

614
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,260
Run!

615
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,940
Don't come any closer.

616
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,620
Stop running,

617
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,220
coward.

618
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,020
Is this fun for you?

619
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,140
Pretty fun.

620
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,700
Xu Chu, Dianwei!

621
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,340
Two Guardian Primordial Spirits?

622
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,940
You have a Divine Warrior's Physique?

623
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,380
Interesting.

624
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,740
Back off, you fiend!

625
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,420
I'll kill you!

626
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,740
Got two beads in one go.

627
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,740
It's been a while
since I've had this much fun.

628
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,060
In three days,

629
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,700
the black beads will turn white

630
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,820
and become my power.

631
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,980
You must have more

632
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,860
Guardian Primordial Spirits inside you.

633
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,940
I won't kill you yet.

634
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,060
I'll lock you back up.

635
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,860
You'll come out again.

636
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,740
You're interesting,

637
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,580
different from other prisoners.

638
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,420
I don't know

639
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,740
why you're trying to escape,

640
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,940
and I don't really care.

641
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,220
You can come out whenever you want.

642
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,380
But remember,

643
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,380
I'll find you,

644
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,740
beat you down,

645
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,900
and lock you up again

646
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,220
until
all your Guardian Primordial Spirits

647
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,460
are in my hands.

648
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,820
You'll regret this.

649
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,500
No one in Shadowbound Prison

650
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,860
