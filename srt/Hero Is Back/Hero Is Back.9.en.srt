over the forest,

147
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,540
making the tower invisible to others.

148
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,580
This spell

149
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,500
is bound to the bloodline

150

can use a specific incantation

only the guide

165
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,500

The clan leader

169
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,820
is usually the Spiritual Guardian

170

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,300
There are just over ten days left

173
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,140
Is that enough time
for us to find the guide?

174
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,020
In my opinion,

175
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,180
they won't easily hand over the guide

176
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,860
because they are committed
to protecting

177
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,620
the Luhua Ancient Tower.

178
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,380
I think

00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,020
nothing is absolute in this world.

I'm confident

181
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,300
that we'll surely find

182
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,100
the guide.

183
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,180
Do you have a plan?

184
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,340
No.

185
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,380
How can you be so certain then?

186
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,220
Think about it.

187
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,060
The fact that your mother

188
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,300
was able to enter
the Luhua Ancient Tower back then

189
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,180
means

190
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,660
she had a guide.

191
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,860
The Wind-Treading Clan

192
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,820
was willing to guide her,

193
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,660
so it wouldn't make sense

194
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,100
that they are reluctant
to guide her son now.

195
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,220
In other words,

196
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,620
as long as we find

197
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,300
the guide from ten years ago,

198
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,620
we'll be able to enter the tower.

199
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,620
Let's go.

200
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,180
Head straight to Lingfeng Street.

201
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,980
Why the sudden rush?

202
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,180
You should have told us
if you were going to speed up.

203
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,700
Yes,

204
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,860
being in a rush won't help.

205
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,060
Before we go to Lingfeng Street,

206
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,060
we need to visit another place.

207
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,820
Another place?

208
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,900
Where?

209
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,380
Take a left turn ahead.

210
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,420
Sure.

211
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,260
This is the place.

212
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,940
Why are we here?

213
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,260
The barrier of Lingfeng Street

214
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,300
is on top of a mountain,

215
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,860
so we need to buy
some mountaineering gear

216
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,700
to climb up.

217
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,940
Climb up?

218
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,780
Any problems?

219
00:07:59,180 --> 00:07:59,780
Not at all.

220
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,740
Welcome.

221
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,020
How may I help you?

222
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,500
Hi,

223
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,700
I'd like to buy
some mountaineering gear.

224
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,540
Okay.

225
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:04,980
This way, please.

226
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,700
What are you looking at?

227
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,300
This is a trendy item.

228
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,700
Recently, everyone has been using it

229
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,220
for camping photos.

230
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,100
Let's buy it too.

231
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,740
I want to post it as well.

232
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:23,780
Post on what?

233
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,420
Blue Note.

234
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,300
What is Blue Note?

235
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,420
You don't even know Blue Note?

236
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,420
You're so behind the times.

237
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,820
Xia's office wear?

238
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,380
What's your business with office wear

239
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,620
when you're unemployed?

240
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,300
I was just recently unemployed,

241
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,940
okay?

242
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,580
I'm just temporarily out
of the workforce.

243
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,540
I can still manage

244
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,460
my online persona.

245
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,380
You're deceiving people.

246
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,700
How is that deceiving people?

247
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,700
I'm just sharing

248
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,940
the outfits I like.

249
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,340
Plus, I spend hours editing
and choosing filters

250
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,780
for my photos.

251
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,300
Yes,

252
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,220
if you don't spend a few hours editing,

253
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,140
you won't achieve

254
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,540
such a transformative effect.

255
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,460

256
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,540

You look great.

259
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,100
Wait a second.

260
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,580
What is this?

261
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,380
Delete it.

262
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,180
You want me to delete it?

263
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,220
That can be arranged.

264
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,700
Buy me the lantern.

265
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,420
Xia Ling,

266
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,780

267

huh?

268
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,620
That's right.

269
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,780
Don't make me do this.

00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,020
The Guardian Primordial Spirit
of the Fire-Eater King

378
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,340
is a Demonic Warrior Form

379
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,020
called Salamander.

380
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,780
The Wind-Treading Clan has
inherently weak Primordial Spirit Power,

381
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,340
so the Fire-Eater King

382
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,620
is bound to be a major concern

383
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,580
for Yan Lingyu.

384
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,220
If you can provoke the Fire-Eater King

385
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,460
to attack Lingfeng Street,

386
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,580
Cao Yanbing and his group

387
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,820
will surely step in to help.

388
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,780
If Cao Yanbing helps Yan Lingyu

389
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,020
deal with this issue,

390
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,900
she will be extremely grateful

391
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,980
and any requests you have

392
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,020
will be easier to negotiate.

393
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,900
Understood.

394
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,140
I'll make sure

395
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,380
to use this pawn wisely.

396
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,650
[The outskirts of Lingfeng Street]

397
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,620
The Blaze Jade

398
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,740
we took on this trip

399
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,380
sold for a high price,

400
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,220
more than double
what it was worth last year.

401
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,020
When we return to Lingfeng Street,

402
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,220
the General will definitely...

403
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,980
Fire... Fire-Eater King.

404
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,140
What are you trying to do?

405
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,140
What am I trying to do?

406
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,860
I'm just here

407
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,740
[Fire-Eater King of Fire-Eater Clan]
to walk my dog.

408
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,900
Salamander!

409
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,140
You are awake.

410
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,420
I suppose you don't mind
being invited here

411
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,700
to be my guest.

412
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,620
You...

413
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,860
What did you do to the others?

414
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,820
Rest assured.

415
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,340
I can't even be bothered

416
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,940
to bring back those useless people.

417
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,700
Unlike you, who is very useful.

418
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,820
I heard there's a kind
of miraculous substance

419
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,940
called Blaze Jade on Lingfeng Street.

420
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,580
Taking it

421
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,380
can greatly increase

422
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,620
one's Primordial Spirit Power.

423
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,300
Is that true?

424
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,820
What Blaze Jade?

425
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,180
I...

426
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,660
I've never heard of it.

427
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,660
Think carefully
before you give me an answer.

428
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,380
Everyone knows

429
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,780
that you're the person

430
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,140
Yan Lingyu trusts most

431
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,780
on Lingfeng Street.

432
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,220
You must know

433
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,380
the method to make Blaze Jade.

434
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,460
Tell me!

435
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,340
I...

436
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,180
I...

437
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,380
I...

438
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,540
Even if you want to kill me,

439
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,900
I still won't tell you.

440
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,300
Blaze Jade can only belong
to the Wind-Treading Clan.

441
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,780
Why go through all this trouble

442
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,620
for what you want to do?

443
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,300
Who's outside?

444
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,140
Do you have a death wish?

445
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,700
Acting all mysterious.

446
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,580
Turns out you're a beauty.

447
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,300
Don't worry.

448
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,460
I will not

449
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,540
kill you so quickly.

450
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,980
Why are you wearing a mask?

451
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,980
Let me help you take it off.

452
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,700
What a shame.

453
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,700
The owner
of the Demonic Warrior Form Salamander

454
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,100
is utterly useless.

455
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,460
Who are you?

456
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,700
How do you know about the Salamander?

457
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,820
Who I am isn't important.

458
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,380
What matters
is why I've come to see you.

459
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,420
You have a Salamander,

460
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,980
but you lack the Primordial Spirit Power
to summon it.

461
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,780
Each time you try,

462
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,700
it vanishes in an instant.

463
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,460
Do you know

464
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,900
what's more shameful than lacking power?

465
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,060
It's being unworthy
of the power you have.

466
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,060
You!

467
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,860
You've gone to great lengths
to obtain Blaze Jade,

468
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,660
just to gain its power.

469
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,540
Yet, I can offer you a kind of power

470
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,700
that's even stronger

471
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,420
and more enduring

472
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,580
than what Blaze Jade

473
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,420
can provide.

474
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,820
This is...?

475
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,060
Xuanhuang Pill.

476
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,940
The legendary Xuanhuang Pill

477
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,980
that can enable Spirit-hosted Humans

478
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,180
to unlock and master the power

479
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,900
of their Guardian Primordial Spirit?

480
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,700
Are there other Xuanhuang Pills
in the world?

481
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,420
Before taking something from others,

482
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,580
you should first ask yourself

483
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,780
what you can do

484
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,700
for them.

485
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,220
What do you want me to do?

486
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,060
Tell me!

487
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,380
The guide?

488
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,700
You want to enter Luhua Ancient Tower?

489
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,660
It's best if you don't know

490
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,620
what I intend to do.

491
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,340
One Xuanhuang Pill

492
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,700
provides temporary effects,

493
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,860
while two offer permanence.

494
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,780
You can receive one now

495
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,820
and get the second one
after the task is done.

496
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,300
Deal.

497
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,940
It's highly likely that Elder Mei

498
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,980
has encountered problems this time.

499
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,300
He should have returned yesterday
according to the agreement,

500
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,780
but there's still no news today.

501
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,340
Elder Mei frequently takes this route,

502
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,540
so he's very familiar with it.

503
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,620
We'll have to wait
for the General to return

504
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,180
and see how she decides on this matter.

505
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,940
Only the General

506
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,660
can make the final decision.

507
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,700
Yes.

508
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,140
It's really hard to deal with.

509
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,820
[Yan Ruofu]

510
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,620
He's unlikely to come back unscathed.

511
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,740
Elders,

512
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,620
is there anything
you want to discuss today?

513
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,380
If Elder Mei doesn't return soon,

514
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,540
it will definitely affect

515
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,340
our business.

516
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,820
Elders,

517
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,540
do you have any matters
to discuss today?

518
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,060
I've just received the news,

519
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,420
and it's all true.

520
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,460
Yes. What should we do now?

521
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,140
The General has arrived!

522
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,940
- General.
- General.

523
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,140
[Yan Lingyu]

524
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,100
I trust you are all aware

525
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,980
that Elder Mei has been away
from the camp for over a month.

526
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,420
He was supposed to return
by yesterday at the latest,

527
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,500
but there has been no news.

528
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,500
Elder Mei is highly respected

529
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,260
and is my right-hand man.

530
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,260
This matter

531
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,300
should not be taken lightly.

532
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,020
Lang Da.

533
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:15,780
Yes, Ma'am.

534
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,820
Lead a search yourself.

535
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:18,820
We need to find

536
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,540
Elder Mei's whereabouts
by the end of today.

537
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,580
Yes, Ma'am.

538
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,540
Mother.

539
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,900
This is the Assembly Hall.

540
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,020
There's no place for a mother,

541
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,260
only for the General.

542
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:30,820
General.

543
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,420
What is it?

544
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,420
You may speak now.

545
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,020
I also want to go find Elder Mei.

546
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,540
Not allowed.

547
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,620
Why not?

548
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,860
If you go,

549
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,220
would you prefer Lang Da

550
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,100
to protect you

551
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,580
or Elder Mei?

552
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,220
General,

553
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,420
please trust me.

554
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,900
I will definitely find Elder Mei

555
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,300
and help ease your worries.

556
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,740
I already told you that you

557
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,060
are not allowed to go.

558
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,820
As the Young General of Lingfeng Street,

559
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:57,820
it is my duty to go

560
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,820
and I must go.

561
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,140
If I encounter any mishaps,

562
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,100
it will not be the fault of others.

563
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,180
I respectfully ask
for your permission, General.

564
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,660
Let me ask you this.

565
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,540
If

566
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,460
you fall into the enemy's hands,

567
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,780
what will you do?

568
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,860
I will fight to the death

569
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,620
to protect the honor
of the Wind-Treading Clan.

570
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,340
You can't even summon

571
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,380
your own Guardian Primordial Spirit.

572
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,380
How can you uphold the honor

573
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,460
of our Wind-Treading Clan?

574
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,340
If you need to cry,
do it somewhere else.

575
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,860
I have the freedom
to make my own choice,

576
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,900
and whether you allow it or not,

577
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,380
I will go search for Elder Mei.

578
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,340
You...

579
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,300
General!

580
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,620
General.

581
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:50,900
General.

582
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:51,740
Bad news.

583
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,860
The Fire-Eater King is attacking us.

584
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,060
He's already entered Lingfeng Street.

585
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,020
This is bad.

586
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,380
The Fire-Eater King

587
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,900
is exceptionally ferocious
and formidable.

588
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,460
Yes,

589
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,060
the Fire-Eater King
has always been raiding

590
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,860
the surrounding areas.

591
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,820
How did he manage to get in?

592
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,140
What are we going to do now?

593
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,020
All right,

594
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,620
everyone be quiet.

595
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,340
How are the Border Dwellers outside?

596
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,740
They are too frightened

597
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,540
to leave their homes,

598
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,620
but we don't know if the Fire-Eater King

599
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,900
will actually hurt them.

600
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,460
Relay my command:

601
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,820
sound the drums at once

602
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,180
and prepare for battle.

603
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:17,860
- Yes!
- Yes!

604
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,520
[Assembly Hall]

605
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,140
The Fire-Eater King is here!

606
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,260
Run!

607
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,620
Run!

608
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,620
The Fire-Eater King is here!

609
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,200
[Lingfeng Street]

610
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,820
Yan Lingyu,

611
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,620
it's been a while.

612
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,940
You've gathered
so many people to greet me.

613
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,900
How thoughtful of you.

614
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,420
Ji Long,

615
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,220
the feud between our clans

616
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,700
ended with the fall

617
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,580
of your Fire-Eater Clan.

618
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,300
I've put up

619
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,780
with your raids around Lingfeng Street

620
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,540
because you

621
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,260
are the last survivor

622
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,660
of the Fire-Eater Clan.

623
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,020
But today,

624
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,220
you dare to cause trouble

625
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,500
in Lingfeng Street?

626
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,380
You're digging your own grave.

627
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,180
I'm digging my own grave?

628
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,260
What nonsense!

629
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,260
The ones who should die are you

630
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,300
and your Wind-Treading Clan.

631
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,300
Why did my people have to perish

632
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,660
at the hands of the Malevolent Beings,

633
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,980
while you get to live?

634
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,660
It makes no sense.

635
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,020
Spiritual Crossroad

636
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,540
belongs to the strong,

637
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
and you

638
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,940
should have been dead long ago!

639
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,820
Your Salamander

640
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,660
couldn't even hold out for a moment,

641
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,540
and yet you still have the nerve

642
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,620
to challenge me?

643
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,140
Do you really think I'm afraid of you?

644
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,220
Yan Lingyu,

645
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,940
the only reason you're so arrogant

646
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,660
is because

647
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,100
of the Blaze Jade in your hand.

648
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,620
Just a friendly reminder.

649
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,900
Recently,

650
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,700
I happened to obtain

651
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,780
a Xuanhuang Pill.

652
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,540
After taking it,
I'm no longer the same as before.

653
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,940
My Salamander

654
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,020
now obeys my every command.

655
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,780
Crushing you

656
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,420
will be as easy as squashing an ant.

657
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,860
Fire-Eater King, I dare you to hurt him!

658
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,420
Kid,

659
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,540
go back and tell them

660
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,220
that your Elder Mei

661
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,220
is in my hands.

662
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,940
If they don't bring me

663
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,460
the guide

664
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,260
by tomorrow night,

665
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,180
I'll kill Elder Mei first

666
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,100
and then finish off

667
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,140
every one of them.

668
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,180
Got it?

669
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,540
Wind-Treading Clan.

670
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,740
General Yan.

671
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:16,780
Mother.

672
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,460
Pass on my order:

673
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,500
sound the alarm bell.

674
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,820
Bring it to me.

675
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,100
General.

676
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,380
- General!
- General!

677
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,540
Mother.

678
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,020
You didn't drink
the Blaze Jade again, did you?

679
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,100
Why has it taken so long?

680
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,860
How are the traps and mechanisms

681
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,860
coming along?

682
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,180
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

683
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,300
Elder Mei told me

684
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,100
that Blaze Jade with a darker color

685
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:50,900
is more potent

686
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,820
but also more poisonous.

687
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,300
The Blaze Jade our people usually take

688
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,380
is diluted

689
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,620
and considered a tonic,

690
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,260
but I know

691
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,860
that before it becomes a remedy,

692
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,340
it is first a poison.

693
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,300
You've been taking Blaze Jade for years.

694
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,900
You must have accumulated

695
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,660
a lot of toxins by now.

696
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,580
- How can you still...?
- That's enough.

697
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,660
Stop talking.

698
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,100
With such a formidable enemy
approaching,

699
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,540
anything that aids in resisting him

700
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,020
must be used,

701
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,860
even if it's poison.

702
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,660
Our Wind-Treading Clan

703
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,860
is inherently weak
in Primordial Spirit Power

704
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,100
and only managed
to resist Malevolent Beings

705
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,180
with the help of Blaze Jade.

706
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,500
And now,

707
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,340
we have no choice
but to rely on it again

708
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,260
to overcome this crisis.

709
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,500
Who says we have to rely on Blaze Jade?

710
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,740
I've already set up

711
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,780
the traps and mechanisms.

712
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,540
Once we capture
the Fire-Eater King tomorrow,

713
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,020
I'll personally defeat him and show you.

714
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,420
Defeat?

715
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,140
How can you defeat him?

716
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,580
You can't even summon

717
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,420
your own Guardian Primordial Spirit.

718
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,780
How do you plan to defeat him?

719
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,740
I practice rigorously each day,

720
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,060
and my body techniques
have greatly surpassed

721
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,900
those of most men in the clan.

722
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,740
You're overestimating
your own abilities.

723
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,500
At Spiritual Crossroads,

724
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,580
we rely on Primordial Spirit Power.

725
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,420
The Guardian Primordial Spirit
of Fire-Eater King,

726
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,860
Salamander,

727
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,860
is a rare Demonic Warrior Form.

728
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,340
Attempting to win
through hand-to-hand combat

729
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,500
is sheer fantasy.

730
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,100
I haven't had a chance to fight.

731
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,300
How can you be certain I can't win?

732
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,140
What if I'm capable?

733
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,780
Ridiculous!

734
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,580
You can't rely

735
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,580
on luck in battle.

736
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,380
You need

737
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,340
to get rid of that notion right away.

738
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,540
Don't even think about it.

739
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:21,740
I...

740
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,540
Mother.

741
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,500
Mother.

742
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,620
[Human Realm]

743
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,580
Look,

744
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,500
the barrier of Lingfeng Mountain

745
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,340
is right at the top of the mountain.

746
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:05,860
Here's the plan.

747
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:06,860
I'll take the lead.

748
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,940
Xia Ling, you stay in the middle,

749
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,660
and Cao Yanbing covers the rear.

750
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,340
Cao Yanbing.

751
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,620
Cao Yanbing.

752
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,820
I said you'd be covering the rear later.

753
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:20,580
Any issues with that?

754
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:26,940
Not at all.

755
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,500
I got this.

756
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,620
But, you know,

757
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,500
the scenery around here

758
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,180
is quite nice.

759
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,140
How about we eat something here

760
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,660
before we continue?

761
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,780
I mean

762
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,380
before we head up.

763
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,620
I don't think it's necessary.

764
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,180
Being full and enjoying the view

765
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,740
probably won't cure a fear of heights.

766
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,060
Fear of heights?

767
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,100
Are you talking about me?

768
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,060
I could never be afraid of heights.

769
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,820
Every time I go out,

770
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,940
I find the highest spot

771
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,620
and stand on it.

772
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,300
Don't I?

773
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,860
Actually, this mountain

774
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,540
may appear high,

775
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,180
but it's not that difficult to climb.

776
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,260
In a moment, just follow me,

777
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,420
adjust your stride

778
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,380
and breathing,

779
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,500
and we'll reach the top soon.

780
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,700
Let's go and get our equipment.

781
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,300
Prepare to depart.

782
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,140
Hurry up.

783
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,940
Is this what you consider not high,

784
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,380
Beiluo?

785
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,180
It's obviously quite...

786
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,380
Cao Yanbing,

787
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,980
you're still not done being frightened?

788
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,060
Get your stuff packed up quickly.

789
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,380
Beiluo,

790
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,500
where's this barrier

791
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,220
you mentioned?

792
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,620
How come I don't see it anywhere?

793
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,540
It's right here.

794
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,980
Just go past that rock,

795
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,900
and you'll reach Lingfeng Street.

796
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,260
Let's go then.

797
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,900
Hold on.

798
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,220
I haven't finished my instructions.

799
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,620
That rock

800
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,660
only allows one person
to pass each time.

801
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,940
Only one person can pass at a time?

802
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,180
What a strange rule.

803
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,980
You know

804
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:14,740
about such an odd rule,

805
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,620
so it seems you must have
a deep connection

806
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,940
with Lingfeng Street.

807
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,220
It's nothing special.

808
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,300
I just have a friend there.

809
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,260
How special is it then?

810
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:23,940
What kind of relationship?

811
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,660
Is it a man or a woman?

812
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,020
He avoids answering the question
and runs away,

813
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,140
he must be hiding something.

814
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,140
All right,

815
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,220
stop gossiping.

816
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,100
Let's go.

817
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,860
Coming out of the mountain
still feels like being within it.

818
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,740
This place is different

819
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,860
from the Spiritual Crossroads
we visited before.

820
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,700
This mountain
is named Lingfeng Mountain.

821
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,380
We are now in the domain

822
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,620
of Lingfeng Street.

823
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:16,940
Look.

824
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,500
As cracks are heard in the waters,
long fish emerge.

825
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,940
As we look up,
Lingfeng's mighty hawks fly high.

826
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,860
[Lingfeng Street]

827
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,700
Lingfeng Street?

828
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,380
That's right.

829
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,260
