[Episode 12]

18
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,260
Lingyu,

19
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,780
I actually came here today

20
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,940
to explain

21
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,980
everything.

22
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,270
The reason the three of us

23
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,140
are going to the Luhua Ancient Tower

24
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,700
is to rescue someone.

25
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,660
Rescue someone?

26
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,420
Yes.

27
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,260
My unconscious companion

28
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,100
is named Cao Yanbing.

29
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,780
Ten years ago, his mother

30
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,980
entered the Luhua Ancient Tower

31
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,980
and never returned.

32
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,420
That's why he's determined

33
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,820
to go in

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,500
and rescue her.

35
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,580
As for Xia Ling,

36
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,100
her father was once a Spiritual Guardian

37
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,700
who died mysteriously ten years ago.

38
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,460
So she's entering the tower

39
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,220
to uncover the truth.

40
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,660
Then,

41
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,220
what about you?

42
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,660
It's all for Shui, of course.

43
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,300
Shui?

44
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,460
Is that your daughter?

45
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,100
Did you find her?

46
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,300
I did find her.

47
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,340
But three months ago,

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,260
I was sabotaged by a traitor,

49
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,460
and Shui got caught up in it too.

50
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,940
Her Primordial Spirit was shattered.

51
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,340
How did that happen?

52
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,500
I've heard
that inside the Luhua Ancient Tower,

53
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,660
there's a secret realm called Penglai,

54
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,420
which holds the Divine Power.

55
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,700
It can purify corruption

56
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,580
and has the ability to restore life.

57
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,780
So, I've been thinking,

58
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,420
maybe I can enter the tower

59
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,420
and use this power

60
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,420
to save Shui.

61
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:01,940
Lingyu,

62
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,820
the three of us
are going into the tower

63
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,580
for the sake of our loved ones.

64
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,740
I'm sure you can understand,

65
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,300
so

66
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,140
I'm hoping

67
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,180
you'll help us

68
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,420
by having Ruofu

69
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,700
lead the way for us.

70
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,860
Of course.

71
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,620
If I were in your shoes,

72
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,540
I'd do

73
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,340
whatever it takes

74
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,260
to enter the tower too.

75
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,300
Rest assured,

76
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,300
I'll discuss it

77
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,300
with Ruofu tomorrow.

78
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,860
But tonight,

79
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,580
let's just enjoy some drinks
and catch up.

80
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,420
Here,

81
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,860
another toast to you.

82
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:33,860
Okay.

83
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,780
I really don't get it.

84
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,180
With such a low tolerance for alcohol,

85
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,700
why are you still trying
to outdrink everyone?

86
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,260
Be careful.

87
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,820
I'm not drunk. I can drink more.

88
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,660
Get me another drink.

89
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,540
Yan Ruofu,

90
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,340
why do you have to push yourself

91
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,660
so hard all the time?

92
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,780
Water.

93
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,260
Water.

94
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,420
I need to drink water.

95
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,340
I need some water.

96
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,060
Who's hosting whom here?

97
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,580
I need some water.

98
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,620
I'm getting you the water.

99
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,740
I'm getting it right away.

100
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,580
Let me raise another cup to you.

101
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,060
Lingyu,

102
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,420
I think we've both had enough

103
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,060
to drink today.

104
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,180
You've had a long day too,

105
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,780
so you should head back
and get some rest.

106
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,540
Beiluo,

107
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,580
it's been years since we last met.

108
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,140
Why the rush to leave?

109
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,060
Let me tell you,

110
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,900
I have plenty of fine liquor
at my place.

111
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,060
Don't be shy.

112
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,820
Tonight, we must drink until we drop.

113
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:50,780
Here.

114
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,300
Don't be so formal with me.

115
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,500
I'll down this one first

116
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,140
to show my respect.

117
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:03,820
Lingyu,

118
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,300
I remember you have internal injuries.

119
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,420
Drinking so much

120
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,820
could worsen your condition.

121
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,260
Let's call it a night
before it gets out of hand.

122
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,820
As a female general,

123
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,380
I'm not that delicate.

124
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,260
It's nothing.

125
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,500
Besides,

126
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,940
since we're catching up
with old friends today,

127
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:18,820
we must drink

128
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,580
until we drop.

129
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,620
Let's keep going.

130
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,060
Cheers!

131
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,500
All right.

132
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,180
What's wrong?

133
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:34,940
Sorry,

134
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,940
I need to go out for a bit.

135
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,060
Beiluo,

136
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,500
are you all right?

137
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,620
Sorry about that.

138
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,940
It seems age has caught up with me,

139
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,300
my tolerance for alcohol
isn't as strong as before.

140
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,620
I'll be right back.

141
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,300
Just wait for me.

142
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,580
Beiluo.

143
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:05,820
Where is Cao Yanbing?

144
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:06,820
Is he in the room?

145
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,580
He's probably in the room.

146
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,580
Did you wrap up your drinking?

147
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,580
Is the catch-up over so quickly?

148
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,380
Let's drop that for now
and go inside to take a look.

149
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,660
Take a look at what?

150
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,940
Didn't you say

151
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,980
you wanted to see something?

152
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:33,940
Did you see it?

153
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:34,900
Close the door first.

154
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:36,860
Close the door.

155
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,740
What's going on?

156
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,380
By the sacred master's will,

157
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,420
with my blood as a medium,

158
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,220
I open the underworld

159
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,500
and call upon the Six Paths.

160
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,460
With my blood as a medium,

161
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
I open the underworld

162
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,500
and call upon the Six Paths.

163
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,740
By the sacred master's will,

164
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,260
with my blood as a medium,

165
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,380
I open the underworld

166
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,260
and call upon the Six Paths.

167
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,980
Master,

168
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,460
is that you?

169
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,140
Celestial Fox.

170
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,940
You really are still around.

171
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,380
I'm so glad to see you again.

172
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,300
Thousands of years have gone by,

173
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,340
and you're still

174
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,620
such a sentimental little fox.

175
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,860
It seems you've held on

176
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,540
to the toy I gave you back then.

177
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,500
I remember you said

178
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,020
this small mirror

179
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,980
was made from shards

180
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,740
of the Sky-Patching Stone.

181
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,780
Although it doesn't have the same power

182
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,820
to mend the heavens

183
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,460
or bring the dead back to life
as a complete stone,

184
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,540
I hoped

185
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,660
it might still bring you back
for a moment.

186
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,780
It really is only for a moment.

187
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,500
Remember to send me back

188
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,780
into Cao Yanbing's body later.

189
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,220
Got it.

190
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,380
But Master,

191
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,060
why are you in Cao Yanbing's body?

192
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,180
Weren't you supposed

193
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,340
to have been obliterated
in that great battle

194
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,540
years ago?

195
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:30,820
Obliterated?

196
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,060
It wasn't that easy.

197
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,180
Though I was defeated
in the great battle,

198
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,420
I left behind lingering energy

199
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,780
that drifted through the world.

200
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,100
After thousands of years

201
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,780
of absorbing the essence
of heaven and earth,

202
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,700
I regained my power

203
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,380
over 800 years ago.

204
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,020
But I was soon sealed again

205
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,700
by the Prison Guardian.

206
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,380
Not long ago,

207
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,300
Cao Yanbing

208
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,300
suddenly appeared.

209
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,940
Not only did he allow me
to see the light of day once more,

210
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,580
but his Divine Warrior's Physique

211
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,300
also provided me
with a new host to inhabit.

212
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,700
I see now what you've been through.

213
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,020
No wonder Cao Yanbing is so formidable.

214
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,260
He's utilizing

215
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,620
your immense power.

216
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,140
What's even more wonderful

217
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,540
is that Cao Yanbing is actually planning

218
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,660
to visit the Luohua Ancient Tower.

219
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,180
Do you know

220
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,900
what's inside that tower?

221
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,020
I've heard

222
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,420
that within it is a realm
called Penglai,

223
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,780
which harbors
the most supreme Divine Power.

224
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,740
Do you know

225
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,100
which deity this refers to

226
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,700
and who actually wields that power?

227
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,740
Could it be...

228
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,740
Although my physical body
perished back then,

229
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,580
the core of my power

230
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,740
remained indestructible,

231
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,300
trapped within the Penglai realm.

232
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,220
Now that I've taken form again,

233
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,660
I plan to completely corrupt

234
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,860
Cao Yanbing's mind,

235
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,380
seize his body,

236
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,620
and then reclaim

237
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,900
my power from Penglai.

238
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,340
With that, I will be able
to rule the world once more.

239
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,740
What?

240
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,180
Is that true?

241
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,220
Did I hear that right?

242
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,740
When have I ever lied to you?

243
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,260
What can I do for you?

244
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,100
I'll give it my all,
no matter the cost.

245
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,940
You don't need

246
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,060
to do anything for the time being.

247
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,780
We'll talk about it later.

248
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,940
Master,

249
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,900
actually, Cao Yanbing's journey

250
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,740
to the Luhua Ancient Tower

251
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,980
wasn't by chance.

252
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,940
It was intentionally directed
by someone.

253
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,940
Directed by someone?

254
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,580
What do you mean?

255
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,420
His name is Huangfu Longdou.

256
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,140
Human as he is,

257
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,700
he is a rare and powerful figure

258
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,180
in the Spiritual Crossroads,

259
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,580
with the strength and ambition

260
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,100
to topple the Border Realm.

261
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,220
He drew Cao Yanbing

262
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,620
to the Luhua Ancient Tower

263
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,140
to gain its power.

264
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,340
I'm concerned

265
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,260
he might interfere with your plans.

266
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,820
Do you need me to deal with him?

267
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,860
Celestial Fox,

268
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,180
do you know

269
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,660
what's the most fun in this world?

270
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,860
It's watching a show unfold.

271
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,620
Watching people painstakingly plan

272
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,340
and strive,

273
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,940
only for it to benefit

274
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,820
someone else in the end.

275
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,540
Isn't this show exciting?

276
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,420
This world is too dull.

277
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,900
We need a little fun,

278
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,820
don't you agree?

279
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,540
Be good,

280
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,140
I'll come back to see you,

281
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,340
little fox.

282
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,620
Master.

283
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,740
Master?

284
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,220
Master,

285
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,700
I can make my fox ears

286
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,740
disappear this time.

287
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,420
Good job.

288
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,580
It looks great this time.

289
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,300
Little fox,

290
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,100
I have something important
to take care of.

291
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,340
Why don't you go
play somewhere else for now?

292
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,340
Master,

293
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,580
please bring me along

294
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,980
for this great battle.

295
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,260
As I've already said,

296
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,900
you don't have to go.

297
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,900
I know I'm young

298
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,980
and weak,

299
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,180
but I want
to fight to the death for you.

300
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,620
I also want to protect you.

301
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,820
You talk too much.

302
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,060
Master.

303
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,300
Little fox,

304
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,140
I'll come back and see you.

305
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,020
Master.

306
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,660
Master,

307
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,500
regardless of whether you
need it or not,

308
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,820
I will definitely help you.

309
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,700
What?

310
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,700
Are you saying General Yan

311
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,580
intentionally sent us away

312
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,620
to deal with Cao Yanbing?

313
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,100
Are you sure about that?

314
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,140
I'm only speculating.

315
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,340
I intended

316
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,940
to just drink a little bit tonight
and return,

317
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,220
but Yan Lingyu

318
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,060
insisted on keeping me company.

319
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,380
Despite her internal injuries,

320
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,580
she insisted on drinking until the end,

321
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,820
as if she were stalling for time.

322
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,900
I felt something was wrong,

323
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,380
so I found an excuse

324
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,340
to leave early and come back.

325
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,620
I hope I'm just overthinking it.

326
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,700
I think you might be overthinking it.

327
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,060
We've just arrived at Lingfeng Street

328
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,340
and already have a conflict

329
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,220
with the Wind-Treading Clan,

330
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,700
so it's natural to be cautious.

331
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,780
But since he seems

332
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,940
to be okay now,

333
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,740
we shouldn't jump to conclusions

334
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,220
and risk wrongfully accusing someone.

335
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,540
That makes sense.

336
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,220
It's probably
because after so many years

337
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,940
of roaming around,

338
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,660
being wary has become my second nature.

339
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,220
Oh,

340
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,700
did you bring up the important matter

341
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,620
with General Yan while drinking today?

342
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,660
You mean the guide?

343
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,700
I did.

344
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,020
Not only did I bring it up,

345
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,580
but I also explained to her

346
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,460
why we needed to go

347
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,100
to the Luhua Ancient Tower.

348
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,060
She didn't refuse at all

349
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,540
and readily agreed

350
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,860
to have Yan Ruofu guide us.

351
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,500
She agreed just like that?

352
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,500
Didn't she mention any conditions?

353
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,620
Conditions?

354
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,540
She didn't mention any.

355
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,260
Maybe since we helped Lingfeng Street

356
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,260
deal with the Fire-Eater King,

357
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,540
she's just returning the favor,

358
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,900
which is quite normal.

359
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,780
No.

360
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,260
I feel

361
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,300
that things
aren't as simple as they seem.

362
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,700
So you're suggesting

363
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,420
that Yan Lingyu

364
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,460
appears to be friendly with us
on the surface

365
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,260
but actually has ulterior motives?

366
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,140
She has quite the motive there.

367
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,700
Considering how she insisted

368
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,020
on asking you to stay with her tonight,

369
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,900
I seriously suspect

370
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,060
her real purpose is to...

371
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:36,940
To what?

372
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,380
To get you.

373
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,860
Honestly,
I think she's interested in you.

374
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,420
It's getting late. Go get some rest.

375
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,820
I genuinely believe it.

376
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,220
In fact, I've already analyzed it.

377
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,140
Think about it...

378
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,380
Don't push me out.

379
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,420
She's a general

380
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,020
who lacks nothing.

381
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,260
She's beautiful and wealthy,

382
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,180
so what could she be missing?

383
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,660
What do you think she lacks in her life?

384
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,420
She only lacks...

385
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:56,740
Sleep.

386
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,940
Go to bed now.

387
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,260
Stop talking nonsense.

388
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,580
There's one more thing I'd like to say.
Just one.

389
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,300
I'm serious.

390
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,460
Go ahead.

391
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,020
Here's the thing.

392
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,380
Today,

393
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,460
although Cao Yanbing helped everyone

394
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
defeat the Fire-Eater King,

395
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,220
he destroyed a house

396
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,900
and he looked pretty frightening.

397
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,140
The general didn't say anything,

398
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,420
but I bet the clan members

399
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,980
are really displeased with us.

400
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,900
Just look
at the Young General's sour face

401
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,540
when she arrived today.

402
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,300
I suggest

403
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,620
we all pitch in

404
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,220
to help repair the house

405
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,020
and ease the tension
with the clan members.

406
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,140
Now, that sounds reasonable.

407
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,260
Also, you should showcase

408
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:30,980
your abilities

409
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,020
in front of the female general.

410
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
Actually, I have

411
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,620
a few more ideas to share with you.

412
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,740
Would you like to hear them?

413
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,980
All right, it's settled then.

414
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,860
See you tomorrow.

415
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,060
Bye, and good night.

416
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,300
[Assembly Hall]

417
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,740
Do you think it's plausible

418
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,780
to claim that you were ambushed

419
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,260
and then fainted?

420
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,060
I dare not deceive you, General.

421
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,620
I woke up this morning

422
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,100
to find that I had been knocked out

423
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,820
and left in the yard.

424
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,460
I truly don't know who did it.

425
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,540
Beiluo Shimen?

426
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:10,980
It probably isn't him.

427
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,740
I had suspicions too,

428
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,420
which is why I used the excuse
of delivering breakfast

429
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,380
to investigate.

430
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,300
There was nothing out of the ordinary

431
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,620
about him and the girl named Xia Ling.

432
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,980
They are probably not involved.

433
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,580
If it's not them,

434
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,340
then who could it be?

435
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,660
General,

436
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,140
how about I give it

437
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,220
another try tonight?

438
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:27,700
That's not feasible.

439
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,100
Last night, we had a chance

440
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,060
because Cao Yanbing

441
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,540
was badly wounded and unconscious,

442
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,460
and Beiluo Shimen and Xia Ling

443
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,580
were off guard.

444
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,020
We had our chance then,

445
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,420
but it won't come again.

446
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,740
I'll think of another plan.

447
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,180
Relay my order.

448
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,580
Tomorrow,

449
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,700
I want to host a banquet

450
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,060
for our guests.

451
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,300
What

452
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,900
is the meaning of this?

453
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,940
To deal with an opponent,

454
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,900
it's not always necessary
to resort to violence.

455
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,540
Simply follow my instructions and make

456
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,100
the arrangements.

457
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,340
You'll see why in the future.

458
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:08,820
Yes, Ma'am.

459
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,380
Xia Ling?

460
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,380
Beiluo?

461
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,380
Where are they?

462
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,540
This trinket of yours is quite nice.

463
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,940
That should be him.

464
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,220
He looks quite young.

465
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,140
So it's him.

466
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,340
It is him.

467
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,580
He's the one
who killed the Fire-Eater King.

468
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,340
Yes.

469
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,140
You said he's pretty capable.

470
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,300
You know his appearance
but not his true nature.

471
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,580
Sir, some buns, please.

472
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,020
Sure. Just a minute.

473
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:29,620
Here.

474
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,060
You can have it.

475
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:51,900
They are dirty.

476
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,300
I'll go...

477
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,500
I'll go get you some fresh ones.

478
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,500
How much do I owe you?

479
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,740
Nothing.

480
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,140
Free of charge.

481
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,860
Why free of charge?

482
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,580
You can't talk?

483
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,020
You

484
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,020
were speaking just fine earlier.

485
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,060
Where can I find Xia Ling and Beiluo?

486
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,060
Nails.

487
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,380
Here you are.

488
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,100
Okay.

489
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,820
We did a great job.

490
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,300
The progress this morning
is quite promising.

491
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,780
Why are you two

492
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,620
fixing the house here?

493
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,620
I'm starving.

494
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,140
He's awake. How are you?

495
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,100
Do you feel any discomfort?

496
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,940
Besides feeling the discomfort

497
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,780
from hunger,

498
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,380
what else could I be feeling?

499
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,340
Do you not remember anything?

500
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,260
What do I need to remember?

501
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,660
Say something, you two.

502
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,580
Just now, the people on Lingfeng Street

503
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,020
looked at me as if they'd seen a ghost.

504
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,500
What's going on?

505
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,580
Do you know

506
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,300
why we're here

507
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,100
fixing the house?

508
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,900
It was blown up yesterday,

509
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:43,860
and you did it.

510
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,100
I did it?

511
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,340
How is that possible?

512
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,420
Yesterday, I was...

513
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,980
Darling, come here.

514
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,500
What is it?

515
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,700
See if he is the one

516
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,180
who destroyed our house.

517
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,420
It is him.

518
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,700
Did I fight

519
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,460
the Fire-Eater King here yesterday?

520
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,940
That's right.

521
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,020
You fought

522
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,900
the Fire-Eater King here yesterday.

523
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,420
During the battle,

524
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,220
you were consumed by the power

525
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,140
from your own body again,

526
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,740
and it was even more severe than before.

527
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,980
Then, you ended up blowing up

528
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,660
this house.

529
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,340
But it's okay.

530
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,140
You're back to normal now.

531
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,620
We can explain things

532
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,100
to the people
of the Wind-Treading Clan later.

533
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,060
They won't really

534
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,900
hold it against you.

535
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,140
Why am I considered abnormal?

536
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,180
Wasn't I consumed by that power

537
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,460
to help them with the Fire-Eater King?

538
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,660
That's true,

539
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,380
but you're also the one
who blew up this house.

540
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,660
How about this?

541
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,540
You fix it yourself,

542
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,860
and then we'll go apologize to them.

543
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,140
Apologize?

544
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,660
Why should I apologize?

545
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,540
Yesterday, I saved
the Wind-Treading Clan

546
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,740
and Lingfeng Street.

547
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,620
At worst, the pros and cons
should balance out.

548
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,620
Why should I apologize?

549
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,660
What kind of logic is that?

550
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,460
You two.

551
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,100
Wait.

552
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,540
What's with this reaction?

553
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,420
Did I say something wrong?

554
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,860
It's just an empty house

555
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,420
with no one in it.

556
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,420
I didn't do it on purpose.

557
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,540
The Fire-Eater King

558
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,620
was going to slaughter their street.

559
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,980
And the Wind-Treading Clan,

560
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,460
well, it's fine if they didn't thank me,

561
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,860
but they went behind my back
and criticized me.

562
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,500
It's really rude

563
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,020
and ungrateful.

564
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,300
What's wrong?

565
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,060
Can't I speak honestly?

566
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,820
The people of the Wind-Treading Clan

567
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,380
are just ungrateful

568
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,100
and rude.

569
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,900
I dare you to say that again.

570
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:38,900
This is great.

571
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,060
My mother even asked me

572
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,220
to pass on the message

573
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,380
that there will be a banquet tomorrow
to thank the three of you.

574
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,540
I didn't know the Wind-Treading Clan

575
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,180
was held

576
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:45,980
in such low regard by you.

577
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,100
If that's how you feel,
why don't you just leave?

578
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,060
Why are you still here?

579
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,580
Young General,

580
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,380
you should know

581
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,380
why I'm still here.

582
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,220
If it weren't for the fact
that you're the guide,

583
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,780
I wouldn't be arguing with you,

584
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,740
I'd be fighting you.

585
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,300
Sure.

586
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,780
Let's fight.

587
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,740
Who do you think is afraid?

588
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,780
Of course, I'm not afraid.

589
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,140
I'm worried
that you might be afraid of me.

590
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,380
Please, both of you, stay calm.

591
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,780
Can't we
just talk things over peacefully?

592
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,660
It's none of your business.

593
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,620
With your mediocre skills,

594
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,740
if it weren't for me yesterday,

595
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,020
the Fire-Eater King

596
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:10,980
would have ruined this place by now.

597
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,500
Let's not even mention
your lack of ability.

598
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,980
You don't even have the self-awareness.

599
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,620
I offered to help

600
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,460
out of goodwill,

601
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,220
and you locked me up,

602
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:18,780
calling me a braggart.

603
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,540
How about now?
Isn't this embarrassing for you?

604
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,740
Cao Yanbing, that's enough.

605
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
You've crossed the line.

606
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,900
You beat the Fire-Eater King.

607
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,580
So what?

608
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,980
I think you

609
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,020
are just as bad as he is.

610
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,540
The Fire-Eater King
didn't blow up any houses,

611
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,300
but if you don't achieve your goals,

612
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,380
you'll probably be even worse than him.

613
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,260
Young General,

614
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,340
your comments are out of line.

615
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,060
It's going a bit too far.

616
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,700
Whether I'm good or bad
depends on who the person is.

617
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,700
Right now, I'm obviously on the side

618
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,540
of Lingfeng Street,

619
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,420
but who knows what the future holds,

620
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:41,820
especially

621
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,380
since you'll be
the future Spiritual Guardian.

622
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,220
You...

623
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,940
Why did you have to talk

624
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,900
like that?

625
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,340
- Well...
- Young General.

626
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,620
That's just the way things are.

627
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,700
You shouldn't back down
in a verbal fight.

628
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,620
Young General.

629
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,700
[Lingfeng Street]

630
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,660
Don't mind Cao Yanbing.

631
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,540
He always

632
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,780
speaks harshly,

633
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,420
but it's not really

634
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,500
how he feels inside.

635
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,540
One of you plays the bad cop

636
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,300
and the other the good cop.

637
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,500
Such nice teamwork.

638
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,460
Since you've already offended me,

639
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
there's no need to try and appease me.

640
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,060
The only reason you followed me

641
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,900
is that you still expect me

642
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
to be your guide.

643
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,300
Why are you

644
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,820
so ungrateful?

645
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,900
Although most

646
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,620
of what Cao Yanbing said today

647
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,460
was wrong,

648
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,620
he was right about one thing:

649
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,860
we saved you.

650
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,940
I don't care what others

651
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,540
think of us.

652
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,780
At least we don't owe you anything.

653
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,220
Yes,

654
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,100
you saved me.

655
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,740
I'm thanking you here.

656
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,540
Are you satisfied now?

657
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,500
I'm not satisfied.

658
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,580
What kind of attitude is this?

659
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,740
Is this how you show gratitude?

660
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,380
This is how I show my gratitude.

661
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,780
It's up to you
whether you accept it or not.

662
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,900
I won't accept it.

663
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,820
Listen,

664
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,020
if you're not going to thank me,
then don't.

665
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,180
But if you do want
to express your gratitude,

666
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:53,980
look me

667
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,660
in the eye

668
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,580
and say "thank you".

669
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,260
No.

670
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,420
It is possible for me

671
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,780
to thank you properly.

672
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,780
But there is a condition.

673
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,220
Condition?

674
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,220
Let's have a proper fight,

675
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,300
without using
Guardian Primordial Spirits.

676
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,300
Why do you want to fight with me again?

677
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,220
Didn't we already have

678
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,140
a drinking contest yesterday?

679
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,900
You were so drunk

680
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,220
that you couldn't even be helped up.

681
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,580
Forget about yesterday.

682
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,220
Let's have a real fight
with real weapons.

683
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,420
Are you up for it?

684
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,380
Why do you

685
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,340
want to fight with me so badly?

686
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,460
Did I offend you or something?

687
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,100
If you're scared, just admit it.

688
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,620
What's there to be scared of?

689
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,420
I'm not afraid of you.

690
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,100
All right, it's decided then.

691
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,220
Tomorrow at dusk,

692
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,460
on top of Lingfeng Mountain.

693
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:50,860
So,

694
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,340
do you need a hand with anything,
Beiluo?

695
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,140
If you weren't so impulsive
in the future,

696
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,580
we wouldn't be so busy.

697
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,180
I've already explained

698
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,420
that it wasn't done on purpose.

699
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,860
I'm not talking about that.

700
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,380
If so,

701
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,860
what are you talking about then?

702
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,740
Many things.

703
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,860
For example,

704
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,820
you never told me

705
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,420
that you were constantly at risk

706
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,340
of being backfired by demonic forces.

707
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,540
You sneaked out of the prison

708
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,100
and faced the Fire-Eater King alone.

709
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,780
In the military,

710
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,580
lacking any sense

711
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,580
of teamwork like that

712
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,540
would get you harshly reprimanded.

713
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,820
My situation is different.

714
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,100
I'm a Spiritual Guardian,

715
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:27,820
and after all these years

716
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,100
of fighting solo,

717
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,580
I've become accustomed to it.

718
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,660
But things are different now.

719
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,260
You have friends.

720
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,940
Didn't you want to help?

721
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,820
Do it now then.

722
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,420
Sure.

723
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,100
Since we are friends,

724
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,020
can you show me how it's done?

725
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,540
Can you hammer nails?

726
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,100
Come.

727
00:30:59,620 --> 00:30:59,940
Okay.

728
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,900
Help me hold it,
and I'll do the hammering.

729
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,780
Take this.

730
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:10,900
Cao Yanbing,

731
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,900
you still need to be cautious

732
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,020
about the power within you.

733
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,380
While Yan Ruofu's remark

734
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,140
about you resembling the Fire-Eater King

735
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,420
is a bit of an exaggeration,

736
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,860
it's important to stay alert.

737
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,060
You don't want to end up

738
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,020
being devoured by the demonic power

739
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,580
and doing

740
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,300
something irreversible.

741
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,100
That's impossible.

742
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,860
Yan Ruofu is just spreading

743
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,060
alarmist nonsense.

744
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:31,580
That's right.

745
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,780
She has a difficult personality.

746
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,180
She's like a hedgehog,

747
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,580
always ready to poke
at whoever gets in her way.

748
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,780
Miss Xia finally understands me.

749
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,900
So shouldn't you

750
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,500
apologize to me?

751
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,100
You are like a barking dog.
You are no better than she is.

752
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,940
Xia Ling, how can you say that?

753
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,860
Which side

754
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,740
are you really on?

755
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,820
Enough now.

756
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,740
Let's stop the repairs for now.

757
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:51,740
Let's go have some food,

758
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,940
and we'll pick up
where we left off afterward.

759
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,100
Let's go.

760
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:54,500
Come on.

761
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,300
It's true that I'm very hungry,

762
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,900
but Xia Ling, you must understand

763
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,180
who your real allies are.

764
00:31:59,340 --> 00:31:59,860
Enough

765
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,140
with the bickering.

766
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,260
You should think

767
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,820
about how to handle this guide instead.

768
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,620
That's what really matters.

769
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,580
Here's a general guideline:

770
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,540
Cao Yanbing should talk less.

771
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,420
Why are you telling me to talk less?

772
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,500
You're the one
who should cut down on talking.

773
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,500
Both of you should talk less.

774
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:11,940
Honestly,

775
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,900
if it weren't for what you said,

776
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,380
I wouldn't be wasting my time
appeasing that general.

777
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,540
You need her

778
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,660
to be your guide.

779
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,860
Do you understand that?

780
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,500
So it's my fault again?

781
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,940
I was the one who fought
the Fire-Eater King, you know.

782
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,140
You did fight the Fire-Eating King.

783
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,340
Why don't you go beat

784
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:23,860
the Young General up as well?

785
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,100
If she weren't the guide,

786
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,900
I'd have already...

787
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,260
Come in, please.

788
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,580
My mother sent me to ask

789
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,060
if you have any food allergies

790
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,060
or dislikes for tomorrow's banquet.

791
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:53,860
Not really.

792
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,500
I'm quite easy-going

793
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,860
and have no specific demands.

794
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,060
I've answered everything.

795
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,500
Is there anything else you need to say?

796
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,580
Our showdown is scheduled for tomorrow.

797
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,060
I know.

798
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:16,940
You...

799
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,340
Don't you want to know
what we'll be competing on?

800
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,860
I thought we were supposed to fight?

801
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,820
I know that already.

802
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,740
Are you angry again?

803
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,180
I must defeat her tomorrow.

804
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,540
Never mind.

805
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,100
She already took the initiative

806
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,860
to tell you to ask

807
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,780
about what's involved
in the competition.

808
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,540
You'd better play along.

809
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,380
You should be humble
when you are asking for a favor.

810
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,460
Young General.

811
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:22,940
Are you all right?

812
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,340
I'm fine.

813
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,420
Young General,

814
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,700
why do this to yourself?

815
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,420
I was born weaker than others.

816
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,140
So I mustn't slack off.

817
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,140
I don't want to be underestimated

818
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,660
to the extent that people

819
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,460
think they can easily defeat me.

820
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,300
Okay.

821
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,180
Allow me to keep you company then.

822
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:57,620
Sure.

823
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,300
Please help check my movements.

824
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,780
It's already so late,

825
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,940
can't you let me go get some sleep?

826
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:24,940
Hold this.

827
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:26,820
Hold it.

828
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,860
If Yan Ruofu doesn't sleep tonight,
neither will I.

829
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,260
Are you ready?

830
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,740
Go ahead then.

831
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,580
Lang Da,

832
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,460
would you like to have a spar with me?

833
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:04,900
Young General,

834
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,460
it's getting late now.

835
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,900
You should get some rest.

836
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,420
You'll need to perform

837
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:11,980
for the guests tomorrow.

838
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,020
Perform?

839
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,100
Perform what?

840
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,980
Actually, I'm here to pass on a message

841
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,820
from the General.

842
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,820
There will be honored guests
at tomorrow's banquet,

843
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,460
and they expect you

844
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,860
to perform the festive dance.

845
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,100
What?

846
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,900
Mother wants me to dance for them?

847
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,070
[Assembly Hall]

848
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,860
The Young General's dance
is exceptional.

849
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,500
it's truly awe-inspiring.

850
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,500
Yes.

851
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,020
Normally,
the Young General only performs

852
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,380
during festivals and celebrations.

853
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:26,900
Keep it up.

854
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,380
Today,

855
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,700
it's considered an exception made
for those three guests.

856
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,260
It seems that no matter where you go,

857
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,420
having children perform something
is a common trend.

858
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,700
Human behaviors

859
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,780
are remarkably similar.

860
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:21,900
Come,

861
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,980
let me offer a toast
to the three of you.

862
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,180
The Fire-Eater King
has declared himself king

863
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,340
and, over the years,

864
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,380
has frequently invaded

865
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,580
and plundered the Lingfeng Street.

866
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,540
This time, he's even more outrageous,

867
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,700
aiming to exterminate
our entire street and clan.

868
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,900
Your efforts

869
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,380
to eliminate
the Fire-Eater King this time

870
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,340
is truly a great help to me.

871
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,180
Thank you.

872
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:57,900
General,

873
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,300
this is...

874
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,620
It is a token

875
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,420
of gratitude from my clan.

876
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,340
General,

877
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,900
this is very generous of you.

878
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,700
Thank you so much.

879
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,380
I'm rich now.

880
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,740
There are so many Border Coins.

881
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,460
Liang would be over the moon
if I brought them back.

882
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,740
My Rakshasa Street

883
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,380
is finally getting rich.

884
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,260
We are grateful
for your kindness, General.

885
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,780
But in terms of the Fire-Eater King,

886
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,940
you have already repaid our favor

887
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,020
by agreeing to let the Young General

888
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,740
be our guide.

889
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,940
So there is no need
for further expenditures.

890
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:50,980
That's right.

891
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,300
My effort to deal
with the Fire-Eater King

892
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,420
is also to secure a guide.

893
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,860
All you need to do

894
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,900
is agree to let the Young General
be our guide.

895
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,300
Mr. Cao,

896
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,340
as you are new to this place,

897
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,660
you may not know much

898
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,460
about our Luhua Ancient Tower yet.

899
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,460
As the dwelling of deities

900
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,500
in legends,

901
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,660
the tower is extremely perilous.

902
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,260
For thousands of years,

903
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,460
anyone who has attempted to enter

904
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,660
has never come out.

905
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,940
Never came out?

906
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,220
Indeed.

907
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,500
Despite that,

908
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,140
do you still insist
on entering the tower?

909
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,620
In the face of extreme danger,

910
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,260
it is not disgraceful to back down.

911
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:35,980
I believe

912
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,140
that if your family

913
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,620
were aware of this,

914
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,180
they would not want you

915
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,860
to take such risks for them.

916
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,500
Family?

917
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,100
It seems you already know

918
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,740
why we need to enter

919
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,580
the Ancient Tower.

920
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,660
Beiluo

921
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,820
has more or less explained
everything to me.

922
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,540
Since you already know,

923
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,100
you must understand

924
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,420
why we are determined to enter

925
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,260
the Ancient Tower.

926
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,700
You mentioned

927
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,340
that no one has ever come out
of the Luhua Ancient Tower.

928
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,300
Well, let us

929
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,740
be the first

930
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,100
to emerge from it.

931
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,820
In that case,

932
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,300
I'll be honest with you.

933
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,660
In fact, our clan has had

934
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,660
a long-standing rule:

935
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,300
anyone who wishes to enter

936
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,500
the Luhua Ancient Tower

937
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,540
must first undergo a trial

938
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,980
set by our ancestors.

939
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,860
Only those who pass the trial

940
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,140
are qualified

941
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,820
to be led into the tower by a guide.

942
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,900
How come I've never heard

943
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,060
of such a trial before?

944
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,420
Beiluo,

945
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,340
you never mentioned before

946
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,900
when you came to our Lingfeng Street

947
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,380
that you wanted
to go to the Ancient Tower.

948
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,660
What happens

949
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,420
if we fail the trial?

950
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,300
The will of our ancestors
must not be violated.

951
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,860
I'm afraid
I won't be able to assist you further.

952
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,260
The trial comes with risks,

953
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,740
and life and death
are determined by fate.

954
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,660
I hope you all

955
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,340
consider carefully

956
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,460
whether to participate.

957
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,660
General,

958
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,700
may I ask

959
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,300
if the people from ten years ago

960
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,220
also went through the trial?

961
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,780
Of course.

962
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,060
All right.

963
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,940
Since this trial

964
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,780
is a tradition
of your Wind-Treading Clan,

965
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:32,900
I'll respect it.

966
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,180
If the group from ten years ago

967
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:35,980
was able to pass,

968
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,540
there is no reason
we cannot succeed as well.

969
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,700
I will participate.

970
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,700
- Me too.
- Me too.

971
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:46,860
Very well.

972
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,540
I truly admire

973
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,620
your resolve and courage.

974
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:50,700
In that case,

975
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,100
I will schedule the trial

976
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,460
for tomorrow.

977
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,540
I look forward
to seeing your performance.

978
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,580
General,

979
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,100
I have another question.

980
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,740
If we manage to pass the trial,

981
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,460
can you assure us

982
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:04,980
that the Young General

983
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,260
will definitely be our guide?

984
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,260
Rest assured.

985
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,580
I am the Spiritual Guardian
of this street,

986
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,060
and my word is final.

987
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,900
However, the requirement

988
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,220
is that you must pass the trial first.
