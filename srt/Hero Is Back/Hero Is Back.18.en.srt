[Episode 18]

18
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,660
You humans are truly interesting.

19
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,660
Despite having access

20
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,580
to more powerful forces,

21
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,540
you choose to follow

22
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,180
a path destined for defeat.

23

Kid,

27
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,780
I heard you like playing with fire.

28
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,780
Let's see how you'll handle this!

29
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,660
That's impossible!

30
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,420
Ever since Lyu Bu took his form,

31
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,340
he's never been defeated.

32
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,660
He's reached the peak
of the Human Warrior Form.

33
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,340
How could you have overpowered him?

34
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,780
Master,

35
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,540
there's something off about him.

36
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,460
I can sense the presence of a demon.

37
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,820
Demon?

38
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,060
I am different
from your Primordial Spirits.

39
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,540
I was born from the Boundless Void,

40
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,940
absorbing true demonic aura,

41
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,580
which makes me a true demonic form.

42
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,420
Demonic form?

43
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,420
No wonder Cao Yanbing

00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,900

Unleashing the Power of the Fiend King

shorten your lifespan,

54
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,620

and show them

61
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,100
what fiendish power looks like.

62
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,300
Lyu Bu has slain

A general who can't fight
a thousand foes alone

69
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,300
isn't worthy of the title.

70
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,020
Fellow generals,

00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:19,900

or the Water Spiritual Guardian,

74
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,020
as long as you're targeted
by these fiends,

75
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,020
you are bound

76
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,460

Hand everything over

80
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,180
to me right now.

81
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,220
What do you mean?

82
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,740
I mean you should let me
completely become you,

83
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,420
and not just a part

84
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,740
of your Primordial Spirit.

85
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,180
Why?

86
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,740
Wouldn't that mean

87
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,300
I would cease to exist?

88
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,420

Your consciousness

90
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,860
will merge with mine.

91
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,500
My existence will be yours.

92
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,700
This is the only way

93
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,740
I can fully unleash

94
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,860
my power

95
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,980
and eliminate the opponent before us.

96
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,100
No,

97
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,780
don't even think about it.

98
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,380
I will never become you.

99
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,260
Cao Yanjing,

100

Aren't you contradicting yourself?

101

You want to grow stronger

102
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,620
but also stay kind.

103
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,740
You want to use my power

104
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,740
to win,

105
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,380
yet control me

106
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,340
with the Sevenfold Soul-Resonance Bell.

107
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,220
How long will you continue to waver

108
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,580
and be conflicted?

109
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,100
Open your eyes

110
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,660
and see the world.

111
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,540
Like me,

112
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,460
you're too powerful

113
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,100
to be accepted by the world,

114
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,860
faced with suspicion,

115
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,140
slander,

116
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,420
and betrayal.

117
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,860
Since the world

118
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,740
is so unfair to us,

119
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,860
how can choosing the evil side

120
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,220
be wrong?

121
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,860
Cao Yanbing,

122
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,660
stop hesitating.

123
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,500
Choose now.

124
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,940
Will you rule

125
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,620
this world with me

126
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,620
as a king

127
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,780
or be a good person

128
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,940
and be trampled upon?

129
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,380
Hang in there a little longer.

130
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,180
We're almost there.

131
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,420
What is this?

132
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,660
Could it be...

133
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,460
Cao Yanbing.

134
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:48,740
Who is it?

135
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,820
Who did it?

136
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,820
An ax?

137
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,100
This is bad.

138
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,100
Let's hurry back
and report to the Border Domain.

139
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,180
Let's go.

140
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,100
You must be Huangfu Longdou, right?

141
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,220
Now that you've seen me in person,

142
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,980
can that help you confirm my identity?

143
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,100
We don't know each other.

144
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,820
Why are you helping me?

145
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,540
Is it just

146
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,780
because we're both fugitives?

147
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,820
Or

148
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:33,940
is it because my mother

149
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,140
was once your subordinate?

150
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,820
Xiaoxiao was one of my subordinates,

151
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,980
but my help to you

152
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,060
has nothing to do with her.

153
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,860
It's purely because you

154
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,980
are so capable

155
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,820
and keep surprising me

156
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,820
over and over again.

157
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,780
Surprising you?

158
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:52,700
That doesn't make sense.

159
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,820
How did you know my whereabouts?

160
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,900
Were you following me?

161
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,140
So, the unexpected rescue

162
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,700
we received

163
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,180

in Leiquan Street

166
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,020
was also from you.

Huangfu Longdou.

168
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,820
What's your real motive for helping me?

169
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,580
The answers to your questions

170
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,660
will come in time.

171
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,780
Be patient.

172
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,060
Cao Yanbing,

173
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,180
we will meet again.

174
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,620
Cao Yanbing,

175
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,060
Are you all right?

176
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,620
What happened to them?

177
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,540
Did you manage to defeat them?

178
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,860
Have you been controlled
by the demonic form?

179
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,940
Cao Yanbing,

180
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,740
that ungrateful fool.

181
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,260
He had such immense power

182
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,100
but chose to disregard it

183
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,020
and even dared to insult me.

184
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,300
I've already

185
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,300
devoured him.

186
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,220
How dare you put on an act
in front of me?

187
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,620
Do you think I can't tell

188
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,780
if you're being controlled
by the demonic form?

189
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,300
Do you want me
to be even more concerned?

190
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,700
I'm just trying to lighten the mood

191
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,540
and relax a little

192
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,300
now that the big fight is over.

193
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,460
Rest assured,

194
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,820
I've put the demonic form

195
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,420
back in check,

196
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,660
and it won't be a problem again

197
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,580
for a while.

198
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,060
That's good then.

199
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,260
Beiluo?

200
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,460
By the way, where is Yan Fengzha?

201
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,940
I thought
you were supposed to escort him.

202
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,940
Why did you come alone?

203
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,220
Don't worry.

204
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,860
I've settled him in the cabin.

205
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:51,940
Fengzha?

206
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,100
Isn't he already dead?

207
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:56,900
Let's go.

208
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,060
Let's go.

209
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,420
Just now, at Xianfeng Valley,

210
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,940
you appeared in front of the people

211
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,060
from the Hall of Heroes.

212
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,260
Are you sure everything is fine?

213
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,980
In a few days,

214
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,420
the Border Domain

215
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,500
may cease to exist.

216
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,220
A bunch of insignificant minions

217
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,020
are nothing to worry about.

218
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,220
But Cao Yanbing...

219
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,740
What about him?

220
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,940
I just saw him covered

221
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,980
in a malevolent aura,

222
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,300
which was unexpected.

223
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,340
I wonder why.

224
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,660
Over the next few days,

225
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,740
I will monitor

226
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,820
his every move

227
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,540
and report the findings to you

228
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,940
once the truth is known.

229
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,780
I'll count on you then.

230
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,180
Once the task is completed,

231
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,340
your contribution will not go unnoticed.

232
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,260
We're almost at the cabin.

233
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,740
Fengzha might have already woken up.

234
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,940
Let's move faster.

235
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,380
Walk a bit faster.

236
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,380
Cao Yanbing,

237
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,180
stop.

238
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,620
I need to say this sooner or later.

239
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,500
Whether you accept it or not,

240
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,220
I owe you an apology.

241
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,180
I didn't believe you right away,

242
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:34,460
whether it was about Tianyue's death

243
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,580
or fearing you

244
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,820
would be controlled

245
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,460
by the demonic form

246
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,060
and harm Lingfeng Street.

247
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:44,980
So?

248
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,620
Do you believe me now?

249
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:49,580
I do.

250
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,340
Why?

251
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,620
Did you come to this realization

252
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,620
because you found new evidence

253
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,740
showing that Yan Lingyu

254
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,980
was lying to you?

255
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Before I came to find you,

256
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,260
that was indeed the case,

257
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,260
but now those things

258
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,060
are no longer important.

259
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,700
Is it because you learned

260
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,100
that Yan Fengzha is still alive?

261
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,860
It's an undeniable fact.

262
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,460
After all, in the face

263
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,340
of an actual guide,

264
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,740
everything else is insignificant.

265
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,860
Because belief is belief.

266
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,380
Trusting one's friends

267
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,460
requires no reason.

268
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,500
This is what I've learned

269
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,100
from Xia Ling.

270
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,700
In the same situation,

271
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,740
she always chose to trust you.

272
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,260
And from the moment

273
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,460
I met you,

274
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,260
I've held a prejudice against you.

275
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,580
Even though you saved my life

276
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,380
and helped me regain my composure,

277
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
you've always been a dangerous person

278
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,340
in my eyes.

279
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,260
I've always been on guard against you

280
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,500
because of your bad reputation

281
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,580
and because you have
a Divine Warrior's Physique.

282
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,340
Looking at it this way,

283
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,220
I'm no different from the people

284
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,220
in the Hall of Heroes.

285
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,460
No,

286
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,340
I'm even worse than they are.

287
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:06,980
Cao Yanbing,

288
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,700
you have every reason to be angry.

289
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,620
If you think my apology isn't enough,

290
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,740
you can hit me now.

291
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,820
I won't fight back.

292
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,620
Cao Yanbing,

293
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,700
look.

294
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,540
Beiluo has already apologized

295
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,820
and even came specifically to rescue us.

296
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,300
Please calm your anger

297
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,700
and forgive him.

298
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,420
Good.

299
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,220
You are a man of your word.

300
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
Since you accept the beating,

301
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,620
I'll accept

302
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,740
the apology too.

303
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,700
So, does this mean I'm forgiven?

304
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,460
No more beating?

305
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,820
Not really.

306
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,540
This chance is too rare.

307
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,820
We'll settle it another time.

308
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,180
That's great!

309
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,740
I don't have to keep quiet anymore.

310
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,540
By the way, I suspect

311
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,940
that Yan Tianyue is already dead.

312
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,300
I saw Yan Lingyu

313
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,980
paying respects to him.

314
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,940
Let's hurry and find Yan Fengzha.

315
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:47,900
Let's go!

316
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,300
Feilian.

317
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,420
Where is Fengzha?

318
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,180
I'm sure I left him here.

319
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,820
Maybe he woke up

320
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,420
and left on his own?

321
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,820
That sounds unlikely.

322
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,260
Cao Yanbing.

323
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,220
Feilian.

324
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,700
Feilian,

325
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,940
I had no idea

326
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,020
you were imprisoned here
all these years.

327
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,100
I was completely unaware.

328
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,580
I truly...

329
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,620
I truly...

330
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:50,820
I haven't been...

331
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,700
I haven't been a good master.

332
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,860
Feilian was indeed imprisoned here.

333
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,100
It appears
that the so-called elixir Blaze Jade

334
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,380
is derived

335
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,780
from Feilian's blood.

336
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,940
Yan Lingyu,

337
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,340
who appeared to be benevolent,

338
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,500
was using this method

339
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,140
to exploit and oppress
the Guardian Primordial Spirit

340
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,580
for power and wealth.

341
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,460
No wonder the symptoms
of the fake Yan Tianyue

342
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,060
before his death

343
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,300
were identical
to the uncontrollable rage

344
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,300
described by Fengzha.

345
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,140
Given Feilian's immense
Primordial Spirit Power,

346
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,620
why is he here,

347
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,100
submissively undergoing
blood extraction?

348
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,340
One of these tubes

349
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,940
is used to draw blood,

350
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,540
while the other must be for...

351
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,260
Sedative.

352
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,100
Watch out, Fengzha.

353
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:06,740
Cao Yanbing,

354
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,260
Feilian is in Demonic Warrior Form,

355
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,420
which is tough to deal with.

356
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,420
Cao Yanbing, forget it.

357
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,060
Summon the Guardian Primordial Spirit.

358
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,420
Shi Ling...

359
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,940
No, don't hurt it.

360
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,820
Feilian is suffering like this

361
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,780
because it followed the wrong master.

362
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,660
It's my fault.

363
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,860
I wasn't strong enough.

364
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,660
If I had controlled Feilian

365
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,500
from the beginning,

366
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,100
it wouldn't have endured such suffering.

367
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,140
I owe it to Feilian.

368
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,940
Even if it wants to hurt me,

369
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,500
I must let it go.

370
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:53,940
Feilian,

371
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:54,940
leave!

372
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,780
Feilian.

373
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,060
Feilian.

374
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,060
Feilian.

375
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,460
Abandoning
your Guardian Primordial Spirit

376
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,460
is your solution?

377
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,180
After all your hard work,

378
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,260
you're just going to give up?

379
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,660
Let me tell you, Yan Fengzha,

380
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,620
your sympathy for Feilian

381
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,940
is just

382
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,580
your self-deception.

383
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,380
It's meaningless.

384
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,700
The real issue

385
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,820
isn't whether Feilian

386
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,100
had the wrong master,

387
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,380
but whether you

388
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,740
have made the effort

389
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,060
to become the right person.

390
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,140
Do you know

391
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,580
why you can't subdue Feilian?

392
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,500
Because you view the bond

393
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,820
between the Spirit-hosted Human
and the Guardian Primordial Spirit

394
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,820
merely as a matter

395
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,460
of control and submission.

396
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,300
Feilian, wait for me!

397
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,460
No.

398
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,260
No.

399
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,260
I must...

400
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,180
I must learn to control Feilian.

401
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,420
Feilian, I'm coming!

402
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,860
Feilian!

403
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,140
A Guardian Primordial Spirit

404
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,340
is called so

405
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,060
because its core contract

406
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,980
is protection,

407
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,780
meaning to stick together
through thick and thin,

408
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,060
and never abandon each other.

409
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,820
The bond ensures
the Guardian Primordial Spirit's

410
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,700
protection

411
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,660
in exchange for the Spirit-hosted Human's

412
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,700
unwavering allegiance.

413
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,460
Not everyone

414
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,700
can manifest
a Guardian Primordial Spirit.

415
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,900
You were fortunate

416
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,380
to have Feilian from the start.

417
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,780
But if you

418
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,980
had the chance,

419
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,940
would you still choose it?

420
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,740
Think carefully about this.

421
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,500
Over the years,

422
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,940
have you truly treated it

423
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,180
as a partner

424
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,140
and considered how to protect it?

425
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,100
You're right.

426
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,380
Instead of seeing Feilian as a partner,

427
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,380
I viewed it

428
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,780
more as an adversary,

429
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,500
as an obstacle to my freedom.

430
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,460
I was truly

431
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,220
and utterly mistaken.

432
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,100
You don't need to be so pessimistic.

433
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,500
Feilian seems

434
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,100
to be more wary

435
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,180
than hostile.

436
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,740
He didn't intend to rip you apart.

437
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,420
Consider

438
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,100
if there was ever

439
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,060
a true connection

440
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,420
between you and Feilian,

441
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,740
even just once.

442
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,580
Fengzha,

443
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,700
don't be afraid.

444
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,100
My blade is sharp,

445
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,380
and soon

446
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,060
you won't be in pain anymore.

447
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,100
Father,

448
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,660
don't kill me.

449
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,940
If I die,

450
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,380
Feilian will disappear too.

451
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,180
I can't let that happen.

452
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,100
It's my Guardian Primordial Spirit.

453
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,380
I can't let it disappear.

454
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,380
I remember

455
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,100
there was a time

456
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,140
when I focused solely

457
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,820
on protecting Feilian,

458
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,380
and Feilian

459
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,620
was protecting me as well.

460
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,700
Feilian,

461
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,140
it's me.

462
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,900
I've come to find you.

463
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,020
I'm sorry, Feilian.

464
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,740
I've come too late.

465
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,220
All these years,

466
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,900
you must have felt

467
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,780
very uneasy

468
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,220
without your master.

469
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,860
Indeed, I haven't

470
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,580
been a good master.

471
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,100
I've come to my senses now, Feilian.

472
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,860
Can you forgive me?

473
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,420
I know

474
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,620
I'm not that strong

475
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,340
and that I fall short

476
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,340
compared to you.

477
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,180
You'll probably have to protect me more

478
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,180
in the future,

479
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,900
but surely there are things

480
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,820
only I can do

481
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,380
to guard you.

482
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,220
Feilian,

483
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,580
let me protect you once more.

484
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:58,940
Okay?

485
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,460
Feilian,

486
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,780
come back!

487
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,020
Fengzha,

488
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,060
here are the restorative pills.

489
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,340
Be sure to take them properly.

490
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,100
Also,

491
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:12,620
remember

492
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,940
to chew them thoroughly

493
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,780
before swallowing them

494
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,620
for better absorption.

495
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,540
If I take these,

496
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,380
will Feilian recover faster?

497
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,420
Of course.

498
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,420
These were refined by Li Xuanyuan

499
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,380
using True Fire.

500
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,260
Don't worry.

501
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,140
Unlike Blaze Jade,

502
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,340
they have no side effects.

503
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,060
I'm sorry.

504
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,660
I didn't mean to say those things.

505
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,020
Please don't take them to heart.

506
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,300
You didn't say anything wrong.

507
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,660
I will make sure to address

508
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,900
the issue with the Blaze Jade properly.

509
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,060
How do you plan

510
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,060
to address it then?

511
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,660
It involves

512
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,060
your own kin and clan members.

513
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,860
I'll deal with it
as it needs to be dealt with.

514
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,180
My auntie

515
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,420
will be held accountable.

516
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,380
As for my father,

517
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,500
I haven't seen him

518
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,140
in years.

519
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,340
I heard he's been bedridden

520
00:32:59,340 --> 00:32:59,980
and unable to leave the house.

521
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,820
Whether he knows about the matter

522
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,220
with the Blaze Jade,

523
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,100
I need to find him and ask to be sure.

524
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,900
What happened to you guys?

525
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,140
Fengzha,

526
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,860
your father might not know

527
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,500
about the Blaze Jade.

528
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:20,980
How do you know?

529
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,900
Last night,

530
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,340
I saw Yan Lingyu

531
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,780
at the barrier
on Lingfeng Mountain's summit,

532
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,820
where she greeted the three people
from the Hall of Heroes.

533
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,740
Then, she knelt

534
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,540
under a big tree,

535
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,860
took out some flower cakes
soaked in liquor,

536
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,580
and began her ritual.

537
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:37,820
What

538
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,500
is the meaning of that?

539
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,420
The liquor-soaked flower cakes

540
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,540
that Yan Lingyu used for the ritual

541
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,380
are your father's favorite.

542
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,540
As far as I know,

543
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,860
he's the only one

544
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,620
who likes them this way.

545
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,660
Tianyue,

546
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,140
the crisis in Lingfeng Street

547
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,660
should be considered over now.

548
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,020
General Yan,

549
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,420
