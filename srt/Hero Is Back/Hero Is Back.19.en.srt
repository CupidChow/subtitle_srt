18
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,500
Tianyue,

19
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,140
the crisis in Lingfeng Street

20
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,620
should be considered over now.

21
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,900
General Yan,

22
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,260
what are you doing here?

23
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,140
You...

24
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,620
How come you are...?

25
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,700
How come

26
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,460
I'm standing here unscathed

27
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,100
instead of being taken away
by those from the Hall of Heroes?

28
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,740
Is that what you're wondering?

29
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,180
Well, it's because we're tough

30
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,580
and lucky.

31
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,700

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,140
who are you mourning here

33
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,060
for no good reason?

34
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,580
Cao Yanbing,

35
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,660
you're a wanted criminal.

36
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,820
Is there anything wrong
with me reporting you

37
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,940
to the Hall of Heroes?

38
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,820
As for who I'm here
to pay my respects to,

39
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,900
how is that any of your concern?

00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,580
Flower cakes soaked in liquor.

41
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,460
As far as I know,

42
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,220
only Tianyue enjoys them

43
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,660

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,860
what do you mean by that?

47
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,820
Do you think

48
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,420
I'm honoring my brother?

49
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,500
Just because of these few cakes?

50
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,500
Isn't this enough to prove it?

51
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,660
Lingyu,

52
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,980
I advise you

53
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,020
to be honest and tell us

54
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,300
the truth right now.

55
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,300
The truth?

56
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,500
The truth is that my brother

57
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,860
was killed by Cao Yanbing.

58
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,860
I'm filled with grief.

59
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,420
That's why I came here

60
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,940
to chat with my nephew Fengzha.

61
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,300
Fengzha?

62
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,700
Are you still trying to say

63
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,100
that it's Fengzha who's buried here?

64
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:31,900
That's right.

65
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,820
Weren't you skeptical

66
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,860
about Fengzha being dead?

67
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,260
This

68
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,020
is where Fengzha is buried.

69
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,260
As for these offerings,

70
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,260
Fengzha is my brother's son,

71
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,700
so their tastes

72
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,620
would naturally be similar.

73
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,380
You are lying!

74
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,820
How could I not know

75
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,580
my taste?

76
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,460
Fengzha.

77
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,460
Fengzha.

78
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,700
You...

79
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,020
Why are you...?

80
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,660
Did they

81
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,380
trick you into coming out?

82
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:08,900
Is that right?

83
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:09,580
I came out on my own

84
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,860
after hearing

85
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,420
that my father was killed.

86
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,580
It had nothing to do with them.

87
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,460
But then,

88
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,580
I discovered

89
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,060
that the deceased

90
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,380
was wearing

91
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,460
a mask resembling my father's face.

92
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,940
He was someone else.

93
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,140
So,

94
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,820
who is buried under this tree?

95
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,460
Is it

96
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,020
my father?

97
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,140
Why aren't you speaking?

98
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,380
Answer me!

99
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,380
Fengzha,

100
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,340
I had someone impersonate your father

101
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,460
just to find a way

102
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,540
to trap Cao Yanbing

103
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,380
and prevent him from taking you away.

104
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,260
I did this

105
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,500
to protect you.

106
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,820
You're still lying

107
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,260
even at this point.

108
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,380
Fine,

109
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,260
I'll reveal the truth.

110
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,060
Five years ago,

111
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,820
Feilian transformed
and escaped from my body.

112
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,060
You and Father
managed to subdue it together.

113
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,700
Knowing that Feilian

114
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,180
was a Demonic Warrior Form,

115
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,140
you coveted its power.

116
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,060
So,

117
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,260
you went so far

118
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,620
as to secretly kill my father,

119
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,060
deceitfully claiming

120
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,500
he was terminally ill

121
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,580
and convincing me
to obey your instructions

122
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,060
and stay imprisoned.

123
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,300
Meanwhile,

124
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,620
you continuously

125
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,020
extracted its blood

126
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,820
to make Blaze Jade,

127
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,060
which became the source of your power

128
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,140
and wealth.

129
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,180
Am I right?

130
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,740
It seems

131
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,940
that you have seen Feilian.

132
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,940
In the underground chamber,

133
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,740
I saw the tubes
for extracting its blood.

134
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,300
I truly regret

135
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,380
not discovering this sooner.

136
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,180
So, I'll ask you one last time.

137
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,940
Is it my father

138
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
buried under this tree?

139
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,380
Did you

140
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,260
kill him?

141
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,260
Given the situation,

142
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,700
there's nothing left to hide.

143
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,100
Yes, it's true.

144
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,340
I killed your father.

145
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,780
He is buried under this tree.

146
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,140
Back then,

147
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,220
Elder Mei had already developed a method

148
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,900
to reduce the toxicity

149
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,220
of Feilian's blood.

150
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,260
With it,

151
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,060
the Wind-Treading Clan
could have grown stronger.

152
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,060
But my brother was against it.

153
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,820
We can't do that.

154
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,860
Despite Feilian's demonic nature,

155
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,740
it remains

156
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,540
a divine beast
of the Wind-Treading Clan.

157
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,220
Locking it up

158
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,140
was already a last resort.

159
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,180
How could we continue to hurt it?

160
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,780
Do you know
where those Malevolent Beings went

161
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,020
before coming

162
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,700
to Lingfeng Street?

163
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,660
They went to the Fire-Eater Village

164
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,380
and wiped out the entire clan.

165
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,220
If it weren't for Feilian's blood

166
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,540
this time,

167
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,660
the Wind-Treading Clan

168
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,940
would have faced the same fate.

169
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,020
Tianyue,

170
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,180
if we don't become stronger,

171
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,420
what if those Malevolent Beings

172
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,380
come back?

173
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,420
We'd be

174
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,820
in grave danger.

175
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,380
In the Spiritual Crossroads,
it's survival

176
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,900
of the fittest.

177
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,020
The Wind-Treading Clan
is inherently weak,

178
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,860
and our survival to this point

179
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,300
is due to centuries

180
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,540
of isolation.

181
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,780
Should we face another invasion

182
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,020
in the future,

183
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,420
our extinction

184
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,660
would be inevitable.

185
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,260
No,

186
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,940
we are not that weak.

187
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,220
Don't forget.

188
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,780
We still have Fengzha.

189
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,020
For now,

190
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,020
we can rely on Feilian's power

191
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,340
to sustain us.

192
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,660
Once Fengzha

193
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,700
can fully control

194
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,860
Feilian's power,

195
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,060
everything

196
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,940
will get better.

197
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,460
Fengzha has endured

198
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,380
so much hardship.

199
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,940
And now,
you want to extract blood from Feilian,

200
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,120
treating his Guardian Spirit

201
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,580
like this.

202
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:29,980
Right now,

203
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,460
this is the only way

204
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,620
to survive.

205
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,140
Being indecisive

206
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,580
will only endanger everyone.

207
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,620
Enough.

208
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,020
I am the Spiritual Guardian
of this street.

209
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,420
I know what should be done

210
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,660
and what should not.

211
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,380
I'm sorry.

212
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,860
I don't know.

213
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,500
All I know

214
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,980
is that I don't want to see our people

215
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,220
being killed one after another

216
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,380
by those Malevolent Beings.

217
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,300
I know

218
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,380
that I don't want to see Ruofu

219
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,220
and those who tried so hard

220
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,140
to survive

221
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,700
to meet such a tragic end.

222
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,500
Yu, where are you going?

223
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,420
I'm going to tell our people

224
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,660
about this

225
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,060
and let them make their own decisions

226
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,100
on what should be done.

227
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,180
Have you lost your mind?

228
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:07,980
That's absolutely out of the question.

229
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,260
What if I insist on doing it?

230
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,900
Then don't blame me

231
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,420
for being harsh.

232
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,820
He brought all this

233
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,260
on himself.

234
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,420
Yan Lingyu,

235
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,020
it turns out

236
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,500
you really would go so far

237
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,140
as to harm your brother

238
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,660
just for a bit of power

239
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,620
and this role as the Spiritual Guardian?

240
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,220
That's right.

241
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,500
The Spiritual Guardian
of Lingfeng Street

242
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,900
is me,

243
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,340
and it should be me.

244
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,500
Every Spiritual Guardian

245
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,140
should be willing
to do whatever it takes

246
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,500
to protect their street.

247
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,620
Yet your father

248
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,220
was indecisive.

249
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,740
He'd rather risk his clan

250
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,380
being wiped out
by those Malevolent Beings

251
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,340
than use

252
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,620
Feilian's power.

253
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,620
So what right does he have

254
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,260
to be a Spiritual Guardian?

255
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,660
So

256
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,660
you mistreated Feilian

257
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,900
and took my father's life.

258
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,500
How could you

259
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,140
even bring yourself to do that?

260
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,020
Even if your father

261
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,860
hadn't died at my hands,

262
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,980
he would have perished
at the hands of those Malevolent Beings.

263
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,900
Do you understand?

264
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,740
Five years ago,

265
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,540
when the Malevolent Beings invaded,

266
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,340
if I hadn't used

267
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,020
Feilian's blood in time,

268
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,900
would Lingfeng Street still exist today?

269
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,260
Would you still be seeing

270
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,620
what you see now?

271
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,620
Is there a problem

272
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,140
with me protecting my street?

273
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,620
You have no idea

274
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,140
what I've been through

275
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,260
these five years.

276
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,220
I believe my actions

277
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,620
have been justifiable

278
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,900
to both Lingfeng Street

279
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,740
and the Wind-Treading Clan.

280
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,020
And you?

281
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,860
For years you've claimed

282
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,500
you wanted to protect Lingfeng Street,

283
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,020
but today,

284
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,900
you've betrayed that

285
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,740
by siding with these outsiders.

286
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,380
Do you think
you've lived up to the expectations

287
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,100
of Lingfeng Street
and the Wind-Treading Clan?

288
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,500
I was wrong about you.

289
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,860
You've always been a useless person

290
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,860
who can't even control

291
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,620
your own Guardian Primordial Spirit.

292
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,380
How do you know

293
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,660
that I can't control it?

294
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,500
Feilian!

295
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,740
Come back.

296
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,500
Fengzha,

297
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,500
are you truly able

298
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,860
to control Feilian with ease now?

299
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,660
How about that?

300
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,380
Didn't expect it, did you?

301
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,620
You won't be able to confine me anymore.

302
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,380
I swear to take vengeance

303
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,980
on the one who killed my father.

304
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,500
Such big talk.

305
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,060
Do you think
just because you can control

306
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,740
your Guardian Primordial Spirit,

307
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,140
you'll be able

308
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,260
to use its power effectively in battle?

309
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,180
Learn how to strike properly

310
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,020
before you talk about revenge.

311
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,340
Do you think I can't do it?

312
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,300
Then give it a try.

313
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,500
Crane's Cry Strike.

314
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,900
Watch out, Fengzha.

315
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,580
Moonshadow Strike!

316
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,460
Ruofu.

317
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,660
Ruofu.

318
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,020
- Ruofu.
- Ruofu.

319
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,700
Ruofu.

320
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,380
Ruofu.

321
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,020
Ruofu.

322
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,060
Ruofu.

323
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,740
Ruofu, how are you feeling?

324
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,580
Ruofu.

325
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,140
Ruofu.

326
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,460
Go away, all of you!

327
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:15,980
Ruofu.

328
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:17,580
Mother.

329
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,420
Ruofu.

330
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,740
How come you...

331
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,060
You...

332
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,580
Haven't you left already?

333
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,100
I haven't left.

334
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,660
I've been following you all along.

335
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,300
How could you be so silly?

336
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,820
This has nothing

337
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,260
to do with you.

338
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,980
Why are you so silly?

339
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,740
- Ruofu.
- Mother.

340
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,380
Are you all right?

341
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,580
Fengzha.

342
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,540
Ruofu.

343
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,300
I'm so glad, Fengzha,

344
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,260
that you're still alive.

345
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,620
Fengzha,

346
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,460
please hear me out.

347
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,660
Don't blame my mother for what happened.

348
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,580
Let my life

349
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,420
atone for her past mistakes.

350
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,660
Ruofu.

351
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,260
Mother,

352
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,180
I saw

353
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,420
what occurred between you and Uncle

354
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,780
on that day.

355
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,140
What?

356
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:29,820
That day,

357
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,900
I had just finished practicing
my swordsmanship.

358
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,780
Have you lost your mind?

359
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,740
That's absolutely out of the question.

360
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,340
What if I insist on doing it?

361
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,380
Then don't blame me

362
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,020
for being harsh.

363
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,180
Tianyue!

364
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,420
Tianyue,

365
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,780
wake up.

366
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,660
Tianyue!

367
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,780
Fengzha,

368
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,060
my mother...

369
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,100
My mother

370
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,780
didn't intend for this to happen.

371
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,620
How could things turn out like this?

372
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,660
Mother,

373
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,780
I know

374
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,180
you've been living in pain
all this time.

375
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,860
You've given everything you have

376
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,500
to protect Lingfeng Street.

377
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,540
I truly

378
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,380
want to help you,

379
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,540
but...

380
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,860
but I've tried so hard

381
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,380
and I just can't do it.

382
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,820
No.

383
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,660
No.

384
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,980
Perhaps, as you said,

385
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,020
I am indeed useless.

386
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,140
I hope

387
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,180
my death

388
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,900
will relieve you

389
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,060
of your pain.

390
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,260
Ruofu.

391
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,900
Ruofu.

392
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,900
Ruofu.

393
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,980
Wake up, Ruofu.

394
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,060
Ruofu!

395
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,500
Ruofu.

396
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,300
Ruofu.

397
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,780
Suiyun!

398
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,650
[Suiyun]

399
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:25,940
Suiyun,

400
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:27,780
I order you

401
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,820
to sever our bond right away

402
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,300
and pledge your allegiance
to Ruofu instead.

403
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,660
Use your power

404
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,500
to save her life,

405
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,140
and from now on,

406
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,740
protect and accompany her

407
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,620
through life and death,

408
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,780
without ever abandoning her.

409
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,340
Ruofu.

410
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,180
Mother.

411
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,100
Ruofu.

412
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,980
Ruofu.

413
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,940
It's great.

414
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,500
Mother.

415
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:36,900
Mother.

416
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,660
Mother, what happened to you?

417
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,540
Mother.

418
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,620
How did it turn out like this?

419
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,180
What happened to my mother?

420
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,460
Your mother

421
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,980
gave her Guardian Primordial Spirit
to you.

422
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,380
But

423
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,220
why is she in such a state?

424
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,620
Perhaps the prolonged use of Blaze Jade

425
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,060
has deeply poisoned her,

426
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,860
making her body unable to function

427
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,620
without the power
of the Guardian Primordial Spirit.

428
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,140
Mother.

429
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,620
Mother.

430
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,700
Mother.

431
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,220
Ruofu.

432
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,220
Ruofu.

433
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,700
I'm...

434
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,500
sorry.

435
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,500
I killed

436
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,380
your Guardian Primordial Spirit.

437
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,340
Now,

438
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
I'm giving Suiyun

439
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,420
to you,

440
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,100
hoping it

441
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,780
can make up

442
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,260
for my mistakes.

443
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,460
Mother.

444
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:46,940
Ruofu,

445
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,940
I'm responsible for your suffering.

446
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,780
It's...

447
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,420
It's all my fault.

448
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,740
Since you were little,

449
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,700
you were so unruly

450
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,420
and

451
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,820
so willful.

452
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,860
I originally thought

453
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,180
it was because you

454
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,420
couldn't summon

455
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,460
your Guardian Primordial Spirit in time

456
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,820
that you became like this.

457
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:14,780
But it turns out

458
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,820
it's all because of me.

459
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,220
My mistakes have caused you harm.

460
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,180
That's not true, Mother.

461
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,900
My mistakes have affected you.

462
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,380
That's not true.

463
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,540
Ruofu,

464
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,380
I'm the one who hurt you.

465
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,780
I'm sorry.

466
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,860
That's not true, Mother.

467
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,540
No.

468
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,460
Fengzha,

469
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,180
I'm sorry.

470
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,140
I don't blame you.

471
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,700
It's me who harmed you

472
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,180
and your father.

473
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,740
In fact,

474
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,900
I want to tell you

475
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,860
that I kept Cao Yanbing

476
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,980
from finding you

477
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,700
not because of the Blaze Jade,

478
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,820
but because of you.

479
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,300
Because you

480
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,860
are everything
to our Wind-Treading Clan.

481
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,140
You can change Lingfeng Street.

482
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,340
You are the hope of our entire clan.

483
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,660
My brother and I

484
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,940
once made a vow

485
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,900
that no matter what,

486
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,900
we would persist

487
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,460
through any challenge

488
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,780
until the day

489
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,140
you could truly

490
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,740
control Feilian.

491
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,500
Fengzha,

492
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:04,740
I

493
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,500
am so happy

494
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,500
to see

495
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,460
that you've finally

496
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,140
managed to control Feilian today.

497
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,100
I can finally

498
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,180
make amends.

499
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,220
Mother.

500
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,140
Now that my wish has been fulfilled,

501
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,140
the future

502
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,460
of the Wind-Treading Clan

503
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,180
is entrusted

504
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,660
to you and Ruofu.

505
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,740
Mother.

506
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,380
Cao Yanbing,

507
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,340
there's something

508
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,860
I need to tell you.

509
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,500
I met your mother

510
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,180
ten years ago.

511
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,420
My mother?

512
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,860
Back then,

513
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,740
their group

514
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,380
entered the Luhua Ancient Tower

515
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,180
in search

516
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,140
of a power

517
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,020
to purify the Malevolent Beings.

518
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,980
Purify the Malevolent Beings?

519
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,700
Why do they need to purify
the Malevolent Beings?

520
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,940
I asked her the same question.

521
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,100
They are the source of all evil

522
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,860
in the Spiritual Crossroads.

523
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,220
Shouldn't you be trying

524
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,300
to eliminate them
as quickly as possible?

525
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,460
Why are you

526
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,980
thinking about purifying them?

527
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,300
But we've been killing Malevolent Beings

528
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,180
for so long.

529
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,900
Do you think

530
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,220
the Spiritual Crossroads
have become better?

531
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,300
As we all know,

532
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,540
Malevolent Beings evolve

533
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,500
from ordinary Border Dwellers.

534
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,980
They use their power

535
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,940
to devour Border Dwellers,

536
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,260
and the Border Domain

537
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,900
then uses Spiritual Guardians' power

538
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,700
to eradicate them.

539
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,700
For nearly

540
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,580
a thousand years,

541
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,700
we've been killing

542
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,700
in this endless cycle of slaughter

543
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,820
and power struggles.

544
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,540
The real problem has been obscured.

545
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,420
We've become numb,

546
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,980
filled with hatred,

547
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,300
and the rules
of the Spiritual Crossroads

548
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,420
have boiled down to just one:

549
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,380
survival of the fittest.

550
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,260
We follow the law of the jungle.

551
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,940
Either you eliminate me,

552
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,380
or I make you fear me.

553
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,820
Where is the compassion?

554
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,100
The innocence?

555
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,580
The kindness and benevolence?

556
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,340
It seems that all the beautiful things

557
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,620
have become insignificant.

558
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,060
Whether it's Border Dwellers

559
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,540
or Spirit-hosted Humans,

560
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,020
no one can see

561
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,540
where the future lies.

562
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,740
So you're planning

563
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,620
to purify the Malevolent Beings.

564
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,700
If it works,

565
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:41,940
the Spiritual Guardians

566
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,780
won't have to keep killing them,

567
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,060
and the Border Dwellers
won't have to live in constant fear.

568
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,620
This way,

569
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,100
the conflicts
in the Spiritual Crossroads

570
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,380
would be greatly reduced.

571
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,060
At least,

572
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,780
we'll have another way

573
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,940
to deal with the Malevolent Beings.

574
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,740
That would be ideal,

575
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,180
but

576
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,460
according to legend,

577
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,820
the Ancient Tower is inhabited

578
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,900
by powerful deities

579
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,540
and is fraught with danger.

580
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:03,780
In the past,

581
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,380
there have been people from our clan

582
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,740
who ventured in,

583
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,820
but none returned.

584
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,740
Perhaps

585
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,140
you should reconsider carefully.

586
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,340
I've thought it through clearly.

587
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,620
Given my current situation,

588
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,100
I won't be able to return

589
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
to Rakshasa Street for a long time,

590
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,620
and I won't be able

591
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,900
to be with my two children.

592
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,700
So, even if it's only

593
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,940
for their sake,

594
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,220
I should make every effort
to give it a try.

595
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,660
For their sake?

596
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,700
I don't quite understand.

597
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,460
What's the logic

598
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,700
in doing this for the children?

599
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,620
To be honest,

600
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,660
I also once believed

601
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,520
that being powerful
in the Spiritual Crossroads

602
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,020
was all that mattered

603
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,780
and that killing was the best way

604
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,700
to solve problems.

605
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,940
I was a hitwoman

606
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,980
and lived a long time

607
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,900
as a cold-blooded and ruthless person

608
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,180
who only knew how to follow orders.

609
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,020
But after I had children,

610
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,220
I experienced

611
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,900
many wonderful things

612
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,060
and felt all kinds

613
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,140
of beautiful emotions.

614
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,020
One day, I realized

615
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,300
that I didn't want

616
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,180
my children

617
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,500
to live in a world

618
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,460
governed by the law of the jungle

619
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,060
and filled with ceaseless killing.

620
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:13,620
She said

621
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,780
that the ultimate source of all evil
in the Spiritual Crossroads

622
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,500
is not the Malevolent Beings,

623
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,900
but rather

624
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,700
the survival-of-the-fittest principle.

625
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:25,980
She mentioned

626
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,380
that if she could find another way

627
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,900
to completely resolve

628
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,340
the Malevolent Beings issue,

629
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,580
then killing to stop killing

630
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,500
would no longer be the only option.

631
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,500
She also said

632
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,100
that she might be away

633
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,340
from home

634
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,620
for a long time

635
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,020
because

636
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,500
she doesn't want her children

637
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,780
to live in a world

638
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,820
filled with violence.

639
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,540
Mother.

640
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,660
This knife

641
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,420
was given to me by your mother
back in the day.

642
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,620
I don't deserve to possess it,

643
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,420
so today,

644
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,260
I'm giving it back to you.

645
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,500
I guess...

646
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,580
I guess it's another way

647
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,060
of returning it to its rightful owner.

648
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,620
[A strong heart can shatter stone.]

649
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,350
[A fierce spirit can vanquish demons.]

650
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,620
Ruofu.

651
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,820
Mother.

652
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,460
The final thing

653
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,180
I want you to know

654
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:14,900
Mother.

655
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,100
is that you

656
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,820
have never been a useless person.

657
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,900
To me,

658
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,460
you are...

659
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,780
you are my

660
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,220
only pride.

661
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,500
Mother.

662
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,900
Mother!

663
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,020
Auntie.

664
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:39,740
Mother!

665
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,100
Mother.

666
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,460
Mother.

667
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,740
Mother.

668
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:51,980
Mother.

669
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,180
I never thought

670
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,980
things on Lingfeng Street

671
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,060
would turn out this way.

672
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,020
Sometimes I wonder

673
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,340
if no matter what Yan Lingyu chose,

674
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,060
it would have been wrong.

675
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,380
If it were me,

676
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,380
I honestly wouldn't know what to do.

677
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,700
What's on your mind?

678
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,620
Why have you gone quiet?

679
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,300
I'm looking at the knife

680
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,420
Mom gave to Yan Lingyu.

681
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,540
It has two lines of text:

682
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,500
A strong heart can shatter stone,

683
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,700
and a fierce spirit can vanquish demons.

684
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,700
What does it mean?

685
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,340
With enough ruthlessness,
one can be invincible?

686
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,140
If your interpretation is correct,

687
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,620
Mom wouldn't have risked

688
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,740
going to the Ancient Tower

689
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,180
to find ways to purify
the Malevolent Beings

690
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,460
and change the ruthless
survival-of-the-fittest situation

691
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,140
in the Spiritual Crossroads.

692
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,060
That's true.

693
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,460
So what does it mean?

694
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,980
Mom once told me

695
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,980
to maintain

696
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,580
one's true self

697
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,580
amid anger and resentment.

698
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,140
I guess the true self

699
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,380
might mean something similar.

700
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,420
According to your interpretation,

701
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,540
I think Yan Lingyu

702
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,540
is following

703
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,580
these principles.

704
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,140
However, people have different paths.

705
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,220
She prioritizes survival

706
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,860
above all else,

707
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,660
which is also the mindset

708
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,940
of most people
in the Spiritual Crossroads.

709
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,980
The problem

710
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,860
is that humans
can't just focus on surviving.

711
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,780
That's the biggest difference

712
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,380
between humans and animals.

713
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,580
What would your choice be

714
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,580
if you were in the same situation?

715
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,100
You're asking me?

716
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,820
I don't know.

717
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,180
It's all right
that I don't know the answer,

718
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,140
but you don't know either?

719
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,700
All my life,

720
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,100
my sole concern

721
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,580
has been how to safeguard
Rakshasa Street.

722
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,100
I'm capable of doing that.

723
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,300
But as for what lies

724
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,700
beyond Rakshasa Street,

725
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,500
I've never cared.

726
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,500
The current state and future

727
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,380
of the Spiritual Crossroads

728
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,980
are things
I've never even thought about.

729
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,340
So what were you thinking about
just now?

730
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,260
I was wondering

731
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,940
what Mom meant

732
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,860
when she told Yan Lingyu
that she wouldn't be able

733
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,020
to return to Rakshasa Street

734
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,740
for a long time.

735
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,620
Also, I can't understand

736
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,980
why Mom didn't go home after escaping

737
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,220
from the Shadowbound Prison.

738
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,940
But now

739
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,780
it seems

740
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,020
there must have been

741
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,900
some unavoidable circumstances.

742
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,420
It seems that in your simple mind,

743
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,740
the question

744
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,180
of "to be or not to be"
will never arise.

745
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,580
Bee?

746
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,220
What bee?

747
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:21,100
[The resting place
of Yan Lingyu and Yan Tianyue]

748
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,380
Generals,

749
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,740
thanks for your efforts.

750
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,820
Mr. Beiluo,

751
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,740
thank you for helping
to bury my mother.

752
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,380
I hope you can overlook
whatever offenses

753
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,380
we've committed in the past.

754
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,420
Since I've come to bid her farewell,

755
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,740
I no longer hold anything against you.

756
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,020
I just wish for her,

757
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,820
for both Generals Yan,

758
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,740
to rest in peace.

759
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,020
Lingfeng Street will rely

760
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,140
on you two moving forward.

761
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,180
Mother's last wish

762
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,500
was for you

763
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,540
to protect

764
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,940
Lingfeng Street.

765
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,020
From now on,

766
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,660
you will be the Spiritual Guardian

767
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,500
of Lingfeng Street,

768
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,540
and I will assist you

769
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,940
with everything.

770
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,540
Ruofu,

771
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,420
now that you have Suiyun,

772
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,420
you will be able
to protect Lingfeng Street.

773
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,620
What's wrong?

774
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,940
Don't you want
to be the Spiritual Guardian?

775
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,220
Why?

776
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,820
Are you still holding a grudge

777
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,460
against my mother?

778
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,100
No, it's not that.

779
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,420
Regarding my auntie,

780
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,340
I

781
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,060
have very mixed feelings.

782
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,340
Then,

783
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,620
why are you unwilling

784
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,620
to become the Spiritual Guardian?

785
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:31,780
I have

786
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,820
more important things to do.

787
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,540
What things?

788
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,100
Ruofu,

789
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,620
just stay here with Auntie.

790
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,220
I'll be heading off.

791
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,540
Fengzha,

792
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,420
what kind of snacks
are you into these days?

793
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,260
I'll prepare them for you tomorrow.

794
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,260
Why tomorrow?

795
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,260
Have you forgotten?

796
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,940
Tomorrow is your birthday.

797
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,340
I completely forgot.

798
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,060
You still remember?

799
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,300
You're my family,

800
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,740
so of course, I remember.
