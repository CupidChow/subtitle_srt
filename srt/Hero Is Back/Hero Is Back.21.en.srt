00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,940
[Adapted from Xu Chen's comic:
Rakshasa Street]

17
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,940
[Episode 21]

18
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,540
This place is massive.

19
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,940
How much longer do we have to walk?

20
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,100
According to our clan's ancient records,

21
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,020
the Luhua Ancient Tower

22
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,100
will appear tonight at moonrise.

23
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,020
Its location is deep

24
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,220
in the heart of the forest,

25
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,580
almost at the very center.

26
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,100
My sister once told me

27
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,140
there's an ancient tree there

28
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,460
that's over a thousand years old

29
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,820
and stands dozens of meters tall.

30
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,460
We need to find that tree first,

31
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,140
and once the tower appears,

32
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,260
I'll use the method

33
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,420
passed down
through generations of guides

34
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,540
to dispel the illusion

35
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,060
placed by our ancestors over the forest.

36
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,020
That way, we'll be able

37
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,700
to see the tower.

38
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,020
The ancient tree
sounds pretty mysterious.

39
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,220
Fengzha,

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,260
why don't you tell us more?

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,700
Are there any other legends?

42
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,740
I was just about to tell you,

43
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,660
though it might not be that interesting.

44
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,660
Legend has it

45
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,260
that Voidwood

46
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,540
is a cursed forest.

47
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,220
Humans, except for Border Dwellers,

48
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,660
will turn to stone if they stay here

49
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,540
for more than three days.

50
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,420
This curse

51
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,980
was placed by the deities
in the Ancient Tower

52
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,380
to prevent the land

53
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,100
from being tainted

54
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,220
by human presence.

55
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,500
What kind of curse is that?

56
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,380
It's so extreme.

57
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,860
No human presence allowed?

58
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,540
Is the deity allergic to humans
or something?

59
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,180
If that's the case,

60
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,020
from the moment

61
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,940
we enter this forest

62
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,020
until the tower appears

63
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,140
and we get out,

64
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,580
we've got

65
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,580
less than three days.

66
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,460
That's cutting it close.

67
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,820
It's just one deity,

68
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,700
and there are four of us.

69
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,940
We'll wrap this up fast.

70
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,580
Who said there was only one deity

71
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,460
in the Ancient Tower?

72
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,380
Isn't it just one?

73
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,340
It's four.

74
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,220
Four?

75
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,620
The Four Sacred Deities
of Luhua Ancient Tower:

76
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,500
Wind, Flower, Snow, and Moon.

77
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,380
Those names are rather poetic.

78
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,740
Don't be fooled by the names.

79
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,900
They're just a facade.

80
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,580
If the Ancient Tower were a fortress,

81
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,620
they'd be the lords

82
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,220
of their territories.

83
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,140
Some say

84
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,220
they're unworldly

85
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,300
and others claim they're ruthless,

86
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,460
showing no mercy to outsiders

87
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,620
and killing them indiscriminately.

88
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,540
But those are just rumors.

89
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,780
The truth

90
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,860
remains unknown.

91
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,580
So let's not dwell on that for now.

92
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,700
Our priority
is to find the Ancient Tower.

93
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,700
We need to hurry

94
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,460
and get there before it appears.

95
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,380
Let's go.

96
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,820
Longdou,

97
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,460
I've been waiting here
for quite some time.

98
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,020
If you still hadn't come,

99
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,700
I'd think you were planning

100
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,500
to enter the Ancient Tower empty-handed.

101
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,940
This is the most critical part

102
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,140
of our plan.

103
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,700
Everything's in place.

104
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,900
Chengfeng,

105
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,620
it's time to pass the item to me.

106
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,020
This divine pearl is an ancient artifact

107
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,300
that's hard to come by.

108
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,300
Please

109
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,460
handle it carefully.

110
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,580
Rest assured.

111
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,580
I will live up

112
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,380
to your expectations.

113
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,220
Okay,

114
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,780
I'll stay here in Reincarnation City,

115
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,700
waiting for your return
with the divine power.

116
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:54,940
However,

117
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,820
is it sufficient to only bring

118
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,140
Iron Pawn?

119
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,060
Given the formidable abilities
of the Dragon Calvary General,

120
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,620
one is more than enough.

121
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,020
Besides,

122
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,500
I have other key forces prepared

123
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,820
for tackling the Four Lords.

124
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,300
I almost forgot

125
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,140
that you already have

126
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,140
your secret weapon, Cao Yanbing.

127
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,580
It seems I worried for nothing.

128
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,180
But I wonder

129
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,140
if Xuanma

130
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,020
would return with you?

131
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,060
Are you unwilling to say goodbye to her?

132
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,620
I do

133
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,260
quite like

134
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,380
this charming little fox.

135
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,500
That depends
on whether she can make the right call.

136
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:38,820
Iron Pawn,

137
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:39,860
let's go.

138
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,860
Night has fallen.

139
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,580
This won't do.

140
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,620
We need to move faster.

141
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
We have to find the ancient tree

142
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,620
before the moon rises.

143
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,820
Fengzha,

144
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,820
is it essential

145
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,580
to use your method

146
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,380
for dispelling

147
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,700
the illusion

148
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,420
precisely at the moonrise?

149
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,420
That would be ideal.

150
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,820
Oh, no.

151
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,460
This is a sign that the Ancient Tower
is about to appear.

152
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,420
We're running out of time.

153
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,340
Let's speed up.

154
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,100
This is the place.

155
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,540
What do we do next?

156
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,460
Wind,

157
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,380
Flower,

158
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,300
Snow,

159
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,100
and Moon.

160
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,420
Come on.

161
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,180
Let's go inside.

162
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,340
Are you sure you want to go in?

163
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,500
What do you mean?

164
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,140
The power of the four deities
within this Ancient Tower

165
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,220
is beyond

166
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,500
what you can imagine.

167
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,140
Even my mother couldn't make it

168
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,100
out of there back then.

169
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,060
If you're having second thoughts now,

170
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,580
there's still time.

171
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,260
What are you trying to say?

172
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,380
Are you indicating

173
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,820
that you're starting to regret it?

174
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,820
Of course not.

175
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,180
No matter what, I am going

176
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,020
into this Ancient Tower.

177
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,780
That's settled then.

178
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:37,860
Cao Yanbing,

179
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,180
we all have

180
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,460
just as many reasons as you do

181
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,380
to enter the Luhua Ancient Tower.

182
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,100
So,

183
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,100
no matter how dangerous it is inside,

184
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,860
we'll face it together.

185
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,580
Exactly.

186
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,380
Don't even think
about going in there by yourself.

187
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,740
All right, quit with the chatter.

188
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,340
I don't know

189
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,460
how long the Ancient Tower
will be around.

190
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,620
Let's go now.

191
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:58,780
Let's go.

192
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,300
The plan is going smoothly.

193
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:18,980
Xuanma,

194
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,500
don't forget your task.

195
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,060
Yes, Chief.

196
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,980
Having spent ten years
sharpening this sword,

197
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,780
it's time to put it to the test.

198
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,060
Why is this place

199
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,100
so different from what I imagined?

200
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,140
It's practically empty
and has nothing in it.

201
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,660
Strictly speaking,

202
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,300
this ancient tower is only for display.

203
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,340
It's the entrance

204
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,580
to the territories
of Wind, Flower, Snow, and Moon.

205
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,380
What stands out most here

206
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,180
is this statue.

207
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,980
Its pose appears

208
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,940
to be demanding something.

209
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,380
This is the Fortress Guardian Statue.

210
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,260
It will only activate

211
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,140
if a divine weapon

212
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,300
of the same level as the spellcaster

213
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,940
is placed here.

214
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,940
Divine weapon?

215
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,380
Will my Sevenfold Soul-Resonance Bell
work?

216
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,420
It probably doesn't need two balls,
does it?

217
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,700
An ancient divine weapon, huh?

218
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,100
I wonder if my King of Ten Halls

219
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,500
meets that criterion.

220
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,780
Let's go.

221
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:36,970
[Kingdom of Snow]

222
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,220
Cao Yanbing.

223
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,900
You're finally awake.

224
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,340
How come you're here?

225
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,620
Where are we?

226
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,580
I fell here with you.

227
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,060
It's all snow here.

228
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,620
It must be the Snow Lord's territory.

229
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,940
The Snow Lord's territory?

230
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,060
Where are Beiluo and Fengzha?

231
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,380
I'm not sure either.

232
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,180
They are probably

233
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,100
not here with us.

234
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,820
It's freezing.

235
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,700
Of course, you are freezing.

236
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,220
You've been lying here
for quite a while.

237
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,460
Come with me now.

238
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,460
I've found a place

239
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,580
where we could escape the snow.

240
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,260
How... How do you know?

241
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,660
I kept calling you earlier,

242
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,300
but you didn't respond.

243
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,380
I was worried

244
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,060
that we might freeze to death here,

245
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,540
so I searched around

246
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,220
and found a cave

247
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,540
where we can escape the wind
and stay warm.

248
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,460
A cave?

249
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,140
We should get going quickly.

250
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,780
If the wind gets stronger,
we won't be able to get out of here.

251
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,340
Okay.

252
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,460
Let's go.

253
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,500
Let's go.

254
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,860
What's the matter?

255
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,580
I just can't keep going.

256
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,100
It's unbearably cold,

257
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,940
and my legs are frozen stiff.

258
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,140
I'm the same.

259
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,860
The snow and wind are too intense.

260
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,900
We can't see the road at all.

261
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,180
We can't continue like this.

262
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,020
Xu Chu.

263
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,980
Xu Chu,

264
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,020
this Fire Wheel...

265
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,700
My Lord,

266
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,580
I've infused

267
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,060
all my strength

268
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,780
into this Fire Wheel.

269
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,060
It can maintain warmth

270
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,980
and prevent us from freezing

271
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,660
until it's completely burned out.

272
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,620
Have you considered

273
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,820
the consequences of doing this?

274
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,340
If you die, My Lord,

275
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,180
my remaining Primordial Spirit Power
would be of no use.

276
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,940
Please allow me to pave the way for you.

277
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,100
Xia Ling.

278
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,980
Cao Yanbing.

279
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,700
Mr. Beiluo.

280
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,420
The Moon Palace?

281
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,900
This is an unfinished game.

282
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,380
Do you like playing Xiangqi too?

283
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,540
You...

284
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,660
You...

285
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,340
Who are you?

286
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,180
Is this Xiangqi set yours?

287
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,100
Are you from the Ancient Tower then?

288
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,940
Have you seen my sister?

289
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,980
Her name is Yan Qiaoqiao.

290
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,820
Kid,

291
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,780
so you want to ask me questions, huh?

292
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,540
Do you know where she went?

293
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,220
It's easy.

294
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,500
If you can beat me

295
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,020
in a Xiangqi game,

296
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,820
I'll give you the answer.

297
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,300
Do you promise?

298
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,900
You can refuse if you want to.

299
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,180
It's just a game of Xiangqi.

300
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,700
I know how to play it.

301
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,620
Let's have a game.

302
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,620
[City of the Wind]

303
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,820
Why is there no one around?

304
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:56,500
I wonder

305
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,700
whose territory this is.

306
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,020
Where could Xia Ling

307
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,380
and Cao Yanbing be?

308
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,340
Miss.

309
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,660
Excuse me.

310
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:20,900
Excuse me.

311
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,900
You don't need to be afraid.

312
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,860
I'm not a bad person.

313
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,740
I...

314
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,100
You are...

315
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:34,940
Watch out!

316
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,580
Great.

317
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,740
Another human.

318
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,300
Once I eliminate

319
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,580
these two incompetent servants,

320
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,020
I'll have a new servant

321
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,700
to replace them.

322
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,740
Did you do this to them?

323
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,500
Who are you?

324
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,940
Are you the ruler here?

325
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,020
If you want to see Master,

326
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,940
it's quite easy.

327
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,700
Once I capture you to be a servant,

328
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,180
ruin your appearance,

329
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,500
strip away your ability to speak

330
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,260
and curse you with immortality,

331
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,100
you'll see her.

332
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,380
You'll become
the Wind Lord's slave for eternity,

333
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,860
and that will be your ultimate destiny.

334
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,420
Shi Lingming!

335
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,860
Shi Lingming,

336
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,580
take her down.

337
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,580
Xia Ling,

338
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,100
where is the cave you mentioned?

339
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,820
We've been walking for so long.

340
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,660
Why haven't we arrived yet?

341
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,020
I don't know either.

342
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,220
I found it quickly

343
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,140
after leaving that place earlier.

344
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,180
I'm not sure

345
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,140
why it's taking so long
to find it this time.

346
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,100
That must be the Snow Lord's trick then.

347
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,660
You've done a great job, Xu Chu.

348
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,340
I'll come back to get you later.

349
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,180
Xia Ling.

350
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,580
Xia Ling.

351
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,260
Xia Ling,

352
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,940
how are you holding up?

353
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,980
I'm sorry,

354
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,620
but I simply can't go any further.

355
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,380
Don't worry about me.

356
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,740
Just go on without me.

357
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,020
But you must stay alive.

358
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,260
What nonsense are you talking about?

359
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,100
There's no way I'd walk away

360
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,180
and leave you here alone.

361
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,340
Don't underestimate this snowfield.

362
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,460
Staying here too long

363
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,340
could be fatal.

364
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,260
Save your energy now

365
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,020
and don't talk much.

366
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,140
I'll carry you.

367
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,180
Come on.

368
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,180
Dianwei!

369
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,380
Yes, My Lord.

370
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,860
Clear the wind and snow,

371
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,380
and lead the way for me.

372
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,580
As you command, My Lord.

373
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,100
Kid.

374
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,060
You've lost.

375
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,500
All right.

376
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,900
I admit

377
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,220
my skills are lacking.

378
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,220
Farewell.

379
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,060
Kid.

380
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,180
You're not thinking

381
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,100
that winning the game earns you a reward

382
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,700
while losing has no cost, are you?

383
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,740
What do you mean?

384
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,060
According to the rules,

385
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,380
anyone who loses the game

386
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,820
will be turned into stone by me.

387
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,380
Turned into stone?

388
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,380
So you are the Moon Lord?

389
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,100
[Moon Lord,
one of the Four Sacred Deities]

390
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,340
Very clever.

391
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,820
A smart child

392
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,580
should stick to the rules tightly,

393
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,580
don't you think?

394
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,420
Then I'll show you

395
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,260
my rules.

396
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,260
Moonshadow Strike!

397
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,580
Fascinating.

398
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,380
Have a taste of this.

399
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,300
[Special Fusion: Fengzha and Feilian]

400
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,460
Special Fusion?

401
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,340
Unfortunately,

402
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,020
it's not enough to hurt me.

403
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,100
Quit talking

404
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,060
and just tell me

405
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,260
where my sister is.

406
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,380
Kid,

407
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,380
you're quite interesting,

408
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,220
but since you've lost the game,

409
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,300
you have to turn into stone.

410
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,460
As for your sister,

411
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,260
she's no longer human.

412
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,260
She's been reborn

413
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,820
into someone completely different.

414
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,140
Release me,

415
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,340
you jerk.

416
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,220
Did you even consider
the consequences of your actions?

417
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,220
Offending me means
making an enemy of the Wind Lord.

418
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,380
You'll be annihilated.

419
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,860
Is that so?

420
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,340
In that case,

421
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,020
summon the Wind Lord

422
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,820
you mentioned.

423
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,220
I have some questions for her.

424
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,820
Who is it that wants to see me?

425
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,700
[Wind Lord,
one of the Four Sacred Deities]

426
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,500
Yan Qiaoqiao.

427
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,020
How come she is...

428
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,220
Master,

429
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,420
this person is incredibly audacious

430
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,300
and disrespectful.

431
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,980
You should teach him a proper lesson.

432
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,700
Pathetic!

433
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,260
It's truly disgraceful

434
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,420
to be so thoroughly defeated by a human

435
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,740
who trespassed into the Ancient Tower.

436
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,460
Are you the Wind Lord?

437
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,260
Was it you

438
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,980
who arrogantly demanded

439
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,020
to see me earlier?

440
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,700
Since you are the Wind Lord,

441
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,300
you must know

442
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,660
the location of Penglai
in the Ancient Tower.

443
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,860
So you are here to look for Penglai.

444
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,340
That's right.

445
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,460
As long as you tell me

446
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,380
where Penglai is,

447
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,540
I'll leave immediately.

448
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,940
You want to go there?

449
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,180
I can give you a ride.

450
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,260
That's not necessary.

451
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,060
Just give me the approximate direction,

452
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:35,500
and I...

453
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,940
This is not for you to decide.

454
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,260
Are you okay?

455
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,980
I'm fine.

456
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,020
It's just

457
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,140
that all my Guardian Primordial Spirits
are frozen,

458
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,300
and I can't feel my feet anymore.

459
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,460
You should just give up,

460
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,100
or you'll end up dead too.

461
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,060
No,

462
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,900
there's no way

463
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,780
I'd give up here.

464
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,660
I mustn't quit halfway.

465
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,340
Maybe...

466
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,020
Maybe the cave is right up ahead.

Cao Yanbing.

479
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,140
You're too easy to fool.

480
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,660
There was never any cave.

481
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,940
But thank you

482
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,780
for playing along

483

in this survival act.

484
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,220
I enjoyed it,

485
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,340
but too bad,

486
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,100
it looks like this game

487
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,780
is coming to an end.

488
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,100
How come you're not completely frozen?

489
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,500
Don't underestimate me.

490
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,740
I have Primordial Spirit Power too.

491
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:54,860
Now, tell me

492
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,620
who you are,

493
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,060
and why you are pretending
to be Xia Ling.

494
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,100
When did you start to realize

495
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,420
that I'm not the real Xia Ling?

496
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,500
Very early on,

497
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,380
back when you told me

498
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,220
to leave you alone

499
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,740
and go on ahead by myself.

500
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,260
Don't worry about me.

501
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,580
Just go on without me.

502
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,620
When I heard those words,

503
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,460
I immediately sensed something was off.

504
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,780
I know Xia Ling too well.

505
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,940
In such a situation,

506
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,780
she would likely call for Li Xuanyuan

507
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,700
or say something

508
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,980
like "Cao Yanbing, I believe in you,

509
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,140
you can do it."

510
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,500
But she would never tell me

511
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,660
to go on alone

512
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,140
and to stay alive.

513
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,420
So,

514
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,340
if you're going to deceive someone,

515
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,620
you should at least do your homework

516
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,860
and not be overconfident

517
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,980
in your acting.

518
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,420
Now, tell me,

519
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,900
where is Xia Ling?

520
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,500
So you sacrificed

521
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,700
your Guardian Primordial Spirit

522
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,700
to help me stage this act

523
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,500
all for that little girl.

524
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,020
Interesting.

525
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,980
Quite interesting indeed.

526
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,420
But it's a pity that it's too late.

527
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,460
From the moment you arrived here,

528
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,380
it was already destined

529
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,140
that you would die here.

530
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,140
