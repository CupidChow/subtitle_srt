[Episode 22]

18
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,300
I remember you.

19
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,660
A decade ago, you took people into

20
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,020
my Moon Palace uninvited.

21
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,460
Unfortunately,

22
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,900
apart from yourself,

23
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,460
who managed to escape by chance,

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,060
the entire force was wiped out.

25
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,660
I'm just a mere human,

26
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,100
yet you still think of me.

27
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,500
I'm very grateful.

28
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,700
Enough talk.

29
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,180
The fact that you dare

30
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,980
to show up in front of me

31
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,860
means you must be tired of living.

32
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,380
Let me correct something.

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,820
I'm here

34
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,620
simply because I resolved

35
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,740
the challenges you set

36
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,220
and am continuing
with the unfinished plan.

37
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,260
How arrogant!

38
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,860
This time, your people

39
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,900
will face the same fate as last time,

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,500
but unlike before,

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,060
you won't get another chance

42
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,860
to escape.

43
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,940
Moon Lord,

44
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,180
don't speak too soon.

The team I've sent this time

46
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,980
is quite different from the past.

47
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,060
Why don't we

48
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,380
have a few rounds

50
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,180
and see what happens?

51
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,500
Why should I wait

52
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,500
instead of turning you into stone

53
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,740
at this very moment?

54
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,140
I, too, enjoy Xiangqi

55
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,140
and know the feeling of playing alone.

56
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,260
It must be quite lonely to be a deity,

57
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,620
wouldn't you agree?

58
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,660
Be warned.

59
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,820
Don't attempt to pry into my thoughts.

60

Don't be so distant.

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,500
we met,

63
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,900
you praised my Xiangqi skills

64
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,460
and said I was a good opponent.

65
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,940
What's the matter?

66
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,860
Is it that even a grand deity like you

67
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,060
is afraid to play

68
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,460
a game of Xiangqi

69
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,540
with a mere human like me?

70
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,500
Interesting.

71
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,900
You're indeed different

72
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,180
from other humans.

73
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,420
All right,

74
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,020
I'll play a game of Xiangqi with you.

75
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,460
But if you lose...

76
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,980
I know the rules.

77
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,780
You'll turn me
into a stone statue if I lose.

79
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,500

this girl,

91
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,060
but even if I took on

92
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,900
her appearance,

93
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,580
I couldn't make you

94
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,860
play out the scene I want to see.

95
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,820
Hence, her existence

96
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,380
is pointless.

97
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,940
How is that possible?

98
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,260
How could ordinary flames

99
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,820
possibly do that?

100
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,260

How is this possible?

105
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,180
I'm not angry,

106
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,260
nor do I have any killing intent.

107
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,380
Why can I hear you talking?

108
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,740
How are you able

109
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,420
to control my body?

110
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,060
Kid,

111
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,620
why don't you have a guess?

112
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,820
You jerk,

113
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,940
who exactly are you?

114

the aura of the Demon Lord

116

117
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,420
of his power?

118
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,060

What are you trying to do?

122
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:57,980
I don't care

123
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,100
how you're able to control my body.

124
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,260
Get out right now.

125
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,020
I'm afraid that's not up to you.

127
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,100

00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,300
wake up, please.

130
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,460

Cao Yanbing,

132
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,420
what happened to you?

133
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,260
No time to explain.

134
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,980
The demonic form
has taken control of me.

135
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,580
Hurry and use
the Sevenfold Soul-Resonance Bell.

136
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,180
Sevenfold Soul-Resonance Bell.

137
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,260
In the boundless nether world,
amidst the layers of Vajra mountains,

138
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,780
the boundless light of the sacred jewel,
pierces through the flames of torment.

152
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,580
Do you think that suppressing me

153
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,780
will solve everything?

154
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,060
Let me remind you.

155
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,380
To save your mother,

156
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,260
you'll need to defeat

157
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,140
not only the Snow Lord
but also the remaining three Lords.

158
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,260
This isn't something you,

159
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,140
a mere human,

160
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,060
can accomplish alone.

161
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,060
Sooner or later,
you'll have to work with me.

162
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,020
I'll never let you get your way.

163
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,140
Never!

164
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,300
Cao Yanbing,

165
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,460
how are you feeling?

166
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,460
What exactly happened?

167
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,780
Why did the demonic form appear?

168
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,820
I'm not sure either.

169
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,020
The old geezer was acting
super weird this time,

170
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,340
as if he'd unlocked
some kind of restriction

171
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,580
and become reckless.

172
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,980
Maybe

173
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,380
it has something to do
with this Ancient Tower.

174
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,300
Foolish human,

175
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,420
do you think
offering yourself to the Demon Lord

176
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,580
will grant you power

177
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,620
and immortality?

178
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,340
Wishful thinking!

179
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,580
Even if I fall,

180
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,420
the Moon Lord and Wind Lord

181
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,380
are still waiting for you.

182
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,460
They will avenge me.

183
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,620
You and your master will never succeed!

184
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,100
What nonsense are you spouting?

185
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,980
Don't lump me in

186
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,660
with that old geezer.

187
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,220
Answer me.

188
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,900
Where are the people
who were turned to stone

189
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,220
after entering the Luhua Ancient Tower

190
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,940
ten years ago?

191
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,100
The people who were turned to stone?

192
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,540
You're not working for the Demon Lord?

193
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,180
Stop wasting time.

194
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,260
Just tell me.

195
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,100
Those who were turned to stone

196
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,660
are in the Moon Lord's territory,

197
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:38,860
the Moon Palace.

198
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,100
The Moon Palace?

199
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,860
How do we get there?

200
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,580
It's not hard to get to,

201
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,100
but you can't do it by yourself.

202
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,980
Only the four of us Lords

203
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,060
can open the barrier passage

204
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,900
between the four territories.

205
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,300
That's easy.

206
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,500
You take us there.

207
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,340
If you don't want to die,

208
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,060
open the passage quickly

209
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,020
and take us there.

210
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,580
Then close your eyes first.

211
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,180
Neither of us

212
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,140
can win this round.

213
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,780
Shall we just settle for a draw?

214
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,780
What do you think, Moon Lord?

215
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,860
That Snow Lord is so useless.

216
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,620
It seems

217
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,420
that while neither of us could win

218
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,700
the Xiangqi game,

219
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,940
in reality,

220
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,420
I've won a round.

221
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,940
Although the Snow Lord lost,

222
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,260
she sent them

223
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,740
to the Poisonous Miasma Flower Valley,

224
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,260
where survival is nearly impossible.

225
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,060
They have no way out.

226
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,580
I told you before

227
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,420
that the people I sent this time

228
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,420
are no ordinary individuals.

229
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,820
Since we haven't determined

230
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,900
a winner yet,

231
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,660
why speak so soon?

232
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,180
How about we start over

233
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,020
and play another round?

234
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,940
You want to be turned to stone
by the Moon Lord?

235
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,020
That's too quick a death.

236
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,060
To avenge the humiliation
you've caused me,

237
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,340
I must send you to the Flower Valley

238
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,140
to experience despair

239
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,380
and die in agony

240
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,020
before my anger is appeased.

241
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,580
Since you are the Wind Lord,

242
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,700
you must know

243
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,660
the location of Penglai
in the Ancient Tower.

244
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,340
I can give you a ride.

245
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,860
- It's him!
- It's him!

246
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,140
- It's him!
- It's him!

247
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,140
Please calm down

248
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,020
and let him explain.

249
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,180
He has his reasons.

250
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,220
No need to explain. It's him!

251
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,460
Can you all give me a moment to explain?

252
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:23,980
Please.

253
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,020
Get lost!

254
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,340
Is this the Moon Palace?

255
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,140
It doesn't look like it.

256
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,820
Cao Yanbing, what's wrong?

257
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,660
This is bad. The air is toxic.

258
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,620
Cao Yanbing, take this.

259
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,540
It's a pill from Li Xuanyuan

260
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
that can temporarily suppress
the poison.

261
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,620
Take it now.

262
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:32,660
It seems this

263
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,580
isn't the Moon Palace.

264
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,740
The Snow Lord does want to harm us.

265
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,180
What do we do then?

266
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,340
The Snow Lord mentioned

267
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,220
that only the Four Lords can open

268
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,300
the passage to the barrier.

269
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,300
If we want to leave here,

270
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,340
we need to find the lord here.

271
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,300
As well as Beiluo and Fengzha.

272
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,460
If they arrive

273
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,340
before us,

274
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,500
it could be very dangerous

275
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,540
without Li Xuanyuan's pills.

276
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,460
Let's hurry and search around.

277
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,260
Let's go.

278
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,140
Why does it seem like this place

279
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,060
is growing increasingly grim?

280
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,940
- It's him!
- It's him!

281
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,860
Look, there are people over there.

282
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,380
Please calm down and let him explain.

283
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,460
He has his reasons.

284
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,620
Can you all give me a moment to explain?

285
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,180
Please.

286
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,380
Get lost!

287
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,540
They've disappeared.

288
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,060
What's going on? This is so bizarre.

289
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,620
I don't know why,

290
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
but it feels like the sound of the flute

291
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,580
is guiding us.

292
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,300
We can't worry about that right now.

293
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,500
Let's go check it out.

294
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,900
It's like two entirely different worlds

295
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,620
inside and outside this cave.

296
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,420
Coa Yanbing.

297
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,020
Excuse me, sir.

298
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,060
We're a bit lost

299
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,340
while passing through this area.

300
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,020
Could you please tell us where we are?

301
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,540
This is the Flower Valley.

302
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,140
The Flower Valley?

303
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,100
Is this the territory
of the Flower Lord?

304
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,860
It is indeed.

305
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,700
May I ask who you are?

306
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,020
I'm Xiang.

307
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,780
I'm just a gardener

308
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,580
in this Flower Valley.

309
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,340
Do you know the Flower Lord?

310
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,980
We need to see him
for an important matter.

311
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,420
Can you let us know where he is?

312
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,060
Since you've come all this way,

313
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,660
why don't you join me for some tea

314
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,660
and talk things over
more comfortably?

315
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,380
Please come with me.

316
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,020
Beiluo.

317
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:01,980
Beiluo.

318
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,820
Beiluo.

319
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,700
Beiluo.

320
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,740
Beiluo.

321
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:05,740
Beiluo.

322
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,380
Wake up, Beiluo.

323
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,060
He's been poisoned by miasma.

324
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,900
Do you know him?

325
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,580
His name is Beiluo Shimen,

326
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,140
and he's our friend.

327
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,260
Did you save him?

328
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,460
Did you use the flute music

329
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,140
to guide us here to help us?

330
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,260
Given my current abilities,

331
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,340
I can only temporarily

332
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,660
suppress the toxin

333
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,260
and keep you alive.

334
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,740
From your appearance,

335
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,900
it seems you've found

336
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,460
some ways to control the poison.

337
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,660
However, unfortunately,

338
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,500
the miasma is incurable.

339
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,860
Unless

340
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,260
you leave the Flower Valley

341
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,180
within a limited time,

342
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,340
you will also succumb

343
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,420
to the poison.

344
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,980
Due to certain special reasons,

345
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,140
my range of activity is confined

346
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,380
to this small cave.

347
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,300
As you can see,

348
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,660
this is the only place

349
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,580
in the entire Flower Valley

350
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,820
that is free of poisonous miasma.

351
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,500
Mr. Xiang,

352
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,500
given that you reside
in the Flower Valley,

353
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,100
you must know how to get out.

354
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,140
Could you please tell us?

355
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,100
Even though I know, it won't help.

356
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,500
Why is that?

357
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,220
Don't you find it strange?

358
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,500
This place, which is supposed
to be the Flower Valley,

359
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,900
is overrun with withered grass,

360
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,540
filled with poisonous miasma,

361
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,300
and covered in thorns and vines.

362
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:25,900
That's because

363
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,300
what you're seeing today

364
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,660
is not the true Flower Valley

365
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,180
but rather its appearance

366
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,060
in the nightmare.

367
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,900
The nightmare?

368
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,020
Yes.

369
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,100
This whole nightmare
is an endless cycle,

370
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,340
boundless and infinite.

371
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,780
Since you fell into this Flower Valley,

372
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,460
you've been trapped within it,

373
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,060
unable to escape

374
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,020
or leave.

375
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,060
Have you seen

376
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,020
the flowers and plants in this cave?

377
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:57,900
This is the only area

378
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,420
that still somewhat

379
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,620
resembles the original Flower Valley.

380
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,820
But it won't be long

381
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,460
before this place

382
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,660
is also consumed

383
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,060
by the nightmare.

384
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,340
In other words,

385
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,460
the person we saw being killed

386
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,820
in the Flower Valley,

387
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,380
and those who appeared

388
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,300
and then vanished suddenly,

389
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,340
were also part of this nightmare?

390
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:24,860
That's right.

391
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,740
Since this is a nightmare,

392
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,980
if we find a way to break it,

393
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:29,820
won't we be able

394
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,660
to get out?

395
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,860
While breaking the nightmare

396
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,180
is the most straightforward solution,

397
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,140
it is incredibly difficult,

398
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
because this nightmare

399
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,500
was created
by the combined divine powers

400
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,660
of the Moon Lord, Wind Lord,

401
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,700
and Snow Lord.

402
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,180
Mr. Xiang,

403
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,980
is there

404
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,780
no other way

405
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,980
to break this nightmare?

406
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,540
Since it's a dream,

407
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,540
it must have an owner.

408
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,060
The only way

409
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,460
to break the nightmare

410
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,420
is to find the owner of the dream

411
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,460
and wake him up.

412
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,300
All I can do to help you

413
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,900
is to tell you the location

414
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,220
of the nightmare's owner right now.

415
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,220
That sounds easy enough.

416
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,340
Tell us where he is,

417
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,460
and we'll go find him now.

418
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,420
No, that's not it.

419
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,540
Your biggest challenge

420
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,460
lies in time.

421
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,340
Please calm down and let him explain.

422
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,460
The previous nightmare has ended,

423
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,620
and a new cycle is about to begin.

424
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,580
When this round of nightmares ends,

425
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,580
both you

426
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,580
and your friend

427
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,060
will die.

428
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,140
I get it now.

429
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,060
So we have a limited amount of time

430
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,500
and only one chance.

431
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,780
We have to seize it.

432
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,020
Soon,

433
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,540
the owner of the nightmare will appear

434
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,100
in the Yanluo Abyss
to the southeast of the Flower Valley.

435
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,540
You have only one chance,

436
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,620
so go now.

437
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:00,940
Also, there's one more thing

438
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,380
that you need to keep in mind.

439
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,780
No matter what you see

440
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,860
or hear,

441
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,220
you must not reveal

442
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,700
your identities or names.

443
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:08,900
Otherwise,

444
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,060
outsiders' intrusion

445
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,780
might create confusion in the nightmare,

446
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,700
making it even more uncontrollable.

447
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,460
All right,

448
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,220
got it.

449
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,340
I'll leave

450
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,700
our friend to you.

451
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,580
See you after we break the nightmare.

452
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,700
Good luck.

453
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,580
Let's go.

454
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,620
[Yanluo Abyss]
This should be the Yanluo Abyss.

455
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,460
Why is there no one around?

456
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,300
Mr. Xiang mentioned

457
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,220
that the owner of the nightmare

458
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,460
should appear here.

459
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,860
Have we arrived too late?

460
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,060
There's a way up over there.

461
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,340
Let's go take a look.

462
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,460
Let's go.

463
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,260
It's her,

464
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,380
the owner of the nightmare.

465
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,500
Xiao,

466
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,500
it's too dangerous for you to be here.

467
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,500
Xia,

468
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,660
you arrived just in time.

469
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,300
Let's get going.

470
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,500
- Mom.
- Dad.

471
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:48,780
Why

472
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,660
is my dad here?

473
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,740
Could he still be alive?

474
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,740
Is this dream

475
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,860
based on their experiences?

476
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,580
Is the owner of the nightmare

477
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,300
one of them?

478
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,220
I'm not sure either.

479
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,740
How about

480
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,860
we both go and check it out?

481
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,780
But

482
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,260
we can't reveal our identities

483
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:10,860
or names.

484
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:16,780
They probably

485
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,940
won't recognize us.

486
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,340
Let's go.

487
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,660
Generals,

488
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,660
have you also come to the Yanluo Abyss?

489
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,660
Sorry,

490
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,300
you look familiar,

491
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,820
but I can't quite recall your names.

492
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,940
Who are you?

493
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,820
We...

494
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,900
We are from the East District
of the Spiritual Crossroads.

495
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,940
They are friends of General Feng

496
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,020
from the East District,

497
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,460
the Spiritual Guardians of Tianyu Street

498
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,220
and Dongzhen Street.

499
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,820
Exactly.

500
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,020
Since you've long been stationed
in the North District's Rakshasa Street,

501
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,260
it's understandable
that you don't know us, General Tang.

502
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,500
Do you know me?

503
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,580
Your fame is well-known

504
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:25,900
and resounding, General Tang.

505
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,460
Even at a time like this,

506
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,340
you still have the mood to joke.

507
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,460
You have some guts,

508
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,180
young man.

509
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,620
You two

510
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,980
are also here
looking for an exit, aren't you?

511
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:46,940
There's no need to search any further.

512
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,500
I've checked

513
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,580
and there's no way
out of the Flower Valley from here.

514
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,980
Let's try somewhere else.

515
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,220
We can't just wait here and do nothing.

516
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,660
Don't lose hope, Xia.

517
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,580
Longdou isn't trapped
in the Flower Valley.

518
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,660
He's probably also trying

519
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,300
to find a way to rescue us.

520
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:03,980
Just hang in there a bit longer.

521
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:06,860
No,

522
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,700
he won't come to rescue us.

523
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,300
What is that supposed to mean?

524
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,940
It pains me

525
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,860
to say this,

526
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,340
but I have to.

527
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,220
Huangfu Longdou

528
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,140
deceived us.

529
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,220
Under the guise of justice,

530
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
he gathered everyone
to enter the Luhua Ancient Tower,

531
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,180
claiming it was to seize

532
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,180
the divine power of Penglai

533
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,940
to purify the Malevolent Beings.

534
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,660
In reality,

535
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,460
it was all a lie.

536
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,180
From the beginning,

537
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,700
he intended for everyone

538
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,220
to be cannon fodder and die,

539
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,620
so he could claim

540
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,860
the divine power for himself.

541
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,780
How did you find out

542
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,740
about this?

543
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,020
On the day before our departure,

544
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,380
I went to see Huangfu Longdou

545
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,780
and accidentally overheard it.

546
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,540
From the limited information we have,

547
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,100
the Four Lords
of the Ancient Tower's secret realm

548
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,340
are all ancient beasts.

549
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,660
To defeat them and open Penglai,

550
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,180
it's likely that more than half

551
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,100
of the people you bring will be lost.

552
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,140
If we can achieve our goal,

553
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,260
even if I have to lose all of them,

554
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,420
it will be worth it.

555
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,060
Who's there?

556
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,700
I was planning to tell everyone,

557
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:54,940
but

558
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,420
by the time I arrived,

559
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
you had already entered
the Ancient Tower.

560
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,420
Xia,

561
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,740
no matter what,

562
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,540
you chose to follow us
into the Ancient Tower

563
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,500
and stand by our side.

564
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,980
I'll ignore

565
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,660
what I just heard.

566
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:06,820
Let's go.

567
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,460
You might be able to overlook it,

568
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,580
but how could I possibly act

569
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,860
like it never happened?

570
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,660
How could I possibly act

571
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,780
like it never happened?

572
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,540
Cao Yanbing,

573
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,820
I feel like my dad
is acting very strangely.

574
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,340
That makes sense.

575
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,460
It seems your dad

576
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,020
is the owner of the nightmare.

577
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,100
My dad?

578
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,820
I'll go calm him down right away.

579
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,860
He's disappeared.

580
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,060
What should we do?

581
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,820
Dreams are always fragmented.

582
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,020
They must have gone

583
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,780
to the next layer of the dream.

584
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,100
The next layer of the dream?

585
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,900
But Mr. Xiang said

586
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,380
that if this layer of the dream ends,

587
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,500
we will succumb to the poison and die.

588
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,380
How could we possibly move on

589
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,380
to the next layer?

590
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,100
Xia Ling, keep your composure.

591
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,380
Right now, you're the only one

592
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,420
who can awaken your dad.

593
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,780
Me?

594
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,780
How am I supposed to awaken him?

595
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,660
He's currently trapped

596
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,980
in the feelings of grim death.

597
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,220
You need to help him
regain a sense of hope.

598
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,100
Did you just mention

599
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,180
the feelings of grim death?

600
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,700
Remember

601
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,900
when we first arrived
at the Flower Valley,

602
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,300
a man was pushed off a cliff?

603
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,660
Could he be...

604
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,660
That must be the case.

605
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,980
The events at that place

606
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,860
happened later
than what's happening here.

607
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,940
In other words,

608
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,140
if we wake him

609
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,020
before he's pushed

610
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,820
off the cliff,

611
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,140
we might be able to end the nightmare.

612
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:52,820
General Xia,

613
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
you're holding a signal flare.

614
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,820
Are you planning
to call all your companions over

615
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,220
and confess to them?

616
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,780
General Xia,

617
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,460
why are you being so hard on yourself?

618
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,180
Huangfu Longdou is the one to blame.

619
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,860
He's the real culprit.

620
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,380
You're a kind person,

621
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,460
Miss.

622
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,140
Even though your own life

623
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,420
is in danger,

624
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,740
you're still trying to defend me.

625
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
This matter

626
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,220
started because of Huangfu Longdou,

627
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,380
but it was me

628
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,100
who secretly gathered

629
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,020
everyone

630
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,660
for this mission.

631
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,980
If it weren't for me,

632
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,540
they wouldn't have come here to die.

633
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,660
General Xia,

634
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,700
even if you didn't do it,

635
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,860
Huangfu Longdou

636
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,780
would still find someone else to do it.

637
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,340
But the fact

638
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,180
is that I'm the one who did it.

639
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,340
I can only

640
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,260
atone with my death.

641
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:01,860
It's okay,

642
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,420
you can take your time to think.

643
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,060
The only issue

644
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,180
is that you might not
have much time left.

645
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,500
Cao Yanbing.

646
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,020
You might escape it all

647
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,540
by dying,

648
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,100
but have you thought about your family?

649
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,900
They'll just keep missing you

650
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,700
and worrying about you.

651
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,740
My father

652
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,540
passed away ten years ago.

653
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,260
He has no idea

654
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,780
how much I've missed him,

655
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,260
how much I've longed

656
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,300
for him to come back to life

657
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,820
and spend time with me.

658
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,260
I...

659
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,620
My dad was so foolish.

660
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,620
He didn't even realize

661
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,660
what he missed out on.

662
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,500
But you're even more foolish.

663
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,180
You have a daughter

664
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,340
waiting for you at home,

665
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,260
and instead of trying your best

666
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,100
to get everyone out,

667
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,580
how could you even think of dying?

668
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,220
Did I also

669
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,660
make a mistake?

670
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,900
General Xia,

671
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,060
everyone makes mistakes in their life.

672
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,460
But if you decide

673
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,780
to end your life

674
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,340
over one mistake,

675
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,060
you'll lose everything.

676
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,500
Think about yourself,

677
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,980
and think about how much

678
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,820
your family misses you.

679
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,380
Family...

680
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,460
Wow, that's amazing!

681
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,100
