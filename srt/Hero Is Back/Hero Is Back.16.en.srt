[Episode 16]

18
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,300
Since General Tianyue

19
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,700
has remembered Beiluo,

20
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,020
does that mean he has also recalled

21
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,740
other things in the past?

22
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,020
Miss Xia, I understand

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,700
that you want to inquire
about the guide.

24
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,100
I'll take you

25
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,780
to see my brother soon,

26
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,900
so you can ask him directly.

27
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,700
I hope his answers

28
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,260
will ease your concerns

29
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,500

He's dead.

52
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,340
You did it.

53
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,300
Don't get the wrong idea.

54
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,700
I didn't do this.

55
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,180
My brother

56
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,180
clearly died at your feet.

57
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,180
If you didn't do it, then who did?

00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,380
I have no idea,

59
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,660
but I swear it wasn't me.

60

Cao Yanbing,

61
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,220
I know

62
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,140
you're angry with me

63
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,340
for lying to you,

64
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,420
and I understand how desperate
you are to find your mother.

65
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,300
But if you have a problem,

66
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,220
just come at me.

67
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,380
Why did you harm

68
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,340
my innocent brother?

69
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,660
Why would I kill him?

70
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,500
I had so many questions
I wanted to ask him.

71
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,140
It was him.

72
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,180
He was the one
who wanted to kill me.

73
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,780
My brother didn't even know you.

74
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,940
Why would he try to kill you?

75
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,060
But the fact is,

76
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,820
when I went into the room to see him,

77
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,380
he suddenly rushed out and attacked me.

78
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,180
So you decided to kill him

79
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,940
just because he attacked you?

80
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,740
My brother is sick.

81
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,740
He didn't mean it.

82
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,340
So I never fought back

83
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,580
and I kept dodging.

84
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,980
You could destroy an entire city

85
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,980

against my brother

88
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,860
means you showed mercy, right?

89
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,500
Yan Lingyu,
why are you speaking this way?

90
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,300
I've been explaining things
to you calmly,

91
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,060
yet you keep calling me a murderer

92
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,380
and criticizing me harshly.

93
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,620
What are your true intentions?

94
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,460
What are my intentions?

95
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,460
What are yours then?

96
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,540
My brother died because of you,

97
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,900
and now you're turning the blame on me.

98
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,460
How is that fair?

99
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,100
Is it just because you

100
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,220
feel superior to me?

101
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,420
I'm sorry,

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,060

these strangers to you.

105
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,060
You haven't done

106
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,740
anything wrong to anyone.

107
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,860
The world is so unfair.

108
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,060
So unfair!

Don't listen to her.

113
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,980
I honestly didn't do it.

Lingyu,

115
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,060
try not to be too distressed.

116
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,380
Stop it!

117
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,580
If you hadn't brought

118
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,500
this monster here,

119
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,260
my brother wouldn't be dead.

120
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,780
Yan Lingyu,

121
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,660
don't push it too far!

122
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:53,980
What?

123
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,020
Killing my brother isn't enough.

124
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,540
Now you want to kill me too?

125
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,100
Is that it?

126
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,580
Fine!

127
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,180
If you want to do it,

128
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,300
then go ahead.

129
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,740
But remember,

130
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,540
people like you,

131
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,780
who are cruel, cold, and merciless,

132
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,420
will surely face retribution!

133
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,900
Beiluo,

134
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,420
step aside.

135
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,220
Cao Yanbing.

136
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,900
Stop now.

137
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,780
Don't keep going down the wrong path.

138
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,900
Keep going down the wrong path?

139
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,740
You also think

140
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,660
I killed Yan Tianyue,

141
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,180
and now you believe

142
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,100
I would kill this woman too,

143
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,740
don't you?

144
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,780
I want to believe you,

145
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,660
but I trust my own eyes more.

146
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,420
From the moment I walked in,

147
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,340
I saw Tianyue

148
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,340
lying at your feet,

149
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,660
and you were holding

150
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,020
the King of Ten Halls.

151
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,220
Great logic.

152
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,340
Just because I'm holding
the King of Ten Halls,

153
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,900
it makes me the killer?

154
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,380
Beiluo Shimen,

155
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,300
so in your eyes,

156
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,660
I'm just a lunatic,

157
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:23,820
a ruthless killer

158
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,420
with no mercy.

159
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,900
No wonder I blew up Yulin Street,

160
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,820
right?

161
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,460
Cao Yanbing,

162
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,900
I'm really grateful
for you saving me back then,

163
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,220
but...

164
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,740
Enough.

165
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,380
I don't want to lose my temper,

166
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,380
at least not right now.

167
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,340
Step aside.

168
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,420
I warned you.

169
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,940
If you dare harm anyone here,

170
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,980
I will never let you off.

171
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,900
I'll say it one more time.

172
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,300
Move aside.

173
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,460
You can't handle the consequences

174
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,740
of angering me.

175
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,380
Cao Yanbing,

176
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,940
I'm doing this to save you.

177
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,260
- I told you to stand down!
- I told you to stand down!

178
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,380
You old geezer,

179
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,420
who knew
that despite my effort to hold back,

180
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,780
you'd still find a loophole?

181
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,700
Yes, kid,

182
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,900
I didn't expect either

183
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,660
that we'd meet again

184
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,660
so soon.

185
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,140
But, of course,

186
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,780
who could stay calm

187
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,060
in such a situation?

188
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,500
If someone could, they'd be a saint.

189
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,740
What's the point of being a saint?

190
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,580
Admit it,

191
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,780
you should have listened to me long ago.

192
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,460
Cao Yanbing,

193
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,220
who are you talking to?

194
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,340
My demonic form.

195
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,580
What?

196
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,060
He's right here.

197
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,060
The sudden changes

198
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,820
in my temperament before

199
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,300
were actually due to him.

200
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,820
So

201
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,980
when I told you not to provoke me,

202
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,780
it wasn't a warning

203
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,900
but advice.

204
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,860
I'm actually trying to save you.

205
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,820
Shi Lingming!

206
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,050
[Shi Lingming]

207
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,860
You've made me do this.

208
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,300
Xu Chu!

209
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,150
[Xu Chu]

210
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,860
Don't fight.

211
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,540
This won't resolve the problem.

212
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,580
My Lord,

213
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,900
what are your instructions?

214
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:11,940
Beiluo,

215
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,740
it's better to talk things over

216
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,460
when friends have misunderstandings.

217
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:16,860
Shi Lingming,

218
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,660
he is under the control
of the demonic form

219
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,460
and no longer
the Cao Yanbing you know.

220
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,940
You've figured it out.

221
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,980
That fool Cao Yanbing

222
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,180
only stands in my way

223
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,340
and prevents me
from blowing up Lingfeng Street.

224
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,780
He's so indecisive

225
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,820
and useless.

226
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,060
Shi Lingming,

227
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,420
did you hear that?

228
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,900
Why haven't you taken action yet?

229
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,100
General,

230
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,740
though I'm reluctant,

231
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,100
I won't go easy on you.

232
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,980
We both have our own allegiances.

233
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,820
Forgive me for any offense.

234
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,340
I've told you

235
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,940
to stop fighting!

236
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,860
Generals,

237
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,100
please calm down.

238
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,540
Li Xuanyuan,

239
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,460
step aside

240
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,460
or you might get hurt.

241
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,700
Cao Yanbing,

242
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,700
since you've admitted

243
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,820
that refusing me earlier was foolish,

244
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,940
summon

245
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,300
my power now,

246
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,940
and I'll make sure this monkey

247
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,100
can't move again.

248
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,740
Did you hear me?

249
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,060
Cao Yanbing,

250
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,580
my patience has limits.

251
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,060
Do you think this

252
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,340
means I'm out of options?

253
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,060
Don't forget,

254
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,340
your Guardian Primordial Spirit
is still fighting.

255
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,700
You jerk,

256
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,460
what are you plotting this time?

257
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,700
Your Guardian Primordial Spirit

258
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,100
is also a part of you,

259
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,580
and on the battlefield,

260
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,460
no warrior wants to lose.

261
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,300
Wait.

262
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,340
Cao Yanbing isn't controlled
by the demonic form.

263
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,220
Beiluo, stop immediately.

264
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,300
Xu Chu,

265
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,340
come back.

266
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,940
Shi Lingming,

267
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,700
come back.

268
00:11:59,460 --> 00:11:59,980
Li Xuanyuan.

269
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,420
Ya...

270
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,620
Ma...

271
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,860
Cease your pointless resistance

272
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,740
and yield to me.

273
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,260
Anger cannot be quelled
by suppression alone.

274
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,100
Shut up!

275
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:19,780
It will only cause you

276
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,140
more pain.

277
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,860
As long as your heart

278
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,740
isn't truly at peace,

279
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,220
the more you suppress

280
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,100
and hold back,

281
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,460
the more energy you'll waste.

282
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,940
You'll lose control

283
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,260
of your will,

284
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,260
leaving it dominated by me.

285
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,420
No one cares about the truth

286
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,820
or who you really are.

287
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,300
Even your friend

288
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,780
sees you as a monster

289
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,900
and want to eliminate you.

290
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,460
Why are you resisting it?

291
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,580
Who are you holding back for?

292
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,700
Release your anger

293
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,820
and let it burn.

294
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,140
Burn down

295
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,020
everything in front of you.

296
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:18,820
Lingyu,

297
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,100
I'm sorry.

298
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,700
I am the one who brought

299
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,460
Cao Yanbing to Lingfeng Street.

300
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,580
The mistakes he made

301
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,940
are my fault,

302
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,220
and I will take full responsibility.

303
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,260
Say no more, Beiluo.

304
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,180
I spent the night here

305
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,980
and have come to terms with it.

306
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,700
You have shown

307
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,540
true loyalty and sincerity

308
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,620
towards my brother.

309
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,580
After the incident,

310
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,660
you didn't blindly cover for

311
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,860
or protect Cao Yanbing.

312
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,180
You've done nothing wrong.

313
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,660
Last night,

314
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,180
I was overwhelmed with grief

315
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,540
and spoke out of turn.

316
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,220
I hope

317
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,980
you won't take it too seriously.

318
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,260
You don't blame me,

319
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,540
but I can't help but blame myself.

320
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,140
Lingyu,

321
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,860
I want to attend Tianyue's wake.

322
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,340
Please grant me permission.

323
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,900
I'm afraid I can't.

324
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,700
Are you still angry with me?

325
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,420
No, it's not that.

326
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,820
I refused the request

327
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,060
simply because

328
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,420
it's our custom
in the Wind-Treading Clan

329
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,900
that the deceased
should not be disturbed

330
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,340
on the first night after passing.

331
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,860
Since you have such customs,

332
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,900
I won't insist.

333
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,540
I'll visit the place Tianyue loved most

334
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,060
when he was alive

335
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,220
and regard it
as an alternative way to honor him.

336
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,740
I thank you on behalf of my brother.

337
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:57,900
General.

338
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,420
The mourning hall is ready,

339
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,340
and the body and coffin are in place.

340
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,740
Great job.

341
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,260
I was very pleased

342
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,780
with what you did last night.

343
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,340
Thank you, General.

344
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,740
It's my duty

345
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,740
to protect Lingfeng Street.

346
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,300
It was necessary

347
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,580
to confine you here

348
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,140
for all these years.

349
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,140
You deserved a swift end much sooner,

350
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,060
but the chance never came.

351
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,780
Now, the time has come.

352
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,420
Embrace your liberation.

353
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,620
Now,

354
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,740
you must assign people
to guard the General's Mansion

355
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,700
and make sure

356
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,700
no one approaches the mourning hall.

357
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,500
Understood.

358
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,260
By the way,

359
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,340
Elder Mei has woken up

360
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,420
and sent word

361
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,980
that there's something important
he needs to discuss with you.

362
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,660
Something important?

363
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,540
Everyone,

364
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,380
stay alert.

365
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,980
That darned Cao Yanbing

366
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,060
killed General Tianyue.

367
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,260
We'll leave no stone unturned
to catch him.

368
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,420
Let's split up and get moving.

369
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,140
Okay, you go over there.

370
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,300
The rest of you, follow me.

371
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:10,860
Hurry.

372
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,620
[Wanted poster: Cao Yanbing]

373
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,060
Cao Yanbing.

374
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,260
He is a wanted criminal
of the Hall of Heroes?

375
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,540
Look at what's written there.

376
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,820
He killed
the Spiritual Guardian of Yulin Street

377
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,900
and blew up the whole street.

378
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,860
He's a complete monster.

379
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,300
How unfortunate.

380
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,500
How did such a person

381
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,540
[Cao Yanbing, wanted for felony]
end up at Lingfeng Street?

382
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,100
I already brought back

383
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,220
the wanted poster,

384
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,860
but I was caught by the Fire-Eater King

385
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,460
and fell unconscious
for the past few days.

386
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,420
It seems that
the divine has forsaken Lingfeng Street.

387
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,100
On the contrary,

388
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:09,900
the divine

389
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,220
are protecting us.

390
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,980
The wanted poster arrived just in time.

391
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,860
Cao Yanbing

392
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,300
killed my brother

393
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,500
but has remained at large.

394
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,460
This will always be a hidden threat.

395
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,500
If we can let the Hall of Heroes

396
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,700
find and capture him,

397
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,860
it will be revenge for my brother.

398
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,300
Lingyu,

399
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,820
the dead cannot be brought back to life.

400
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,220
Don't grieve

401
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,980
or blame yourself

402
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,780
for Tianyue's fate.

403
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,700
Ultimately,

404
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,980
the misfortune was caused by the guide.

405
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,700
Yet, I understand more than anyone

406
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,540
why you couldn't surrender Fengzha.

407
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,380
That's right.

408
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,660
No matter who it is,

409
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,060
I will never allow them

410
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,060
to take Fengzha away.

411
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,540
The future of our Wind-Treading Clan

412
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,580
rests entirely on Fengzha.

413
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,780
I have already struggled

414
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,540
for five long years,

415
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,540
and now,

416
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,980
Fengzha is about to become
more powerful.

417
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,300
So right now,

418
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,860
I cannot allow anyone

419
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,740
to ruin it all.

420
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,820
Rest assured.

421
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,380
Except for you and me,

422
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,820
no one else in the street

423
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,140
knows where Fengzha is.

424
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,660
No one can take him away.

425
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,300
I've been searching all night.

426
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,780
When will I be able to go home?

427
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,420
Shut up

428
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,180
and follow the orders.

429
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,820
But I was supposed
to have a day off today.

430
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,220
I haven't had a break for ten days.

431
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,260
You brat!

432
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,060
Do you know

433
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,980
who died last night?

434
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,900
He was the previous Spiritual Guardian,

435
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,900
General Yan Tianyue.

436
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,100
General Tianyue

437
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,220
devoted himself entirely
to our Lingfeng Street.

438
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,220
You haven't even matured yet,

439
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,660
so how dare you complain?

440
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,780
I...

441
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,500
I'm still young

442
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,100
and not familiar

443
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,700
with General Tianyue.

444
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,220
Shut up

445
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,580
and keep a sharp eye out.

446
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,340
If you spot any man in red clothing,

447
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,580
notify us right away.

448
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,780
We must avenge General Tianyue.

449
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,420
Got it?

450
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,220
Is that person

451
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,980
the killer of the General?

452
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,260
Who is he?

453
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,860
And why did he kill General Tianyue?

454
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,380
Why are you talking so much?

455
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,740
Don't ask questions you shouldn't.

456
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,180
Thank you, Xia Ling.

457
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,660
You're awake.

458
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,380
How are you feeling?

459
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,220
Is there any discomfort?

460
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,700
I'm feeling pretty good.

461
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:31,980
How about you?

462
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,180
Forget about me.

463
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,340
I'm talking about you.

464
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,140
When I found you

465
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,060
last night,

466
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,180
you suddenly passed out

467
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,740
and were covered in black mist.

468
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,660
It really scared me.

469
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,420
Xia Ling,

470
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,540
have I ever told you

471
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,180
that the reason I am like this

472
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,980
is because my body...

473
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,620
Demonic aura.

474
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,860
You've told me before.

475
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
And I also know

476
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,460
that you've never been controlled
by the demonic form

477
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,660
On the contrary,

478
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,500
You've been fighting his dominion.

479
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,220
How did you find out?

480
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,300
It's obvious, all right?

481
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,220
Do you believe your deceit

482
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,980
is sophisticated?

483
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,180
Actually, it's really silly.

484
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
Why are you laughing all of a sudden?

485
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,020
I laugh because I'm indeed very silly,

486
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,100
but it's surprising that some people

487
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,100
actually take
such ridiculous statements seriously.

488
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,340
Cao Yanbing,

489
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,100
I'm not defending Beiluo,

490
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,700
but from what I saw yesterday,

491
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,060
it certainly looked like

492
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,580
you killed General Yan Tianyue.

493
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,900
But the truth

494
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,700
is that I encountered someone
on the street

495
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,180
who looked very much
like General Yan Tianyue.

496
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,260
So I followed him

497
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260
to his place,

498
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,460
intending to ask him

499
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,260
about Yan Fengzha.

500
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,260
However, as soon as I walked in,

501
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,380
he attacked me.

502
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,140
He was extremely agitated,

503
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,540
with blue eyes

504
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,020
and a ferocious fighting style

505
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,900
that was definitely not typical

506
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,940
of an ill person.

507
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:49,740
General Yan,

508
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,740
I don't fight with patients.

509
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,860
Let's talk this out.

510
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:14,900
General Yan,

511
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,860
if you keep this up,

512
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,660
I won't hold back.

513
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,300
I'm sorry, General Yan,

514
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,540
but if you promise
not to attack me again,

515
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,540
I'll let you go.

516
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,980
Did you say his eyes were blue?

517
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,140
Yes.

518
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,420
Do you remember

519
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,980
the day we first arrived
at Lingfeng Street?

520
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,500
We accidentally triggered a trap
and fell into it.

521
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,500
Yan Ruofu drank the Blaze Jade

522
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,740
to prepare for battle,

523
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,900
and her eyes...

524
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,900
Her eyes were also blue.

525
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:14,540
Exactly.

526
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,500
Her eyes

527
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,860
had a light blue glow.

528
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,460
If this is the case,

529
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,220
General Yan's death

530
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,420
is related to the Blaze Jade.

531
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,660
But that's odd,

532
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,940
given many have used

533
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,540
the Blaze Jade safely.

534
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,180
It seems this isn't the cause.

535
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,300
Yet, when you think about it,

536
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,460
this whole thing seems quite odd.

537
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,020
Isn't it too much of a coincidence?

538
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,620
I just happened to come across

539
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,460
Yan Tianyue on the street,

540
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,100
and right after

541
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,180
he collapses,

542
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,780
Yan Lingyu

543
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,820
brings you all in.

544
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,700
Even a perfectly timed delivery
isn't that accurate.

545
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,100
What you said makes sense,

546
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,060
but I'm not sure

547
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,900
where we should start our investigation.

548
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,100
It doesn't matter if you don't know.

549
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,100
What matters is that Yan Tianyue knows.

550
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,540
The dead are often the most honest.

551
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,580
Autopsy it is.

552
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,260
This is the Hall of Heroes' Office
of General Affairs.

553
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,180
Which street are you from? Who are you?

554
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,180
And what is your report about?

555
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,980
I am Yan Lingyu, the Spiritual Guardian
of Lingfeng Street.

556
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,900
I'd like to report

557
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,740
that the wanted criminal, Cao Yanbing,

558
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,340
has appeared in Lingfeng Street.

559
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,980
Is the report reliable?

560
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,900
Very reliable.

561
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,460
This is Li Gucheng
from the Hall of Heroes,

562
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,700
sent to convey the leader's orders.

563
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,260
General Yan,

564
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,700
whatever methods you use,

565
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,460
make sure
to keep Cao Yanbing under control.

566
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,460
We'll arrive as soon as possible

567
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,500
to capture him.

568
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,220
Yes, sir.

569
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,860
You go first.

570
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,820

I wasn't fond of the previous batch,

579

but this batch is particularly tasty.

580
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,300
I like it.

581

If it tastes good, dig in.

This time,

583
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,620
I had someone add honey

584
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,420
to the filling.

585
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,580
Take your time.

587
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,340
Thank you, Father.

590
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,020
Why would I hate you?

591
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,980
You would bring me delicious food,

But since I've locked you in here,

597
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,820
you can't go anywhere.

598
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,340
That's because

I'm your son,

602
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,140
and I want to protect
Lingfeng Street too.

603
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,780

you've said

607
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,900

and become stronger,

608
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,380

Cao Yanbing hasn't found the guide yet,
