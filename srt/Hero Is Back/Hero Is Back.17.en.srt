00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,940
[Adapted from Xu Chen's comic:
Rakshasa Street]

17
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,940
[Episode 17]

18
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:01,740
No one's here.

19
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,260
That's great.

20
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:04,940
We're good to go.

21
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,540
I've prepared these.

22
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,780
What are they?

23
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,700
Gadgets for the autopsy.

24
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,940
They always appear in TV series,

25
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,460
like "Witness to a Prosecution".

26
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,460
In Spiritual Crossroads,
examining the deceased

27
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,300
follows a different method
than in the Human Realm.

28
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,060
The death of a Spirit-hosted Human

29
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,700
might be caused
by the Primordial Spirit Power

30
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,980
of someone else

31
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,700
or a backlash from their own power.

32
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,940
Regular tools aren't sufficient
for this task.

33
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,100
Only Primordial Spirit Power

34
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,020
can uncover the truth.

35
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,700
Understood.

36
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,300
You can begin now.

37
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,620
But surprisingly,

38
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,660
this place is unguarded.

39
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,220
That makes sense.

40
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,020
Everyone thought

41
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,940
you were after the guide,

42
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,020
and no one would suspect

43
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,060
the killer to check the corpse.

44
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,060
Right?

If spotting any man in red,

46
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,740
let us know immediately.

00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,900
We must avenge General Tianyue.

48
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,660
Fair point.

49
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,660
We can't worry about that now.

50
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,740
Let's hurry up.

51
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,660
Let's do this.

52
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:06,740
Please forgive me.

53
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,500
Stop!

54
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:11,860
Watch out.

55
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,180
Just as expected, we've got an ambush.

56
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,220
You've killed my father,

57
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,460
and now you dare tamper with his body.

58
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,660
Today, you'll join him in the afterlife.

59
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,260
Wait.

60
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,300
Yan Tianyue is your father?

61
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,780
You are Yan Fengzha.

62
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,740
So you aren't dead.

63
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,780
You guys are dead.

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,420
You coward, why are you dodging?

If I hurt you,

who will lead the way for me?

67
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,660
You still want me to show you the way?

68
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,140
Hold on.

69
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,740
Keep it down, you two,

70
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,860
or you'll attract the guards.

71
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,260
While I'm away,

72
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,180
has anything unusual happened?

73
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:00,900
The girl who arrived

74
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,740
with Cao Yanbing earlier

75
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,620
came to report

76
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,300
that he intended to kill her.

77
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,980
She's waiting
for Beiluo Shimen's return,

78
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,180
bidding him farewell,

79
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,420
and then leaving Lingfeng Street.

80
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,540
Where is she now?

81
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,300
I told her to wait inside.

82
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,020
She went inside?

83
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,260
You two

84
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,300
secure this area.

85
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,500
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

86
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,180
So what if the guards come?

87
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,780
It'd be perfect to capture both of you.

88
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,220
Calm down

89
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:20,900
and hear me out.

90
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,420
I honestly didn't kill your father.

91
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,620
Don't even think about denying it.

92
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,500
Listen to me.

93
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,220
Your father's death seems suspicious.

94
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,340
If you want to find out

95
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,460
who the real murderer is,

96
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,900
keep quiet

97
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,300
and join me in examining the body.

98
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,460
I'll examine yours first!

99
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,580
Commander Lang.

100
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,060
Miss Xia,

101
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,500
you shouldn't be here.

102
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,620
Here's the thing.

103
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,820
I was originally here

104
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,740
to wait for Beiluo,

105
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,700
but before I left,

106
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,260
I wanted to pay my respects
to General Tianyue.

107
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,420
If my father were still alive,

108
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,300
he would be about the same age

109
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,140
as General Yan Tianyue.

110
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,820
Since you've paid your respects,

111
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,820
please come with me, Miss Xia.

112
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,380
I know where Beiluo Shimen is

113
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,060
and can show you.

114
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,420
Please.

115
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,540
Thank you.

116
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,540
Still planning to fight?

117
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,060
Can you at least wait

118
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,260
until after the autopsy?

119
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,300
You can fight
to your heart's content afterward.

120
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:03,900
Dream on.

121
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,780
All right,

122
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,100
I won't examine it. You can take over.

123
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,020
What are you doing?

124
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,780
Stop!

125
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,540
What is this?

126
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,940
Could this be...

127
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,540
As expected,

128
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,220
Yan Lingyu

129
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,220
wouldn't frame me

130
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,940
with her own brother's death.

131
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,260
She found a scapegoat.

132
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,100
See?

133
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,140
He's not your father.

134
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,700
My name is cleared now, right?

135
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,700
Whether the deceased
is my father or not,

136
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,020
you're still

137
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,180
the suspect,

138
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,100
and that's undeniable.

139
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,700
I'm not a murderer.

140
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,860
I didn't kill anyone.

141
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:19,900
This person

142
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,660
suddenly attacked me,

143
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,020
with blue pupils and immense strength.

144
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,300
He was acting so weird.

145
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,140
Someone

146
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,820
is trying to frame me.

147
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,300
Blue eyes

148
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,860
and immense strength?

149
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,660
Yes.

150
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,340
This person was fine yesterday

151
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,100
during the day.

152
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,580
It must be the Blaze Jade.

153
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,260
Blaze Jade?

154
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:41,820
What's that?

155
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,300
You don't know what Blaze Jade is?

156
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,660
Isn't it something everyone

157
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,820
in Lingfeng Street knows about?

158
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,460
It's a long story.

159
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,820
Let's first examine the body.

160
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,980
You're still under suspicion.

161
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:57,860
I'll handle it.

162
00:08:59,460 --> 00:08:59,820
Sure.

163
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,300
You do it.

164
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,100
Blaze Jade is quite potent.

165
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,620
Despite the person
having been dead for so long,

166
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,420
there are still some traces.

167
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,500
How is this possible?

168
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,180
What do you mean?

169
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,180
Miss Xia,

170
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,660
Beiluo Shimen should be

171
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,340
at the Fengyu Bridge right over there.

172
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,900
You know how to get there, right?

173
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:38,940
I've been there before.

174
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,260
I can go by myself.

175
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,260
You can get back to work.

176
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,740
I won't accompany you then.

177
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,060
Take care.

178
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,780
Excuse me, Commander!

179
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:01,780
Commander!

180
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,220
What's the matter?

181
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,500
Commander.

182
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,460
Something has come up.

183
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,500
Did you spot Cao Yanbing?

184
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,620
Not exactly,

185
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,380
but

186
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,460
it's close enough.

187
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,380
What do you mean by "close enough"?

188
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,020
Explain clearly.

189
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,620
We just changed shifts

190
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,020
and noticed one of our men was missing.

191
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,260
After searching everywhere,

192
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,140
we found him unconscious

193
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,740
by the roadside,

194
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,860
no clue when.

195
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,260
Why was this critical issue

196
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,380
only discovered now?

197
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,380
Cao Yanbing

198
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,140
could have already infiltrated.

199
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,380
He might be hiding
somewhere around here.

200
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,020
Oh, no.

201
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,860
The mourning hall.

202
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:26,660
Come with me.

203
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,020
Yes, sir.

204
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,740
It's Feilian.

205
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,780
Feilian?

206
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,100
What's that now?

207
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,900
Feilian is my...

208
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,660
Someone's approaching.

209
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,540
Hurry up.

210
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,500
Search carefully.

211
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,660
Check it out over there.

212
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,020
Luckily, I reacted quickly.

213
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,420
Otherwise,
we would have been discovered.

214
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,660
You're the one afraid
of being found out,

215
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,260
not me.

216
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,060
Aren't you worried that people

217
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,260
might see us running together?

218
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,260
You're a murder suspect now.

219
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,060
I have to keep an eye on you

220
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:48,780
and make sure you don't escape.

221
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,900
Enough already.

222
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,060
Quit the denial.

223
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,660
I know your story.

224
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,660
Because you couldn't control

225
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,140
your Guardian Primordial Spirit
from a young age,

226
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,020
your father hid you
in Lingfeng Mountain.

227
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,660
Nearly everyone
in the Wind-Treading Clan

228
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,820
has never seen you.

229
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,300
I guess

230
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,180
you don't want

231
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,660
to suddenly appear in front of them

232
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,060
and shock them, right?

233
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,060
How do you know

234
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,660
about these things?

235
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,180
This isn't the place to talk.

236
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,580
Let's meet with Xia Ling outside.

237
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,420
Let's talk it over

238
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,300
when we get there.

239
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,620
All right,

240
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,340
we're now outside

241
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,260
the borders of Lingfeng Street.

242
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,540
There's no need to hide anymore.

243
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,420
Hello, Fengzha.

244
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,140
We were in such a rush

245
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,900
at the mourning hall earlier.

246
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,580
Let's get to know each other again.

247
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,980
I'm Xia Ling,

248
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,100
and this is Cao Yanbing.

249
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,900
I think we might

250
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,500
have a slight misunderstanding.

251
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,700
Someone's life is involved.

252
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,900
It's more than a small misunderstanding.

253
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,700
How do you

254
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:08,940
know so much

255
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,660
about me?

256
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,740
It was your cousin,

257
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,340
Yan Ruofu, who told us.

258
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,900
She also mentioned

259
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,860
that five years ago,

260
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,140
when your Guardian Primordial Spirit

261
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,940
awakened and went berserk,

262
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,900
your father

263
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,860
had to kill you to prevent it

264
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,900
from causing harm to Lingfeng Street.

265
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,100
Kill me?

266
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,420
That's utter nonsense.

267
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,580
I indeed went berserk,

268
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,500
but my awakened
Guardian Primordial Spirit

269
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,700
was later subdued

270
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,460
by my father and auntie

271
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,580
and hidden

272
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,540
in a very safe place.

273
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,060
I

274
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,740
was also moved

275
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,940
to an even more secluded cave.

276
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,820
But your aunt insisted

277
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,900
that you were dead.

278
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,100
How do you explain that?

279
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,900
Moreover, she accused me

280
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,020
of killing Yan Tianyue,

281
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,540
and you saw with your own eyes

282
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,540
that the Yan Tianyue in question

283
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,500
was an impostor.

284
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,020
Are you saying
that Yan Tianyue was fake?

285
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,620
Yes,

286
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,220
that person

287
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,060
was not Yan Tianyue.

288
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,340
He was just wearing a mask

289
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,660
made to look like Yan Tianyue.

290
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,660
So Beiluo has been completely deceived.

291
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,940
Yan Lingyu

292
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,900
is something

293
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,780
and her schemes are quite cunning.

294
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:07,820
It's quite terrifying.

295
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,220
Don't speak ill of my auntie.

296
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,180
You must have pressured her

297
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,180
into handing over the guide first.

298
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,180
So she did all this

299
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,780
to protect me.

300
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,460
Besides,

301
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,180
even if the dead person
wasn't my father,

302
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,460
it still doesn't prove

303
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,820
you're innocent of murder.

304
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,620
What more proof do you need?

305
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,460
The corpse clearly shows

306
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,420
traces of Blaze Jade.

307
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,340
You keep mentioning Blaze Jade.

308
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,340
What exactly is it?

309
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,180
Blaze Jade is a potion

310
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,540
that can boost
one's Primordial Spirit Power.

311
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,100
Its formula is unknown,
and it's very expensive,

312
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,940
but it is produced

313
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,540
in your Lingfeng Street.

314
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,820
I don't know anything

315
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,340
about Blaze Jade.

316
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,580
What I detected

317
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,540
on the body

318
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,140
was the power of Feilian.

319
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,380
Feilian?

320
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,820
What's this Feilian
you are talking about?

321
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,620
You don't even know

322
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,220
about the ancient divine beast Feilian?

323
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,780
You must be incredibly uninformed.

324
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,260
Fine,

325
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,940
I may be uninformed,

326
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,620
but what does it have

327
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,580
to do with you?

328
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,060
It's my Guardian Primordial Spirit,

329
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:00,940
so of course I know about it.

330
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,180
Are you saying

331
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,260
that the power on the corpse

332
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,500
is from your Guardian Primordial Spirit?

333
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,500
That seems unlikely.

334
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,340
Believe it or not. It's up to you.

335
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,380
I'm not the one

336
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:12,980
suspected of murder.

337
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,420
The investigation's all yours.

338
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,060
Where are you going?

339
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,740
None of your business!

340
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,100
We will go with you.

341
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,540
Won't you check

342
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,980
the cause of death in the mourning hall?

343
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,700
We came

344
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,300
to Lingfeng Street

345
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,300
to find the guide.

346
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,380
Now that you, the guide,

347
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,340
are right here,

348
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,660
why should I check the cause of death?

349
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,300
Or is it that you

350
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,500
want to investigate it yourself?

351
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,660
It's not easy for me to be out here,

352
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,900
so I need to find Feilian first.

353
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,700
You're looking for Feilian?

354
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,260
We can help you with that.

355
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,060
I don't need help.

356
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:45,980
I can sense it myself.

357
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,500
So it's based on sensing.

358
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,100
Xia Ling,

359
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,100
is there a range limit
for the connection

360
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,860
between a Spirit-hosted Human

361
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,260
and his Guardian Primordial Spirit?

362
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,380
Certainly,

363
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,780
if the distance is too far,

364
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,780
sensing it becomes very difficult,

365
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,260
much like finding
a needle in a haystack.

366
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,380
What do you say?

367
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,020
Maybe you should

368
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,100
get our help.

369
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,420
Don't take me for a ride.

370
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:06,940
You make it sound

371
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,980
like you have a solution.

372
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,300
I don't have a solution,

373
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,660
but I do

374
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,940
have an idea.

375
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,340
Since you insist

376
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,740
that Feilian's power

377
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,740
was detected in the corpse,

378
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,700
and I think

379
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,660
the cause of death
is related to Blaze Jade,

380
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,580
there might be a connection

381
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,420
between Feilian and Blaze Jade.

382
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,460
We can't find Feilian,

383
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,900
but I do know someone

384
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,380
well-versed in Blaze Jade.

385
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,580
Someone well-versed in Blaze Jade?

386
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,540
Who is it?

387
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:34,980
Elder Mei.

388
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,300
Are you referring

389
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,820
to the chubby old man

390
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,660
captured by the Fire-Eater King?

391
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,020
Yan Ruofu did mention to me

392
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,580
that Blaze Jade was made by him,

393
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,260
and only he knows the formula.

394
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,980
Since that's the case,

395
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,100
wouldn't it be unwise

396
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,500
not to seek him out?

397
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:51,820
So?

398
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,300
Now that we've got the target,

399
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,420
should we go?

400
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,420
Asking someone isn't enough.

401
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,820
Getting answers is what matters.

402
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,140
How can you just walk away like that?

403
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:00,780
Do you even know

404
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,620
where Elder Mei resides?

405
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,500
Who is it?

406
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,140
Who's outside?

407
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,380
Is it Lingyu?

408
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,140
You are Elder Mei, right?

409
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,140
Don't worry.

410
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,540
We won't hurt you.

411
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,620
We just need to ask you a few questions.

412
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,620
If you promise not to shout,

413
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,340
I'll remove my hand

414
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,420
and let you talk.

415
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,500
Is that okay?

416
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,140
Fengzha.

417
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:13,780
You...

418
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,380
How did you get out?

419
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,140
And how did you end up

420
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,020
associating with these people?

421
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:18,980
Do you recognize me?

422
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,260
Have we met before?

423
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,380
No,

424
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,340
we haven't.

425
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,340
We haven't met before.

426
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,540
I...

427
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,780
I've only heard about you from Lingyu.

428
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,660
You're lying.

429
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,620
If you've only heard about him,

430
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:32,660
how can you recognize

431
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,020
and know his name

432
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,460
at the first meeting?

433
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,540
Tell me the truth.

434
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,180
Have you seen me before?

435
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,620
Back when Feilian's power

436
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,740
caused you

437
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,140
to lose your sanity,

438
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,300
I visited the mountain

439
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,580
to treat you.

440
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,340
You know about Feilian,

441
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,660
so do you know

442
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,660
where it's being kept?

443
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,420
You shook your head without thinking,

444
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,500
which means you're lying again.

445
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,100
I...

446
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,860
I don't know.

447
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:07,940
All right,

448
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,580
if you know little about Feilian,

449
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,460
you should at least
know about Blaze Jade.

450
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,980
I've heard that you

451
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,220
developed Blaze Jade yourself,

452
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:15,620
so let me ask you this.

453
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,380
Even though Blaze Jade

454
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,260
is meant to enhance

455
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,220
Primordial Spirit Power,

456
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,860
could it also potentially

457
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,660
cause sudden death?

458
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,740
That's impossible.

459
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,180
How much would one have to consume?

460
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,460
The Blaze Jade I made

461
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,900
is always diluted.

462
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,100
Elder Mei,
you are indeed straightforward.

463
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,500
We got the point from just one sentence.

464
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,180
Diluted Blaze Jade

465
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,140
is relatively safe,

466
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,180
but large quantities

467
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,940
or undiluted Blaze Jade

468
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,060
can be lethal,

469
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,380
right?

470
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,180
So what's the connection

471
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,860
between Blaze Jade and Feilian?

472
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,660
They mentioned
that after using Blaze Jade,

473
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,740
one's pupils will turn blue,

474
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,820
which mirrors

475
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,100
the symptom I had
when my Primordial Spirit Power

476
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
was out of control.

477
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,700
Quick, speak up.

478
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,180
Don't play dumb.

479
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,500
Tell me.

480
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,500
Elder Mei,

481
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,220
I've heard that you are highly respected

482
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,100
in Lingfeng Street.

483
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,780
But if we were to change

484
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,900
your eyebrow shape,

485
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,220
shaving half

486
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,740
of your brows,

487
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,020
I wonder if your image and prestige

488
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,420
would remain.

489
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,740
If you want to kill me, just do it.

490
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,540
Don't humiliate me.

491
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,980
Why all this violence?

492
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,020
I'm not

493
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,500
a killer.

494
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,540
I just have a keen interest

495
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,500
in eyebrow trimming.

496
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,580
You're Elder Mei, right?

497
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,420
So your eyebrows

498
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,500
should have

499
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,500
some distinctive features.

500
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:57,900
Xia Ling,

501
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,020
Yes?

502
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,220
Do you have scissors?

503
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:01,700
Yes, I do.

504
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,260
It's specifically for eyebrow grooming.

505
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,300
It's perfect for the job.

506
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,020
This is exactly what I need.

507
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,700
No.

508
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,300
No.

509
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,060
No. Stop.

510
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,740
Please stop.

511
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,740
I'll tell you.

512
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,540
I'll tell you.

513
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,580
I'll tell you right now.

514
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,540
I'll tell you right now.

515
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,500
It would have been better
if you had spoken up sooner.

516
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,540
Now, tell us.

517
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,300
What's the connection

518
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,300
between Feilian and Blaze Jade?

519
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,700
And where is Feilian being held?

520
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,820
All right then.

521
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,100
Since you've managed to come out

522
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,060
and are now mixed with these people,

523
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,420
this is fate.

524
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,900
You can head to Lingfeng Mountain,

525
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,700
and locate a lakeside cabin

526
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,780
on the side facing away
from Lingfeng Street.

527
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,820
You'll find out everything

528
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,020
once you go inside.

529
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,940
So you mean

530
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,220
Feilian is being held there?

531
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,900
You should go.

532
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,740
Given your ability to sense it,

533
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,100
you'll find it in no time.

534
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,260
He doesn't sound

535
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,340
like he's lying.

536
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,580
So we don't need to bring him along.

537
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,020
If we leave him here,

538
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,060
he might notify

539
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,940
Yan Lingyu.

540
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,980
It's safer this way.

541
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,700
Any objections?

542
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:41,940
Then let's proceed

543
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,300
to Lingfeng Mountain.

544
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:00,580
General,

545
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,740
everything you asked for is prepared.

546
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,740
You may leave now.

547
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:03,700
Yes, Ma'am.

548
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:33,740
Bad news.

549
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,460
General, bad news.

550
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,100
General.

551
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,700
Something happened

552
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,180
to Elder Mei.

553
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,500
Elder Mei?

554
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,060
What happened to him?

555
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
He was found unconscious in the room.

556
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,100
His family

557
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,020
only discovered it a short while ago.

558
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,980
I suspect Cao Yanbing

559
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,500
is responsible.

560
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,180
How could it be him?

561
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,820
Just now, I saw the girl, Miss Xia,

562
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,180
who ran off with Cao Yanbing

563
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,100
in the mourning hall.

564
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,740
She claimed Cao Yanbing
wanted to kill her,

565
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,740
so she tried her best to escape

566
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,020
and came back to see Beiluo Shimen.

567
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,460
I didn't notice anything unusual,

568
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,500
so I let her go.

569
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,060
Then it was discovered
that some patrolling soldiers

570
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,060
had been knocked out.

571
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,660
Now even Elder Mei is...

572
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,220
Ridiculous!

573
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,540
Cao Yanbing

574
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,700
has been loitering

575
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,020
right under your eyes all night.

576
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,340
How could you let this happen?

577
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,420
However,

578
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,500
what is he

579
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,660
up to?

580
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,740
First, he visited the mourning hall,

581
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,180
then Elder Mei.

582
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,060
Wait a minute.

583
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,500
Could it be...

584
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,740
Feilian?

585
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:49,740
Lang Da,

586
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,020
you can leave now.

587
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,740
I'll handle the rest.

588
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,180
Yes, Ma'am.

589
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,700
Just the smell tells me
it's good liquor.

590
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,780
Of course.

591
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,740
Here. I'll pour you some.

592
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,780
Come on, cheers.

593
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,940
That's not how we drink our liquor

594
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,100
in Lingfeng Street.

595
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:23,900
Please hold on.

596
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,340
Is there a specific way to enjoy it?

597
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,140
Yes, there is.

598
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,180
Come on, have a piece.

599
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,100
Is this how you're supposed to eat it?

600
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,820
This is, of course, my original recipe.

601
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,860
It's flower cakes soaked in liquor.

602
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,460
The flavor gets better with each sip.

603
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,540
It's a gourmet delight.

604
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,500
This is a bit...

605
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,860
Give it another try.

606
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,900
It's quite good.

607
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:09,900
Yan Tianyue, I'm warning you.

608
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:10,780
If you make me eat this kind

609
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,260
of awful food again,

610
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,180
we're going to have a serious problem.

611
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,500
Lingyu.

612
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,380
I am Yan Lingyu, the Spiritual Guardian
of Lingfeng Street.

613
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,140
I'm here to greet all of you, Generals.

614
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,540
General Yan, no need for formalities.

615
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,140
Where is Cao Yanbing?

616
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,140
He's in Xianfeng Valley.

617
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,020
Xianfeng Valley?

618
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,780
Are you positive he's headed there?

619
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:33,740
Madam.

620
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,380
Now that we know the location,

621
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,660
let's go.

622
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,380
- Yes.
- Yes.

623
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,340
May I ask

624
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,860
if there are just

625
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,740
three of you?

626
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,620
Three is certainly excessive.

627
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,340
I'll just come with Madam

628
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,180
to join the fun.

629
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,740
Madam happens to be in the mood

630
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,100
to go out for a stroll today.

631
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,580
It is a rare blessing

632
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,820
for Lingfeng Street.

633
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,980
General Yan, don't be ungrateful

634
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,620
and upset Madam.

635
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,420
Li Gucheng,

636
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,100
why are you so talkative today?

637
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,740
We're here to do our job
and capture someone.

638
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,780
Let's just get it done fast
and head back.

639
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,180
Flower cakes soaked in liquor.

640
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,500
No way.

641
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,180
How is that possible?

642
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,620
Tianyue,

643
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,740
may you bless Lingfeng Street,

644
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,980
help it escape this calamity,

645
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,740
and ensure Cao Yanbing

646
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,300
is brought to justice.

647
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,500
If this is resolved,

648
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,740
I will build

649
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,460
a grand and fitting tomb for you,

650
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,100
where our people will honor you

651
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,620
and offer incense.

652
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:01,980
Update letter.

653
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,020
It's probably Beiluo.

654
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:03,820
Ignore him.

655
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,420
You should answer him.

656
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,460
What if he has an urgent issue

657
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:06,980
and needs to reach us?

658
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,900
What could be the issue?

659
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,500
It's only to inform Yan Lingyu

660
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,300
of our whereabouts

661
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,500
so she can come and capture us.

662
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,180
I don't think that's the case.

663
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,020
You're not allowed to answer it either.

664
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,460
So bossy

665
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,460
and immature.

666
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,500
They were heading this way.

667
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,460
Why don't I see anyone?

668
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,820
Cao Yanbing,

669
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,620
Xia Ling, answer quickly.

670
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,580
Answer it.

671
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,020
Answer it, please.

672
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,460
- Fengzha.
- Fengzha.

673
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,180
Come on, get up.

674
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,460
Is the walking wearing you out?

675
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,380
Do you want to rest for a bit?

676
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,820
I'm fine.

677
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,420
It must be

678
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,060
because we're getting closer to Feilian.

679
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,380
I can already sense

680
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,100
its presence.

681
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,900
My current state

682
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,260
indicates that Feilian

683
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,260
is also very weak

684
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,300
and in pain at this moment.

685
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,020
This won't do.

686
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,660
I need to find it quickly.

687
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:24,820
Come.

688
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,180
Hold this, Xia Ling.

689
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,060
Careful.

690
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,580
What are you doing?

691
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,100
Isn't it obvious?

692
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,140
I'm carrying you on my back.

693
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,420
This is way faster

694
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,180
than your turtle-like speed.

695
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,220
Put me down.

696
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,460
I'm fine
with moving slowly like a turtle.

697
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:46,980
What a coincidence.

698
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,260
I'm quite happy to carry a turtle.

699
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,700
How are you feeling, Feng Zha?

700
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,460
Still holding up okay?

701
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,140
I'm fine.

702
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,140
I can feel

703
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,940
that we're almost there.

704
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,020
In other words,

705
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
once we pass the valley ahead,

706
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,380
we'll see the lakeside cabin

707
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,420
Elder Mei mentioned.

708
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,620
Let's hurry up.

709
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,100
Who's behind the ambush?

710
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,020
Come out and face me!

711
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,620
Don't you recognize

712
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,380
this arrow,

713
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,260
Cao Yanbing?

714
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,220
The fugitive Cao Yanbing

715
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,380
has caused trouble in Lingfeng Street.

716
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,540
The Hall of Heroes has been informed

717
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,420
and is duty-bound to eradicate
the threat and ensure peace.

718
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,580
It must be Yan Lingyu
who tipped them off.

719
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:57,820
I should have known.

720
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,220
Xia Ling,

721
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,180
take Fengzha and leave first.

722
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,180
I'll hold them off.

723
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,500
No,

724
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,580
I'm coming with you too.

725
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:07,820
Xia Ling,

726
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,660
given Fengzha's current state,

727
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,820
we must get to Feilian right away.

728
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,580
If something happens to Fengzha,

729
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,740
all our efforts will be wasted,

730
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,300
and his life will be lost in vain.

731
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,740
But we couldn't even defeat Li Gucheng

732
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,020
with the three of us before.

733
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:18,980
How are you going to handle

734
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,700
three of them now?

735
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,460
Don't worry.

736
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,300
I, Cao Yanbing,

737
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,660
won't lose to the same person

738
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,980
twice.

739
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,220
Stop trying to act tough.

740
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,300
Xia Ling,

741
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,020
teamwork is important.

742
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,700
Besides, I'm not alone.

743
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,780
I have
my Guardian Primordial Spirits with me.

744
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,500
Take Fengzha and leave now.

745
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,180
Then you must be very careful.

746
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,500
Let's go, Fengzha.

747
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,260
Are you coming at me individually

748
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,820
or as a group?

749
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,780
Hurry up.

750
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,300
I've got a second round coming up.

751
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,500
You're quite bold, young man.

752
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:11,900
Then,

753
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,300
let's start

754
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,300
with a mixed-gender challenge.

755
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,620
Yang Yuanzhao!

756
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,380
Li Guang.

757
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,170
[Yang Yuanzhao]

758
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,470
[Li Guang]

759
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,140
Generals,

760
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,700

You should know

who's the true Fire Spiritual Guardian

exhibit the aura

776
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,220
of a Divine Warrior's Form?

777
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,140
Although games are fun and exciting,

778
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,580
they can never compare to the thrill

779
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,100
of real combat.

780
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,060
The reason

781
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,620
is that I can see

782
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,060
the exact depressed look

783
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,820
of defeat on someone's face,

784
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,500
and then watch them perish in this world

785
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,380

hold your head up a bit

789
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,180
