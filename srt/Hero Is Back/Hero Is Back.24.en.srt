Are you really going to attack me?

32
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,940

Huangfu Longdou,

what exactly do you want to do?

35
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,980
Earlier in the Moon Palace,

36
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,260
my former subordinate already told you

37
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,180
that I need
your Divine Warrior's Physique

38
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,340
to place the Soul-Locks

39
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,460

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,300

43
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,740
There's no need
to be so hostile towards me.

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,020
a sophisticated villain all the time,

51
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,740
but in the end, you're just using

52
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,020
my friends' lives to threaten me.

53
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,580
It seems

54
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,780
you really have
a deep misunderstanding of me.

deeply.

70
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,580
You're the one who led her to this fate.

71
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,580
Xiao was already struck

72
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,180
by the Moon Lord's Black Death Light

73
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,220
before she turned into stone.

74
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,340
The reason she has become

75
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,340
a Malevolent Being now

76
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,300
is that the more powerful and diligent

77
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,620
a Spiritual Guardian is,

78
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,300
the more likely they are to become

79
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,980
a Malevolent Being after death.

80
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,140
No,

81
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,540
that can't be true.

As ridiculous as it sounds,

85
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,060
this is the truth.

The Border Domain insists
that Spiritual Guardians

eliminate Malevolent Beings,

88

89
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,260
that once we die

90
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,340
and our Primordial Spirit Power
dissipates,

91
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,140
our bodies will be eroded

92
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,780
by the fiend energy
of the Malevolent Beings we've killed.

93
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,220
Those like your mother,

94
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,620
who have slain
countless Malevolent Beings,

95
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,860
will inevitably become
Malevolent Beings.

96
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,740
Mom.

97
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,380
What's the point of years spent
battling Malevolent Beings

98
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,700
and upholding the peace

99
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
and justice I believe in?

100
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,260
This is why I rebelled

101
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,180
back then

102
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,620
and why I'm seeking

103
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,780
the divine power of Penglai now.

104
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,140
I want to use this power

105
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,340
to attack the Border Domain

106
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,820
and change everything.

107
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,940
I don't want to have to kill
Malevolent Beings

108
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,940
while I'm alive

109
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,620
and then become

110
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,660
a Malevolent Being myself after death,

111
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,980
only to be slain by my friends.

112
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:54,940
I also don't want to see

113
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,300
other Spiritual Guardians

114
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,580
face the same tragic situation
you're facing now,

115
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,300
where they have to kill

116
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,660
their loved ones with their own hands.

117
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,780
What did you just say?

118
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,540
Kill their loved ones?

119
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,460
Isn't that the case?

120
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,020
Mom,

121
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,700
don't you recognize me?

122
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,660
It's me!

123
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,020
Please wake up.

124
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,180
You're the one who needs to wake up.

125
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,780
When someone becomes
a Malevolent Being,

126
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,780
they lose all sense of self.

127
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,380
If you don't kill her,

128
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,940
she'll kill you.

129
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,700
Cao Yanbing,

130
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,260
assist me in acquiring the divine power,

131
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,940
and we'll change
the Spiritual Crossroads together.

132
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,300
She's my mother.

133
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,780
I will never kill her,

134
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,700
and I certainly won't help you.

135
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,380
Mom,

136
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,660
can't you just go a little easier on me?

137
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,580
Sure.

138
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,060
Why don't you go out on the street

139
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,940
and ask those Malevolent Beings

140
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,420
to go easy on you?

141
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,780
But you're my mom,

142
00:10:59,180 --> 00:10:59,940
not a Malevolent Being.

143
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,660
Come on, let's continue.

144
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,420
Again.

145
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,060
Not bad, you little rascal.

146
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:28,820
Anyway,

147
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,900
happy birthday.

148
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,020
From now on, I'll protect you.

149
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,300
There has to be another way.

150
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,180
There must be.

151
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,460
I promised my mom

152
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,940
I'd protect her, even if it kills me.

153
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,420
Then go ahead and die.

154
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,300
Don't listen
to Huangfu Longdou's nonsense.

155
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,660
Since justice ultimately leads to evil,

156
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,480
and Spiritual Guardians

157
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,780
will inevitably become
Malevolent Beings,

158
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,300
you might as well

159
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,300
join me now.

160
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,940
In this world, good and evil

161
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,700
should be determined by the strong.

162
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,540
Let's reclaim

163
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,420
my power together

164
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,900
and become the ultimate rulers,

165
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,460
turning what they call "evil"

166
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,380
into justice.

167
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,420
By becoming you,

168
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:14,820
will I no longer

169
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,780
need to kill my mom?

170
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,140
Of course.

171
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,940
As long as I regain my power,

172
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,820
I can control
all the Malevolent Beings in the world,

173
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,180
and she will stand

174
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,820
by your side forever.

175
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,060
Okay,

176
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,540
I'll give you

177
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,900
my all.

178
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,780
It feels great

179
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,780
to use the body freely.

180
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,420
You must be Huangfu Longdou,

181
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,940
the one who injured Celestial Fox,

182
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,940
stole the Soul-Locks,

183
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,300
and tried to take my power.

184
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,140
Are you planning to hand over

185
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,380
the Four Lords' Soul-Locks
while you're alive,

186
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,940
or after you're dead?

187
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,020
He's come out.

188
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:23,980
No, wait.

189
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,740
He's being controlled
by the demonic form.

190
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,540
The world, from the boundless heavens

191
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,660
to the primal chaos,

192
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,660
will soon be under my rule.

193
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,380
Hell will be reopened

194
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,780
today.

195
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,140
This divine pearl
is an ancient artifact.

196
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,540
Please

197
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,460
handle it carefully.

198
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,180
What's going on?

199
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,580
What is this?

200
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,060
This pearl is an ancient divine artifact

201
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,740
that can control anyone to serve me.

202
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,660
From now on,

203
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,180
you will only obey my commands

204
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,060
and become my ultimate weapon

205
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,420
for attacking the Border Domain.

206
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,580
Devious human,

207
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,860
did you have this all planned out

208
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,980
and were you just waiting for the moment

209
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,860
I recovered my power?

210
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:01,860
Indeed.

211
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,500
I've been waiting

212
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,820
for this moment for ten years.

213
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,860
So you already knew

214
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,980
that the power hidden in Penglai

215
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,060
belongs to me.

216
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,380
But isn't the Celestial Fox...

217
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,340
I anticipated her betrayal long ago.

218
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,540
The talk about using
the Four Lords' Soul-Locks

219
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,900
to fuse into the Soul Key

220
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,140
was just to deceive her.

221
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,420
The real purpose

222
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,260
of Cao Yanbing's
Divine Warrior's Physique

223
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,420
is to merge with your residual energy,

224
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,980
transform into a demonic form,
and reclaim the power.

225
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,220
Only then can I control you.

226
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,260
No wonder you wanted Cao Yanbing

227
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,580
to kill his mother.

228
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,900
You did it on purpose,

229
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,980
knowing he lacked the resolve.

230
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,860
You got it right.

231
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,660
If I hadn't done this,

232
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
how else would he

233
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,660
have chosen you so early?

234
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,060
Huangfu Longdou.

235
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,100
Mission accomplished.

236
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,220
It's time to test

237
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,180
my new combat power.

238
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,620
Heed my commands.

239
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
It's Cao Yanbing's mom.

240
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,540
Kill her!

241
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,700
Happy birthday.

242
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,420
From now on, I'll protect you.

243
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,570
[Cao Yanbing, Cao Xuanliang]

244
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,580
You little rascal.

245
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:23,780
Mom?

246
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,700
Am I dead?

247
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,060
You are still alive.

248
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,700
I'm still alive?

249
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,180
So was I dreaming earlier,

250
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,940
or am I having illusions?

251
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,420
This is not a dream.

252
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,980
It is a Protective Domain created

253
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,860
using the Bloodline Forbidden Technique

254
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,380
of the Tang Family.

255
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,940
Protective Domain?

256
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,420
Back then,

257
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,420
when I learned

258
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,660
that I would likely become
a Malevolent Being after death

259
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,020
due to the countless Malevolent Beings
I had killed,

260
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,820
I was shocked

261
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,700
and enraged.

262
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,500
But what worried me more

263
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,660
was that if I turned
into a Malevolent Being

264
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,500
after my death,

265
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,060
and encountered you or Liang,

266
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,980
I might harm you.

267
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,300
So I used my own blood

268
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,540
to create this domain.

269
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,980
As long as my body

270
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,500
comes into contact with your blood,

271
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,100
this domain will activate instantly

272
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,100
and temporarily protect
your Primordial Spirits.

273
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,140
So,

274
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,700
Mom, you're truly dead,

275
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,180
aren't you?

276
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,620
It seems this
is a spiritual space secret technique

277
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,900
created by the Tang Family.

278
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,220
It will only prolong Cao Yanbing's life

279
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,700
for a short while

280
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,140
and won't change anything.

281
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,420
Mom,

282
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,180
I really can't understand.

283
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,980
We worked so hard

284
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,940
to protect this place,

285
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,380
and in the end,

286
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,580
why must we become Malevolent Beings?

287
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,860
I came to save you,

288
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,780
so why does it end up

289
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,860
with me having to kill you?

290
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,660
Is this world

291
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,020
really so unreasonable?

292
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,340
I just don't get it.

293
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,140
The reason

294
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,980
I left a trace

295
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,980
of my consciousness here

296
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,300
is to tell you

297
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,060
that even if, in the end,

298
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,940
you have to kill

299
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,700
me as a Malevolent Being,

300
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,220
you haven't done anything wrong.

301
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,940
So don't blame yourselves for it.

302
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,540
As for the confusion

303
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,220
about the ways
and answers of this world,

304
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,740
it's something

305
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,420
we must find and uphold ourselves.

306
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,660
That's why I entered

307
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,700
the Luhua Ancient Tower.

308
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:48,620
No,

309
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,260
that was because Huangfu Longdou
deceived you.

310
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,180
He manipulated you.

311
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,140
I wasn't deceived,

312
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,660
you know.

313
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,260
Before entering the Ancient Tower,

314
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,220
I suspected

315
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,380
Huangfu Longdou might have
some hidden agenda.

316
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,580
But I also investigated the legend

317
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,740
of the divine power of Penglai,

318
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,540
and it does exist.

319
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,700
This means

320
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,980
there's still a chance

321
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,700
to purify the Malevolent Beings.

322
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,140
Even if the legend

323
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,860
isn't entirely true,

324
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,780
I was willing to take the risk

325
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,900
for that possibility.

326
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,660
So no matter the outcome,

327
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,340
I have no regrets.

328
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,660
No matter what the outcome is,

329
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,860
you have no regrets?

330
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,460
You little rascal,

331
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,620
both you and I possess power

332
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,140
far beyond that of ordinary people.

333
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,900
But true strength

334
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,300
isn't just about the power itself.

335
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,820
It's about how you use

336
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,540
that power.

337
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,220
You need to understand why you fight.

338
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,300
I followed

339
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,340
my own will

340
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,820
and gave my all

341
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,860
to what I thought was right.

342
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,340
So how could I regret that?

343
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,060
A strong heart can shatter stone,

344
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,300
and a fierce spirit can vanquish demons.

345
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,460
Exactly.

346
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,460
So, what about you?

347
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,140
What are you fighting for?

348
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,780
Mom.

349
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,100
Time is running out.

350
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,660
Follow your heart

351
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,220
and act accordingly.

352
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,540
Can't handle a little hardship?

353
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,660
Do you still want to be

354
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,340
a Spiritual Guardian?

355
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:50,980
What does it mean to be strong?

356
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,460
It means being able

357
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,540
to bear the consequences
of being let down

358
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,420
or betrayed,

359
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,940
and still hold onto your true self

360
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,420
even in anger and resentment.

361
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:58,820
That's true strength.

362
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,140
When you get anxious,

363
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,100
you can't think straight,

364
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,900
and your movements become less precise.

365
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:03,900
Of course, the lock won't open.

366
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,860
When you're calm enough

367
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,340
to hear your own heartbeat,

368
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,540
no lock

369
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,580
can hold you back.

370
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,860
But

371
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,060
instead of protecting me,

372
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,740
I hope you can

373
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,300
protect Liang

374
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,020
and Rakshasa Street.

375
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,900
I will.

376
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,500
Mom.

377
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,660
So you're here.

378
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,260
Cao Yanbing,

379
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,100
Huangfu Longdou

380
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,540
actually dared to plot against us.

381
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,340
Let's use this opportunity

382
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:01,900
to go back together

383
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,060
and deal with him.

384
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,180
Why aren't you saying anything?

385
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,220
Even now,

386
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,220
you're still hesitating?

387
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,860
Don't be foolish.

388
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,020
Once this Protective Domain disappears,

389
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,980
both of us will fall

390
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,180
into Huangfu Longdou's hands.

391
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,380
This isn't the outcome

392
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,700
you want, is it?

393
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,620
You are right.

394
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,780
Great.

395
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,980
You've finally come around.

396
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,180
I have come around indeed.

397
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,300
But what I'm contemplating now

398
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,340
is how to take you down

399
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,060
so you can no longer wreak havoc.

400
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,220
If you disappear,

401
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,220
Huangfu Longdou's plan

402
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,460
will inevitably be thwarted.

403
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,380
Cao Yanbing,

404
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,500
what can

405
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,500
an inexperienced mortal

406
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,020
like you

407
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,140
achieve?

408
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,900
You were never my equal.

409
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,900
Now that I've retrieved my heart

410
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,380
and all my power is restored,

411
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,820
you think you can defeat me

412
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,180
with just yourself

413
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,460
and your Guardian Primordial Spirits?

414
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,260
While I can't defeat you,

415
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,580
Old Geezer,

416
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,740
I am capable of ending my own life.

417
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,660
What did you say?

418
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,260
Don't forget.

419
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,420
You're currently using my body.

420
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,460
Your heart

421
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,340
is beating in my chest,

422
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,700
and your power

423
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,020
is flowing through my veins.

424
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,500
So, what if

425
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,340
I destroy

426
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,220
this body of mine?

427
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,860
Do you think destroying the body

428
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,260
will kill me?

429
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,100
That's just your assumption.

430
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,580
I'll tell you this.

431
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,620
I might not be obliterated,

432
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,420
but you

433
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,220
will definitely die.

434
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,460
I'm aware that I'm going to die,

435
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,860
but what if I can take you down with me?

436
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,820
Is it worth

437
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,980
sacrificing your life

438
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:56,700
for just a slim chance?

439
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,180
I can accept defeat,

440
00:28:59,220 --> 00:28:59,900
but you

441
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,340
are not allowed to win.

442
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,660
Fine.

443
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,780
Cao Yanbing,

444
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,940
you're not afraid of dying, huh?

445
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,260
But are you afraid
of becoming a Malevolent Being?

446
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,020
A hero who saved the world,

447
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,300
only to end up as something

448
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,700
people want to kill?

449
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,340
Are you willing to accept that?

450
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,540
Will the ignorant and weak people

451
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,980
you sacrificed yourself to protect

452
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,180
even understand,

453
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,820
remember, or appreciate you?

454
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,420
Old Geezer,

455
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,420
becoming a hero

456
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,940
was never my goal.

457
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,660
I sought power

458
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,340
and fought with all my might,

459
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,860
always

460
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,140
for one reason:

461
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,900
to protect.

462
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:08,940
Initially,

463
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,500
it was to protect

464
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,380
this street,

465
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,500

466
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,140
and friends.

[Rakshasa Street]
It is under my control.

469
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,740
Sorry,

470
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,420
I overslept this morning.

471
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,860
It seems I got here just in time.

472
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,660
I'll help.

473
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,420
And now,

474
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,860
I need to protect more people

475
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,100
and more places.

476
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,900
If you're going to fight,

477
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,700
I can help out.

478
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:53,980
If

479
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,700
you want to rescue your sister
from the Ancient Tower,

480
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,140
all three of us can help.

481
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,140
It's a deal.

482
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:00,860
It's a deal.

483
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,260
This is what I believe,

484
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,340
my reasoning,

485
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,020
and my answer.

486
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,220
All generals, heed my command.

487
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,260
No.

488
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,780
The duty
of the Guardian Primordial Spirits

489
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,740
is to protect their master.

490
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,020
Hurting the master

491
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,540
would lead to their own destruction.

492
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,460
They wouldn't be foolish enough
to do that.

493
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,260
Those
are regular Guardian Primordial Spirits,

494
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,500
but my generals

495
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,940
are not
just Guardian Primordial Spirits,

496
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,460
they are also warriors.

497
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,900
For all my warriors,

498
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,940
when commanded,

499
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,100
none dare to disobey.

500
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,740
You cannot do this.

501
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,660
You can't!

502
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,980
Listen.

am in charge here!

509
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,740
I'm about to become
a Malevolent Being too.

510
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,380
You little rascal,

511
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,220
you did the right thing.

512
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,100
I'm proud of you.

513
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,700
Cao Yanbing,

514
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,220
how can you destroy

515

my ten years of careful planning

516
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,700
with such a senseless act

517
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,900
of self-sacrifice?

518
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,460
I will make sure
you are completely obliterated.

This reckless approach

522

actually activated

within you,

Well, Cao Yanbing,

527
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,500
you are indeed interesting.

528
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,620
Live well,

529
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,700

00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
today.

532
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,500
Let's go.

533
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:54,860
Forget it.

534
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,260
Since Master has fallen,

535
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,900
I might as well keep
following the strong.

Did you fail?

539
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,380
I failed at the final stage.

540
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,740
But you don't seem

541
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,300
particularly disappointed.

542
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,100
Because I discovered something

543
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,380
even more interesting,

544
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,420
not only did Cao Yanbing
eliminate the demonic form,

545
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,340
but he also activated

547
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,180
He has such a talent?

548

00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,460
