1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,300
Come here.

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,594
Let's go and tell your mother

3
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:15,974
that she shouldn't have given birth
to a son like you.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,060
You're making no sense.

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:21,938
I was born 30 years ago.
It's too late for that.

6
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,064
You little...

7
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,316
It's not like Jun-young hit someone

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,943
or betrayed his country.

9
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:31,072
Why did you lock him up when he's sick?

10
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:36,745
If it weren't for him, you'd be living
in a prison cell somewhere.

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,872
How ungrateful can you be?

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,750
I'm doing this because I am grateful.

13
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,792
What?

14
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,087
Do you even know
where Jun-young is trying to go?

15
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:49,048
He's trying to go to the station
where Ms. No is locked up.

16
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,176
-The station?
-Yes.

17
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,262
Ms. No got arrested for attempted murder

18
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,432
because she tried to hit Mr. Choi
with her car.

19
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,424
Mom.

20
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,058
How dare they

21
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,228
lock you up when you're so sick.

22
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:48,108
Get up. Let's get you to a hospital.
Get up.

23
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,026
Come on.

24
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,362
Let's go. Come with me.

25
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,324
I have to see Eul.

26
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,660
Help me.

27
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,081
I need to go to her.

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,500
Please help me.

29
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,380
Mom.

30
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,929
What did you just say?

31
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,223
Mr. Choi Hyeon-jun?

32
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,391
Yes.

33
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:25,311
What do you think will happen
if people find out

34
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,605
that he's friends
with someone who tried to kill

35
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,690
a congressman?

36
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,358
That's why I locked him up.

37
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,401
Okay?

38
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,029
Hey.

39
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,618
I don't think I understood correctly.

40
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,744
Did...

41
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,372
Did you say his name was

42
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,541
Choi...

43
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,129
Choi Hyeon-jun? Are you sure?

44
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,008
Help me.

45
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,095
No...

46
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,763
No.

47
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,516
You can't go anywhere in this state.

48
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,393
Mom.

49
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,815
You stay right here.

50
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,359
I'll go and get some medicine first.

51
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,533
Choi Hyeon-jun.

52
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,583
If you stayed by his side,

53
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,922
he wouldn't have become
such a horrible person.

54
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,470
If you stayed with him
instead of running away,

55
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,644
he wouldn't have become so corrupted.

56
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,857
It's all because of you.

57
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,819
It's your fault.

58
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,405
It's because of you.

59
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,950
It's all your fault!

60
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,036
It's your fault! Everything's your fault!

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,248
It's your fault.

62
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,170
What do you think you're saying?

63
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,507
How dare you talk to your mom like that

64
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,009
just because you're crazy over some girl!

65
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,140
Hey, do you have any idea
how your mom raised you?

66
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,143
Do you know what she had to go through

67
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,271
to raise you decently
even when you had no father?

68
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,440
She did her best to raise you well.

69
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,901
But is that all you can say to her?

70
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,486
Jeong-sik.

71
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,281
You're an ungrateful fool.

72
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:46,536
Do you even know much pain
she feels inside?

73
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,163
What an ungrateful child.

74
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,290
Wait outside.

75
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:58,840
You may be a star to everyone else,
but you aren't a star to us.

76
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,591
Do you think you're something great

77
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,677
just because people praise you
all the time?

78
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,640
Jerk, if you were my son,
you would've been dead.

79
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,518
I told you to go outside, Jeong-sik.

80
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,271
Go and wait outside.

81
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:17,942
Listen carefully.

82
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,528
If you hurt your mom,

83
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,865
it'll all come back and hurt you more.

84
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,158
Make sure you remember that.

85
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,046
I'll go and get some medicine.

86
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,882
I'll crawl there if I have to.

87
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,721
Even if you don't help me,

88
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,683
I'm going to go to Eul, whatever it takes.

89
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,245
Yeong-ok.

90
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,571
Eul.

91
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,704
Jun-young.

92
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,139
What took you so long?

93
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,934
I waited so much for you.

94
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,941
I'm sorry.

95
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,487
I'm really sorry.

96
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,666
I...

97
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,086
I wasn't trying to kill him.

98
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:31,052
I'm serious.
I wasn't trying to kill Choi Hyeon-jun.

99
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,763
I was going to forget about everything

100
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,726
and live like nothing ever happened.
I'm serious.

101
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,115
I know.

102
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,495
I'm so scared, Jun-young.

103
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,121
Why are you scared?

104
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,708
I'm here for you.

105
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,297
-Let's go.
-Where to?

106
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,803
We decided to go on a trip, remember?

107
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,931
We promised to come back after ten years.

108
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,481
Let's go.

109
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,275
Right now?

110
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,110
Yes, right now.

111
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,177
Come on.

112
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,657
Let's return

113
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,868
after staying here for 100 years.

114
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,629
Let's live here where no one can find us.

115
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,883
We can return after living here
for 100 years.

116
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,448
Everything turned cold.

117
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,534
I'll heat it up again.

118
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,166
So?

119
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,918
Has he not eaten anything since yesterday?

120
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,297
That's not all.
I don't think he's even breathing.

121
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:40,050
-What if Jun-young dies, Dad?
-My goodness.

122
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,637
How can a man die just because of a girl?

123
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,432
I should go there with a shovel.

124
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,602
Tell him to wait.
I'll shove food down his throat.

125
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:50,853
My goodness.

126
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,105
Darn it.

127
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,483
IHWASOO YUKGAEJANG

128
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,442
My goodness.

129
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,592
You little...

130
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:22,801
You...

131
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:42,780
Jik.

132
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,118
Why are you here?
Don't you have a test today?

133
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,287
I walked out in the middle of the test.

134
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,041
I understand.
You probably can't focus on anything.

135
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,253
I wish Hyeon-u was with us right now.

136
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,297
He studied with a lot of other students,
so he probably knows a few lawyers.

137
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,467
Where on earth did he disappear to?

138
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,635
Forget him.

139
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,389
Both Hyeon-u and Jun-young can get lost.

140
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,516
We can take care of ourselves.

141
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,143
But

142
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,021
what if Eul cries?

143
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,026
I've never seen her cry for years.

144
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,156
If I see her cry right now,

145
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,869
I think I might go insane.

146
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,247
What do I do, Na-ri?

147
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,503
I'm letting you do this
only because you're sick.

148
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,922
Thank you.

149
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,766
One middle-aged lady came in this morning.

150
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,270
She got caught running away with
the money she gathered with her friends.

151
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,273
Do you know who Lee Mario is?

152
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,860
She was a lady,
but she looked exactly like him.

153
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,738
I was so shocked.

154
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,740
It's not the time for you to laugh.

155
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,035
You're right. It's not.

156
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,416
When I saw her, I said,

157
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,918
"Look, it's Lee Mario.

158
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,461
What brings you here?"

159
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,047
I even greeted her like this.

160
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,382
-Isn't this funny?
-Eul.

161
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,260
Jik, don't you know who Lee Mario is?

162
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,221
Don't you remember?

163
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,891
The guy who used to dance like this.

164
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,142
Don't you know?

165
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,103
-Eul.
-Na-ri, you must know.

166
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,732
Don't you remember
the guy who danced like this?

167
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:45,569
Eul, what's with you?
You're embarrassing me.

168
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,614
That's not right.

169
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,452
This is Lee Mario's dance.

170
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,329
Like this. Do you understand?

171
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,164
You're right. That's it.

172
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,042
It's like this.

173
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,215
Stop frowning, Jik.

174
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,759
It's not like I'm dying.

175
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,846
I'll be out soon,
so find a great tofu place for--

176
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,057
Eul, you weren't really

177
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,601
trying to kill that congressman, right?

178
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,691
Of course

179
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,901
not.

180
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,736
I knew it.

181
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,613
I'm good, then.

182
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,366
I heard Jun-young was there, too.

183
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,160
Why doesn't he visit?

184
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,622
He can bear witness
and say that you weren't--

185
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,748
I told you

186
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,418
not to even mention that jerk's name.

187
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,297
Jik went to Jun-young

188
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,924
and asked for help.

189
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,801
But apparently,
he didn't even open the door.

190
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,638
Don't trust him, Eul.

191
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,265
I'll take care of everything.

192
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,392
I'll prove your innocence and...

193
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:03,230
If you're a student,
you should go to school and study.

194
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,231
Eul.

195
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:07,067
By the way, Jun-young just called me.

196
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,861
He said he's going to come soon
and pick me up.

197
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,113
He may even be on his way already.

198
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,227
Jun-young.

199
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,023
Go to the parking lot.

200
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,734
Get in a car.

201
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,529
Start the car.

202
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,283
Take off.

203
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,246
You have 59km left until your destination.

204
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,375
And 58km.

205
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,152
This is your mom's yukgaejang.

206
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,612
It's what you've always wanted.

207
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,781
At least have a bite.

208
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,538
If you're trying to threaten me
by not eating,

209
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,081
you should give up.

210
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,210
I'm supposed to keep you in here
even if you starve.

211
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:49,837
Your mom ordered me to do so.

212
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,765
I knew this would happen.

213
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,517
I was waiting around for this.

214
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:04,935
Here.

215
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,487
Why are you hurting yourself

216
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,531
when you can't even put this on?

217
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,869
You should be more careful
when using a knife.

218
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,664
Choi Hyeon-jun.

219
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,836
If you stayed by his side,

220
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,175
he wouldn't have become
such a horrible person.

221
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,554
If you stayed with him
instead of running away,

222
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,352
he wouldn't have become so corrupted.

223
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,649
Yeong-ok.

224
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,735
Yeong-ok.

225
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,821
Yeong-ok, where are you going?

226
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,336
What brings you here?

227
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,797
Please get Ms. No out.

228
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,593
Do you like her?

229
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,138
Since when?

230
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,103
The moment you and Mom
began to ruin her life

231
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,023
by fabricating and hiding the truth.

232
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,317
I see.

233
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,487
Ji-tae, ever since you were young,

234
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,657
you were always full of compassion.

235
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,826
When you saw someone crying,

236
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,454
you'd stop and ask,
"What's wrong? How may I help?"

237
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,164
-Dad.
-But

238
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,542
don't you have too much to lose

239
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,337
to risk it all on pity?

240
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,839
I'm not scared.

241
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,218
I see.

242
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,055
Then you can go out
and tell everyone this.

243
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,351
"Choi Hyeon-jun
received an undeniable request

244
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,895
while serving as a prosecutor

245
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,357
and thus covered up a hit-and-run case.

246
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,777
His wife, Lee Eun-su, played along

247
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,572
and destroyed a little girl's life.

248
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,367
In return, the couple received

249
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,911
everything they ever dreamt of

250
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,664
and are on a roll.

251
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,672
And those two people are my parents."

252
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,383
Tell that to everyone.

253
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,678
Why?

254
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,847
You can't do it?

255
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,102
If you don't have the courage to say this,

256
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,980
shut your mouth and become a coward,

257
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,152
just like how I was before.

258
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,973
Ms. Sin, I'm so upset.

259
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,601
I was going to call you.

260
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,687
I'm afraid that he might really die.

261
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,024
He doesn't sleep or drink any water.

262
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,695
He won't even eat your yukgaejang.

263
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,614
This is so frustrating.

264
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,285
What about him?

265
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,037
What did he do?

266
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,502
He is an honorable man.

267
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,921
We can't even compare to him.

268
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,965
Who said something that absurd?

269
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,676
Who's been spreading such nonsense?

270
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,639
Tell me who so that I can sew up
that person's mouth.

271
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,934
Tell me who said such a thing.

272
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,979
I saw him.

273
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,149
What?

274
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,613
I saw him with my own two eyes.

275
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,494
I saw how

276
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,997
terrible,

277
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,542
selfish

278
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,169
and brutal that man is.

279
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,510
Why did you love someone like him?

280
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,264
You're probably mistaken.

281
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,182
You probably mistook him.

282
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,977
He is someone

283
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,106
who would give everything for the poor

284
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,651
even when he didn't have enough money
for himself.

285
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,279
When everyone else

286
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,908
disregarded me
for being uneducated and poor,

287
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,077
he was so considerate that

288
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,455
he hid the fact
that he was a law school student

289
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,583
and told me that
he was also uneducated and poor.

290
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,792
Eul's father

291
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,963
died in a hit-and-run accident.

292
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,841
Why are you bringing that up now?

293
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,552
Choi Hyeon-jun was a senior prosecutor
at that time.

294
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,222
He manipulated the case

295
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,267
for his own success.

296
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,021
What?

297
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,608
I thought she was okay.

298
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,987
Time has passed,

299
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,782
so I thought
she put everything behind her.

300
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,205
But Eul still remembers everything.

301
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,211
I thought she was okay,

302
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,799
but Eul was still living in darkness.

303
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,304
And Choi Hyeon-jun,
who committed the crime,

304
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,267
forgot about everything he did

305
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,062
and is living in paradise.

306
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,524
But that's not right, Mom.

307
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,196
That's not how this world should be.

308
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,665
Jeong-sik was right.

309
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,919
You really have lost your mind

310
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,631
because of that gold digger.

311
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,883
-Mom.
-He is

312
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,927
the most fabulous,

313
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,180
the most wonderful

314
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,933
and the nicest man

315
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,019
I know in this world.

316
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,438
He is someone

317
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,984
you can never dare to be compared to.

318
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,986
You crazy fool! You don't know anything!

319
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,700
And stop calling him by his name.

320
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,910
-He's your father!
-That's why

321
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,543
I almost killed Eul.

322
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,215
I considered that dirty man as my father.

323
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,055
I tried to cover up his embarrassment,

324
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,142
and I ended up almost killing her.

325
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:54,988
Is that why

326
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,075
you quit school?

327
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,707
Is that why you said

328
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,128
you don't deserve to be a prosecutor

329
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,632
and that you're hopeless?

330
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:22,724
Yes.

331
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,523
How can I judge
other people's sins after doing that?

332
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,787
He's running two hours and 30 minutes late

333
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,248
because his fans caught him on the way.

334
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,251
The traffic light was broken,

335
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,005
so he's taking
about an hour and 50 minutes longer.

336
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,886
He ran out of gas, so he went to get some.

337
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,472
Then he changed the engine oil.

338
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,977
While he's at it, he got a car wash.

339
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,735
And now,

340
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,195
he has 43km left.

341
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,198
And 42.9km.

342
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,493
And 42.8km.

343
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,954
How can this happen?

344
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,458
I have really good ears,

345
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,962
so I heard everything you two said.

346
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,672
That's why

347
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,008
after I take you home,

348
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,885
I'm planning to

349
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,346
go back and unlock his room.

350
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,850
If we leave him like that,

351
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,019
he could really die.

352
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,237
They said you can't meet her
even if you go there now.

353
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,926
My name is Sin Jun-young.

354
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,929
I'd like to meet Mr. Choi Hyeon-jun.

355
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,311
Is he not home?

356
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,856
He's not here at the moment.

357
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,067
Dad came home just a while ago.

358
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,904
Why? Is someone here?

359
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,031
-No, it's--
-It's Jun-young, Dad.

360
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,950
That hurts, Mom.

361
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,868
What do you mean, Jun-young?

362
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,913
It's nothing. They found the wrong house.

363
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,581
Go in and study.

364
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,083
Hurry.

365
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,877
Are you

366
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,380
talking about Sin Jun-young,

367
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,131
the celebrity that Ha-ru likes?

368
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,424
Yes, you're right, Dad.

369
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,469
Why would he come looking for me?

370
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,546
I'm sorry.

371
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:25,383
We can't deal
with everyone looking for him.

372
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,969
I'm sorry to barge in like this.

373
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,554
Did you eat dinner?

374
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,389
Yes.

375
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,059
Honey, go inside.

376
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,228
Ha-ru, you should go and study.

377
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,188
I have to talk to him,

378
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,024
so don't come near the study.

379
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,818
This way, please.

380
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,253
Mom, I'm not seeing things, right?

381
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,882
Sin Jun-young
is really in our house, right?

382
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,468
Ha-ru, will you help me?

383
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,016
You don't look so well.

384
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,185
Were you sick?

385
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:21,022
Yes, I was.

386
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,482
That's not good.

387
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,400
Well,

388
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,571
is there a reason you came here
at this hour when you're not well?

389
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,616
Is it because of Ms. No?

390
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,662
Yes.

391
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,206
I thought so.

392
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,500
However,

393
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,088
attempted murder
isn't a crime subject to complaint,

394
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,174
so things won't change
even if I drop the charges.

395
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,387
Isn't this something you know, as well?

396
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,515
At first, the case
was considered as poor driving.

397
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,770
A week later, it changed
into an attempted murder case.

398
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,400
Why did you change your mind?

399
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,319
Because I know for a fact

400
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,698
that she tried to kill me.

401
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,201
Why do you think Eul tried to kill you?

402
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,203
That's what I'd like to know, too.

403
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,332
I heard she's been remaining silent.

404
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,419
Will you ask her for me

405
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,921
why she tried to kill me?

406
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,590
If she really wanted to kill you,

407
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,261
she would've had many chances
in the last five years.

408
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,348
If she really wanted to kill you,

409
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,853
she wouldn't have
turned the car like that.

410
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,312
Mr. Sin Jun-young.

411
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,731
Of course, if I was her,

412
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,567
I would've

413
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,363
never turned the driving wheel.

414
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:29,650
Yong-deuk.

415
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,572
Call...

416
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,325
Call the doctor

417
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,328
and tell him to stay open

418
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:42,747
because a patient

419
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,583
will be there soon.

420
00:34:56,636 --> 00:35:00,098
You came a long way
in the midst of your busy schedule.

421
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,725
But I'm sorry, I can't help you.

422
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,566
I'd like to thank you again
for risking your life

423
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,570
-to save me.
-I regret that.

424
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,200
I don't have any hard feelings
against you.

425
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,868
I can't explain it,

426
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,664
but I do feel
a certain fondness towards you.

427
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,833
Can you believe that?

428
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,130
My daughter is a huge fan of yours.

429
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,257
Would you like to have dinner...

430
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,388
What is this?

431
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,306
I hope

432
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,811
to never see you again.

433
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,439
I hope

434
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,240
this is the last time
I see you in this life.

435
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,381
What brings you here?

436
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,508
I came to blackmail Mr. Choi.

437
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,720
So...

438
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,016
did you succeed?

439
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,521
I'm not sure.

440
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,706
Hello, Mr. Lim. It's me.

441
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,334
It's about No Eul.

442
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,335
No.

443
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,879
You can't let her go.

444
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,090
If you do,

445
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,302
she'll try to kill you again.

446
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,388
-Honey.
-You're Choi Hyeon-jun.

447
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,433
Don't give in to Sin Jun-young's threat.

448
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,768
Honey, please.

449
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,559
Five years ago,

450
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,813
if only Eul had taken that USB
to the TV station...

451
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,567
If only you hadn't taken
that USB away from Eul...

452
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,698
Hey, stop!

453
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,450
Stop right there!

454
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:42,004
If everyone had paid
for their sins then...

455
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,465
If everyone paid
for what they were responsible for...

456
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,014
Eul would've lived a different life.

457
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,308
So

458
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,727
you don't have the right, either.

459
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:01,482
You don't have the right
to be happy with her either,

460
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,401
because like me,

461
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,199
you're also Choi Hyeon-jun's son.

462
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:39,979
SEOCHO POLICE STATION

463
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,724
Eul.

464
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,314
You must be worn out.

465
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,732
I'm fine.

466
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,734
I had fun thanks to Ms. Lee Mario.

467
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,027
My goodness.

468
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,237
First, have this.

469
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,995
Don't ever go near
Choi Hyeon-jun again, okay?

470
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,676
Are you waiting for someone?

471
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,473
Are you waiting for Jun-young?

472
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,101
He's not going to come.

473
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,187
If he was going to, he'd be here already.

474
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,764
Why isn't Jik coming?

475
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,707
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

476
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,625
Yes.

477
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,590
My goodness, you should go see a doctor.

478
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,265
NA-RI

479
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:26,270
Your call cannot be connected.

480
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:27,980
Please leave...

481
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,773
Why isn't Jik answering his phone?

482
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,074
I told you, Jun-young isn't coming.

483
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,284
Don't wait for him.

484
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,995
Can't you see?

485
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,415
Jun-young is avoiding you
because he doesn't want to get involved

486
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,751
with someone who's been in jail.

487
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:51,670
I'll wait just ten more minutes.

488
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,589
Hey.

489
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,885
Stop this. Let's go home.

490
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,387
I'll tell Jik to come straight home.
Let's go.

491
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,306
Come on.

492
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,766
Na-ri...

493
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,773
-Jik.
-Jik.

494
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,734
-Hey, Eul.
-Are you hurt?

495
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,361
-What happened?
-It's nothing.

496
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,237
I sprained it, that's all.

497
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,658
I'm so sorry. I got distracted

498
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,242
and didn't see him coming.

499
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,537
I'm really fine, Eul.

500
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,665
Are you okay?

501
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,050
I'm sorry.

502
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,643
I wanted to take him to a doctor,

503
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,812
but he insisted on coming here.

504
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,028
I'm truly sorry.

505
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,283
Ms. Kim isn't someone
who makes mistakes like this.

506
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,245
Things could've been much worse.

507
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,790
If she stepped on the brakes
just a second later...

508
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,085
I don't even want to think about it.

509
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:29,977
Go.

510
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:34,982
Go.

511
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:44,700
Go.

512
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,962
Ms. No was cleared
and released today morning.

513
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,846
Also, your engagement suit fitting
is at 4:30 p.m.

514
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,227
Go.

515
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,278
Jun-young.

516
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,617
What is all this?

517
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,161
You told me
you didn't want anyone to visit.

518
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:32,206
Were you just drinking
and playing games until now?

519
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,710
Fine, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry for what I did.

520
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:41,507
If you tell me that you want me to die,

521
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,675
I could die right here.

522
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,678
But I don't regret what I did.

523
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,931
I think I did my best

524
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:52,726
by keeping you intact
without a single scratch in the midst

525
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,269
of all this yellow journalism.

526
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:57,147
You didn't keep him intact.

527
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,192
I was the one who resuscitated him

528
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,362
when he was as good as dead.

529
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,447
But all he does is play games right now.

530
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,241
My goodness.

531
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:08,492
By the way,

532
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:12,204
Ms. No was cleared
and released earlier today.

533
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:18,919
Aren't you going to visit her?

534
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,171
Why would he go there?

535
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,674
He should, though.

536
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,968
He's been desperately longing for her.

537
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,262
What are you talking about?

538
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,805
Stop talking nonsense.

539
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,640
Five years ago,

540
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,394
if only Eul had taken that USB
to the TV station...

541
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,855
If only you hadn't taken that USB
away from Eul...

542
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:44,361
If everyone had paid
for their sins then...

543
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,947
If everyone paid
for what they were responsible for...

544
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,657
Game over.

545
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,828
...Eul would've lived a different life.

546
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,040
-You jerk.
-Let go.

547
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,296
I'm going to kill you.

548
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,381
-Jun-young.
-Jun-young.

549
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,606
So

550
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,233
you don't have the right, either.

551
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:29,072
You don't have the right
to be happy with her either,

552
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:30,991
because like me,

553
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,787
you're also Choi Hyeon-jun's son.

554
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,122
How dare you come here?

555
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:23,210
What trouble are you trying
to get him into now?

556
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,048
Jun-young isn't going to hang out
with you anymore.

557
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,258
So get lost

558
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,843
while I'm asking nicely.

559
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,445
No.

560
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,114
What?

561
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,241
I won't get lost.

562
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,244
Why would I get lost?

563
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,375
Jun-young never visited you, did he?

564
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,253
You know how he is.

565
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,631
If he really missed you, he would've

566
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,217
visited you a thousand times already.

567
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,261
I mean, he can walk,
and he also has a car.

568
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:19,641
Aren't you smart enough
to understand the situation?

569
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:24,187
Jun-young got drunk and told me this.

570
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,606
"I don't think love
is about staying loyal.

571
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:31,111
Eul will come looking for me
when she gets released.

572
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:35,157
Just thinking of seeing Eul again
is killing me."

573
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,244
You're lying.

574
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:53,675
NA-RI

575
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,515
It's me, Na-ri.

576
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,767
Go Na-ri.

577
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,770
I have a question.

578
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,522
Why didn't you visit Eul?

579
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,734
-No reason.
-What?

580
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,695
How can you do that to her?

581
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,989
Do you know how eagerly
she waited for you?

582
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,408
I'm sorry, Na-ri.

583
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,827
But I can't stay on the phone--

584
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,954
I don't want to keep talking
to you either, you jerk.

585
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,083
I was just going to ask you

586
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,795
to persuade her from leaving.

587
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,171
What are you talking about?

588
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,090
Where is she going?

589
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,889
Stop crying and tell me.

590
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,143
Go Na-ri.

591
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,444
I was hoping I'd never see you again.

592
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,793
Do you remember? After the trial,

593
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,962
I said I never wanted to see you again,

594
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,757
and that we should end
our ill-fated relationship.

595
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,138
But why are you still
lingering around like this?

596
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,394
Did you want to see how far I would go?

597
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:36,403
Your brother seems like a smart kid.

598
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,531
He looks like a person

599
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,783
who would succeed later

600
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,412
and take good care of his only sister
if nothing happens to him.

601
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,570
SIN JUN-YOUNG

602
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,090
What brings you here this late?

603
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,489
Congratulations on your engagement,
Jeong-eun.

604
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:45,949
Thank you, Dad.

605
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,078
People say it's impossible to have
a happy ending with one's first love.

606
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,997
It's all thanks to you.

607
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,291
I'll be forever grateful.

608
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,169
Her fiancé, Choi Ji-tae,

609
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,380
is my daughter's first love.

610
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:03,049
People say that this engagement is

611
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,926
all about politics and business,

612
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,803
but they don't know what they're saying.

613
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,514
Dad, don't say things like that.

614
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:11,725
When her friends wanted to become

615
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:15,645
a lawyer, a doctor, a famous pianist
and whatnot,

616
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,480
my daughter wanted to be...

617
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,983
What was it again?

618
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,943
My goodness.

619
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,822
I wanted to be Ji-tae's wife.

620
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,200
That's how she is.

621
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:32,370
Unlike how she looks, she's been

622
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,457
hopelessly in love with one man
for almost 20 years.

623
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,211
I'm so nervous.

624
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,049
I'm so nervous right now.

625
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,636
Dad, do you have a sedative?

626
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,352
Come on. Get in the car.

627
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,271
Aren't you going to tell me?

628
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:01,483
What is it that we have to run
without telling Na-ri?

629
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,778
Did the loan sharks threaten to kill you?

630
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,030
We don't have time. Get in.

631
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,657
We can't leave our parents here.

632
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:10,784
How will you live overseas

633
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,535
when you can't even speak
a word of English?

634
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,370
How will you make a living?

635
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,414
-It's better than here.
-What?

636
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,958
Wherever we go, it'll be a thousand times
better than this hellhole.

637
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:20,502
No Eul!

638
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,339
If you aren't coming, I'm leaving alone.

639
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,137
Eul.

640
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,023
We can go now. To Incheon Airport, please.

641
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,571
Is he insane?

642
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,576
Hey, what's with you?

643
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:57,497
You are not going anywhere.

644
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,666
Get off right now, Eul!

645
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,764
It's not working?

646
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,153
-Doesn't that work, either?
-You know it doesn't.

647
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,864
Don't you have cash?

648
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,700
I do.

649
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:35,535
I probably do.

650
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,746
How can a lawyer not even have 10,000 won?

651
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,248
My goodness.

652
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,042
Here. I'll pay.

653
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,755
-Who are you?
-Are you Mr. Cha Taek-jung?

654
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,467
I am. Who are you?

655
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,011
You were the prosecutor
who was in charge of the hit-and-run case

656
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,804
of Mr. No Jang-su in 2006, right?

657
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,558
Who are you?

658
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,731
The real culprit of the hit-and-run case
that Choi Hyeon-jun tried to hide...

659
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,193
What...

660
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,154
Who is it?

661
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,284
Hello. Nice to meet you.

662
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,745
I won't marry Jeong-eun.

663
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,164
I will no longer live my life
for you or Mom.

664
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,334
Just send Ji-tae to Jeong-eun.

665
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,002
It's all because of this dress!

666
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:11,631
I got humiliated in front of everyone,
and I didn't even get engaged!

667
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:12,757
You insane jerk.

668
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,759
Take off the burden
you have to carry forever

669
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,010
and give it to me.

670
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:19,556
However late it is, as long as you get him
to her, the two can still get engaged.

671
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,141
Why can't I get drunk today?

672
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,185
If I see you...

673
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,312
It could be the greatest way
to get back at them.

674
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,981
Then let's date.
