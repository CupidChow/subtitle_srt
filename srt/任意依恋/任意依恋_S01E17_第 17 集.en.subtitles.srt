1
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,345
Pororo.

2
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,849
Pororo.

3
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,742
Guk-yeong. Did you take Pororo?

4
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,703
I can't seem to find him anywhere.

5
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,706
You sent Pororo away a while ago

6
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,750
so he could live where the air is fresh.

7
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:42,917
When?

8
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,837
Why would I send Pororo...

9
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,715
My doctor warned me that

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,427
my memory will slowly fail
as the illness gets worse.

11
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,595
I remember now.

12
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,349
I sent him away.

13
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,561
-What statute expires in 13 days?
-What?

14
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:05,982
I set an alarm saying a statute
expires in 13 days. What does that mean?

15
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,817
Why are you asking me that?

16
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,944
How would I know?

17
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,828
"No, that will never happen.

18
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,290
God can't be that cruel."

19
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,834
That's what I said
as I ignored my doctor's warning.

20
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,848
I took off my engagement ring.

21
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,561
Can I come in now?

22
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,661
But as always,

23
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,664
God never forgot to be cruel

24
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,125
towards

25
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,627
Eul and me.

26
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,884
Aren't you glad to see me?

27
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,514
Why are you looking at me
like you don't know me?

28
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,156
Who's the real criminal
of the case that Choi Hyeon-jun

29
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,032
tried to cover up?

30
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,451
It's Daehan Jeil Party's representative

31
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,871
Yoon Seong-ho's daughter,

32
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,706
Yoon Jeong-eun.

33
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,458
I will give up on Ji-tae.

34
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,673
You should give up, too.

35
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,634
Ji-tae won't ever change his--

36
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,428
It's too late.

37
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,140
There's no evidence or witness.

38
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,226
There's no legal way to catch the culprit.

39
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,728
Have you sobered up?

40
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,523
Let go.

41
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,984
Let go of my arm, you scumbag.

42
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,236
Lose the engagement ring
the next time we kiss.

43
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,615
I'm not kind or insensitive enough
to welcome a woman

44
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,658
wearing another man's

45
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,994
engagement ring.

46
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,122
I will get her no matter what it takes.

47
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,248
You just wait and see.

48
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,591
You came earlier than expected,

49
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:38,968
Ms. Yoon.

50
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,431
I haven't eaten yet.

51
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,392
Can you make me ramyeon?

52
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,186
Sure.

53
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,860
So I decided

54
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,654
to become crueler

55
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,406
than the cruel God.

56
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,390
Shall we kiss?

57
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,645
For real?

58
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,331
I'll go through pain
a thousand times worse

59
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,875
than the pain I've given her.

60
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,546
I'll go through agony
ten thousand times worse

61
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,424
than the agony I've given her.

62
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,765
You know, don't you?

63
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,144
You know who Jeong-eun is dating.

64
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,980
I don't.

65
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,982
Ji-tae.

66
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,735
I don't know.

67
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,081
It tastes

68
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,585
just like the ones
I had freshly caught before.

69
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,588
I'm always blessed with such great dishes.

70
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,133
All right.

71
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,801
Let's drink this

72
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:48,056
and end things between our two families.

73
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,143
Mr. Yoon.

74
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,646
No matter how much I try
to control the press,

75
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,815
everyone already knows.

76
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,401
They know that Jeong-eun got stood up

77
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,445
by her fiancÃ© on her engagement day.

78
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,408
I'm tired of telling excuses
to everyone I meet.

79
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,119
-I don't know what to say.
-Right.

80
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,915
I'm thinking about letting Mr. Baek

81
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,460
take over the secretary-general position
that you were about to get.

82
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,296
You've only been in this field
for five years.

83
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:24,842
Think about it. I can't let a
five-year-old take over important matters.

84
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,385
This is between us,

85
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:30,515
but it didn't make sense
from the beginning, anyway.

86
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,351
But you've already made the announcement.

87
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,685
Sadly,

88
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,981
I don't think
I can help you out either, Ms. Lee.

89
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,150
What do you mean by that?

90
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,445
I'm saying you should give up hoping
that KJ Construction will be

91
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:49,534
in charge of next year's
government project.

92
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,373
Who is this girl

93
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,460
that you chose over my Jeong-eun?

94
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:04,757
I'm just asking out of pure curiosity.

95
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,137
Then why is Jeong-eun

96
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,014
seeing a guy who can't even
compare to Ji-tae?

97
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,892
I'm also just asking out of curiosity.

98
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,229
What are you talking about?

99
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,314
I guess you didn't know, either.

100
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,650
Jeong-eun is dating someone else.

101
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,154
She even ran over to him
after visiting us a while ago.

102
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,363
Honey.

103
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,574
Do you have evidence?

104
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,922
Who is this?

105
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,722
It's Sin Jun-young. He's a celebrity.

106
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,257
IHWASOO YUKGAEJANG

107
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,676
-What's this?
-You can have it.

108
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,764
-Is this a present?
-No, it's not a present.

109
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,724
I found it on the street.

110
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,602
-It's new.
-Exactly.

111
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,562
Whoever had it must've been rich.

112
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,397
Why would anyone throw away a new hat?

113
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,650
I don't like used things.
Give it to someone else.

114
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,734
Hey.

115
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,237
It's not used.

116
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,905
Then did you buy it yourself?

117
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,157
-Yes.
-For me?

118
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,492
Yes.

119
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,662
So just put it on, will you?

120
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,334
Do you really like me?

121
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,418
Yes.

122
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,255
No.

123
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,881
Do you think I'm crazy?

124
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,345
Look, isn't she

125
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:18,182
the girl who asked me out a while ago?

126
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,440
What are you doing here?

127
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,610
I just walked, and I ended up here.

128
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,448
You can just ignore me and go. I'm sorry.

129
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,995
If you want Jun-young back,
you should go to him.

130
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,122
There's no use coming here.

131
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,499
You're only making Yeong-ok feel bad.

132
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,750
I know.

133
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,836
I'm just

134
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,171
not in my right mind right now.

135
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,258
I'm sorry for making you feel bad.

136
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,552
If you're sorry,
you shouldn't be doing this.

137
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,471
If you keep this up,
you'll only stress out Yeong-ok.

138
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,431
-Jeong-sik.
-What?

139
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,890
Just go.

140
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,017
Okay.

141
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,780
Are you crying?

142
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,032
No.

143
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,495
I'm so dumbfounded and shocked

144
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,247
that I can't even cry.

145
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,624
Then why are you like this?

146
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,126
You're not even looking at me
when I'm talking to you.

147
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,090
Have you eaten?

148
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,093
-No.
-Good for you.

149
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,099
I just closed,
and we're also out of yukgaejang.

150
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,437
Do you want to come over to my house?

151
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,078
Why was No Eul

152
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,955
in front of your house?

153
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,624
I'm not sure.

154
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,627
Poor kids must have no pride.

155
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,629
Why does she keep coming back

156
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,881
when you rejected her?

157
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,760
Do I need to explain how she feels to you?

158
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,596
-No.
-Let's stop talking about her.

159
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,144
Who is it at this hour?

160
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,813
Could it be Eul?

161
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,364
I'm Mr. Yoon's aide.

162
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,199
Is this Sin Jun-young's house?

163
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,873
Mr. Yoon wants to meet you.

164
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,045
I'll be back.

165
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,798
I think my dad found out about you and me.

166
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,509
Don't go. He's a scary man.

167
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,593
I'll be fine.

168
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,096
I'm not scared. I'll take care of this.

169
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,682
He's not someone you can fight against.

170
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,395
I'll take care of this.

171
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,522
I'll resolve this and return to you.

172
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,274
Leave it to me.

173
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,237
I love you.

174
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,991
It's hard to believe myself,

175
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,121
but I truly love you.

176
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,214
Okay, then.

177
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,425
Don't be too late.

178
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,719
If you take too long,

179
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,806
I'll go over there myself.

180
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,819
I could've cooked you a meal.
Why did you want ramyeon?

181
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,074
I heard Jun-young
cooks ramyeon for someone.

182
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,703
That's why I suddenly craved it.

183
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,540
Jun-young cooks ramyeon for someone?

184
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,083
Yes. For this woman.

185
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,168
A woman?

186
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,212
Is he dating someone?

187
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,922
I think so.

188
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:19,924
He must be crazy.

189
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,426
Who is it?

190
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,767
She's this really awesome woman.

191
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:41,529
She's rich, from a good family,
sexy and smart.

192
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,864
She's someone who
I can't even dream of competing with.

193
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,079
I hope she gets sick
after eating that ramyeon.

194
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,206
Hey, stop.

195
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,042
I brought this soju for myself.

196
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,045
Did I just drink that?

197
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,715
Gosh, it really is alcohol.

198
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,595
Then did you think this was water?

199
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,763
Yes.

200
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,724
I'm not supposed to drink.

201
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,228
I'm going to cause trouble again.

202
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,525
Hey.

203
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:21,944
Yes?

204
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,156
Why don't you and I have a drink?

205
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,075
Go ahead and cause some trouble.

206
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,703
Let's see how bad it can get.

207
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,244
I don't know when

208
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,663
or how

209
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,376
my memory will start fading again.

210
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,546
So I'm leaving this video.

211
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,719
My mom is

212
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,014
Sin Yeong-ok.

213
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,226
She's an owner of a yukgaejang restaurant.

214
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,897
She only graduated

215
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,316
from middle school.

216
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,112
She gave birth to me
and raised me as a single mother.

217
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,325
I do not

218
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,372
have a father.

219
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,584
I never had one.

220
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,352
My father is

221
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,188
Choi Hyeon-jun.

222
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,357
He's a former prosecutor,

223
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,443
and he's currently a congressman.

224
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,821
He doesn't know I exist.

225
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,202
When he was a senior prosecutor,

226
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,790
he manipulated
Eul's father's hit-and-run case.

227
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,381
MOM

228
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:53,804
What's up, Ms. Sin? It's pretty late.

229
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,142
If you called because you missed me,
I'll run over there right now.

230
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,539
The chair leg broke?

231
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,917
Is there anything else
that needs to be fixed?

232
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,502
What about your table?

233
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,588
How's your washing machine?

234
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,007
I hope your drain isn't clogged.

235
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,633
Eul is in your room.

236
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,347
You said your chair leg broke.

237
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,850
I didn't think you'd come
if I told you she was here.

238
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,770
-Mom.
-Are you dating someone?

239
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,566
Why would you do that
when you're crazy about Eul?

240
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,943
Eul's the one you really like.
Why are you dating--

241
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,487
Mom.

242
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,324
Why? Are you looking down on her

243
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,034
because she isn't well-off

244
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,578
and well-educated
like the girl you're seeing?

245
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,705
Then you must look down on me, too.

246
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,793
Eul's sleeping.

247
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,714
She said she didn't sleep for three days,

248
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,633
so I got her drunk.

249
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,805
She said she causes trouble
every time she drinks,

250
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,557
but she just fell asleep
without doing anything.

251
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,478
Too bad I didn't get to see
how she acts when she gets drunk.

252
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,442
Anyway,

253
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,237
something urgent came up
at the restaurant.

254
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,823
I'll be back after a while,
so take care of Eul.

255
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,740
Mom.

256
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,409
What if she starts causing a scene
after she wakes up?

257
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:25,641
I'm going to the sauna
with a few of my friends.

258
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,810
I may sleep over if it gets too late,

259
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,187
so go home whenever you want.

260
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,227
Where am I?

261
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,459
YOU CAN'T DREAM IF YOU'RE NOT DESPERATE

262
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,377
IT'S NOT THE TIME THAT MATTERS,
IT'S YOUR EFFORT

263
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,590
THE NEW CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE

264
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,014
LET'S NOT POSTPONE TODAY'S WORK
UNTIL TOMORROW

265
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,849
SEOUL NATIONAL UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL,
SIN JUN-YOUNG

266
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,777
LET'S GO, I CAN DO THIS

267
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,252
LOOKING FOR THE HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER,
SIN JUN-YOUNG

268
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,590
Did you sleep well?

269
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,384
Where's Jun-young?

270
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,344
Was he here?

271
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,225
I should feed you some hangover soup
before you go.

272
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,393
Hang on just a minute.

273
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,608
Jun-young did everything he could.

274
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,778
-Pardon?
-He tried so hard to go to law school,

275
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:12,033
and studied hard for
the first bar exam and passed.

276
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,704
But he quit everything.

277
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,959
I'm just saying.

278
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:26,047
He's a man of conscience,
unlike his parents.

279
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,466
So don't resent him.

280
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,888
If you keep badmouthing him,
you're a bad person, too.

281
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,682
Wash your face.

282
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,684
You have sleep in your eyes.

283
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,858
Was Jun-young really here?

284
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,418
You have a great view.

285
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,670
May I talk to you outside?

286
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,352
What's your purpose?

287
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,570
You threatened me with that USB.

288
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,448
And I'm sure you knew that Jeong-eun

289
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:34,950
was to be my future daughter-in-law.

290
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,452
You're playing such an absurd game.

291
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,039
What is it that you want?

292
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,874
A just society.

293
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,542
Stop joking around.

294
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,127
Do I look like I'm joking?

295
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:47,963
It's not

296
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:53,093
that hard for me
to destroy someone like you instantly.

297
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,345
Are you threatening me?

298
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,554
Then,

299
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,266
are you saying you'll keep playing
this absurd game?

300
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,519
You're the one who started
the absurd game.

301
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,105
Have you already forgotten

302
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,109
what you did as a prosecutor just to gain

303
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,611
fame and prestige?

304
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,323
If your purpose is to ruin my life,

305
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,617
then aim only at me.

306
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:23,248
Leave my wife and children out of this!

307
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,584
No.

308
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:31,631
Your family needs to equally
get wounded and hurt.

309
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,259
They need to learn that it's a big sin

310
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,678
to have a person like you as a husband

311
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,722
and a father.

312
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,641
I'm going to warn you once again.

313
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:47,731
Destroying a person like you
is a piece of cake for me.

314
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,941
Stop your game while you can.

315
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,778
Don't you dare touch anything
that belongs to me.

316
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,536
Let me give you advice
in return for your warning.

317
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,666
Don't just warn me. Destroy me.

318
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,045
I plan on spending the rest of my life

319
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,632
as an obstacle on your road to success.

320
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,179
Go on and knock me down
before I knock you down,

321
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,059
before I become more of a jerk.

322
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,986
Please wait just a little bit more.

323
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,863
I'll run over to you in a bit, Jun-young.

324
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,491
Give me my phone.

325
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,661
Did you decide to live a reckless life

326
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,331
just because your engagement
got broken off?

327
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,541
No. I've lived a reckless life until now.

328
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,126
But I'm going to live properly
from now on.

329
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,462
I knew you were childish,

330
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,340
but of all people,
you choose this petty celebrity.

331
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,050
He's someone I love.

332
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,636
-What?
-He makes me happy.

333
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,644
What's the earliest flight
to the United States?

334
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,939
I'm going to send Jeong-eun
to the United States today.

335
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,942
-Dad.
-Okay. Get the ticket ready.

336
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,736
Leave tonight.

337
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,822
Don't even think about returning
before I tell you to.

338
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,824
No, I'm not leaving.

339
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,242
Do as I tell you!

340
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,537
You're not in a state
to make a rational judgment.

341
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,956
It's just like ten years ago.

342
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,128
Come in.

343
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,006
Mr. Choi Ji-tae is here.

344
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,053
Tell him to come in.

345
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,275
May I have a word

346
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,402
with Jeong-eun?

347
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,499
I know

348
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,002
that I don't have the right to say this.

349
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,129
-Then don't.
-Find someone else

350
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,089
other than Sin Jun-young.

351
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,634
There are great guys
who are standing in line for you.

352
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:25,472
But what if I choose Jun-young
over all of them?

353
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,517
I don't even remember liking you
thanks to him.

354
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,690
Can you leave now?

355
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,400
I have to put on a suicide show

356
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,279
saying that I'll kill myself
if my dad continues to disapprove.

357
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,363
Sin Jun-young

358
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,244
approached you with personal intentions.

359
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,247
-What?
-He doesn't like you.

360
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,416
-Ji-tae.
-He just wants

361
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,921
revenge on my father.

362
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,224
YOON JEONG-EUN

363
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,254
CONTACTS
SIN JUN-YOUNG

364
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,047
INCOMING CALL
MR. YOON

365
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,427
Hello.

366
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,098
Right now?

367
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,938
Who did you say is the girl
who's been hitting on Jik?

368
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,399
She's the daughter of the nearby
galbi restaurant owners.

369
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,861
I mean, if things go well with her,

370
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,196
Jik can eat all the galbi he wants.

371
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,949
Also, she's their only daughter.

372
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,243
She may inherit that huge restaurant.

373
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,954
It's going to be great news for Jik.

374
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,915
Gosh, you're making me tell you more
than I should.

375
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,546
I actually haven't told Jik
about who I really am yet.

376
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,300
If he marries me, he won't just get galbi.

377
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,343
I can buy him a cow farm.

378
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,429
I can tell my mom to build him
hundreds of--

379
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:32,056
I understand what you're wishing for.

380
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,267
But Jik needs to be with a rich girl.

381
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,729
He suffered so much because of his family.

382
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,981
He should at least meet a rich wife.

383
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,274
Exactly.

384
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:45,904
If he marries me,
he can live a totally rich life.

385
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,615
I am actually...

386
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,788
I'm the daughter of KJ Group's president.

387
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,626
That's amazing. It's unbelievable.

388
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,960
Exactly.

389
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,631
I haven't mentioned it
because I knew you would feel--

390
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,300
If you're the daughter of KJ Group's
president, I'm Mansour's daughter.

391
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,261
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

392
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,020
This is my mom, and this is my dad.

393
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,563
I'm sure you saw them on TV.

394
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,856
Do you believe me now?

395
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,862
There's no need to get intimidated.

396
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,159
Just treat me the way you've always done.

397
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,619
-Go home.
-My gosh.

398
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,496
There's nothing different
about rich people.

399
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,623
We eat three meals a day,

400
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,833
drink water when we're thirsty
and go to the toilet--

401
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,335
Delete Jik's number right now.

402
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:45,755
From this point on,
don't ever contact him again.

403
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,048
What's wrong, Na-ri?

404
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,883
I thought you wanted him to date
a rich girl.

405
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,052
Forget that. You can never be with him.

406
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,888
Leave before Jik gets here.

407
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:54,973
-Hurry.
-No way.

408
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,933
My gosh. Why?

409
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,726
-I'm not leaving.
-You're persistent.

410
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,436
-Leave.
-No way.

411
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,230
-I'm not leaving.
-I'm telling you to leave.

412
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,315
-Why?
-Ha-ru.

413
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,275
Jik.

414
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,114
Na-ri says you and I
can never be together.

415
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,491
Jik, you have to end it with her.

416
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,867
Why are you saying that?

417
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:15,994
Exactly.

418
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,246
Who are you to make us do that?

419
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,706
You're not even his real sister.

420
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:23,251
If I were, I would have pulled
all of your hair out.

421
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,587
End it with her before Eul finds out.
Right now!

422
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,849
What's with her?

423
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,685
Who is she to tell us to break up?

424
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,605
Things at home
are already complicated enough.

425
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,109
She doesn't have to add to this.

426
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,862
I won't break up with you, so don't worry.

427
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,071
What?

428
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,289
No matter what Na-ri says,

429
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,082
or no matter what my sister says,

430
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,669
I won't break up with you, so don't worry.

431
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,046
Are you sure?

432
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,384
So hush. Stop crying.

433
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,803
You can't leave me.

434
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,557
That galbi restaurant girl
is nothing compared to me.

435
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,768
Why did Na-ri act like that?

436
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,313
-Hey, Jik.
-Yes?

437
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,606
You just

438
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,233
hugged me.

439
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,110
And very tightly.

440
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,037
So stop crying.

441
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,332
I really don't know how to act
if you cry like this.

442
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,416
No.

443
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,293
I'm going to cry.

444
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,421
I'm going to cry
through the night like this.

445
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,882
Why did Na-ri say that?

446
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:04,936
Sin Jun-young

447
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,356
approached you with personal intentions.

448
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,156
He doesn't like you. He just wants

449
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,741
revenge on my father.

450
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,414
I heard something unbelievable
from Ji-tae.

451
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,168
But if you say it's not true,

452
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,545
I'll believe you.

453
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,215
So tell me it's not true.

454
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,427
Tell me that Ji-tae is lying.

455
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,137
We didn't meet by chance.

456
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,724
I approached you

457
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,476
with a purpose.

458
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,145
It was all planned.

459
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,523
I wanted to get back at my father
who abandoned me.

460
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,028
Is this the unbelievable story you heard

461
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,696
from Choi Ji-tae?

462
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,576
You're making things difficult for me.

463
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,329
I said I'd believe you.

464
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,331
I told you to tell me that it's not true!

465
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,707
You should run away.

466
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,961
I might come up
with another scheme to fool you

467
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,589
and keep you around.

468
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:01,177
You should run away from me, Jeong-eun.

469
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,602
Why did you show up like that
so unexpectedly?

470
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,020
Where's your pride?

471
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:12,939
What's pride?

472
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,440
Can I buy it at the grocery store?

473
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,943
If you show up
at the documentary shooting again,

474
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:20,446
the president of Jun-young's agency
will kill you.

475
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,991
Then should I get plastic surgery
so no one will recognize me?

476
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,953
You're so persistent.

477
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,290
Yes, this is Yoon Jun-u speaking.

478
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,543
Pardon? Who is this?

479
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,295
Sin Jun-young?

480
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,549
What made you call me
personally like this?

481
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,592
Yes.

482
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,469
I see.

483
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,596
Okay, sure.

484
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,185
-What did he say?
-He wants you to come

485
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,854
-to tonight's shooting instead of me.
-Don't lie.

486
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,233
You just heard me talking to him.

487
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,985
He's so unpredictable.

488
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,737
Is he joking or what?

489
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,889
Stop frowning.

490
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,475
You can leave if you don't want to do it.

491
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,316
I haven't exactly heard
about the shooting.

492
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,735
What are we shooting today?

493
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,155
It's the first item on my bucket list.

494
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,995
I'm going to propose

495
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,082
to the woman I love
in front of the camera.

496
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,878
Are you really not going to get admitted?

497
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,047
It's a very important day for me,

498
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,882
so please cooperate.

499
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,636
If you're going to frown like that,
call Mr. Yoon.

500
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,765
-Should I call him?
-I'm not frowning.

501
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,269
Satisfied?

502
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,108
So

503
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,195
who's this woman
you're going to propose to?

504
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:27,990
No Eul.

505
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,162
Stop frowning, seriously.

506
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,339
Yoon Jeong-eun of KJ Group.

507
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,094
Let me

508
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,846
go and get a glass of water.

509
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,540
He's so cruel.

510
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,335
How can he ask me

511
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,003
to film him

512
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,381
proposing to another woman?

513
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,800
That jerk.

514
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,796
MOTHER-IN-LAW

515
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,801
-Hello?
-Did you end things with Jun-young?

516
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,933
If you two are finished talking,
come back.

517
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,436
Come back and marry Ji-tae.

518
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,275
I no longer love Ji-tae.

519
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,027
Marriage isn't about love.

520
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,862
I'm going to hang up now.

521
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,155
Ten years ago,

522
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,201
when you fled the scene
after hitting a man with your car,

523
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:40,080
there was a CCTV footage
of the entire act.

524
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,540
I was going to destroy it,

525
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,833
but I kept it because I thought

526
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,251
-it would come in handy.
-You're lying.

527
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,506
You can check for yourself
if don't believe me.

528
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,093
If that goes public,
it won't affect just me.

529
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,303
Mr. Choi will also--

530
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:57,932
Of course, we'll have to pay
for helping you.

531
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,391
But between

532
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,560
a presidential candidate

533
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,229
who has a murderer for a daughter

534
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:08,150
and a mere senior prosecutor
who gave into power,

535
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,821
I wonder who'll shed blood more painfully.

536
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,699
Come back, Jeong-eun.

537
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,993
I'll be waiting.

538
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,554
Didn't you run away?

539
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,973
How far were you planning to go?

540
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,850
If you didn't get caught,

541
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,103
how far would you have gone?

542
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,771
I would've married you.

543
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,817
I wanted to take the one thing

544
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,070
that my father longs and yearns for.

545
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,656
You're willing to marry someone
you don't even love

546
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,450
just to get revenge on your father?

547
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,327
Feelings can always change.

548
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,748
Just like how you came to me
to get back at Ji-tae

549
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,002
but started to like me instead.
You're hesitant

550
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,838
even when you found out
that you've been deceived.

551
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,384
Stop getting my hopes up and leave.

552
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,558
You really are a player.

553
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,605
You really know how a woman
thinks and feels.

554
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,025
Let's do this together.

555
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,404
I think you and I may share

556
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,948
the same destination.

557
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,950
Let's do it together.

558
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,202
I'll decide if I want to kill you
or spare you

559
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,121
when this is all over.

560
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,683
I'm sorry I'm late.
I had people tailing me.

561
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,060
I had to get rid of them.

562
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,229
Can you really air this?

563
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,148
I don't know.

564
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:15,110
My producer is easily influenced
by powerful figures.

565
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,747
We can change the producer if you want.

566
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,625
No, I'm fine.

567
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,502
I like her.

568
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:38,133
Hello, I'm No Eul.
I'm in charge of the filming.

569
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,844
We must be fated to meet each other.

570
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,638
Please make it look great.

571
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,891
Please smudge out my blemishes.

572
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,676
Hyeon-u?

573
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,721
It's you.

574
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,515
It's you, Hyeon-u.

575
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,350
Have you been well?

576
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,812
My goodness.

577
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:36,733
Do you know how desperately
I've waited for you?

578
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,110
I've been busy.

579
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,655
But why do you look like this?

580
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,159
Why did you become so handsome?
You're just my type.

581
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,785
What kind of a person do I seem like?

582
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,621
You're handsome, cool,

583
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,248
sexy--

584
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,458
I thought I was

585
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:55,919
very rational,

586
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,047
reasonable,

587
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,469
fair and good.

588
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,846
That's hard for me to say.

589
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,432
I don't know that much about you.

590
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,018
That's why we should meet more often.

591
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,146
You should invite me over
to your house, too.

592
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,150
Ji-tae, this is bad.

593
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,152
I think you have the wrong person.

594
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,987
This is Hyeon-u.

595
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,364
Here's the latest rumor on Jun-young.

596
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,002
Unbelievable.

597
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,796
-Unbelievable.
-What?

598
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,549
This is about Jun-young, right?

599
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:43,967
Yes, definitely.

600
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,136
I can't believe this.

601
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,597
I caught you two.

602
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,643
Are you going to keep acting
all lovey-dovey at work?

603
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,646
It's not that. This is bad, Guk-yeong.

604
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,440
Did you get caught writing foul comments?

605
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:02,569
My goodness. People who write
bad comments online should...

606
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,030
What's this?

607
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,533
-Is this about Jun-young?
-Yes.

608
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:08,909
Who wrote this?

609
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,702
This is nonsense.

610
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,329
I'll get these jerks.

611
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,373
Jun-young would never--

612
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:19,795
You should all

613
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,713
keep your mouths shut.

614
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,298
And you should

615
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,883
go and check on Jun-young.

616
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,718
-Did you see this?
-I did.

617
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,638
You should call your company's president

618
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,682
and find out what's going on.

619
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,893
Dad, Jun-young is going to be fine, right?

620
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,062
This is all over the Internet.

621
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,523
This is nonsense, so don't mind it.

622
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:44,611
Also, Yeong-ok can never find out
about this, okay?

623
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:48,740
If any of you tell Yeong-ok about this,

624
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,534
I'll make sure I kill--

625
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,618
What?

626
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,621
What is this about?

627
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,874
-Yeong-ok.
-What is it?

628
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,336
Did something happen to Jun-young?

629
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,258
Jun-young.

630
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:13,890
I'm sorry.

631
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,863
May I ask you some questions?

632
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:29,406
Of course.

633
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,325
It must've been hard for a person like you

634
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,077
to decide to go public with this proposal.

635
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,954
What made you decide...

636
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:36,997
It's on my bucket list.

637
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,832
I want Ms. Yoon to answer.

638
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,837
I wanted to publicly tell people
that I have chosen

639
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,547
Jun-young as my life-long partner,

640
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:49,426
and that they should not try to change
my mind or threaten me.

641
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:51,803
Do you two

642
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,306
truly love each other?

643
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:55,849
Of course.

644
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,101
How about you answer that, Jun-young?

645
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,149
Of course, I love her.

646
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,318
Since when have you loved her?

647
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:09,279
-What?
-Since when did you start loving Ms. Yoon?

648
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,823
Tell me the exact date and year.

649
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,543
I don't exactly remember the date.

650
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,462
How can you not remember?

651
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,673
Do you remember

652
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,258
every single moment when you fell in love?

653
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,219
Do you remember the exact date and year?

654
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,178
Of course.

655
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,931
It was on March 15, 2005

656
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,349
at a playground in my neighborhood.

657
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,687
Some kids made fun of my brother
because he didn't have a mom,

658
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,355
and this is what he said to him.

659
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,732
Hush. Stop crying.

660
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,776
Big boys shouldn't cry.

661
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,905
Jik, kids used to make fun of me

662
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,200
for not having a dad when I was your age.

663
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,952
But I never cried.

664
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,745
-Why?
-Why?

665
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:03,375
Because that's what they wanted me to do.

666
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,712
I didn't want to give them
what they wanted.

667
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,427
I won't cry from now on. Just like you.

668
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:19,057
That's the spirit, Jik. You're the man.

669
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:20,350
You're so cool, Jik.

670
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,102
Since that day,

671
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:26,314
my brother never cried
no matter what anyone said.

672
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:28,859
After that day,

673
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,944
I fell in love with him.

674
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,702
How do you love, Jun-young?

675
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,622
I'm not sure what you're asking.

676
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:46,168
Didn't you love another woman
before Ms. Yoon?

677
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,252
Excuse me.

678
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,260
Yes, I did.

679
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,220
Did you even love her?

680
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,723
I don't remember.

681
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,024
-You don't remember?
-I don't.

682
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,988
I'm the type that erases past memories

683
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,865
and starts with a clean slate

684
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,950
when I start loving someone.

685
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,540
I'm sorry.

686
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,250
We'll take a five-minute break.

687
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,519
You're a scary man, Jun-young.

688
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,657
What a great camera.

689
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,243
What's the model?

690
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,538
When everything is over,

691
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,123
shall we start over?

692
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,044
What was your dream?

693
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,629
Pardon?

694
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:21,388
I wanted to become a prosecutor
like my father.

695
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:26,518
So I wanted to visit my father one day

696
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:30,355
to tell him that I grew up well
even without him.

697
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,816
I wanted to receive his compliment.

698
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,279
Didn't you resent your father
for abandoning you and your mother?

699
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:40,115
I thought you wanted to get revenge.

700
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,077
He doesn't even know that I exist.

701
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:49,457
That's why I studied so hard

702
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,168
and passed my first bar exam.

703
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,342
But one day,

704
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,553
I found out about my father's true colors.

705
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:11,646
My father, whom I respected
more than anyone,

706
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,066
was a cruel, evil, and scary man
who'd do anything

707
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,028
to get his hands...

708
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,991
on whatever he wanted.

709
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,431
Why?

710
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,476
What did your father do?

711
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,145
He covered up

712
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:56,483
a hit-and-run case
because a powerful man asked him to do it.

713
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:00,445
He destroyed the CCTV footage,
appeased the witness,

714
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,281
and made a different driver
make a false confession.

715
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:07,827
He also relegated a colleague
who wanted to reveal the truth.

716
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,373
Are you okay?

717
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:14,918
I have to go to the bathroom.

718
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,586
-Do you want me to escort you?
-No.

719
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,130
I'll be fine.

720
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,574
I'm sure I turned it off.
Why is it still recording?

721
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,453
Did you touch this?

722
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,300
From this point on,

723
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,512
don't take your eyes off the screen.

724
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,931
What are you talking about?

725
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,159
Did you do this?

726
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,453
What are you talking about?

727
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,163
The rumor about Sin Jun-young's drug use.

728
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,749
Was it your doing?

729
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,752
Sin Jun-young used drugs?

730
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,298
Read it again.

731
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:49,471
"It has been revealed that
a certain renowned actor and singer

732
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,766
has been using illegal drugs

733
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,809
on a regular basis.

734
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,021
According to witnesses,

735
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:03,109
he used illegal drugs
in a private room in clubs

736
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,529
and had parties
with the girls he came with."

737
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:07,489
This is

738
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,700
not Jun-young, Yeong-ok.

739
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,495
Who would begin

740
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:16,206
such a rumor

741
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:18,500
about our dear Jun-young?

742
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:20,919
I will go

743
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:25,048
and rip this guy into pieces.

744
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,426
Just wait until I catch this jerk.

745
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:32,305
People already assume this person
is Sin Jun-young.

746
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,849
The police and prosecutors

747
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:38,019
will soon begin their investigation
on this case.

748
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,105
Okay.

749
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:41,773
Great job.

750
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,609
Was this the only way?

751
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,695
He's still your son.

752
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,749
Your father called.

753
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,752
Thank you.

754
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,588
Prosecutors are people, too.

755
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,842
They can't always live their lives
according to morals.

756
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:12,428
They can sometimes be cowardly,
get easily tempted,

757
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,556
and they can also make mistakes.

758
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,351
Everyone lives like that.

759
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,604
Not the prosecutors I know.

760
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,941
Even if they're at a disadvantage

761
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,278
and get stigmatized as a bad father
and husband,

762
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:31,156
they still try their best
to stick to their principles,

763
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,575
justice and conscience.

764
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:36,661
Is that the petty reason
why you seduced me

765
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,705
to get back at your father?

766
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,708
That man who died
from the hit-and-run accident

767
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,502
was my girlfriend's father.

768
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,464
And I interfered

769
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,552
when she wanted to reveal the truth
about her father's death.

770
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,439
He was still my father,

771
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,316
and I tried to protect him.

772
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,067
So I killed

773
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,570
my girlfriend.

774
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:20,955
I killed

775
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:23,708
her.

776
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:07,544
Did you two stage everything to fool me?

777
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:10,755
You're under arrest for illegal drug use.

778
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:11,839
Is that possible?

779
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,675
It must have been fun for you all.

780
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,552
Move abroad with your mother.

781
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,220
What happens if I refuse to leave?

782
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,097
I'm going to air it on TV.

783
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,099
That will hurt Jun-young, too.

784
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,183
This is

785
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,686
the first item on my bucket list

786
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,064
and the last one.
