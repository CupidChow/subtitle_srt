00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,592
Next news on Entertainment Weekly.

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,261
Last week, we found out

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,347
that Sin Jun-young is fighting
a terminal disease.

4
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,891
Many of his fans fell in despair.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:20,061
I still can't believe this news.

6
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,273
I really can't believe it, either.

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,360
I heard many people are supporting him
through social media.

8
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,319
That's right.

9
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,822
An elderly grandmother who's been his fan

10
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,699
for a long time
wrote a letter to him saying

11
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,785
"Get well, Jun-young."

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,913
It received a lot of attention
on social media.

13
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,583
Also, his Asian fan association

14
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,501
is raising a fund

15
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,922
to build a forest
to wish him a fast recovery.

16
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,217
Why are you watching that?

17
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,513
Did people love me that much?

18
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,850
I thought I only had a million haters.

19
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,810
I didn't know people loved me that much.

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,520
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,523
Some people are even saying
that they'll die too if you...

22
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:13,031
Well, at least
you're no longer accused of using drugs.

23
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,699
-Guk-yeong.
-What?

24
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,827
You should take care of Pororo.

25
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,288
Don't be hard on him just because

26
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,456
he's picky about food.

27
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,625
Don't say things like that.
You make it sound like

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,918
you're going to die soon.

29
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,506
But I am going to die soon.

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,050
Oh, right.

31
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,635
I...

32
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,805
I forgot to turn the ignition off
after parking the car.

33
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,181
I'll be right back.

34
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,561
By the way,

35
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,940
I shouldn't have called you
a hopeless jerk.

36
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,817
I'm really sorry.

37
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,610
I didn't know that you were sick

38
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,279
and that you weren't in your right mind.

39
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,156
I overreacted.

40
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,839
MOM

41
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,480
-What's with you? Did you cry?
-No. I didn't cry.

42
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,898
Your eyes are red.

43
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,943
My eyes are always loud.
I mean, they're always red.

44
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,617
Don't go inside if you're going to cry

45
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,119
in front of him.

46
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,914
I feel better now,

47
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,916
so I'm going to go inside and see him.

48
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,086
But this is just nonsense.

49
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,880
He's only 28 years old.

50
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,506
Stop it, you fool.

51
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,341
I was doing a good job
of holding back my tears.

52
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,801
Why are you making me cry again?

53
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,071
NO EUL

54
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,284
It's me, Eul.

55
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,828
Can we meet for just a while, Jun-young?

56
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,215
Aren't you Sin Jun-young?

57
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,677
-Do you know me?
-Of course.

58
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,136
You're a top celebrity.

59
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,889
Jun-young, may I get your autograph?

60
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,767
I'm not a star.
I'm just a university student.

61
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,603
Stop lying. You are a celebrity.

62
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,689
No, I'm not.

63
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,734
I know that I'm very handsome,

64
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,279
but I'm not a celebrity.

65
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,906
You should go and play with your friends.

66
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,241
Go on.

67
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,159
My gosh.

68
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,453
I'm sure he's Sin Jun-young.

69
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,123
Well,

70
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,835
I am too good looking
to become a prosecutor.

71
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,505
My goodness.
Maybe I should just become a celebrity.

72
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:07,473
Honey, are your classes over?

73
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,267
Hey, you should be careful.

74
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,685
Jun-young is mine.

75
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,771
If you hit on him ever again,

76
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,232
you'll have your next meal
in your next life.

77
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,628
Well done, Eul.

78
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,176
Did you see the girl's face?

79
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,011
It was a complete success.

80
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,890
She really thought
that you were my girlfriend.

81
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,395
Why don't you try acting as a career?

82
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,857
Okay, I'll dock two.

83
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,572
I couldn't sleep because I had to study.

84
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,282
Give me ten minutes so I can take a nap.

85
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,660
I think I'll get an A for everything.

86
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,913
I'll treat you if I get a scholarship.

87
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,042
-Jun-young.
-I'm going to sleep now.

88
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,835
Don't wake me up.

89
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,004
There he is.

90
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,468
Look. He's Sin Jun-young, right?

91
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,595
Yes, I think he is.

92
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,557
Hey, isn't he Sin Jun-young?

93
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,184
He keeps on saying that he isn't.

94
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,478
What did he say?

95
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,898
He said he's just a student,
not the top star Sin Jun-young.

96
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,320
That's right. He's not a celebrity.

97
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,447
He's just a student.

98
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,408
No way. I'm sure he's Sin Jun-young.

99
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,034
Can you keep it down?

100
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,494
He's sleeping.

101
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,538
Now that I look at him,

102
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,373
he looks uglier than Sin Jun-young.

103
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,958
He's not him. Let's go.

104
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,378
He is. I'm sure it's him.

105
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,957
TO JUN-YOUNG, WHO'S FIGHTING
A TERMINAL ILLNESS

106
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,589
Sir.

107
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,341
Sir.

108
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,179
Ji-tae was just moved
to the regular ward from the ICU.

109
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,148
Ji-tae.

110
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,735
Don't cry.

111
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,447
They said he'll be fine.
He'll wake up soon.

112
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,658
Who did this to him?

113
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,117
Who?

114
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,203
Ji-tae made a mistake while driving.

115
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,748
He ran a red light
and was speeding over the limit.

116
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,250
He wouldn't do that.

117
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,295
He drives more safely than anyone I know.

118
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,340
Dad.

119
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,640
Ha-ru.

120
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,603
I want to be alone with him for a while.

121
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,146
Will you leave us?

122
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,314
Why?

123
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,108
I want to stay here.

124
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,861
He's right. You skipped too many classes
to be here. You should go.

125
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,531
I'll see her off to the elevator.

126
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,700
No, I want to stay.

127
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,048
However hard I think about this,

128
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,427
there's nothing I can do to stop you two.

129
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,012
You two

130
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,474
have become monsters I can't deal with.

131
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,518
Please, think carefully.

132
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,687
Is there really no way

133
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,232
-to stop you?
-No.

134
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,737
I'm sorry to say there is no way.

135
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,949
Root for me, Dad.

136
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,743
I'd like to win this fight.

137
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,539
Ji-tae!

138
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,475
I...

139
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,356
really liked you, Dad.

140
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,193
Although I'm not your biological son,

141
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,990
I really wanted to be a good son to you.

142
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,409
So,

143
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,287
I did anything that would help you.

144
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,957
I did anything that would make you happy.

145
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,336
I even did terrible things I hated

146
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,005
or thought were wrong.

147
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,050
I did it for your sake.

148
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,221
I just went through with it.

149
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,266
If I didn't,

150
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,729
I thought you'd abandon my mother and me,

151
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,569
just like my biological father.

152
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,539
It's my fault.

153
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,292
I shouldn't have done that.

154
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,756
I should've stopped you
from doing anything wrong.

155
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,552
I should've told you were wrong
and that I wouldn't go along with it.

156
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,348
Please keep your promise

157
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,853
that you won't leave Mom.

158
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,274
The person who's disobeying you isn't Mom.

159
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,946
It's me.

160
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,702
You only have to

161
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,374
abandon me.

162
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,399
MS. KIM

163
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,195
There's a problem, ma'am.

164
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,823
We destroyed the black box
in Ji-tae's car.

165
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,658
But a black box from another car recorded

166
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,452
what happened
before and during the accident.

167
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,290
What should we do?

168
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,585
Thankfully, we found it
before the police did, so...

169
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,629
Hello?

170
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:18,964
Mrs. Lee.

171
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,382
Mrs. Lee?

172
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,095
Hold on, Ms. Kim.

173
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,473
I'll put her on the phone.

174
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,488
Hello? What is it?

175
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,414
Okay. I understand.

176
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,595
Yes, I stopped Ji-tae.

177
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,430
It was me.

178
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,103
I wanted to protect you.

179
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,705
Count this as three.

180
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,334
I'll try my best to pretend
to be your girlfriend,

181
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,211
so dock three at once.

182
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,428
What should I do?

183
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,264
Do you want me to shout
that I'm your girlfriend?

184
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,766
Or do you want me to write,

185
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,061
"I'm Jun-young's girlfriend"
on my forehead?

186
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,900
Do you want to write,
"I'm Eul's boyfriend"

187
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,484
on your forehead, too?

188
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,196
I think I had a pen here somewhere.

189
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,115
Will the documentary air
two days from now?

190
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,584
You have to air

191
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,754
everything about Jeong-eun and me.

192
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,255
I know it'll be hard.

193
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,049
People will try to stop you.

194
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,550
But you have to do it.

195
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,344
It's your job.

196
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,348
I'll be gone soon.

197
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,226
But you'll have to continue
living your life.

198
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,605
Build the world

199
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,483
you believe in, Eul.

200
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,071
Don't live in despair.

201
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,657
Don't blame other people.

202
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,284
And don't make excuses.

203
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,498
You'll win if you don't give in.

204
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,215
I came to tell you that. Bye.

205
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,176
I'm the one who called you out.

206
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,596
I have something to say to you.

207
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,861
It's not your fault, Jun-young.

208
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,281
I

209
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,410
thought about it a lot.

210
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,832
And I didn't want to acknowledge it.

211
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,127
But it's not your fault.

212
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,006
It

213
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,176
just happened.

214
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,849
It just happened.

215
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,436
It's just that you and I

216
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,896
happened to be there.

217
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,443
It's not your fault, Jun-young.

218
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,023
I WANT YOU TO BE HEALTHY
DON'T GET SICK

219
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,035
I'M YOUR AUSTRALIAN FAN
I HOPE YOU GET WELL SOON

220
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,413
Jun-young.

221
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,582
Long time no see.

222
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,417
My goodness.

223
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,504
Gosh. This person really can't spell.

224
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,840
It's not bad for a foreigner.

225
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,301
Why can't I stand misspelled words?

226
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,721
Did anyone in my family die
because of that?

227
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,726
Can you pick out what's wrong?

228
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,312
You said you were smart.

229
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,272
You told me you got an A on everything.

230
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,902
Yes, I was the top of my class.

231
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,570
Wait. Let's see.

232
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,697
This person should've written...

233
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,741
Let's see.

234
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,246
Where's Mom?

235
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,039
She's in the kitchen.

236
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,750
She's been

237
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,628
peeling onions in there for days.

238
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,923
Jeez. This person misspelled...

239
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,944
Mom.

240
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,004
What are you doing?

241
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,090
I heard you're peeling tons of onions.

242
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,852
Your son's here. Can't you show me
your sexy face?

243
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,375
Why are the onions so spicy?

244
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,127
They're spicier than garlic and peppers.

245
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,879
Yong-deuk.

246
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,131
You said I wouldn't tear up
if I put these on.

247
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,842
How dare you lie to me.

248
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,305
Who do you take me for?

249
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,140
I'm the owner...

250
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,937
I'm the owner of this restaurant.

251
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,980
How can you lie to your boss?

252
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,239
You said I wouldn't cry if I put those on.

253
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:47,162
Then what is all this falling
from my eyes?

254
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,541
I never cried when I peeled onions
with goggles on.

255
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,462
Yeong-ok.

256
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,215
Please stop. You have customers.

257
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,927
This is so frustrating and upsetting.

258
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,512
I don't think I can stay here anymore.

259
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,765
I'm going to leave early.

260
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,143
Can you close the store later?

261
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,347
Build the world

262
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,017
you believe in, Eul.

263
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,476
Don't live in despair.

264
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,104
Don't blame other people.

265
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,898
And don't make excuses.

266
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,985
You'll win if you don't give in.

267
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,036
Are you Ms. No?

268
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,874
I am Mr. Yoon's aide.

269
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,835
Mr. Yoon would like to see you.

270
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,295
Do you have time?

271
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,424
I guess he's trying to threaten me.

272
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,011
You'll take me even if I decline, right?

273
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,180
Let me take you to him. Please get in.

274
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,487
We had an appointment, right?

275
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,530
I'm sorry that I'm late.

276
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,797
CONGRESSMAN CHOI HYEON-JUN

277
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,305
I guess my threat worked.

278
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:14,434
You came all the way to our house
to pick me up in person.

279
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,562
Is the video about--

280
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,397
It's a video of Yoon Jeong-eun confessing

281
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,651
that she hit my father
with her car and fled.

282
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,906
I guess she already
told her father about it.

283
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,950
He'll probably threaten the TV station

284
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,576
to stop it from airing.

285
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,378
This is the video.

286
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,046
You should take a look.

287
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,548
It'll be aired in two days.

288
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,259
You should check if there are any errors.

289
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,974
I will air this no matter what.

290
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,527
By the way, that's the original.
I didn't make a copy.

291
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,406
What does that mean?

292
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,408
That USB is the only evidence.

293
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,995
Please return it to me intact
so that I can air it.

294
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,139
Ji-tae.

295
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,099
Are you awake?

296
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,270
Gyu-cheol.

297
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,986
What about Jun-young?

298
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,655
What happened to him?

299
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,952
His charges for drug use were dropped.

300
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,415
That's a relief.

301
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,668
I'm very glad.

302
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,380
It's because his terminal illness
was made public.

303
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,305
Ji-tae.

304
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,641
Then how is

305
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,478
Jun-young doing?

306
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,691
Is he doing okay?

307
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,174
No Eul.

308
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,511
You're home.

309
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:58,348
I noticed that you changed your password
back to 0000.

310
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,229
Are you wondering why I'm here?

311
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,399
It's because I suddenly became so famous.

312
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,902
People kept coming and asking to see me.

313
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,863
I'm seeking refuge here.

314
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,783
You have a huge house. Let me stay

315
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,368
until I get less popular.

316
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,665
-This is the South Pacific Ocean.
-Gosh.

317
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,542
I envy them.

318
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,211
I want to go on a trip, too.

319
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,380
Ouch!

320
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,590
-Can you drive?
-Why?

321
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,259
I want to make up

322
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,261
for the promise I broke.

323
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:42,600
I wanted to become a prosecutor
like my father.

324
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,353
So I wanted to visit my father one day

325
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,649
and tell him that I grew up well
even without him.

326
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,444
I wanted to receive his compliment.

327
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,488
That's why I studied so hard

328
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,408
and passed my first bar exam.

329
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:06,583
CONGRESSMAN CHOI HYEON-JUN

330
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:13,631
DAEHAN JAEIL PARTY

331
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,091
Hello?

332
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,432
It's me. Sin Yeong-ok.

333
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,801
Can you please

334
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,179
save Jun-young?

335
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,018
You're in a powerful position,
so must know many prestigious doctors.

336
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,270
Can you

337
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,940
help cure his illness?

338
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,403
I will do

339
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,198
anything you tell me to. So please

340
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,703
save Jun-young.

341
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,833
Yeong-ok.

342
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,714
I told him

343
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,760
to live like you.

344
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,430
I told him to help people in need

345
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,974
and not to ignore the falsely accused.

346
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:32,228
I told him to listen to and help people
who are weak and powerless.

347
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,066
I told him that his father was like that.

348
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,238
I taught him

349
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,575
to live like that,

350
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,453
just like his father.

351
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,042
My goodness.

352
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,251
I have...

353
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,505
I have taught him wrong.

354
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,423
I think...

355
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:04,594
I think he got sick because of me.

356
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,722
I feel so sorry for my poor Jun-young.

357
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,602
I think he's paying

358
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,896
for all the wrong things we've done.

359
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,775
What am I going to do?

360
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,111
What will I do?

361
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,449
What can I do?

362
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,582
What am I going to do?

363
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,592
What is this place?

364
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,136
It's the house I built for us.

365
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,101
Let's stay here for a bit.

366
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,605
You said you built this for us.

367
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,316
Let's live here

368
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,110
just for 500 years.

369
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,364
FISH MARKET

370
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,117
Come and look. They're fresh crabs.

371
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,231
Eul.

372
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,026
My gosh.

373
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,737
How can an octopus cost
as much as 40,000 won?

374
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,322
Can you give us a 3,000 won discount?

375
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,991
How about 2,000 won?

376
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,621
Please give us a 1,000 won discount.

377
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,332
That place over there
sold one for only 30,000 won.

378
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,001
Go and buy it from there, then.

379
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,878
Gosh. You're so stingy.

380
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,714
I was acting all cute for you.
My goodness,

381
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,217
-you're so--
-Keep the change.

382
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,551
Have a great day. Let's go.

383
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,638
-Hey, this isn't worth 50,000 won.
-Knock it off.

384
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,057
This octopus might get angry
and shoot out ink.

385
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,767
Let's go.

386
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,602
You two don't have that card.

387
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,313
How can you win ten rounds in a row?

388
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,774
Didn't you tell me

389
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,275
that this card is worth two points?

390
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,736
-No, that's three points.
-Wait here.

391
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,571
-Why?
-How many times do I have to tell you?

392
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,199
-Just give me the money.
-Gosh.

393
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,327
That card is worth only two points.

394
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,538
That means you only have two points.

395
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,164
You haven't won yet.

396
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,875
Who are you to interrupt our game?

397
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,419
You should just go your way.

398
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,921
-My gosh.
-Yes, we should go.

399
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,382
Wait.

400
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,428
Three of those cards
don't always make three points.

401
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,640
This one.

402
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,309
If this one is included, it's two points.

403
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:45,064
That means she didn't win yet, and...

404
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,691
My goodness.

405
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,860
-You're the winner.
-What?

406
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,695
My goodness.

407
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,655
Hey, go away.

408
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,782
You should use this card.

409
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,117
STRANGER

410
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,077
See? You won with three points.

411
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,829
What? Is this worth two cards? Then

412
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,456
does that mean I won?

413
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,457
Yes.

414
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,626
Listen, there are different rules
for different regions.

415
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,171
That's not worth two cards
here in my town.

416
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,381
No, this is a universal rule.

417
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,885
Does that mean she's been fooling us?

418
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,764
I did not fool anyone. My goodness.

419
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,641
-You did fool them.
-Is this Jun-young's number?

420
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,019
-You can't be trusted.
-It's me, Choi Hyeon-jun.

421
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,812
-How can you fool us?
-Hey.

422
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,481
-Who are you to say that?
-Jun-young.

423
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,483
-Who is this girl, anyway?
-Are you listening?

424
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,360
I won't play with you two.

425
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,528
I quit.

426
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,238
-Where are you going?
-Let me go.

427
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,949
-Give me back my money.
-Hey! Come back here!

428
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,409
You're a fraud.

429
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,036
-My goodness.
-The orchid card

430
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,954
is also worth two points.

431
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,290
Hey, you scored five points, okay?

432
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,001
Yes, I'll be there right now.

433
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,378
No, I can go right away.

434
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,465
Okay. Sure.

435
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,472
Ma'am.

436
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,891
How do I look? Do I look handsome?

437
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,268
Why? Are you going on a date?

438
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,812
No, I'm meeting my father.

439
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,772
My father wants to see me.

440
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,068
Goodbye.

441
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,028
Taxi.

442
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,030
Jun-young.

443
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,012
When did you come back?

444
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,265
-Just now.
-Are you leaving again?

445
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,641
I have an appointment.

446
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,477
I tried to reach you yesterday.

447
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:47,895
I was busy.

448
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,406
Are you mad at me?

449
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,119
Do I even have the right to be mad?

450
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,996
-Honey.
-Ji-tae

451
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,874
probably thinks
that I caused his accident.

452
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,293
Let's keep it that way.

453
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,087
Don't get caught.

454
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,175
Yes?

455
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,052
Mr. Yoon is here.

456
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,475
I came here myself

457
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:31,439
because it's so hard
to meet you these days.

458
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,155
I personally requested someone
to get this wild ginseng just for you.

459
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,366
Give it to Ji-tae once he gets discharged.

460
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,410
Thank you.

461
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,120
Sometimes in life,

462
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,040
things don't happen
the way you want them to.

463
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,791
Things can get difficult once in a while.

464
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:54,045
Let us forget all about our sour past.

465
00:36:56,005 --> 00:37:00,134
I recommended you again
as the secretary general.

466
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,554
What's more important is one's competence,

467
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,640
not one's work experiences.

468
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,941
No matter how hard I think about it,

469
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:20,446
you're the only man I can really trust.

470
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,491
Thank you.

471
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,076
Oh, and one more thing.

472
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,663
There's a nephew of mine

473
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,749
who is around Ha-ru's age.

474
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,045
Why don't we arrange
a blind date for those two?

475
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,840
Jeong-eun and Ji-tae
just weren't meant to be.

476
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,801
We greatly appreciate the gesture.

477
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:45,054
But our daughter isn't very presentable.

478
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,681
I heard you quit being a prosecutor
to become a politician.

479
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,267
Is the election next week?

480
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,605
I told my friends
who live in your district

481
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,066
to make sure they vote for you.

482
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,322
-What date is it today?
-Pardon?

483
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,906
When did we

484
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,701
last meet?

485
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,414
It was back in high school.
The umbrella...

486
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,876
Well,

487
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,462
I told you that I'd return to see you

488
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,007
after I pass my bar exam.

489
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,847
Well, I passed the first exam.

490
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,142
You can give me the law book

491
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,437
after I pass the final exam.

492
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,986
I hope you become a congressman

493
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,907
and make this country a better place.

494
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:35,956
My mom keeps saying
that this country is hopeless.

495
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:40,252
I'm glad there's someone noble like you.

496
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,928
Are you okay?

497
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,055
I'm fine.

498
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,641
I'm just tired.

499
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:55,893
I see.

500
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,813
In that case, I should leave.

501
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,941
Get some rest.

502
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,197
Stay healthy until the next time we meet.

503
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,679
JEONG-SIK'S BIRTHDAY

504
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,774
I'm sorry.

505
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,570
Aren't you Sin Jun-young?

506
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,469
JUN-YOUNG

507
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,307
Is that you, Jun-young?

508
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,153
Hello.

509
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:30,863
What brings you here?

510
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,073
Can you teach us how to play cards?

511
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,702
People keep fooling us
because we don't know the rules.

512
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,454
Oh, okay.

513
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,126
Where's your husband?

514
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,128
He had to go somewhere.

515
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,923
He'll be back soon.

516
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,217
-Come in.
-Great.

517
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,010
Let's go.

518
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,895
NO EUL

519
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,027
Yes, this is Jun-young's phone.

520
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,616
Why are you picking up his phone?

521
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,036
He left his phone on the kitchen table.

522
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,080
-Who is it?
-It's Ms. No.

523
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,624
Ms. No, where are you?

524
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,584
Aren't you going to bring in the videos?

525
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,753
Mr. Yoon can't finish
the editing process because of you.

526
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,965
I heard Jun-young asked you
to do the filming instead of Mr. Yoon.

527
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,175
I couldn't film anything that day.

528
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,346
Jun-young was too sick.

529
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,556
Really?

530
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:41,308
I'm going to kill you if you're lying.

531
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,270
Why are you being so mean to her?

532
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,107
I'm sorry, but right now,

533
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,943
Jun-young is busy
throwing a birthday party.

534
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,945
A birthday party?

535
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:56,323
Yes. It's my father's birthday.

536
00:42:56,448 --> 00:43:00,452
I'll tell Jun-young that you called.

537
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,246
You're not telling him anything.

538
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:05,374
You can't let the reporters
catch them together.

539
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:08,669
Also, Jun-young has no time to meet her.

540
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,112
How old are you?

541
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,122
Stop pinching your thigh.

542
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,502
Stop pinching your thigh
to keep yourself from crying.

543
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,715
What are you talking about?

544
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,593
I'm a man, you know.

545
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,386
I'm not

546
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,098
the type that cries

547
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,310
anywhere and anytime.

548
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,366
That looks good.

549
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:26,705
What is this?

550
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,041
Is wearing sunglasses
the dress code for today?

551
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,836
Fine. I'll wear mine, too.

552
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,674
Is Ms. Sin not coming today?

553
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,342
No.

554
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,636
She's busy.

555
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,680
What can she be busy with?

556
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,682
She's such a weird mother.

557
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,809
She doesn't have much time to see her son.

558
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,977
Excuse me. Hey.

559
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,064
I'm just saying--

560
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,566
Like I said, she is quite odd.

561
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,944
She's a huge baby, too.

562
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,072
All right.

563
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,991
Let Jeong-sik's birthday party begin.

564
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,525
Blow out the candles and make a wish.

565
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,609
Okay.

566
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,659
May I make a wish, too?

567
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,911
Sure. Go ahead.

568
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,292
Please take good care of my mom.

569
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,969
Don't let her suffer.

570
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,973
Don't let her get lonely.

571
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,811
Please stay beside her.

572
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,730
Okay.

573
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,108
I will

574
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,653
take care

575
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,532
of your mom with my life.

576
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,580
So don't worry about her.

577
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:32,789
Thank you, Jeong-sik.

578
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,756
I'll trust you.

579
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,762
I'll leave without worrying about her.

580
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,255
Who is that? Is that Ms. Sin?

581
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,598
I came with Na-ri, but she said

582
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:17,102
she can't bear to see you,
so she's waiting outside.

583
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,828
She also

584
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,497
wanted me to apologize to you

585
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,167
on her behalf for something.

586
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:41,752
For what?

587
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:45,088
When you and Na-ri used to date
a long time ago,

588
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:52,721
she said she's partly responsible
for the breakup.

589
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,933
Na-ri said she cheated on you

590
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,644
with another handsome guy.

591
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:03,065
Na-ri was so confident
about her looks back then,

592
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,360
so she thought men were like chips
sold in stores

593
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,321
that were available
whenever she wanted them.

594
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:12,908
But after losing you,
she said she finally realized

595
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,410
what an awesome and cool person

596
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,412
you really were.

597
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:21,833
Gosh. Go Na-ri, you're so dead.

598
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,922
You were once my hero. Do you know that?

599
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:30,217
That means I'm not your hero anymore?

600
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,095
Now, you're

601
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,806
just a jerk.

602
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,476
If you want to become my hero again,

603
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,522
don't die and find a way to live.

604
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,611
My dad once told me

605
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,738
that people die

606
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,116
because they're lazy,

607
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,202
because they're too lazy to breathe.

608
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,039
Okay.

609
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,334
I'll try my best to keep breathing.

610
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,760
Where's my sister?

611
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,055
Why are you asking me?

612
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,641
I called her earlier,
and she said she was with you.

613
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,643
No, I haven't seen her...

614
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,856
What is this place?

615
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,649
It's the house I built for us.

616
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:28,942
Let's live here

617
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,486
just for 500 years.

618
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,575
I'm so stupid.

619
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,537
How stupid.

620
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,876
I'm going to the US tomorrow

621
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:48,879
with Mr. Oh's second son.

622
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,717
If he seems okay, I might marry him.

623
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,720
I won't be back for a couple of years.

624
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,974
While you were lying here,

625
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:04,770
KJ Group reported you
for embezzlement and malpractice.

626
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,898
You'll be summoned by the prosecution
once you get out.

627
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:11,151
Why did you go down that road like a fool?

628
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,862
Even your own parents abandoned you.

629
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,533
Goodbye.

630
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,119
Take care.

631
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:22,954
I'm sorry, Jeong-eun.

632
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,211
I should've told you to stop.

633
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,548
I am truly sorry.

634
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,764
When you fled after the car accident,

635
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:45,060
I shouldn't have just despised you.

636
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,730
I shouldn't have stayed silent.

637
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,608
I should've told you
that what you did was wrong.

638
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,154
I should've persuaded you
to turn yourself in.

639
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,244
You're getting away with it this time.

640
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,747
But one day, when you realize
how wrong you were,

641
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,251
make sure you punish yourself.

642
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,504
You lived

643
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,299
a sinful life.

644
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,221
I'd like to sleep.

645
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,516
Please leave now.

646
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,385
Father.

647
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:04,973
This will be

648
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,893
the last time I call you that.

649
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:10,520
Also,

650
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,398
the fact that I'm your son...

651
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,030
I will consider it a disgraceful,

652
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,742
embarrassing,

653
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,997
and shameful thing until the day I die.

654
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,043
I hope you become a congressman

655
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,838
and make this country a better place.

656
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:44,012
My mom keeps saying
that this country is hopeless.

657
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:48,391
I'm glad there's someone noble like you.

658
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,696
He was still my father,

659
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,448
and I tried to protect him.

660
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,326
So I killed

661
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,079
my girlfriend.

662
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,841
Hello, this is No Eul.

663
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,888
What's the real reason
why you gave me this USB?

664
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,433
I wanted you

665
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,728
to be the first one to see the video.

666
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,691
How can you trust me with this?

667
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,568
You already know

668
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:43,113
what kind of person I am.

669
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,241
I do.

670
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,328
You're Jun-young's father.

671
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,041
Come in.

672
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:47,927
Eul.

673
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,556
No Eul.

674
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,423
Eul.

675
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,136
I'm sorry.

676
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,642
I'm so sorry.

677
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,774
I made a big mistake.

678
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,335
Eul.

679
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,925
You have a really high fever.

680
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:12,762
I'm okay.

681
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:15,348
You're not okay.

682
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,810
Why didn't you call me?

683
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,063
You should've called and said you're sick.

684
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,774
You should've told me to come right away.

685
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,278
I'm going to call an ambulance.

686
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:35,869
Eul.

687
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,412
I'm not going to a hospital.

688
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:39,873
How can you not go to a hospital
when you're so sick?

689
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:44,002
-I'm not going.
-You might die.

690
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,504
I don't care.

691
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,175
Why not?

692
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,636
Do you want to die with me?

693
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,890
Do you want to go with me?

694
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,353
Why not?

695
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,023
Can't I?

696
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:08,693
You can.

697
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,322
Let's die together, then.

698
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,776
Can you kill her?

699
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,986
She says she wants to die.

700
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,322
Do what you can to kill her.

701
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:55,865
You lunatic!

702
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,451
How can you do this
to the mother of a dying boy?

703
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,079
Mr. Choi. Is everything in the video true?

704
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,872
How dare you challenge me.

705
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,290
I will crush all of you.

706
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,668
Do you want to go back
to where you came from?

707
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,753
Jun-young didn't recognize me?

708
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,047
Do you know me?

709
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,259
Sorry for not recognizing you.

710
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,971
They're going to issue
a warrant for your arrest soon.

711
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,474
Let me live!

712
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:25,061
Let me live, please.
