1
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,720
I came all the way here
to take you to that island.

2
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,188
But I'll just go alone.

3
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:05,815
If I take you there,

4
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,611
I'll want to hide you there

5
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,698
and stop you from going to anyone else.

6
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,120
So don't come into my sight.

7
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,542
If I ever see you again,

8
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,800
I'm going to just take you away.

9
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,385
How can you sleep right now?

10
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:22,016
How can you sleep
when everyone is worried sick?

11
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,832
Are you filming a movie?

12
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,586
You're an actor to the bone.

13
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,466
I'm so stupid.

14
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,512
I can't believe what I did for you. Why
was I even worried about a jerk like you?

15
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,348
I took a taxi here all the way from Seoul.

16
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,059
I waited in the freezing cold for a boat.

17
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,020
I also got bitten by a seagull.

18
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,147
Gosh, my money.

19
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:13,067
I could've fed Jik meat for days
with that money.

20
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,240
One.

21
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,299
Do you think this is a dream?

22
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,802
It's not. I really am Eul.

23
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,513
I came all the way here to find you.

24
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,727
Two.

25
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,689
You really do think
it's a dream, don't you?

26
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,859
It's me, Eul.

27
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,570
Three.

28
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,449
Unbelievable.

29
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,201
I should pinch you awake.

30
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,211
Go.

31
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,713
-What?
-Go away.

32
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,384
-What?
-Get out of my sight.

33
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,727
What should I do?

34
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,564
I guess I really did make a huge mistake.

35
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,443
What else did I do wrong?

36
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,993
If I ever drink again,
I'm a real lunatic. A lunatic.

37
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,119
My goodness.

38
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,078
-Here. You didn't eat breakfast, right?
-Ouch.

39
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,747
I'm sorry.

40
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,543
Didn't I tell you?

41
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,795
I act crazy when I'm drunk.

42
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,759
The worst thing is
that I don't remember a thing.

43
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,346
Four.

44
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,891
I'm not sure what I did, but...

45
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,021
I need to remember what I did
if I'm going to apologize.

46
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,942
Gosh, I really do want to apologize.

47
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,073
Jeez. Why can't I remember anything?

48
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,742
Darn it.

49
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,453
Five.

50
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,915
HUSBAND

51
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,972
Hi, Hyeon-u.

52
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,560
Why haven't you been picking up?

53
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,979
Where are you?

54
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,731
Well, the thing is,

55
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:41,984
something urgent came up.

56
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,195
I'm sorry for leaving
without saying goodbye.

57
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,918
Are you with Sin Jun-young?

58
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,003
No.

59
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,425
Yes.

60
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,816
I did something wrong to him.

61
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,735
I'm sorry, I'll call you back later.

62
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,462
Going up.

63
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,798
The doors are closing.

64
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,094
Sir, take a look at this.

65
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,180
What's this?

66
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,354
I believe Ms. Yoon saw those photos.

67
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,772
I thought you stopped the reporters.

68
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,232
I'm sorry, sir.

69
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,778
Did you go to Sin Jun-young's concert
last night?

70
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,989
I think she started doing

71
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,782
a background check on Ms. No.

72
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,934
Gosh. Why can't I remember anything?

73
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:41,771
Gosh.

74
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,272
Gosh.

75
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,484
I can't remember a single moment.

76
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,911
Hey.

77
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,746
-There's something on your shoe.
-Six.

78
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,097
Aren't you hungry?

79
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,391
I'll buy breakfast.

80
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,394
Let's eat before we go.

81
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,895
Please?

82
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,697
Fine.

83
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,324
I did throw a fit while I was drunk.

84
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,952
So what?

85
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,581
My dad told me that people who
hold grudges on others for things they did

86
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,125
when they were drunk
are the pettiest people on earth.

87
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,587
He told me to never befriend
anyone like that.

88
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,631
Seven.

89
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,138
Do you want to hit me?

90
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,767
Go ahead.

91
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,145
Hit me until you feel better.

92
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,272
Here.

93
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,608
Eight.

94
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,602
Gosh, you really hold grudges
for a long time.

95
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,606
How can you be so unforgiving?

96
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,693
Honestly, you're the reason I got drunk.

97
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,654
You're the contributor.

98
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,531
Shouldn't you be apologizing instead?

99
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,784
Get out.

100
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,993
No.

101
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,164
Nine.

102
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,298
Taxi.

103
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,052
I really don't remember.

104
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,389
I really don't know what I did

105
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,974
to make you this mad.

106
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,226
Nine and a half.

107
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,229
I remember you carrying me on your back.

108
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,605
Nine and a half and a quarter.

109
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,400
I also remember throwing up on your back.

110
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,027
Nine and a half
and a quarter and an eighth.

111
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,195
You changed my...

112
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,369
I also remember you
helping me get changed.

113
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,500
I remember you confessing...

114
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,757
Hey.

115
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,760
Your car's right there.
Why are you taking a taxi?

116
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,970
Do you have money to burn?

117
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,225
Where may I take you?

118
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,394
To Seoul, please.

119
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,871
Hey, come on, wake up.

120
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,164
Oh, hey.

121
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,332
Where's Jun-young?

122
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,377
He left his car and took a taxi?

123
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:37,590
What in the world have you done
to Jun-young?

124
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,842
That's what I want to know.

125
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,344
What have I done?

126
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,973
What do you think I did

127
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,975
to make him so angry?

128
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,769
Are you asking me that?

129
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,730
Right, how would you know?

130
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,692
I'm pretty sure
I did something very wrong.

131
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,322
Gosh, I can't remember a thing.
I really can't.

132
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,656
My goodness.

133
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,283
That's not going to help.

134
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,368
Doing this helped me
remember a few things.

135
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,536
Really?

136
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,955
Then come over here. Come on.

137
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,792
Do you remember anything?

138
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:44,365
Excuse me, sir. May I borrow your phone?

139
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,702
Are you Sin Jun-young?

140
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,292
IHWASOO YUKGAEJANG

141
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,173
My goodness.

142
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,758
Here you go again.

143
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,385
Stop it. Why are you taking my--

144
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,011
Hey, Yong-deuk.

145
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,221
What were you doing?

146
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,098
Didn't I tell you to take away her bowl

147
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,641
if she starts eating bibimbap?

148
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,685
-I forgot.
-Give it back.

149
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,186
Stop.

150
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,938
Hurry up and spit it out.

151
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,398
You already have a small stomach.

152
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,484
How are you going to digest everything?

153
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,237
Come on. Spit out everything you have
in your mouth.

154
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,288
Who is it? Is that Jun-young?

155
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,000
Who's Jun-young?

156
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,962
Hello?

157
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,882
It's me, Mom. You must've been worried.

158
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,178
I'm sorry, but you have the wrong number.

159
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,106
It's Jun-young, right?
It was him who called, right?

160
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,191
No, it wasn't that jerk.

161
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,986
Really? Let me check, then.

162
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,114
Jeong-sik!

163
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,954
Mom.

164
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:16,540
It's not your mom. It's me, Jeong-sik.

165
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,835
Hey, Jeong-sik.

166
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,713
Are you insane or what?

167
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,467
When are you going to stop
making your mom suffer?

168
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,553
Goodness, do you know how worried she was?

169
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,057
Stop lying. Why would I worry
about a jerk like that?

170
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,060
Hang up. Hang up the phone. My goodness.

171
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,687
Jun-young, your mom is eating bibimbap

172
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,689
in a huge bowl right now.

173
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,358
You know what that means, right?

174
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,567
-Jeong-sik!
-That means,

175
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,112
your mom is insanely worried
about you right now.

176
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,197
Get it?

177
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,199
Ouch.

178
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,451
You jerk.

179
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,786
Hang up!

180
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,205
I know.

181
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,832
I know how much Mom's worried about me.

182
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,584
But how did you end up

183
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,295
getting involved with a gold digger?

184
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,922
How?

185
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,801
My goodness, did you forget already?

186
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,428
Guk-yeong got involved with a gold digger,

187
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,430
and ended up losing all of my assets

188
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,224
and everything down to his underwear.

189
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,267
Don't you remember what happened?

190
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,728
Guk-yeong even went to prison
because of her.

191
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,523
Don't you...

192
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,942
Don't you remember how you covered for him

193
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,819
with your front money?

194
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,904
She's not a gold digger.

195
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,406
What?

196
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,952
Is she a silver digger, then?

197
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,453
I thought you were a star.

198
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,289
You said you were amazingly rich.

199
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,752
But how can you have
such bad taste in women?

200
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,462
How could you let such a--

201
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,839
I like her, Mom.

202
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,883
What?

203
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,680
I just recently figured it out myself.

204
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,934
I actually love her

205
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,729
a lot.

206
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,857
My goodness. This is a bad one.

207
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,818
Jun-young, you need to
get a grip on yourself.

208
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,570
That's why I'm running away.

209
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,616
If I continue to see her,

210
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,661
I might do all sorts of drastic things.

211
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,000
So, I'm running away from her.

212
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,920
He wasn't joking?

213
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,465
That's right. That's what I believe.

214
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,509
This really upsets me,

215
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,888
but I think Jun-young really likes you.

216
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,932
He even kicked out Pororo

217
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,311
when he found out
you were allergic to dogs.

218
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,774
-Unbelievable.
-Right.

219
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,193
There are so many better women out there.

220
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,028
This just isn't possible.

221
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,154
Exactly.

222
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,033
He must be insane.

223
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,286
Why would he like me?

224
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,914
My goodness. You're a decent woman.

225
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,958
You know when to acknowledge the truth.

226
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,045
That's something I really appreciate.

227
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,755
I mean, of course,

228
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,007
Prince Charming did marry

229
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,260
the unfortunate Cinderella.

230
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,013
But Cinderella was a nice girl.

231
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,724
She was diligent and honest, too.

232
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,309
I'm nice, too.

233
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,311
I'm diligent

234
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:26,939
and honest.

235
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,401
But come to think of it,

236
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,822
he did look a little sick these days.

237
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,741
When he was shooting his last drama,

238
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,369
he got hit hard on the head
with a wooden stick.

239
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,995
Maybe his brain swelled up.

240
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,790
I heard

241
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,793
that you can't think straight
if your brain swells up.

242
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,254
I should take him to a doctor soon.

243
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,839
My gosh.

244
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,091
That's enough.

245
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,176
I'm sitting right here.

246
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,721
Do you really not remember
what you said to him?

247
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,434
But

248
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,230
if Jun-young wasn't joking

249
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,192
and was telling the truth...

250
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,904
If he really likes me,

251
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,866
what should I do?

252
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:24,288
I'll take you to a doctor along with
Jun-young. Let's get you looked at.

253
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:25,956
Okay?

254
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,813
I'm so sorry, sir.

255
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,733
Can you go back
and drive to the back door?

256
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,497
How have you been?

257
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,291
You must be hungry.

258
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,127
I'm sorry. I'll go and get you some food.

259
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,116
Sin Jun-young is in a critical condition?

260
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,620
A brainstem glioma?

261
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,747
Yes. Apparently, it's in a bad location

262
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,207
so it's hard to operate.

263
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,835
Jun-young himself is also avoiding

264
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,670
hospitalization and treatment.

265
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,592
His mom doesn't know about this, does she?

266
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,469
No. He asked to keep it secret

267
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,596
from his family and the agency.

268
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,271
This is sad news

269
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,440
for Jun-young and his mom.

270
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,661
He's not qualified.

271
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,289
I understand that you like him,

272
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,084
but he's not helpful to our party.

273
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,962
Mr. Choi, that's a bit too harsh.

274
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,589
Mr. Kang, you know this, too.

275
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,424
He was charged with stock manipulation,

276
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,551
embezzlement, malpractice,
and tax evasion.

277
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,554
He's still being investigated
by the prosecution.

278
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,973
It doesn't make sense
to recommend someone like him

279
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,767
as our proportional
representation candidate.

280
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,519
He'll soon be cleared
of all those charges.

281
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,189
-There's no need to--
-That's just temporary.

282
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,609
This issue will cause trouble
again one day.

283
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,444
I'm sure

284
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,656
everyone here has some faults.

285
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,618
In the process of achieving big things,

286
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,163
you may do some wrong things,
whether it's intentional or not.

287
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,417
Politics is all about
helping each other in times of need.

288
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,172
That kind of politics leaves regrets.

289
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,591
It makes you do things

290
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,511
even when you don't want to.

291
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:14,267
Mr. Choi, you must have
a lot of free time.

292
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,270
You have time to regret things?

293
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,040
That scum.

294
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,680
What is it?

295
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,390
What's going on?

296
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,852
Ms. Jang, these people
keep cursing Jun-young.

297
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,772
My goodness, I thought
there was a fire or something.

298
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,399
"'Everyone's lover'? Nonsense."

299
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,361
"How do you feel
after betraying your fans for a girl?"

300
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,657
"Jun-young betrayed me.
I'm going to sue him."

301
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,075
Unbelievable.

302
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,035
And look at this.

303
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:19,666
My goodness.
"Same plan, different skill of betrayal."

304
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,294
This is Jun-young's movie. Who did this?

305
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,047
"We all got betrayed
because of his first love."

306
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,051
My gosh. Why did they make
such an effort to create these?

307
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,720
They must have a lot of time
on their hands.

308
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,225
Ms. Jang.

309
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,103
You know that it's my dream
to marry Jun-young, right?

310
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,980
I told you, you can't do that.

311
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,440
His past?

312
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,109
I don't care about things like that.

313
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,906
But I have no idea if he's dead or alive.

314
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,201
Ms. Jang.

315
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,828
Can you bring me more perfume
from my room?

316
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,166
You've already used a lot.

317
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,126
Stop making a fuss and come out.

318
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,628
No.

319
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,172
I still smell like garbage.

320
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:10,258
You don't smell like anything.

321
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,679
I can only smell flowers.

322
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,807
Come out before your body swells up.

323
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,231
I still smell bad.

324
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,317
Jik, that jerk.

325
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,819
I'm going to get back at him.

326
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,454
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

327
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,790
Please leave a message after the beep.

328
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,833
Why is he not picking up?

329
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,418
Is he watching a video lecture?

330
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,965
-Who?
-Lee Hyeon-u.

331
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,467
He's preparing for a civil service exam.

332
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,177
Which room is he in?

333
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,971
Lee Hyeon-u?

334
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,931
I've never heard of that name.

335
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:01,518
That's weird.
He lived here for over two years.

336
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,103
Just a second.

337
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,313
OFFICE

338
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,607
This is him.

339
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,693
I don't think I've seen him before.

340
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,028
That can't be. Can you take another look?

341
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,113
Let's see--

342
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,490
BROTHER-IN-LAW

343
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,867
Where are you?

344
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,870
I'm at your place.

345
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,038
My place?

346
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,167
Right.

347
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,753
I actually moved.

348
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,839
Didn't I tell you?

349
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,632
No, you didn't.

350
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,926
Where did you move to?

351
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,177
I'll go there.

352
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,929
It's all right.

353
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,765
Something came up at home,
so I'm in Daejeon.

354
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,935
Why? Is this urgent?

355
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,025
I'm on my way back to Seoul,

356
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,654
so I'll go to the store you work at.

357
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,115
Okay. See you later.

358
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,582
Hey.

359
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,176
Why were you looking for me so urgently?

360
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,511
It's nothing.

361
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,473
Here.
This is the most expensive drink here.

362
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,809
You're being too obvious.

363
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,479
What is it?

364
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,522
I still have ten minutes
until my shift ends,

365
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,566
-so I'll make it short and quick.
-Okay.

366
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,779
My sister used to have
a crush on Jun-young.

367
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,781
It's when we lived in Suyu-ri.

368
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,450
I saw what she wrote in her diary.

369
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,245
She gave up on him
because he was Na-ri's boyfriend.

370
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,498
So, she'll probably easily fall for him

371
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,959
if he starts to show interest in her.

372
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,548
But isn't it a good thing

373
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,426
if a superstar like him likes Eul?

374
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,262
Jun-young and my sister

375
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,932
are living in different worlds now.

376
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,519
People should meet people
living in the same world.

377
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,730
People who live, eat,

378
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,607
and dress similarly.

379
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,819
People who have similar goals.

380
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,574
So,

381
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,910
what is it that you're trying to say?

382
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,621
Can you step in and stop her?

383
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,124
You're the only one who can bring her

384
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,959
back to reality.

385
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,837
Please?

386
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,373
Ouch.

387
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,959
Where are the kitchen gloves?

388
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,055
When did you wake up?

389
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,935
You seemed to be asleep,
so I didn't wake you.

390
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,494
Your manager let me in
through the back door.

391
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,706
He said there were reporters
at your front door.

392
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,082
Nine

393
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,294
and a half and a quarter
and an eighth and a sixteenth.

394
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,670
I'm fine now.

395
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,089
I have thick fingers,
so it doesn't really hurt.

396
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,593
Where are you going?

397
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,303
Aren't you going to eat?

398
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,476
I put in so much effort to cook that.

399
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,774
Forget it. Don't eat, then.

400
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,860
I'm going to eat it all.

401
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,954
Whatever.

402
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,998
All that matters is the taste.

403
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,804
Gosh, that's salty.

404
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,141
Come to think of it,

405
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,560
does he think I have a disease or what?

406
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,480
Why does he keep avoiding me?

407
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,900
If he's mad, he can just tell me
what he's mad about.

408
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:26,110
He can just confront me face to face.

409
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,404
Gosh, how petty.

410
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,597
Hey, what are you doing?

411
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,267
He turned the lights on
and turned them off again?

412
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:02,563
My goodness.
What in the world are you imagining?

413
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,943
Mr. Kim, why are you being like this?

414
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,322
I just sent the housekeeper there
to feed his dog.

415
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,953
Jun-young really isn't at home.

416
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:20,123
Stop wasting your time and just go home.

417
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,541
Aren't your kids waiting for you?

418
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,084
Best comments of the day.

419
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,421
"No one has seen Jun-young or Eul
for two days.

420
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,008
Maybe they committed suicide
like Romeo and Juliet."

421
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:33,928
To be honest, Jun-young just called me

422
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,681
and said he did what he did out of stress.

423
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:41,978
He acted without thinking,
and he doesn't know why he did it.

424
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,563
So, I told him

425
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,732
that anyone in his shoes
could have gone crazy

426
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,734
and that he should go somewhere
to take a few days off.

427
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,694
"Wow, will No Eul

428
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:53,114
become Juliet
instead of a gold digger overnight?"

429
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,616
Can't you go through a day
without reading those comments?

430
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,537
Of course.

431
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,497
He's definitely

432
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,624
not by himself.

433
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,419
He's with his manager.

434
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,213
Ms. No is probably already in Seoul.

435
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,506
Call her if you don't believe me.

436
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,632
Hello.

437
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:16,012
Yes. If Jun-young really likes Ms. No,

438
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,389
I'll kill myself in front of you.

439
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:22,518
Yes. If he has that bad
of a taste in women,

440
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,146
I will give up my career and my life.

441
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,523
You shouldn't promise him that so easily.

442
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,156
To be honest,

443
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,992
Jun-young actually has a girlfriend.

444
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,368
-Who?
-Who?

445
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,039
Kim Yu-na.

446
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,251
Yes. Yu-na, the actress in my agency.

447
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,337
She's dating Jun-young right now.

448
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,589
-Yes.
-What are you talking about?

449
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,509
It's been about a year.

450
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,386
Some reporter kept on coming

451
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,181
after Jun-young and Yu-na,

452
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,559
so this was all a performance
to draw his eyes away.

453
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,520
Are you satisfied now?

454
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,096
Are these Christmas roses again?

455
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,975
I believe Ms. Yoon saw those pictures.

456
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,518
They suit you well.

457
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,150
Thank you, Ji-tae.

458
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,110
I think she started doing

459
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,945
a background check on Ms. No.

460
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,280
Do you want another glass of wine?

461
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,698
Forget the wine.

462
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,324
I want something else.

463
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,871
A kiss.

464
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,290
Here?

465
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,751
Why not? We'll get married soon, anyway.

466
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,685
I heard you saw that picture.

467
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:33,608
The picture of Sin Jun-young,
me, and that girl.

468
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,115
Her name is No Eul,
and she's 28 years old.

469
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,242
She's a non-regular documentary producer
at Sky Production.

470
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,411
She graduated from
Korea National Open University.

471
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,747
Her parents passed away,
and she has a younger brother.

472
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,958
You don't need to do
a background check on her.

473
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,212
What are you trying to say?

474
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,172
I wanted to save you the trouble.

475
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,506
What is your relationship

476
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,636
with that girl?

477
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,264
I won't answer that question.

478
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,683
-What?
-If I answer that question,

479
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,854
I won't be able to keep my promise to you.

480
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,777
Answer me.

481
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,820
Do you like her?

482
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,406
Let's have another glass of wine.

483
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,617
Answer me, Ji-tae.

484
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,748
I'm asking you.

485
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,501
Answer me, Choi Ji-tae!

486
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,510
I do.

487
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,428
I like her.

488
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,121
I heard that a Christmas rose

489
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,081
means this.

490
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,169
"I have nothing to give to you."

491
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:19,755
Is that right?

492
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,882
It is.

493
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,427
I will make sure

494
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:26,929
you regret

495
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,056
this moment.

496
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,258
The reporters are still here.

497
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,302
They're blocking the back door as well.

498
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,431
They'll think I'm here
if the lights are on.

499
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,019
My goodness. Just my luck.

500
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,065
They'll probably leave in about two hours
if they don't see anything.

501
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,691
You can leave then.

502
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,862
Jik's friend

503
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:29,116
came home after midnight
after his academy,

504
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,370
and his mom was waiting for him
in the elevator.

505
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:37,124
The elevator went up from the first floor

506
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,502
to the second floor

507
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,712
and to the third floor.

508
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,964
It kept on going up.

509
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,425
Suddenly, his mom said this.

510
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,809
"Do I still look like your mom to you?"

511
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,232
What are you doing?

512
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,650
It's a ghost story.

513
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,986
Your fans said that
you're really scared of them.

514
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,988
I wanted to make fun of you.

515
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,369
"Do I still look like your mom to you?"

516
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,162
-There's a ghost behind you.
-What?

517
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:16,997
Oh, my gosh!

518
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,553
Nine and a half and a quarter

519
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,097
and an eighth and a sixteenth

520
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:34,974
and a thirty-second.

521
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,314
It looks like you're the one
who's more afraid of ghosts.

522
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,858
Can you turn on the lights?

523
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,943
They're blackout curtains.

524
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,404
Why are you telling me that now?

525
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,407
-I wanted to make fun of you.
-Gosh.

526
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,868
Do you have a death wish? Was that funny?

527
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,995
Did you enjoy making fun of me?

528
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,670
Ten.

529
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,173
-What?
-I counted to ten.

530
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,759
I tried my best to run away.

531
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,386
What are you talking about?

532
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,695
I tried my best to run away.

533
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,949
But you're the one who decided to stay.

534
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,910
What are you talking about?

535
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,926
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

536
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,220
-Let's eat.
-I thought you weren't eating.

537
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,429
I never said that.

538
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,067
Sit down.

539
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,737
Oh, okay.

540
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,208
Why did you change

541
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,835
-all of a sudden?
-What?

542
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:31,006
You just changed completely.

543
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,424
You're confusing me.

544
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,886
Me?

545
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:41,225
Are you Jun-young's twin brother?

546
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,893
Of course not.

547
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,732
Isn't it too salty?

548
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,484
It's good.

549
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,951
Oh, right.

550
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,621
You have a blister.

551
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,039
I'll bring medicine.

552
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,210
What's going on? Who is that?

553
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,505
Is he a ghost?

554
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,512
You spat everything out, didn't you?

555
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,058
No. Why would I spit out
something you made?

556
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,987
So you are human.

557
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,364
I thought

558
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,824
a ghost took over your body

559
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,369
and came back in his form.

560
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,954
Do I still look like Jun-young to you?

561
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,206
My gosh.

562
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,086
What's with the sudden change?

563
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,088
You're scaring me.

564
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,674
You were telling me to go away
just a while ago.

565
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,551
Why are you suddenly being so nice to me?

566
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,136
Can I not be nice to you?

567
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,972
If someone suddenly changes,
it means that person will die soon.

568
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,235
Hyeon-u.

569
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,070
Hey.

570
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,489
You waited a long time, didn't you?

571
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,865
I'm sorry for being late.

572
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,038
Were you getting ready to go out?

573
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,207
No, where would I go at this hour?

574
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,792
I thought there would be reporters.

575
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,462
I think they're all gone.

576
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,630
Really?

577
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:20,175
Gosh, then they should've told me so.

578
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,052
I even blow-dried my hair.

579
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,138
Where's Eul?

580
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,639
Eul's not home.

581
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,559
-She's not?
-No.

582
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,185
Her phone's off too, right?

583
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,980
She said she was almost out of batteries
a while ago.

584
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,483
Is she with Jun-young?

585
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,736
Yes. She said she had to take care
of something with him.

586
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,613
She told me to go to bed first.

587
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,568
-Hey, Dad.
-Where are you?

588
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,862
Let's go and grab a drink.

589
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,072
Mom will get mad if I drink with you.

590
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,742
You should stop drinking.

591
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,203
I promise I won't drink after today.

592
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,997
Please be a friend

593
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,751
and drink with me just for today, Ji-tae.

594
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,044
I'm sorry.

595
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,046
I'm caught up in something right now.

596
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,468
You should go home.

597
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,969
Mom will be worried.

598
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,598
Okay, fine.

599
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,184
You only care about your mother,
don't you?

600
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,103
All right.

601
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,147
I'll see you at home.

602
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,788
MADAM SONG'S SALON

603
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,252
I'll drive from here.

604
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:19,711
You can go home.

605
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,072
Stop staring. You'll pierce a hole in me.

606
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,326
I'm sorry.

607
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,751
Should I

608
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:02,212
just sit here as always?

609
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,381
Without pouring drinks

610
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,675
or acting cute?

611
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,094
Yes.

612
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,806
Are you going to leave again

613
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,892
without even holding my hand?

614
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,479
Yes.

615
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,358
Are you that afraid of your wife?

616
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:28,947
Yes.

617
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:37,873
In that case,

618
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,417
what about Yeong-ok?

619
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,003
Was she your ex-girlfriend?

620
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,339
That lady who looks like me.

621
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,133
You'd call me Yeong-ok

622
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,594
whenever you got drunk.

623
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,307
Yes.

624
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,352
You're right.

625
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,020
She's my ex-girlfriend.

626
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,484
If she's still lingering in your mind,

627
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,946
you must've loved her a lot.

628
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,199
Yes.

629
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,995
I did a lot of bad things to her.

630
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,211
May I

631
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,672
like you?

632
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:27,798
Don't.

633
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,304
I won't allow any other women
in my life from now on.

634
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,989
SECRETARY

635
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,325
Hello?

636
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,415
Where did you say he's at?

637
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:17,764
Can I have some more water, please?

638
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,520
Ma'am?

639
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,689
-Can I have some water?
-I'm so sorry.

640
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:26,940
Thank you.

641
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,465
CONNECTED WITH VISITOR

642
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,098
Eat up.

643
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:05,479
That's my favorite,
but I'm giving it to you.

644
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:07,939
I'm sorry

645
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:11,109
for making you stay outside
in this cold weather.

646
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:14,780
But

647
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,617
don't people usually keep dogs outside?

648
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:24,164
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

649
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:28,001
I'll try to fix my allergy
with medicine and stuff.

650
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,088
But

651
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,759
would I be able to film the documentary
at this point?

652
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:40,305
I'll probably get beaten to death
by Jun-young's fans.

653
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,351
My gosh.

654
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,437
I guess the reporters haven't left yet.

655
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,149
What am I going to do?

656
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,903
Should I hold a press conference

657
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:58,281
and tell everyone
that it was all a huge lie?

658
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:03,745
Mr. Sin Jun-young,
you're home, aren't you?

659
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,374
Eul is there too, isn't she?

660
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:10,377
The reporters are gone, so let her go.

661
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,298
Let her go right now!

662
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,974
Who was that? Was it a reporter?

663
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:27,352
Do you have an underground passage here?

664
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,356
Huge houses like this
in movies and dramas had them.

665
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:36,987
It's fully charged.

666
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,406
Rock, paper, scissors.

667
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,784
-I won.
-What was that for?

668
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,828
-You can do the dishes.
-My gosh.

669
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,598
Gosh.

670
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,474
I should've gone with rock.

671
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:13,940
Why did I

672
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,152
even play rock-paper-scissors?

673
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,409
NA-RI

674
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,579
Hey, Na-ri.

675
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,248
Hey, Eul. Have you seen the news?

676
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,459
No, I haven't.

677
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,794
Why? Did someone curse me again?

678
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:37,005
This is just unbelievable.

679
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,424
Jun-young must be crazy.

680
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,759
Why?

681
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,078
I'm not letting her go.

682
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,960
I plan on keeping her.

683
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,170
She's not an object.

684
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,799
You're the one who let go of her hand.

685
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,552
So stop lingering around
and stay away from her.

686
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,597
I think you're the one
who should stay away from her.

687
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,141
-What?
-I'm not worthy of her,

688
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,020
but you're even less worthy.

689
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,024
Think about what you did to her.

690
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,695
How can you even look at her in the eye

691
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,989
and say that you like her?

692
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,037
Sin Jun-young.

693
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,721
Why are you out?
The reporters are still outside.

694
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,309
I heard you're dating Kim Yu-na.

695
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,271
And it's been over a year.

696
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:18,815
-What?
-I was just

697
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,193
a tool to avoid a scandal with her.

698
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,031
Who said such a thing?

699
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,783
It's already all over the internet.

700
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:31,703
Your agency president
did the interview himself.

701
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,290
He said you used me

702
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,417
to protect Kim Yu-na.

703
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,671
-That's not true.
-I knew it.

704
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,007
It just didn't make any sense.

705
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:46,968
There's no way

706
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:49,804
that you'd like me.

707
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,309
I'm not sure what you saw or heard,

708
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,603
but they're all lies.

709
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:02,859
Well,

710
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,446
thanks to her,
I'm no longer called a gold digger.

711
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,491
Now, I can walk around with ease.

712
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,576
I said it's not true.

713
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,578
I'll ask for compensation
for psychological damage.

714
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:17,165
The least I can do
is get money off of this.

715
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,126
I need to at least
get something out of this.

716
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,839
It's not like that.

717
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,966
Just listen to what I say.

718
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,887
Don't listen to anyone else. Please.

719
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,725
Please just listen to me.

720
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,149
I love you, Eul.

721
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:54,369
I love you, Eul.

722
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,665
Stop it, Jun-young.

723
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,087
The entire nation knows
that you're a good actor.

724
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,048
So stop it already.

725
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:09,717
I love you,

726
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,595
Eul.

727
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,690
Jik kept telling me to be careful.

728
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:33,116
He said you and I
live in different worlds now.

729
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,953
He told me not to get confused

730
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,747
by every little thing you do.

731
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,294
He told me not to get shaken or hurt.

732
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,630
He kept warning me.

733
00:57:56,681 --> 00:58:00,435
I guess I'm the crazy one here!
I'm the crazy one!

734
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:05,857
My gosh, I should've listened to Jik.

735
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:40,934
Stop!

736
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,310
What nonsense is this?

737
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,312
"I feel bad for the producer.

738
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,940
Was she used
as a shield for the two stars?"

739
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,692
You're hiding an expensive watch
underneath a cheap jacket.

740
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:50,944
Who are you?

741
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,487
Stop this, Ji-tae.

742
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,322
Give up on Ms. No.

743
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,491
I love you, Eul.

744
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,035
I never used you or toyed with you.

745
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,245
Focus only on me.

746
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:01,746
Listen only to me.

747
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,165
Do we need a permit to be in love?

748
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,501
-Who is it?
-I can love whoever I want.

749
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,294
Do you like her that much?

750
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:11,214
You and I will become family
in a month's time.

751
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:12,882
Your mom?

752
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,260
Aren't you the gold digger?

753
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,761
She's the girl I like, Mom.

754
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,682
I won't give up on her even if I die.
