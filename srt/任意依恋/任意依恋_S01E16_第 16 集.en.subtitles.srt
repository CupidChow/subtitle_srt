1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,094
Where are you, Pororo?

2
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,249
I dreamed of you all week.

3
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,586
Can't you dream of me, too?

4
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,228
I'll call you back later.

5
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,464
I don't have a lot of time right now.

6
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,638
Stop playing hard to get
and come to me, Eul.

7
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,089
I just got back from the doctor's.

8
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,970
He says things got a bit worse.

9
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,974
So...

10
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,401
I don't have much time
to be around you, Eul.

11
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,572
I'm afraid I'll die before I get

12
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,119
to tell you how much I love you.

13
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,039
That's my biggest concern.

14
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,838
What's wrong?

15
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,008
I don't think it's an audio issue.

16
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,552
Why can't we hear just the parts
when he's talking to the cameras?

17
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,931
I hear everything.

18
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,641
Can you hear that?

19
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:05,977
Yes.

20
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,606
I can

21
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,943
hear him loud and clear.

22
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,658
Hello, Mother.

23
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,119
I'm away right now.

24
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,748
I will give up on Ji-tae.

25
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,673
You should give up, too.

26
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,344
Ji-tae won't ever change his--

27
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:46,935
MOTHER-IN-LAW

28
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,982
Jeong-eun. Hello?

29
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,318
Hello? Jeong-eun?

30
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,449
YOON JEONG-EUN

31
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,328
I'm not here to surrender.

32
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,914
I'm here to declare war.

33
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,669
I don't know how far you'll go,

34
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,130
but I plan to follow you all the way.

35
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,217
That's what I came here to say.

36
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,053
I'll give up on Ji-tae.

37
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,097
You should give up, too.

38
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,767
Ji-tae won't ever change his--

39
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,769
MOTHER-IN-LAW

40
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,487
MOTHER-IN-LAW

41
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,794
Have you sobered up?

42
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,882
Let go.

43
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,468
Let go of my arm, scumbag.

44
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,388
Lose the engagement ring
the next time we kiss.

45
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,102
I'm not kind or insensitive enough
to welcome a woman

46
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:58,399
wearing another man's engagement ring.

47
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,154
My goodness, look who's here.

48
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,408
Aren't you Ms. Yoon?

49
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,495
She had a lot to drink. Take her home.

50
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,083
What just happened?

51
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,087
Nothing happened
between you and Ms. Yoon, right?

52
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,173
Have you forgotten who she is?

53
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,758
You should hurry.

54
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,803
We can't let her drink and drive.

55
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,600
Nothing happened between you two, right?

56
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,020
If you did something,
you're not even human!

57
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,939
You're a total monster!

58
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,733
That little punk.

59
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,946
Give me your car key.

60
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,827
You shouldn't drive if you're drunk.

61
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,039
You jerk. Are you looking down on me, too?

62
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,252
I'm not looking down on you.
Once I take you home,

63
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,172
I will forget everything
I saw and heard today.

64
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,423
Don't you worry.

65
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,489
Do you want to avoid me that badly?

66
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:53,783
Yes.

67
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,537
My fans wish for a chance
to look at me for a minute.

68
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,957
They'd want to kill you
if they heard that.

69
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,668
Drop me off at the hospital and get lost.

70
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,752
Okay.

71
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,507
I'm good at getting lost.

72
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,843
I'll disappear from your sight right away

73
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,762
without leaving a trace.

74
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,640
But just not right now.

75
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,184
-What?
-I'll go after a minimum of three months

76
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,895
or a maximum of four months.

77
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,453
Loversleporineladymart,
please make him love me.

78
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,247
Loversleporineladymart, please help me.

79
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,083
Please make him love me.

80
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,293
Are you still doing this? It's been days.

81
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,045
You're 20 years old.

82
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,382
Do you really trust
what elementary school kids put online?

83
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,511
Your whole family is tense as it is.

84
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:23,557
Can't you at least pretend to study?

85
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,351
Why are you eating that?

86
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,937
There are so many other things to eat.

87
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,939
Spit it out right now.

88
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,440
Do you think you're a goat?

89
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,483
Spit it out.

90
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,235
There you go.

91
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,780
Eating that completes the spell.
Give it back.

92
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,699
If something like this guaranteed love,

93
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,953
I'd be with a truckload of men by now.

94
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,164
Loversleporineladymart.

95
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,666
Give it up, will you?

96
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:53,087
Loversleporineladymart.

97
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,089
NO JIK

98
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,173
Ms. Jang.

99
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,300
Apologize to the kids.

100
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,760
The spell

101
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,471
just worked.

102
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,435
It worked. It really worked.

103
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,286
You must be really angry.

104
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,789
I ignored your calls and your texts.

105
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,208
-Sorry.
-No.

106
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,501
I'm not angry.

107
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,753
While I couldn't reach you,

108
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,797
I met a truckload of other guys

109
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,550
who are 1,000 times cooler
and 10,000 times sexier than you.

110
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,054
I see.

111
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,724
Okay.

112
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,811
I should go, then.

113
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,106
Where are you going?

114
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,941
You said you met guys 1,000 times cooler

115
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,444
and 10,000 times sexier than me.

116
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,696
-So you're just leaving?
-Yes.

117
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,281
This is insane.

118
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,117
Where would I ever meet someone else?

119
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,161
I idolized Jun-young
for the past three years.

120
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,954
Now, I finally moved on to you.

121
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,208
I may not seem like that at all,
but I'm totally devoted...

122
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,256
Why did you just gulp?

123
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,009
-What?
-What will you do this time?

124
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,970
What would I possibly do to you?

125
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,472
Do you think I'm a pervert?

126
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,058
I'm not like that at all.

127
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,936
I'm very conservative and unsociable.

128
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:35,773
I won't bite,
so don't worry, you little kid.

129
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:43,739
No physical contact
until I graduate from high school.

130
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,201
-What?
-Hugs are only for special days.

131
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,577
What are you talking about?

132
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,623
And introduce me to your parents.

133
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,584
I'll introduce you to my sister, too.

134
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,546
I can't understand a word you're saying.

135
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,882
Let's ask for permission

136
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,134
and date for real.

137
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,971
-What?
-Don't you want to?

138
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,140
It's not that I don't want to.

139
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,059
This isn't the Joseon dynasty.

140
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,602
We aren't getting married.

141
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,271
We don't need permission.

142
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,356
And why can't I kiss you?

143
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,775
Even middle school kids
kiss when they date.

144
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,862
That's their problem.

145
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,822
I have certain values.

146
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,700
Once I become an adult
who can be more responsible,

147
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,535
I will take care of you

148
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,662
and act accordingly.

149
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,914
What are you saying?

150
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,333
My head hurts.

151
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,796
So I can't touch even a single hair
on your body

152
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,132
until you graduate from high school?

153
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,760
We can hold hands. Just hands.

154
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,680
I mean, people shake hands
all the time, so...

155
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,318
I don't think we can hold hands, either.

156
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,613
Why not?

157
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,198
What's the problem?

158
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,646
Hello, Dr. Kang, how are you?

159
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,857
A lady named No Eul came by this morning.

160
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,239
Why was she there?

161
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,214
She said she knew you were sick.

162
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,594
So I told her everything.

163
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,179
I told her you need help.

164
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,602
Tell me.

165
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,732
What sickness does Jun-young have
and how bad is it?

166
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:08,318
You're his doctor.

167
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,279
I know everything.

168
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,239
So don't lie to me.

169
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,908
Tell me everything.
Don't leave anything out.

170
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,667
Will Jun-young...

171
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,507
really...

172
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,929
die?

173
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,483
How did you get in?

174
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,986
What kind of a celebrity
uses 0000 for a password?

175
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,362
Are you a birdbrain?

176
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,412
I thought we were over.

177
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,914
You're right.

178
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,999
We were,

179
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,336
but I suddenly thought that

180
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,005
ending it now
wouldn't benefit me that much.

181
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,677
What would make you think otherwise?

182
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,808
Let me continue working.

183
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,189
I'm not saying we should date.

184
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,067
I don't care if you see someone else.

185
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,903
I don't care if you hug someone else
in front of me.

186
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,571
Just let me be next to...

187
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,663
Honestly, being the producer
of your documentary

188
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,124
is going to be a huge help in my career.

189
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,294
It's worth much more
than just ten million won.

190
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,005
I'd like to be a star producer
with your help.

191
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,467
Help me, won't you?

192
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,513
Jun-young.

193
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,475
No.

194
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,979
Don't be so clingy. Keep your word.

195
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,691
You have one minute to get out.

196
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,298
You good-for-nothing.

197
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,593
A president of a company
should be responsible for one's actions.

198
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,804
But my mother did nothing
to rectify the problems she caused.

199
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,807
Whenever something went wrong,
to avoid scrutiny,

200
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:44,933
she stayed at home or--

201
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,935
How dare you say that.

202
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,147
I know that filial piety
means nothing these days

203
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,399
and that business
isn't always about family,

204
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,402
but how could a son try
to dismiss his own mother?

205
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,821
Take this back right now.

206
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,864
I'm sorry.

207
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,283
I can't do that, Uncle.

208
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,911
Keep fighting, then.

209
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,412
Let's see who gets hurt in the end.

210
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,456
What an ungrateful jerk.

211
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,102
REPORT FOR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

212
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,567
Stop this.

213
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,362
You can't beat your mother.

214
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,988
You'll only hurt yourself.

215
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,707
I'm falling for Jun-young.

216
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,918
Are you surprised?

217
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,254
So am I.

218
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,550
I'm actually falling
for someone other than you.

219
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,637
I never imagined it would be possible.

220
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:06,765
He...

221
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,018
He makes my heart pound.

222
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,106
Are you not going to stop me?

223
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,984
Ji-tae.

224
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,240
I already gave you my answer.

225
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,053
Ms. Lee is here.

226
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,313
Why didn't you call to say you'd be here?

227
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,942
Did something good happen recently?

228
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,652
You're glowing.

229
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,240
About what I said yesterday--

230
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,202
Someone from Jeju Island
sent some saw-edged perch.

231
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,747
Why don't you have dinner with us today?

232
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,415
Are you free?

233
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,667
Ji-tae said he'd come home for dinner.

234
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,627
-Mother.
-I almost forgot.

235
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,715
This is for you.

236
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:24,968
It's a limited edition.
There are only two in Korea.

237
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,887
I hope you like it.

238
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,388
Mother.

239
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,932
-About the phone call yesterday--
-What about that?

240
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,978
About you saying you'll give up on Ji-tae?

241
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,899
I'm sorry.

242
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,443
I really have nothing to say
as his mother.

243
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,489
Be the warm-hearted person you are
and forgive Ji-tae.

244
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,740
Please--

245
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,494
I'm seeing someone else.

246
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,332
I was with him yesterday.

247
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,793
End it with him.

248
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,130
-Mother.
-Shall I do it for you if you can't?

249
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,216
Like I did before?

250
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,232
I also talked to some reporters,

251
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,983
and they said

252
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,903
she gave birth to him
and raised him alone.

253
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,740
Hyeon-jun.

254
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:33,328
Sin Yeong-ok seems to be pregnant
with your child.

255
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,747
When is Jun-young's birthday?

256
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,875
It's September 1, 1989.

257
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:54,307
I want to become a prosecutor.

258
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:59,062
I plan to go to the university
you went to.

259
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,899
You must be doing very well in school.

260
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,569
Well...

261
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,364
Your parents must be proud.

262
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:16,955
You have a goal, and you have
enough determination to reach it.

263
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,749
I have children as well,

264
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,419
and kids these days are useless.

265
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,797
They have no goals or principles,

266
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,966
and no perseverance at all.

267
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,220
I envy your parents.

268
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,393
What are you doing here?

269
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:27,108
Well, our department is organizing
a Hallyu event.

270
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,278
I wanted to ask Jun-young
to sing a few songs.

271
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,780
Are you asking him yourself?

272
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:36,117
I heard that celebrities
can be very conceited.

273
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,495
My aides said that

274
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:42,290
a star like Jun-young
would require my presence.

275
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,876
Were you crying?

276
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,047
Why would I cry?

277
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,550
The cold wind aggravates
my dry-eye syndrome.

278
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,679
You know my condition.

279
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,264
How much do you know?

280
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,899
What are you talking about?

281
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,776
How much do you know

282
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,404
about your relationship with Jun-young?

283
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:21,454
I don't know what you're talking about.

284
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,545
I guess I was mistaken, then.

285
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,630
I'll come back later.

286
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,383
Go and meet Jun-young.

287
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,262
How much

288
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,391
do you know?

289
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,770
My relationship with Jun-young.

290
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,899
How much do you know about it?

291
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,072
I know

292
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,660
as much as you do.

293
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,523
Were you expecting me?

294
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,693
-What?
-You weren't surprised.

295
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,778
Goodness.

296
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,822
You caught me.

297
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,872
When are you going to die?

298
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,751
Didn't the doctor tell you

299
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,920
how long you have left to live?

300
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,006
Why?

301
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,925
Do you want me to die fast?

302
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,635
If you're dying, yes.

303
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,472
My doctor told me that

304
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,226
a person's lifespan
depends on the person's willpower.

305
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,603
He said no one can interfere with that.

306
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,274
Sorry, but I won't die any time soon.

307
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,193
There's a lot I have to do

308
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,154
and a lot I want to do.

309
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,697
Whatever the doctor says,

310
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,159
I will hang onto my life the best I can.

311
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,828
That's what my willpower says.

312
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,789
I could even outlive you.

313
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,291
Leave the revenge to me.

314
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:16,421
Whether it's yours or Eul's,
I'll be the one to do it.

315
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,048
So just die in peace.

316
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,801
Don't use Jeong-eun
to make things messier.

317
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,679
Die in peace

318
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,140
as the pitiful

319
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,893
but beautiful star, Sin Jun-young.

320
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,520
Be remembered that way.

321
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,109
You must be kidding me.

322
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,905
Look, Mr. Choi.

323
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,908
Your father considered
Jeong-eun his daughter-in-law.

324
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,410
I don't know what you're planning,

325
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,120
but stop being a jerk.

326
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,289
Die quietly, Sin Jun-young.

327
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,542
This is my last warning.

328
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,009
Why do you keep saying that? I won't die!

329
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,181
I'm not even 30 years old.

330
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,123
Jun-young.

331
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,918
Ms. No is at your mother's restaurant.

332
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,257
It's really good.

333
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,645
It's all yours. Slow down.

334
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,360
Thank you.

335
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,627
Is Jun-young that mean to you?

336
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,337
How did you know?

337
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,549
She's just like you.

338
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,342
When you're upset and want to cry,

339
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,637
you make a bucketful of bibimbap
and stuff your mouth with it.

340
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,055
Get back to work.

341
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,140
Okay.

342
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,855
Why is Sin Jun-young such a jerk?

343
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,774
He's the worst person I've ever met.

344
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,486
He's so selfish and rude.

345
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,738
He only cares for himself.

346
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,615
He's timid and holds grudges.

347
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,492
He doesn't have the tiniest bit
of consideration for others.

348
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,829
Are you badmouthing my son right now?

349
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,790
Yes. And I haven't even started yet.

350
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:58,875
If...

351
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,754
If he treats you that badly,
find someone else.

352
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,381
I'd love to do that,
but there is no one else.

353
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,050
Why isn't there anyone else?

354
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,509
Half the population is male.

355
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,719
He's a male.

356
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,680
Don't. He's mine.

357
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,307
Man-ok.

358
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,892
You've lost your mind.

359
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,393
Why is he yours?

360
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,686
I didn't give you my permission.

361
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,188
He's a male, too.

362
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,273
Sir, would you like to date me?

363
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,733
-What?
-What?

364
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,695
Yong-deuk, call the psychiatrist.

365
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,907
Tell him that we'll send someone over.

366
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,578
Come and see me when you're done eating.

367
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,626
I almost forgot about it.

368
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,295
Didn't you say you'd break up
with Jun-young?

369
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,714
You said you knew your place.

370
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,342
You could just forget about him.

371
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:53,179
Why cling to him when he'll only hurt you?

372
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,765
Don't see him.

373
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,020
What's that look for?

374
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,357
Could you give me a hug?

375
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,194
-What?
-Or shall I hug you?

376
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,032
Goodness.

377
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:18,079
What are you doing? People are watching.

378
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,291
Just a minute.

379
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,961
Hey...

380
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,882
Can you tell me to be strong?

381
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,554
Tell me not to cry

382
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,597
however hard it gets.

383
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,187
Whatever happens,

384
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:48,151
you shouldn't cry too much, either.

385
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,361
Don't get run down.

386
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,238
Stay strong.

387
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,532
Don't worry about me.

388
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,492
Will you get off me?

389
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,870
People are staring at us.

390
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,883
IHWASOO YUKGAEJANG

391
00:34:58,721 --> 00:34:59,806
End it with him.

392
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,892
Shall I do it for you if you can't?

393
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,061
Like I did before?

394
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,567
You should've cleared things up
before coming to me.

395
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,153
Lose the engagement ring
the next time we kiss.

396
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:17,573
I'm not kind or insensitive enough
to welcome a woman

397
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,661
wearing another man's engagement ring.

398
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:57,321
SIN JUN-YOUNG'S DOCUMENTARY IS A HUGE HIT

399
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,037
HE SENDS A MESSAGE OF HOPE
FOR THOSE FACING DEATH

400
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,599
Jun-young.

401
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,311
Jun-young.

402
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,479
Jun-young.

403
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,607
-Yes.
-What are you

404
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,443
thinking so deeply about?

405
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,577
What was the question?

406
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:48,581
You said you're already working
on the first item on your bucket list.

407
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,334
Could you tell us a little about it?

408
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,211
Well...

409
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:01,219
The first item on my bucket list

410
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,349
is to bring the girlfriend I'm courting

411
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,434
right in front of this camera

412
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,811
confidently.

413
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,356
Do you mean Kim Yu-na?

414
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,274
-No.
-Cut! Just a moment.

415
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,945
Yu-na is your girlfriend.

416
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,489
You went public about the relationship.

417
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:25,159
I guess the cold weather
messed with your memory.

418
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,204
That was a lie.

419
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,375
We can't lie on documentaries, right?

420
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,918
Well, I guess so.

421
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,255
What is he talking about?

422
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:38,839
Well...

423
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,841
Is the camera off?

424
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,802
Oh, yes.

425
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,347
What happened was...

426
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,723
Will you stop conning people?

427
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,684
I didn't say anything yet.

428
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,435
We had our reasons.

429
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,729
I'll tell you everything
over dinner later.

430
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:57,984
Who is this girlfriend you're courting?

431
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,778
-Is it Ms. No?
-Hey!

432
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,446
No.

433
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,241
Is it Ms. Yoon Jeong-eun?

434
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,784
What are you talking about?

435
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,662
She's right. What nonsense is that?

436
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:10,746
You're right.

437
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,707
It's Ms. Yoon.

438
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,667
Hello, everyone.

439
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,799
No Eul.

440
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,009
What are you doing here?

441
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,302
I'm here to work.

442
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,886
I'll be your assistant.

443
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,680
I'll wind wires, log data, edit,

444
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,724
drive and be your sandbag.

445
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,810
Forget about it. I don't need help.

446
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,438
You didn't eat dinner yet, did you?

447
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:39,525
I got this from an amazing restaurant
in Ssangmun-dong.

448
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,694
If you need more...

449
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,033
What the hell are you on about?

450
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,617
He told you to leave.

451
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,786
You were fired.
You have no right to be here!

452
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,289
I invested in this documentary, too.

453
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,917
If you won't let me help,
I won't give you my tapes.

454
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,002
No Eul.

455
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,671
What's gotten into you?

456
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,590
Man-ok, call the police.

457
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:07,678
Report her for fraud,
blackmail and robbery.

458
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,057
Let's call it a day.

459
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,642
But we just got started.

460
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,062
Please leave the house immediately.

461
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,647
All of you.

462
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,032
You heard him. He wants you all gone.

463
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,369
You're the reason why he wants us gone.

464
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,037
You ruined everything!

465
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,164
Will you just stop it?

466
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,292
-Are you okay?
-What do you mean?

467
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,336
Getting hit by the steamed bun?

468
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,255
-That didn't hurt.
-Not that, you silly.

469
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,095
I can't do this anymore.

470
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:53,099
Sir, I'd rather live eating rocks

471
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,477
than be the manager
of a jerk like Jun-young.

472
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,356
I'll text you my resignation.

473
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,565
Jang Guk-yeong!

474
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,486
Have you lost your mind?

475
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,279
My blood pressure is going back up.

476
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:11,367
-Sir, are you all right?
-My gosh.

477
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,868
Gosh.

478
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,562
I was going to call 911,

479
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,191
but I thought it might spread rumors.

480
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,710
Let's go to the hospital.

481
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,259
I'll call Dr. Kang right now.

482
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,347
Jun-young.

483
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,474
I told you to leave.

484
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,478
I told you to leave!

485
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,107
Everyone's gone.

486
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,109
Mr. Yoon and Mr. Namgung left.

487
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,193
You should go, too.

488
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,653
Get admitted to the hospital.

489
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,490
Dr. Kang said you need to get treated
as soon as possible.

490
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,200
Go home.

491
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,535
Why won't you listen to the doctor?

492
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,746
Get treated at the hospital.

493
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,546
Why are you so stubborn?

494
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,882
Are you afraid people will find out?

495
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,801
Is that what's important?

496
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,679
You...

497
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,391
You're going to die.

498
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,937
Let's go to the hospital.

499
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,190
Forget the documentary. Get admitted.

500
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,193
Let's try everything we can.

501
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,863
Jun-young.

502
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,576
Jun-young.

503
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,955
I'll tell everyone.

504
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,420
If you keep acting like this,
I'll tell everyone.

505
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,801
Are you fine with that?
Your mother will find out.

506
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:58,969
Do whatever you want.

507
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,099
Jun-young.

508
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,851
Jun-young.

509
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,034
PASSCODE SETTINGS

510
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,128
You're home late.

511
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,716
The same goes for you.

512
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,517
Promise me

513
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,731
that you will never leave Mom,

514
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,066
whatever happens.

515
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,447
Dad.

516
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,408
Yes, I promise.

517
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,327
Thank you.

518
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,453
What about you?

519
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,580
Can you promise

520
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,542
that you will never leave your mother,
whatever happens?

521
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,338
No.

522
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,717
That's why I asked.

523
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:47,846
You, at least,

524
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,183
should stay with her.

525
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,294
Jeong-eun.

526
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,713
It's been a while.

527
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,508
It has been, Ha-ru.

528
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,178
Jeong-eun, can you taste this for me?

529
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,305
Sure.

530
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,600
Me first.
I'll borrow her for just five minutes.

531
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,229
We need to talk about something.

532
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,939
About what?

533
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,070
When a man falls in love with someone,

534
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:49,366
isn't it normal for him
to want to hold hands and kiss?

535
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:50,826
I guess so.

536
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,202
I knew it.

537
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:56,331
Who made the first move
between you and Ji-tae?

538
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,626
Who kissed who and when and where was it?

539
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,592
I'm all grown up. I'm an adult.

540
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,760
I know about these things.

541
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,471
What are you two ladies whispering about?

542
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,556
Dad.

543
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,765
Hey, Ji-tae.

544
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,857
Mother invited me to dinner.

545
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,692
I see. I'm glad to see you.

546
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,904
Welcome home. Are you hungry?

547
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,365
You should've told me
that you invited Jeong-eun.

548
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,450
Ji-tae.

549
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,452
Let's wash our hands.

550
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,203
I'd have come
without an invitation anyway.

551
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,331
I need to tell your family something.

552
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,498
Like what?

553
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,250
Let's sit at the table.

554
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,003
Jeong-eun, taste the salad for me.

555
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:56,892
Fine.

556
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,520
Let's end this puppet show.

557
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,482
Jeong-eun.

558
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,234
What's going on?

559
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,323
I already told Ms. Lee and Ji-tae.

560
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,200
I'm seeing someone else, sir.

561
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,245
What?

562
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,122
You helped me out once.

563
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,209
I believe my father
made it up to you long ago.

564
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,337
I hope you don't use that incident

565
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,714
to hold me back.

566
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:28,882
Jeong-eun.

567
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,219
Can we talk about this?

568
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,638
I'll head back now.

569
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,563
I left the bag you gave me in your room.

570
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,650
I'm capable of buying any bag I want.

571
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,777
What's the matter with you, Jeong-eun?

572
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,662
Who is it?

573
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,041
Who's the man you're seeing?

574
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,103
Pororo, where are you?

575
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,490
-Na-ri.
-Yes?

576
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,909
Can you give me your hand?

577
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,410
My hand?

578
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:21,703
What for?

579
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,497
Forget it.

580
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,707
Hey.

581
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,542
What did you just do?

582
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,049
Kids go slightly mad
in their last year of high school.

583
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,801
Have you already lost it?

584
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,803
Who are you? Who am I?

585
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:45,018
Na-ri. Would you like to kiss me?

586
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:46,102
What?

587
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,854
You're not slightly mad.

588
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,689
You've completely lost it.

589
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,695
I didn't feel anything
when I just kissed you.

590
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,739
But why does my heart feel

591
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,866
like it's going to explode
when I hold Ha-ru's hand

592
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,327
and why do I feel static electricity
when we touch?

593
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,873
That crazy jerk. That total lunatic.

594
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,266
Pororo.

595
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,769
Pororo.

596
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,035
Guk-yeong.

597
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,328
What do you want?

598
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:46,872
I'm no longer your manager.

599
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,582
Did you take Pororo?

600
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,585
I can't seem to find him anywhere.

601
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,587
Are you kidding me?

602
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,506
If you need an excuse to call,
make it sound plausible.

603
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:58,800
What do you mean?

604
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,761
You sent Pororo away a while ago

605
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,972
so he could live where the air is fresh.

606
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,515
When?

607
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,018
Why would I send Pororo...

608
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:09,936
Pororo...

609
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:15,942
I remember now.

610
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,028
I sent him away.

611
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:20,322
You're really unbelievable.

612
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,491
I'm sick of talking to you. Bye.

613
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,334
Jun-young! Open up!

614
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:39,215
You jerk. You changed the password?

615
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,428
I have something to say to you. Let me in.

616
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,139
I have something to say.

617
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,933
Open the door.

618
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:05,116
You're pushing me away
on purpose, aren't you?

619
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,037
You're afraid I'll get hurt
when you're gone, right?

620
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,708
Did you think that would help me?

621
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,004
You're wrong.

622
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:23,093
We were never madly
in love with each other.

623
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:27,305
I never understood you

624
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,683
and you never understood me.

625
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,559
We always missed each other's cues.

626
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:34,437
It was all a lie.

627
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,440
Not wanting to see you
as more than a friend...

628
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,234
It was a lie.

629
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,404
I like you.

630
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,240
I love you.

631
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,952
That's why I can't stand
wasting another minute,

632
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,413
another second not being with you.

633
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,208
That's why from now on,

634
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,420
I'll do nothing else but look at you.

635
00:54:58,503 --> 00:54:59,963
I'll stay by your side

636
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:03,216
and stare at your face
until I bore a hole in it.

637
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,557
Will you give me a chance?

638
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,642
Open the door.

639
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,650
I want to see you, Jun-young.

640
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,278
Jun-young.

641
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:41,129
STATUTE OF LIMITATION EXPIRES IN 13 DAYS

642
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,634
GUK-YEONG

643
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,472
Hey, Guk-yeong.

644
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,349
I called because
I forgot to say something.

645
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:57,771
You may be a huge star,

646
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,439
the famous Sin Jun-young,

647
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,941
but don't flirt with any woman
who comes your way

648
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,110
and break the heart of a poor girl.

649
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,822
If you do that, you'll pay for it.

650
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,991
You'll go to hell when you die.

651
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,786
-What statute expires in 13 days?
-What?

652
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:17,082
I set an alarm saying a statute
expires in 13 days. What does that mean?

653
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,209
Why are you asking me that?

654
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,002
How would I know?

655
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,134
I took off my engagement ring.

656
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,847
Can I come in now?

657
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:49,651
Shall we kiss?

658
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:51,277
For real?

659
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,738
Eul's the one you really like.
Why are you dating--

660
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:56,991
If you keep badmouthing him,
you're a bad person, too.

661
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:00,161
I'm going to propose to the woman I love.

662
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,292
Let's end things between our two families.

663
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,295
Stop your game while you can.

664
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,006
Don't you dare touch anything
that belongs to me.

665
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,717
When you fled the scene
after hitting a man with your car...

666
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,844
You can check for yourself
if you don't believe me.

667
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:19,097
Here's the latest rumor on Jun-young.

668
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,934
From this point on,
don't take your eyes off the screen.

669
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,980
I wonder who'll shed blood more painfully.
