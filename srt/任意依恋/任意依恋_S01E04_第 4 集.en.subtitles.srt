1
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:17,142
It looked like she was going to
a bridge on Han River.

2
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,893
What if she jumped in and died already?

3
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,812
What? A bridge?

4
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:25,358
I'm a fool for believing Guk-yeong.

5
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,522
My goodness. That's Jun-ho and Lee Yu-bi.

6
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,067
Did they actually start dating
after filming the movie?

7
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,446
This is excellent.
God hasn't abandoned me after all.

8
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,534
Let's take a photo.

9
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,327
One...

10
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,603
Is life so meaningless to you?

11
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,856
Is it so easy for you to die?

12
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,943
Let's film that documentary.

13
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,362
I'll do it, you crazy fool.

14
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,460
-Get the defibrillator ready.
-Yes, sir.

15
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,880
Raise it to 200 joules. In one, two, go.

16
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,592
Raise it to 300 joules. In one, two, go.

17
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,761
We have a pulse.

18
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,221
Okay.

19
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,942
The worst is over
and the surgery went well.

20
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,529
Your sister won't die. Don't worry.

21
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,240
-Thank you, doctor.
-Thank you, doctor.

22
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:39,260
THANK YOU FOR YOUR VOTES
I WILL WORK HARDER

23
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,430
CLEAN POWER, POWER OF THE FUTURE
CHOI HYEON-JUN

24
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,015
CRIMINAL LAW

25
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,936
You want to quit school?

26
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,104
Yes.

27
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,481
Why?

28
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,192
You passed the first round
of the bar exam.

29
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,610
Why quit now?

30
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,696
If someone like me becomes a prosecutor,

31
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,492
then there will really be
no hope for this country.

32
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,743
Is this

33
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,037
me?

34
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,833
I knew it.

35
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,752
The power of cosmetics really is amazing.

36
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,630
Since we're doing a makeover,

37
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,301
let's put some gold glitter
under your eyes like a singer.

38
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,345
Gold glitter? Do we have money to waste?

39
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,097
Hey, don't.

40
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,726
I spent the whole morning
putting all that on your face.

41
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,770
-You want me to meet Jun-young like this?
-Yes.

42
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,106
Are you telling me to seduce Jun-young?

43
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,066
I'm going there for work.

44
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,360
All right, go and work.

45
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,613
It's not like he'll fall for you anyway.

46
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,824
Young ladies from rich families

47
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,702
and celebrities a thousand times
prettier than you

48
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,621
are all waiting for a chance to meet him.

49
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,792
A girl like you
won't even enter his scope.

50
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,795
Then what's all the makeup for?

51
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,591
Jun-young has become someone
on a different level

52
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,135
that plain people like us
can't even think of dating,

53
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,764
but I won't have you showing up
in a cheap jacket

54
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,348
looking pitiful.

55
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,227
He can think of me however he wants.

56
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,063
Who cares? I don't care.

57
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,982
I care. My pride won't allow it.

58
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:03,112
At one time in our lives,
we used to be his equals.

59
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,531
Don't you feel bad for us?

60
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,914
Where's the gold glitter?

61
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,874
Be generous with it.

62
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,267
Not too shabby.

63
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,520
I look great.

64
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,042
-Come on outside.
-What for?

65
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,253
The documentary lady's outside.

66
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,589
You'll see something more interesting
than anything you can imagine.

67
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,507
Come and look.

68
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,349
CONNECTED WITH VISITOR

69
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,934
My goodness.

70
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,062
She's trying so hard to gain your favor.

71
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,190
But why do I feel sorry for her?

72
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:26,112
Is it because I know
you'll still be really hard on her?

73
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,746
The neighbors might report her
if we leave her like that.

74
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,373
Why isn't she coming in?

75
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,334
Don't. Just go and feed Pororo.

76
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,925
The more I look at myself,

77
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,636
the prettier I seem.

78
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,932
I feel bad that I had to

79
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,686
hide this beauty all these years.

80
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,267
Sorry for making you wait.

81
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,978
Why did you tell me to wait outside?

82
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,814
Your earrings and handbag.

83
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,609
They're all fake, and it bugged me.

84
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,653
So I borrowed the real deal from a friend.

85
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,987
-What?
-Your ears.

86
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,406
-Hey.
-Guys like Jun-young

87
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,743
can tell if they're real or fake
right away.

88
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,120
Who cares if I wear fakes?

89
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,997
It'll be deadly embarrassing.

90
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,876
He might look down on you for that.

91
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,464
He'll mock and belittle me whatever I do.

92
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,050
He has a horrible temper.

93
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,803
He's way worse than how he was before.

94
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,020
I can't believe he lives
in this kind of place alone.

95
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,147
The door alone makes me feel small.

96
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,611
Eul, there's no need
to feel intimidated, okay?

97
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,405
So what if he has a temper?

98
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,448
You go crazy when you get angry too.

99
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,910
Right. Don't you worry, my friend.

100
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,662
If he starts getting all mad at you,

101
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,290
consider him as a barking dog
and ignore him.

102
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,417
You went through so much to get this job.

103
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,752
You even pretended to kill yourself.

104
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,756
It's not like I did it on purpose.

105
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,385
I never said I'd kill myself.

106
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,346
He misunderstood
and took it the wrong way.

107
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,432
I can't leave my brother behind.

108
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,267
Of course, you can't.

109
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,247
Darn it.

110
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,669
Darn it.

111
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,466
JUN-YOUNG'S MANAGER

112
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,014
Hello, Mr. Jang.

113
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,807
It's me, No Eul.

114
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,310
I'm outside Jun-young's house.

115
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:47,229
I rang the bell for ten minutes,
but there's no answer.

116
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,232
Really? I wonder why.

117
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,401
I'll check and get back to you.

118
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,737
-Okay.
-All right.

119
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,825
It's obvious what's going on.

120
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,203
Jun-young's mean streak
must have resurfaced again.

121
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,963
Sin Jun-young.

122
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,175
Sin Jun-young.

123
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,719
Are you in?

124
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,473
I'm freezing to death here.

125
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,725
Let me in.

126
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,438
What's going on?

127
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,690
Is he pulling a prank on me?

128
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,369
Hi.

129
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,413
Hello.

130
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,041
Hello.

131
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,962
I think your doorbell's broken.

132
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,423
-The filming crew will--
-They won't come.

133
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,466
-I told them not to.
-Why?

134
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,968
I'm not going to film the documentary.

135
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,681
You said you'd do it just yesterday.

136
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,851
That's because you deceived me.

137
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,479
I thought you were going to jump off
a bridge because of me.

138
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,152
I didn't deceive you on purpose.

139
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,362
You just got the wrong idea.

140
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,114
Then you should've told me that

141
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:24,034
I was mistaken
and that you weren't trying to die.

142
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,414
Oh, well...

143
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,876
I was going to tell you.

144
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,712
I forgot.

145
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,131
Let's call off the documentary.

146
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,677
Pororo, what are you doing?
Let's go for a walk!

147
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,307
I lost a scoop because of you.

148
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,226
I almost got a video
of Jun-ho and Lee Yu-bi dating.

149
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,272
-Were you filming them in secret?
-I was!

150
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,984
I could've earned two months' worth
of living expenses with it.

151
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,030
Text your account number to my manager.

152
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,574
I'll wire you double the living expenses

153
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,993
that you lost out on.

154
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,333
How much?

155
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,044
Do you know how much I spend?

156
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,715
Don't just give me chump change.
Give me a hundred million won.

157
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,970
That's all you need?

158
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,556
I can give you a billion won if you want.

159
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,684
I can also give you a house,
a car and a building.

160
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,895
I can give you everything that I own.

161
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,357
Go on and ask for more.

162
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,653
I'm loaded and all you ask for
is a hundred million won?

163
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,868
It must be so great being rich.

164
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,079
I barely have enough to make a living.

165
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,706
But because you're rich,
you disregard people

166
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,377
and easily break promises.
It must be great to be you! You jerk.

167
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:00,881
Pororo!

168
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,024
What happened? Did you do this to her?

169
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,569
Pororo jumped on her for kicking me.

170
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,903
Did he bite her?

171
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,781
He just barked and jumped
but she passed out.

172
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,534
She fainted at a bark and a jump?

173
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,871
It's just another show
to get something from me.

174
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,831
I'm off to exercise.

175
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,333
Play along for a while,
then send her home.

176
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,630
I think she's really sick.

177
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,523
Jun-young, something's really wrong.

178
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,983
Come back here!

179
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,738
I don't think she's putting on a show.

180
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,536
Call Doctor Kang.

181
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,794
The sudden shock
caused her veins to expand.

182
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,047
That lowered her blood pressure,

183
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,882
and she went into shock.

184
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,302
She said she couldn't breathe
before she fainted?

185
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,762
Yes.

186
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,641
Her skin is blotchy,
and her breathing is ragged.

187
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,561
I would say an allergy to dogs
is the biggest cause.

188
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,438
An allergy to dogs?

189
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,814
The shots will reduce inflammation

190
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,317
and bring up the blood pressure.

191
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,195
She'll be fine by tomorrow.

192
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,741
Thank you for coming by on your day off.

193
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,953
Could you sign an autograph
for my daughter, then?

194
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,957
You seem to be doing well.

195
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,501
Yes. I feel fine.

196
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,172
I think you misdiagnosed me.

197
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,051
You helped me out today,
so I won't sue you.

198
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,811
Stay here for now.

199
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,980
You made her sick.

200
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,150
Thanks for protecting me,

201
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,485
but don't do it again.

202
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,154
If you'd bitten her or something,

203
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,031
I'd have kicked you out.

204
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,784
Okay?

205
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,362
HUSBAND

206
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,214
Your call cannot be connected.

207
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:30,883
Ji-tae.

208
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,719
Hey. Did you take a look around?

209
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,221
Isn't this place perfect for you and Eul?

210
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,515
This place is for us?

211
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,893
We can't afford it.

212
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,020
A friend of mine is emigrating

213
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,522
and he doesn't want to sell
or rent the place long-term.

214
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,776
You guys just have to keep it clean.

215
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,819
-For free?
-Yes, for free.

216
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,029
Isn't it great?

217
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,325
-No, thanks.
-Why not?

218
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,370
All Eul thinks about nowadays

219
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,915
is how to leech off others.

220
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,877
She thinks about how
to gain things for free.

221
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,048
She dreams about turning 1,000 won
into 10 million won.

222
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,966
That's all she thinks about nowadays

223
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,636
whenever she has any free time.

224
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,930
If we move in here for free,

225
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,767
she'll say, "See? It's all about luck.

226
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,561
There's no need
to be diligent and honest."

227
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,815
She'll just dream harder
and wish for a windfall.

228
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:31,652
Thanks for trying to help us out,
but I don't want anything for free.

229
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,238
I can stay with a friend for now,

230
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,365
and Eul can stay with Na-ri.

231
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,742
I work part-time, and Eul also has a job.

232
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,411
We'll find a place to live in no time.

233
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,164
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

234
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,207
My gosh.

235
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,876
What goes on in that head of yours?

236
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,837
You always make me feel bad.

237
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,012
-What's this?
-I tutor this kid.

238
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,765
His grades went up,
so his mom gave me a bonus.

239
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,268
You should get a new jacket
at a department store.

240
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,563
My jacket's just fine.
Buy one for yourself.

241
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,359
Why is there a hole?

242
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,652
It wasn't there earlier.

243
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,654
My sister's very materialistic.

244
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,907
I'd like it if you married her,

245
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,577
but she doesn't think of you that way.

246
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,496
It's because you're poor like us.

247
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,456
She likes rich people.

248
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,252
Get yourself a new jacket

249
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,547
so you can look good and impress her.

250
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:34,923
Okay?

251
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,059
All right.

252
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,106
Okay, I'll be there on time.

253
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,688
My goodness.

254
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,565
Did Jeong-eun cook all this?

255
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,858
Yes, ma'am.

256
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,861
I knew she was smart and pretty,

257
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,863
but she's a great cook, too.

258
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,323
It's nothing special.

259
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,743
I see why you're the expert.

260
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,914
Your mother taught you so well.

261
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,541
We weren't even out for that long.

262
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,879
Ha-ru, has this taught you anything?

263
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,922
Yes.

264
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,093
I hate her guts.

265
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,054
Ha-ru.

266
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,139
How dare you.

267
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,351
I'm really sorry.

268
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,727
Don't be.

269
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,688
My friends say that, too.

270
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,815
They all say they hate my guts.

271
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,076
There has to be a flaw.

272
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,037
What do you mean?

273
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:32,833
A human being can't be that perfect.

274
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,420
Her family's so great,
she did so well in school,

275
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:40,632
she's so pretty, she's so sexy,
and she's also really nice.

276
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,385
And she even cooks well.

277
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,762
Who? Jeong-eun?

278
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,931
She might not be from our planet.

279
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,267
What if

280
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,561
she's from another planet?

281
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,565
Maybe, when she goes home,

282
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,151
she eats snakes, rats,

283
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,445
and cockroaches.

284
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,906
And at midnight,
she might go to a cemetery

285
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,908
to dig up a coffin

286
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:10,245
and suck the blood of a corpse.

287
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,039
Oh, my god!

288
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,708
Ji-tae.

289
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,043
Hello, Dad.

290
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,379
What was that? You totally scared me.

291
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,881
Serves you right for talking like that.

292
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,424
Jeong-eun's here.

293
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,009
I know. I heard.

294
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,845
She got here early and prepared the food

295
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,221
for your grandfather's memorial.

296
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,098
Tell her she did a good job.

297
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,601
I will after I freshen up.

298
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,485
I'm telling you.
Jeong-eun really might have a secret.

299
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,612
She may look and act all sweet,

300
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,781
but she could be a sociopath
or a psychopath.

301
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,865
Ha-ru.

302
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,077
I was kidding. It's just a joke.

303
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,205
Why are you making such a serious face?

304
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,749
You're startling your precious daughter.

305
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:01,922
You silly thing.

306
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,049
Come on, Dad.

307
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,063
I don't like Jeong-eun.

308
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,278
You and her parents set it up
without our consent.

309
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,489
Please cancel the engagement.

310
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,034
She's a lovely lady.

311
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,786
Other well-known families

312
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,747
would love to have her
as a daughter-in-law.

313
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,832
Without love...

314
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,961
I mean, I can't marry a woman
I don't even like.

315
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:45,006
You two got married
because you were madly in love.

316
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,176
-Why should I--
-Are you

317
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,804
seeing someone?

318
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,640
No. Not really, but

319
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,642
I know how close

320
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,520
you and Mr. Yoon are.

321
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,398
I also know that to reach your goal,

322
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,109
you need his help.

323
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,695
But

324
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,576
this is about choosing
who I'll spend my life with.

325
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,912
It's about the rest of my life.

326
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,581
I understand.

327
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,125
I'll call Mr. Yoon tomorrow

328
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,378
and tell him that the engagement is off.

329
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,629
Honey.

330
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,799
My dream is important.

331
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,052
But as a father,

332
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,513
my son is more important.

333
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,811
Nothing in this world

334
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,522
can be more valuable

335
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,733
than you, Ji-tae.

336
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,120
The wine has a lovely aroma.

337
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,956
You chose it, didn't you?

338
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,829
Ji-tae.

339
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,124
You must be tired.

340
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,502
Well done.

341
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,840
Then give me a kiss.

342
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,600
You're warm, but not passionate.

343
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,435
You're seeing me

344
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,230
and being nice to me
only because of our parents, right?

345
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,483
You don't even love me.

346
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,656
I guess it's true.

347
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,536
That really hurt my pride.

348
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,790
Let's get married.

349
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,626
Let's skip the engagement ceremony
and get married right away.

350
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,169
Do you

351
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,923
-love me?
-Unless you push me away,

352
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,676
I won't leave you.

353
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,012
You really won't say you love me.

354
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,557
I don't mind.

355
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,892
I'll just love you

356
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,312
for the both of us.

357
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,154
I was so hungry when I woke up.

358
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,198
I'll pay for the ramyeon.

359
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,159
I mean

360
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,870
I'll give you the money.

361
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,624
I'll speak freely
since we won't be working together.

362
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,210
Is fainting your hobby?

363
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,591
It's because my immune system is weak.

364
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:01,429
I had three huge surgeries
after a car accident,

365
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,014
and my body got weird after that.

366
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,895
Do you have

367
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,482
any leftover rice?

368
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:20,657
About

369
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,284
that thing

370
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,287
you said earlier.

371
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,957
Is it

372
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:32,293
still valid?

373
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,466
I mean...

374
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,220
So what I'm saying is...

375
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,851
You said you'd give me a house,

376
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:51,229
a car and a building.

377
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,773
You said you'd give me anything.

378
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:59,487
I know you won't give me anything.
I was just asking.

379
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,868
What do you want?

380
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,789
Can I tell you?

381
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:13,918
A hundred million won.

382
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,298
That's the biggest amount I can think of.

383
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,469
It's too much, isn't it?

384
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,888
Then fifty million won.

385
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,392
Thirty million won.

386
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,314
Ten million won.

387
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,233
Give me ten million won,

388
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,360
and I won't bug you about the documentary.

389
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,363
I won't show up ever again.

390
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:48,077
If you can't just give it to me,
lend it to me.

391
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,205
For 82 months, interest-free.

392
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,090
Then 60 months, interest-free.

393
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,385
Can't you even give me a loan?

394
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,930
-You're rich anyway.
-I can't.

395
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,557
Why did you make me tell you, then?

396
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,685
They say that the rich are stingier
than the poor. You're the worst.

397
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,020
You can work.

398
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,731
Why ask for a handout
when you're physically able?

399
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,358
I don't have work.

400
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,612
Your temper lost me the job
I just barely landed.

401
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,364
Let's do the documentary, then.

402
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,283
There you go again.

403
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,660
Let's do it.

404
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,620
Yes, fine, why not?

405
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,172
What do you want?

406
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,383
Write up a new contract
for the documentary.

407
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,926
You said you wouldn't do it.

408
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,846
Guk-yeong called to say you called it off.

409
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,348
I changed my mind. I'm doing it.

410
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,558
Okay.

411
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,977
But you might want to change
your mind again,

412
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,938
so think about it carefully
tomorrow morning.

413
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,189
I won't change my mind.

414
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,108
Add an article saying
that I'll pay 1,000 times

415
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,860
the cancellation fee if I back out again.

416
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,945
You're really going to do it?

417
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,296
FROM: NO EUL
A GIFT FOR THE ONE I'M THANKFUL FOR

418
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,432
Ji-tae.

419
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,808
What's this?

420
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,102
A gift to celebrate my new job.

421
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,440
My brother and I leeched off you
for so long.

422
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,650
You couldn't even buy new trainers.

423
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,445
Did you get a job?

424
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,365
Weren't you blacklisted
by the whole industry?

425
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,242
Well done.

426
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,996
Sin Jun-young agreed
to film the documentary.

427
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,957
Isn't that amazing?

428
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,084
Are you shocked?

429
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,381
People just don't know how talented I am.

430
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,968
I'll make everyone pay for ignoring me.

431
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,139
Hello?

432
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,851
Why are you so quiet?

433
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,730
Did he fall asleep?

434
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,695
It's already past 3 a.m.

435
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,203
Are you really asleep?

436
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,000
Sleep well.

437
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,355
Are you upset?

438
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,445
I'm not kicking you out forever.

439
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,531
Pretend you're in the countryside

440
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,992
and stay here for just three months

441
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,660
until the filming's over.

442
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,039
You can see the clouds and the sky.

443
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,667
At night, you can see the moon and stars.

444
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,252
This is a great spot.

445
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,384
Do you want me to live here
while you live indoors?

446
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,851
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

447
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,852
Please make sure that

448
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,689
none of Pororo's fur
is on the carpets and floors.

449
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,316
-What?
-You see,

450
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,153
Pororo's fur caused an allergic...

451
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,238
Never mind. I'll do it.

452
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,638
Ta-da.

453
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:02,517
It's taro milk tea, your favorite.

454
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,354
It's nice and sweet and full of ice.

455
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,482
I even ordered extra tapioca balls
and coconut jelly.

456
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,859
I also asked for milk foam on top.

457
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,028
It's a jumbo size. Do you like it?

458
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,030
And the milk foam

459
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,407
symbolizes my love for you.

460
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,077
Why are you doing this to me?

461
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,413
Your skin is extra smooth today.

462
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,875
You see? This is why people need a break.

463
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,169
-Aren't you glad you listened to me?
-What do you mean?

464
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,588
Now that you're recharged,

465
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,382
shall we get to work?

466
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,260
-What work?
-The Ministry of Culture and Tourism

467
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,262
commissioned a documentary.

468
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:44,058
I was hoping you would take the project.

469
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,645
I get it.

470
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,522
-Get what?
-I guess you already heard

471
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,440
that I'm directing
Sin Jun-young's documentary.

472
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,483
Are you?

473
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,528
I haven't heard anything like that.

474
00:35:55,987 --> 00:36:01,325
You shouldn't have fired
such great talent like me.

475
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,704
You're a terrible judge of skill
and character.

476
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,541
I'll pay you double
of whatever you're getting.

477
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,961
Plus, a permanent position with insurance.

478
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,006
-Really?
-Really.

479
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,138
I need to take this. Sorry.

480
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,518
No way.

481
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,273
Hello, sir.

482
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,861
She's in my office.

483
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:37,945
DIRECTOR
CHOI JI-TAE

484
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,115
I'll talk her into it. Don't worry.

485
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,909
Thank you.

486
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,869
If you get her on board,

487
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,830
I'll proceed with the investment
I promised.

488
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,354
What's with the flowers?

489
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,314
He got new cushions and carpets.

490
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,857
Will you look at that?

491
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,943
He's smooth and sly.

492
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,695
After all that complaining
about the documentary...

493
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:23,074
He actually cares a lot about his image.

494
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,702
-Where is he anyway?
-Where could he be?

495
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,013
Jun-young, are you in there?

496
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,101
What are you doing? Pooping?

497
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,988
Okay, good luck.

498
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:15,293
I wanted to ask, "Why now?"

499
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,087
I was doing fine until now.

500
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,423
I ate well

501
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,216
and slept well.

502
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,635
I even beat my record

503
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,096
of climbing Mount Cheonggye
by three minutes.

504
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,934
Eul's supposed to come today.

505
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,980
I looked forward to this day for so long.

506
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,190
So why now?

507
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,445
But suddenly,

508
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:45,740
I remembered the promise
I'd made long ago.

509
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,828
"Please let Eul live.

510
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,081
If you let her live,

511
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,961
I will give up

512
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,047
all of my happiness.

513
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,180
I will give up

514
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,307
all of my happiness."

515
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,940
Thank you for inviting me back

516
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,276
and for offering me
a generous pay package.

517
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,779
No, I should be thanking you.

518
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,614
I was worried that you might be too upset

519
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,741
to work here again.

520
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,910
But I was mistaken.
You're really something.

521
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,203
You don't hold a grudge.

522
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,662
I do.

523
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,040
I hold grudges forever.

524
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,501
-What?
-I'm not going to return.

525
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,753
What do you mean?

526
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,130
You love money.

527
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,840
I said I'll pay you double.

528
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:48,636
Plus, a permanent position with insurance.

529
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,226
Hey, No Eul!

530
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,150
Double the pay, a permanent position
and insurance...

531
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,528
It all sounds very tempting.

532
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:10,116
But if I betray Jun-young,
he will kill me.

533
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,492
I'm sure of it.

534
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:14,954
I'm sorry, sir.

535
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:18,707
She'd do anything for money,
but for some reason she--

536
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,887
If a scumbag like you
becomes a congressman,

537
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,265
this country will be doomed.

538
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,768
If you reveal the real criminal
for my dad's case,

539
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,855
which you manipulated,

540
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,400
I will burn all the data I have.

541
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,045
Hey!

542
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,215
Give it back to me!

543
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,883
Hey, stop right there!

544
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,760
Hey, stop!

545
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,845
Find out about this phone's owner.

546
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,013
Who is it?

547
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,932
He almost killed his own girlfriend

548
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,103
to save my father.

549
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,038
The person you asked about,

550
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,624
his name is Sin Jun-young.

551
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,210
I think he's your father's son.

552
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,636
Congratulations, doctor.

553
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,514
I guess you are not a quack.

554
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:47,393
Your disease is progressing faster
than we anticipated.

555
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,188
How much longer do I have to live?

556
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,400
Six months?

557
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,029
-Three months?
-Why don't you get admitted right away?

558
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,657
You can get cancer treatment
and radiation therapy.

559
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,201
-We'll do what we can--
-But

560
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,286
that doesn't mean I won't die.

561
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,790
But it could extend your life.

562
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,501
Forget it.

563
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,463
Please prescribe a good painkiller
to numb the pain

564
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,592
so that no one can tell

565
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,137
that I'm dying.

566
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,515
If possible,

567
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,184
I'd like to forget about it, too.

568
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,357
I'll give you 100 autographs
if I can stay pain-free until I die.

569
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,123
Isn't that Sin Jun-young?

570
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,250
I believe it is.

571
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,211
What's he doing here?

572
00:45:57,129 --> 00:46:00,132
You should hurry.
You'll be late for your appointment.

573
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:01,550
Okay.

574
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,270
MOM

575
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:17,316
Your call cannot be connected.

576
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,067
Please call again later.

577
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,903
MOM

578
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,911
I CAN'T PICK UP. I'M IN A MEETING
I'LL CALL YOU BACK LATER

579
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,662
She's lying again.

580
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,374
Who holds a meeting
at a yukgaejang restaurant?

581
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,295
She's not going to call me back anyway.

582
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,354
PRETTY SPY, IRON-WILLED MS. OK,
DEUK DRAGON

583
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:59,483
"Isn't Sin Jun-young a bit overrated?"

584
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,655
Don't say things like "a bit."

585
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,990
You don't sound confident enough.

586
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,076
"He's totally overrated."

587
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,620
You have to say it like you're sure of it

588
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,622
to make others believe you.

589
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:14,748
Okay.

590
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:18,460
People with his looks are a dime a dozen.

591
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,837
You can see people like him all the time.

592
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,047
Like this?

593
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,507
Let me see.

594
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,346
Honestly, his looks
aren't really that common.

595
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:32,891
See for yourself if you can find
anyone like him.

596
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,142
Yong-deuk!

597
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,520
If you write such nonsense,

598
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,356
people will just think
that you're a loser.

599
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,358
They won't even click "like"
on your comment.

600
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,401
Okay.

601
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:48,240
Sin Jun-young should just retire.

602
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,828
Whenever he's on TV, I switch

603
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:56,123
-the channel.
-You do switch channels right away.

604
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,458
You always switch to channels
that he appears on.

605
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,131
What are you all up to?

606
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,925
Are you leaving
malicious comments online again

607
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:09,386
so you can get Jun-young to retire?

608
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,472
Lift your faces up.

609
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:16,268
I'll take your photos
and report you for slander.

610
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,770
Hey, Yong-deuk.

611
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,732
I said I need to make pickles.

612
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,651
Did I tell you to peel the garlic
and onions or not?

613
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:28,322
Is this all you peeled in two hours?

614
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,866
Were you busy badmouthing Jun-young?

615
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:34,620
Our boss prefers to badmouth him
than peel garlic.

616
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:38,248
I have to do what I'm told, don't I?

617
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,086
Man-ok.

618
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,089
You're his stylist.

619
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,384
-How can you do this to him?
-I didn't do anything wrong.

620
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,722
Ms. Sin was so pleased
when he went to law school.

621
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,433
But he quit without a word to anyone.

622
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,684
How could he do that?

623
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,686
No human being would do that.

624
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,732
He was ahead of his time.

625
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:07,444
You just don't know
what you're talking about.

626
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:10,530
You don't know the trend.

627
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,074
That's enough.

628
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,701
You're the worst.

629
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:17,204
Who is Choi Hyeon-jun?

630
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,456
Do you think he'd care if you showed up

631
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,874
with a prosecutor son?

632
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:24,002
"Well done, Yeong-ok.
You raised him well."

633
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,172
Do you think he'd leave his wife
to return to you?

634
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:32,636
Jun-young didn't become a celebrity
by choice.

635
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,597
Your son caused trouble

636
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,058
so Jun-young signed the contract
to get money to help him.

637
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,310
Did you think that I didn't know that?

638
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,359
How...

639
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,195
How did she find out?

640
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:54,700
Did she put up with us knowing all that?

641
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,961
SIN JUN-YOUNG'S FANS ARE NOT WELCOME

642
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:11,633
Jun-young knows that you leave
horrid comments about him online.

643
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:15,303
He won't sue anyone for slander

644
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,181
because he's afraid he might see you
at the police station.

645
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,437
That lunatic.

646
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,273
IHWASOO YUKGAEJANG

647
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:31,403
Our data team got screenshots
of the malicious comments,

648
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:36,283
and we got a million people to petition
that these people need to be punished.

649
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:40,162
These are screenshots of the worst
of the worst.

650
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,580
They're horrible.

651
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,416
They should be imprisoned for life.

652
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,585
I know this person.

653
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,129
They change IDs and IP addresses,

654
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,381
but they type the same thing.

655
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,554
What's this?

656
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:01,141
Jun-young's documentary will be directed
by a woman?

657
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,477
A woman

658
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,563
who looks like this

659
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:11,318
will be around our Jun-young all the time?

660
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,325
Is this woman

661
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,160
even a real producer?

662
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,955
She looks really young
and really inexperienced.

663
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,832
-It smells fishy, doesn't it?
-Yes.

664
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,835
I think we should look into her first.

665
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,253
You're right.

666
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,464
Her name is No Eul.

667
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:36,301
What kind of a name is that?

668
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,891
I uploaded her photo in our chat room.

669
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,684
-Find out about her.
-Okay.

670
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,437
Is she a producer?
Which school did she go to?

671
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:51,149
Where does she live?
Who are her family members?

672
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,693
Find out everything you can about her.

673
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,862
-I'll see what I can dig up.
-Okay.

674
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,781
Excuse me.

675
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:02,410
Are you talking about a female producer
named No Eul?

676
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,163
-The one who films documentaries?
-Yes.

677
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,834
-Do you know her?
-Kind of.

678
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,710
Do you really know her?

679
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,337
How do you know her?

680
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,881
Are you her boyfriend?

681
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:19,511
I'm at work, so I can't talk for long.

682
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:23,348
Give me your number,
and I'll call you later.

683
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,309
Are you trying to con me?

684
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,936
Forget it, then.

685
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:41,658
Don't think of using my number
to sell stuff.

686
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,703
My dad used to be
a very famous prosecutor.

687
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,624
What should I save you as?

688
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,626
-What's your name?
-No...

689
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,128
Oh Jik.

690
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,380
-What's yours?
-Choi Ha-ru.

691
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,467
Is your name really Oh Jik?

692
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,808
For ten years in a row,

693
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,977
Korea has had

694
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,480
the unfortunate title of the most suicides

695
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,066
among the OECD countries.

696
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:19,237
The Ministry of Education
and the Ministry of Health and Welfare

697
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,531
put together an anti-suicide campaign
to solve this.

698
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:24,576
They will reveal the bucket lists
of ten people

699
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,536
with much influence on the youth.

700
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,580
Through this, they can learn how to live

701
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,874
and how to set detailed
and realistic goals.

702
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,751
They will learn
that living a diligent life

703
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,878
will let them realize the meaning of life

704
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,047
-and value life--
-Stop.

705
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:38,882
Turn on the lights.

706
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,724
I can't understand a word
of what you're saying.

707
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,727
Can you make it simpler?

708
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,188
Simpler?

709
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,941
That was the simple version.

710
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,359
I'm a little dumb.

711
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:03,073
It's easy.

712
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:08,078
Some young people want to die
because life's so tough.

713
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:10,914
"Don't do that. Continue living.

714
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,457
Don't die."

715
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:16,336
That's what you need to say
through your bucket list.

716
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,716
Tell them that life is worth living,

717
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,593
whatever the price may be.

718
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,428
Tell them how beautiful life is.

719
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,806
It's a blessing from above.

720
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:30,433
They should have hope and courage...

721
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,191
You didn't tell me this was the concept.

722
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:39,651
I did.

723
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,987
I gave the printouts to Guk-yeong.

724
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,573
I put it on your desk.

725
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,242
Didn't I?

726
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,244
It was for you to read.

727
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,538
Didn't you read it?

728
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:18,898
Do you think he'll back out
of the documentary again?

729
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,150
I'm dead if he does.

730
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:23,653
If he does that again, then that woman,

731
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,239
Ms. No, will go crazy

732
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:29,534
and try to kill him for sure.

733
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:37,083
I bet he'll back out and ruin everything.

734
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,836
I'm betting on that, too.

735
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,963
I'm betting on that as well.

736
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,798
Just pack up.

737
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:46,676
-This is all over anyway.
-I'll talk to him.

738
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,646
Let's start filming.

739
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,946
What's the first thing
on your bucket list?

740
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:23,213
Let's assume that you only have

741
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,465
one year to live.

742
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,596
What do you think you'll want to do first?

743
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:37,060
Do you want to go somewhere
or do something?

744
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,395
Or see someone?

745
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,650
Nothing?

746
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,361
Let's say you only have a year to live.

747
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:49,489
A year is all you have left.

748
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,242
Is there anything you want to do or see--

749
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,576
A year is too long.

750
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:58,748
Let's say I have three months.

751
00:56:58,832 --> 00:56:59,833
Okay.

752
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,418
Let's say you have three months.

753
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:03,628
I'll do what I want.

754
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,755
I'll sue people who slander me

755
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,966
and kill everyone I hate.

756
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,388
That goes against the purpose
of this documentary.

757
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,807
Through your bucket list,

758
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,600
we want to send a message
that life is valuable

759
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,811
-and that it's beautiful--
-I'll flirt at clubs

760
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:22,105
-Excuse me.
-and sleep around.

761
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,607
Okay, stop.

762
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:25,817
The interview's over.

763
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,235
Keep the camera rolling.

764
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,492
Do you think this is all a joke?

765
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,787
I'm not joking.

766
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:40,874
I'm serious.

767
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:45,879
If I'm dying, what wouldn't I do?

768
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,422
Why don't you do drugs?

769
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,882
You should drink and drive.

770
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,842
Why not gamble and cause a scene
in public?

771
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,552
Will you go out with me?

772
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,767
Let's say I have three months to live.

773
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:02,896
So for just three months.

774
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,651
Passionately.

775
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:55,281
Can I post on my social media
that I'm dating you?

776
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,409
Ms. No's personal information
is all over the internet.

777
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,744
You're a gold digger.

778
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,829
I owe you nothing now.

779
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:06,167
Can you give me a job as your wife?

780
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,711
I wish you'd date Hyeon-u.

781
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,129
I think you'd be happy that way.

782
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:12,298
I said, someone else will come

783
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,550
to film your documentary tomorrow

784
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,884
instead of that crazy woman.

785
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,219
Are you her husband?

786
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,845
Are you Eul's husband?

787
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,430
-Am I your husband?
-Yes.

788
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,723
Haven't you seen this jerk before?

789
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:21,808
Is he unemployed?

790
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,893
It sounded like he'd be very ugly.

791
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,145
Your boyfriend.

792
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,188
I'm doing a concert today.

793
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,148
Wear this and come to his concert.

794
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,110
Jun-young lives in a different world now.

795
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:33,987
Don't fall for him, Eul.
