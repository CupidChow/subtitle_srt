1
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:14,389
Let's assume
that you only have one year to live.

2
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,978
Let's say you're going to die in one year.

3
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,064
A year is all you have left.

4
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,275
Is there anything you want to do or see--

5
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,526
A year is too long.

6
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,824
Let's say I have three months.

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,745
Okay.

8
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,080
Let's say you have three months left.

9
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,208
I'll do whatever I want.
I'll sue people who slander me

10
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,252
and kill everyone I hate.

11
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,093
That goes against the purpose
of this documentary.

12
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,595
Through your bucket list,

13
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,638
we want to send a message
that life is valuable

14
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,807
-and that it's beautiful--
-I'll flirt with women at clubs

15
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,851
-Excuse me.
-and sleep around.

16
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,312
Okay, stop.

17
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,563
The interview's over.

18
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,190
Keep the camera rolling.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,238
Do you think this is all a joke?

20
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,618
I'm not joking.

21
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,788
I meant every word.

22
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,126
If I'm gonna die soon, what couldn't I do?

23
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,129
Why don't you do drugs?

24
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,506
You should drink and drive.

25
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,341
Why not gamble
and cause a scene in public?

26
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,092
Will you go out with me Ms. No?

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,931
Let's say I have three months to live.

28
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,559
So for just three months.

29
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,270
Passionately.

30
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,320
Just for three months.

31
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,033
Let's date each other
like there's no tomorrow.

32
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:08,044
Well, everyone...
It was just a test run today.

33
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,839
I think Jun-young's
throwing a joke to break the ice.

34
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,715
I told you, I'm not joking.

35
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,348
I clearly said that I wasn't joking.

36
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,020
-Jun-young.
-Do you not want to, Ms. No?

37
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:44,581
How can I say no to that? I'm so thankful.

38
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,877
A top celebrity just asked me out.
If I say no to that...

39
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,462
-I'd be crazy to say no.
-Ms. No!

40
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,924
-Ms. No.
-When do we begin? Today?

41
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,928
Will you make this public?
I don't mind that.

42
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,892
Can I post on my social media
that I'm dating you?

43
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,990
GOBCHANGGO

44
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,909
Hello.

45
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,919
Bong-suk, what's with her?

46
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,004
I don't know.
She must've caused trouble again.

47
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,631
She's been like this for 30 minutes.

48
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,090
You won't die by doing that.

49
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,556
Did you do something wrong?

50
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,604
What?

51
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,483
I think I might get fired

52
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,402
from Jun-young's documentary crew.

53
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:57,820
Why?

54
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:04,077
Jun-young made a joke,
but I took it seriously.

55
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:09,999
Wait, he was serious,
but I made it into a joke.

56
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,418
Wait, no.

57
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:18,883
He was serious,
and I took it seriously, too.

58
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,054
-What are you saying?
-I think she's crazy.

59
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,515
I'm not crazy.

60
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,017
Why are you always so harsh on me?

61
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,437
Everyone in this world looks down on me,

62
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,650
and it's all because you look down on me.

63
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,736
No one says anything to Jun-young.

64
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,030
Nobody ever says anything
when he says something crazy.

65
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,157
But why does everyone call me crazy?

66
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,951
Do I look like a pushover?

67
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,119
My goodness.

68
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,328
Hey!

69
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,708
I never stayed silent about Jun-young.

70
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,752
What's with you?
Do I look like a pushover?

71
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,799
Exactly.

72
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,802
I must be crazy.

73
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,148
That's good news.

74
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,695
You should quit filming his documentary

75
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,448
and continue filming
exploration documentaries.

76
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,616
I'll help you get a job.

77
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,371
You're unemployed, too.

78
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,874
Look who's talking.

79
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,919
I'm going to get a job soon, too.

80
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,924
Once you get a job,

81
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,636
maybe I should just marry you.

82
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,223
I'm so fed up with everything.

83
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,350
What?

84
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,231
You won't

85
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,818
starve Jik and me.

86
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,031
Can you give me a job

87
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,242
as your wife?

88
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,669
What did you say?

89
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,714
I said, someone else will come
to film your documentary tomorrow

90
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,382
instead of that crazy woman.

91
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,551
I know that you joked around

92
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,554
by asking her to date you
so that you could get rid of her.

93
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,973
Our company president got so mad

94
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,018
and said that
she responded to you absurdly.

95
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,604
He told the production crew
that we can't let

96
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,106
someone crazy like her work with you.

97
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,733
Are you satisfied, Jun-young?

98
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,410
What should she have said, then?

99
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:55,706
"You are a crazy asshole. Are you insane?

100
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,376
I will kill you."
Should she have said that?

101
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,045
If she did, things would've been worse.

102
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,257
She would have been criticized for
saying that to a top celebrity like you.

103
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,633
Think about it.

104
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,177
The production crew is pretty harsh too.

105
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,471
Just because she's a temporary worker,
they said,

106
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,725
"Yes, we were thinking
about replacing her, too."

107
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,104
What teamwork, right?
How can they be so cruel?

108
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,940
How can they treat her like that?

109
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,987
I was about to stop talking right now.
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,032
Call Mr. Namgung and tell him that

111
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,078
without Ms. No, I won't film
even a second of that documentary.

112
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,749
If he doesn't want
his agency's top celebrity to quit,

113
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,212
tell him that he'd better
get her back to work.

114
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,894
Hyeon-u, here's some food.

115
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,733
Fine, I take it back.

116
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,235
I take back my proposal.

117
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,741
You could just be honest and say
that you don't want me as your wife.

118
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,785
You don't have to drink like that.
You can't even drink.

119
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,457
"It's not like that, Eul.

120
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,710
Why would I turn down
a lovely girl like you?

121
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,881
I was just surprised,
and couldn't believe what you said."

122
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,970
I guess that's not how you feel.

123
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,686
Are you really turning me down?

124
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,948
I didn't like you much, either.

125
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,898
He's not even coming after me.

126
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,403
It's not like he's so great.
Why is he so stubborn?

127
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,908
That was embarrassing.
I lost my job and got dumped.

128
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,368
What a day.

129
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,873
It's just a bad year, that's all.

130
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,767
She really doesn't know her place.

131
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,936
How can she even think about getting you?

132
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,188
Do you think

133
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,152
I'm better than Eul?

134
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:15,072
Of course. You may be unemployed,
but you're better.

135
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,284
Eul is in huge debt,
and she has a bad temper.

136
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,202
She even takes bribes.

137
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,915
So let me tell you something.

138
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,252
There's this woman I know who cooks well,

139
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,381
has enough money and doesn't look so bad.

140
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,507
I'm

141
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,804
not good enough for her.

142
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,143
I can't dare to have her.

143
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,566
That's why I didn't say yes.

144
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,485
What?

145
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,866
My gosh, Eul left her cell phone here.

146
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,410
She's so clumsy.

147
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,166
He's not sane, either.

148
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,046
Eul.

149
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,382
No Eul.

150
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,763
LAST CALL

151
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,848
What is this?

152
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,020
Yes? This is Eul's phone.

153
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,606
Hello?

154
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,359
Why are you picking up her phone?

155
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,531
I was with her,
and she left her phone behind.

156
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,325
Who is this?

157
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,993
Who are you?

158
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,496
I asked you first.

159
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:50,459
You should introduce yourself first
before you ask.

160
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,212
Can't you read Korean?

161
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,548
My name must've come up on screen.

162
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,969
There was only a picture
of a dog and a bird.

163
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,178
A dog and a bird?

164
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,431
Are you serious?

165
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,517
Anyway, Eul can't take your call,
so you should call...

166
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,523
If you're Sin Jun-young by any chance,

167
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,025
I don't think you should call her again.

168
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,070
Eul just got fired
from the documentary crew.

169
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,196
Who are you?

170
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,532
Who are you to tell me what to do?

171
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,702
Oh, right.

172
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,288
Are you her husband?

173
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,341
Where's my phone?

174
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,262
Are you Eul's husband?

175
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,518
Hello? Answer me. Are you her husband?

176
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,646
Why did you answer my phone?

177
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,149
Hello?

178
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,653
Hello?

179
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,453
Hey, you jerk! How dare you cut in!

180
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,015
HUSBAND

181
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,812
Am I your husband?

182
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,690
Yes.

183
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,486
Whenever I get into a fight,

184
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,155
you always take other people's sides,

185
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,617
just like a typical Korean husband.
That's why.

186
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,702
Goodbye.

187
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,663
Eul.

188
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,337
You will meet someone worthy.

189
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,049
You'll meet someone
who truly cares about you

190
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:04,802
and loves you.

191
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,222
Someone who'll make you happy.

192
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,933
You will meet him.

193
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,436
This is surprising.

194
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,940
I didn't think you were like this.

195
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,693
You're really awful.

196
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,030
If you want to say no, just say it.
Don't play nice.

197
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,408
-Eul.
-I'm not going to see you anymore.

198
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,451
Don't ever call me again.

199
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,514
Why did he call me, anyway?

200
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,351
I can never tell
what this crazy guy is up to.

201
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,608
NEW MESSAGE

202
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:04,737
Why did you call me, you crazy fool?

203
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,573
Do you want me to swear at you?

204
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:12,119
If I ever meet you again,
I'll change my name to Dog.

205
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,249
I am sorry for not picking up the phone
right away.

206
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,753
I am sincerely looking back on myself

207
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:25,341
very deeply on the rash joke that I made.

208
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,594
Please talk to Mr. Namgung

209
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,638
and grant me one more chance...

210
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:41,482
Forget about it.
I can make a living without you.

211
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,401
I will get double the salary,

212
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,821
insurance, and work
as a permanent employee.

213
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:00,334
It looks like Jun-young's car.

214
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,497
Why are you shocked?
Haven't you seen this jerk before?

215
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,502
How did you find me?

216
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,504
I asked your production crew.

217
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,634
How can they give out
my personal information--

218
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,387
Why do you live with Na-ri
if you have a husband?

219
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,725
Well, that's--

220
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,269
Are you married now?
Do you have a kid, too?

221
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,438
Is he unemployed? Did he lose his job?

222
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,649
Did he force you to make money
no matter what?

223
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,325
What kind of a crazy guy
would marry someone like me?

224
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,326
Would you marry me?

225
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,371
I don't have a husband,
and I don't have kids.

226
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,416
I live at my friend's house
because I've got no home, money or pride.

227
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:26,086
And thanks to this psycho,
I got fired again.

228
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,466
So I'll remain penniless,
homeless and husbandless.

229
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,762
Is this funny to you?

230
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,388
Are you having fun?

231
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,684
Why am I telling you this?

232
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,228
I must be out of my mind.

233
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,285
MR. YOON, PRODUCER OF SKY PRODUCTION

234
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,331
-Hello.
-This is Mr. Yoon.

235
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:06,293
We need you to take this documentary
to the end.

236
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,213
I thought you were changing the producer?

237
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,675
Jun-young said he wouldn't film
a second of it without you.

238
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,521
He also wants less crew members
to be around.

239
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,525
We need you here for a meeting.
Can you come over right now?

240
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,488
Hello? Ms. No?

241
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,617
Ms. No, are you listening? Hello?

242
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,205
We are in a hurry. Hello? Ms. No?

243
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,432
What is all this?

244
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,519
I've started working,
so I won't be around for a while.

245
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,729
So eat up.

246
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:34,733
She spent the whole night
making all of this.

247
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,615
It tastes awful, so keep that in mind.

248
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,450
It's too salty.

249
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,078
This is so sad.

250
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,622
Look at your face.

251
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,499
Doesn't your friend give you food?

252
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,794
-Eul, come on.
-My goodness.

253
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:58,048
If you're that worried,
you should follow him around all day long.

254
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,466
Should I do that?

255
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,970
Should I quit everything
and follow you around?

256
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,556
Sure. Quit your job
and come follow me around.

257
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,975
You can come to school with me.

258
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,354
Let's go to school.

259
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,398
Jik.

260
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,695
I do want to follow you around, but...

261
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,076
You do know about Jun-young's fans, right?

262
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,786
What?

263
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,708
His fans are the most extreme
among all celebrity fans.

264
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,711
They're doing a background check
on you right now.

265
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,587
You'll probably get in trouble--

266
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,425
NEW MESSAGE

267
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,136
Is this Oh Jik's phone?

268
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,806
You said you'd tell me about Eul,
but you never called.

269
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,516
You won't pick up your phone, either.

270
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,811
You'll die in my hands
if everything was a lie.

271
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,232
She's the president of his fan club.

272
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,496
WE AND THE REPORTERS ARE FAMILY

273
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,539
SIN JUN-YOUNG

274
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:29,181
Do you remember that my father's
a famous prosecutor?

275
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,768
If you were personally interested in me--

276
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,980
What will you do
with Eul's personal information?

277
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,649
Do your parents know about this?

278
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:40,984
Unbelievable.

279
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,863
Eul, you've matured.

280
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,656
What are you doing?

281
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,200
Eul.

282
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,203
She should do something better
with her life.

283
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,914
-Give me your phone.
-Give it to her.

284
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,415
THE WORST OF THE WORST

285
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,667
That's her, right?

286
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,754
I'll take care of her. Give me your phone.

287
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,925
No Jik!

288
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,595
Your call cannot be connected.

289
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,472
-Please try again.
-My goodness!

290
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,681
What's wrong?

291
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,689
Give me that girl's number.

292
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,900
Why is she messing with a student?

293
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:25,195
-Is Jun-young so special?
-Yes, he is.

294
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,990
She's not a weird kid, either.
She's completely sane.

295
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,869
Jun-young is special enough
to make anyone go crazy.

296
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,913
That's not the point.

297
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,418
-Don't fall for him, Eul.
-What?

298
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,546
Because you'll be around him all the time,

299
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,965
you'll start to have feelings for him.

300
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,633
But don't even think about it.

301
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,010
Who do you think I am?

302
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,055
Jun-young lives in a different world now.

303
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:57,727
If you begin to put meanings
in everything he says or does,

304
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:01,273
you will end up getting hurt.

305
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,987
Are you sick or something?

306
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,198
I guess those ribs
did taste a little weird.

307
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,951
I told you to stay away from it, didn't I?

308
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:16,037
I wish you'd date Hyeon-u.

309
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:21,126
He doesn't have much,
but he's a really good guy.

310
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,336
He's a good match for you.

311
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,714
I think you'd be happy that way.

312
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,801
That's all for today.

313
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,138
Goodbye, Eul.

314
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,932
Have fun at work.

315
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,229
What a little brat.

316
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,649
Hyeon-u dumped me already.

317
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,153
You don't know anything.

318
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,239
It's so embarrassing.

319
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,998
Once you get a job,

320
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,001
maybe I should just marry you.

321
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,796
I'm so fed up with everything.

322
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,050
-What?
-You won't

323
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,803
starve Jik and me.

324
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,933
Can you give me a job

325
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,102
as your wife?

326
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,857
Am I your husband?

327
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,028
Yes.

328
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,657
Whenever I get into a fight,

329
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,159
you always take other people's sides,

330
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,913
just like a typical Korean husband.
That's why.

331
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,184
All right, Ji-tae.

332
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,125
Yes?

333
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,712
Ji-tae, your father wants you.

334
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,213
-My father?
-Yes.

335
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,942
You're thinking for too long.

336
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,154
Your next move will end up as a bad one.

337
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:58,033
It looks like you're hoping
I'll make a mistake.

338
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,827
That won't happen.

339
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:05,999
Let's see.

340
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,293
All right.

341
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,296
I'll get both at once.

342
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,219
Yes!

343
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,722
Hey, one more round.

344
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,182
No way.

345
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,017
Give me what you promised.

346
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,145
That's too precious.
I'll give you something else.

347
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,106
-Come one, one more round.
-My gosh.

348
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,901
Will you be like this? I'm telling Mom.

349
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,489
Do you want to win your father so badly?

350
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,949
My gosh, this is freaking unbelievable.

351
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,119
Where did you learn to speak like that?

352
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,455
Come on. One more round.

353
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,957
-I can't.
-Dad.

354
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,417
Oh, my.

355
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,252
Choi Ha-ru.

356
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,299
-Today was a bad day for me.
-My goodness.

357
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,385
Where have you been?

358
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,930
Today's Jun-young's concert.

359
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,684
Wear this and come to his concert.

360
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,478
It's at 6 p.m. in the Olympic Hall.

361
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,898
How could I go there?

362
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,983
Haven't you heard?

363
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:18,738
A politician posted a picture
of him and his daughter at a concert

364
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,449
on his social media account
and it became very popular.

365
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,909
I didn't know.

366
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,744
He's a busy man.

367
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,288
Also, you should be studying.

368
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,624
You'll fail your college
entrance exams again.

369
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,834
Fine.

370
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,503
Come on, let's go. Please?

371
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,297
Right, I heard
they're filming his documentary, too.

372
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:41,136
Wouldn't it be awesome
for you to be there?

373
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,555
Ha-ru, I said stop.

374
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,891
Do I look like I'm joking?

375
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,227
Ji-tae.

376
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,522
Other students are using
all their time to study.

377
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,525
You don't have time to go to a concert.

378
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,114
I'm telling you, quit that fan club thing.

379
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,198
No.

380
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,118
To me, Jun-young
is more important than going to college.

381
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:09,581
My life is meaningless without him.
Don't tell me what to do.

382
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,417
Watch what you say.

383
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,253
Ha-ru, he's your brother.

384
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:19,215
It's because he's acting weird.
He's so scary.

385
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,178
He must be insane, Dad.

386
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,402
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled
in front of you.

387
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,952
This Jun-young guy,

388
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,913
I suddenly like him a bit.

389
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,293
"Why is Ji-tae never angry?

390
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,422
He has a million reasons to be angry,

391
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,217
but he never gets angry.

392
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,054
Is something wrong with him?"

393
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:11,017
I even thought
about taking you to a doctor.

394
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,021
But I guess I don't have to be worried.

395
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,940
You do know how to be angry.

396
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,067
You also know how to lose your temper.

397
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,323
I learned that you're fine thanks to him.

398
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,867
Maybe I should buy him a meal.

399
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,550
How could you change the password?

400
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,347
You said you'd call.

401
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,691
"I'm in a meeting.
I will call you right back."

402
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,819
You sent me that text when I called you.

403
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,946
The meeting isn't over yet.

404
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,657
I'm doing a concert today.

405
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,328
I got you the best seats,
so come with Jeong-sik.

406
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:18,334
This is your last chance
to see your sexy son from the best seat.

407
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,105
This is really your last chance.

408
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,233
Soon, you won't be able to see me
like this.

409
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,444
Well, that's great news.

410
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,696
Thanks for the good news.

411
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,114
Move.

412
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:50,783
Mom.

413
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,786
Let go. I'm not your mom.

414
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,706
You never treated me like your mom!

415
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,418
You studied so hard to get into that
school, but you quit without telling me.

416
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,422
And you chose to become a celebrity
without even talking to me about it.

417
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,134
What's so bad about being a celebrity?

418
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,179
A celebrity is far better
than a prosecutor.

419
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,473
Mom, do you know how rich I am?

420
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,435
I have buildings, houses,
three fancy cars--

421
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,188
Oh, sure. Good for you.

422
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:26,778
You said you wanted to become a prosecutor
and help poor and helpless people like us.

423
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,365
You made yourself sound so grand
and made a big deal about it.

424
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,493
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

425
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,664
Guys like me shouldn't become prosecutors.

426
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,708
If somebody like me becomes a prosecutor,

427
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:45,129
poor and helpless people like you
won't be able to live in this country.

428
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,548
You'll probably have to
move to another country.

429
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,175
What?

430
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,595
Those seats will remain empty for you and
Jeong-sik. Come if you change your mind.

431
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:57,141
I'm not going. You'll probably die
before I go there.

432
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,061
What a harsh woman.

433
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,271
She almost made me cry.

434
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,583
LET'S GO WATCH JUN-YEONG

435
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,169
CONCERT INFORMATION

436
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,504
SIN JUN-YOUNG'S CONCERT

437
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,927
OLYMPIC HALL

438
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,581
LET'S DO THIS TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME

439
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,465
JUN-YOUNG LOVE

440
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:25,605
Sin Jun-young's concert will begin soon.
Please pay attention to the announcements.

441
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,177
Stop crying.
It's not like your parents are gone.

442
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,013
I was so hurt.

443
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,476
Ms. Jang, how can Ji-tae do that to me?

444
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,604
How can he yell at his only sister?

445
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,819
And he glared at me like this.

446
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,655
I have a weak heart just like my mom.

447
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,449
Your mom has weak kidneys.

448
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,493
It's the same thing.

449
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,454
My brother must really be insane.

450
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,707
My goodness. Good for you.

451
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,418
He worries about you,
but you talk behind his back.

452
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,087
-Dad.
-Mr. Choi.

453
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,053
He has every right to scold you
as your family

454
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:43,015
for not studying
and doing this fan club thing.

455
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,351
Stop talking behind his back, Ha-ru.

456
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,937
-How did you get here?
-I texted him.

457
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,233
I told him
that you were really hurt by Ji-tae,

458
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,277
and that you're crying a river
in this concert hall.

459
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,863
Are you here for Ha-ru?

460
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,364
Here.

461
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,241
Look at this.

462
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,994
This is a secret from Ji-tae and your mom.

463
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,371
Dad.

464
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:09,500
I'm raising her the wrong way, aren't I?

465
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:14,297
Just between us,
Ha-ru isn't really the studying type.

466
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,508
Her scores won't go up
by just sitting in front of a desk.

467
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,467
That's true.

468
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,095
It's not like
I'm doing anything bad, either.

469
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,222
I'm just busy following Jun-young around.

470
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,307
Sure.

471
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,601
Great job, Ha-ru.

472
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,853
Congressman, I mean, Mr. Choi.

473
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,772
You came all the way here today,

474
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,942
so why don't we take a picture together?

475
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,737
No, Ms. Jang. I'm fine.

476
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,448
Okay, here we go.

477
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,617
In one, two, three.

478
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,265
-We love you, Jun-young!
-We love you, Jun-young!

479
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,809
I LOVE JUN-YOUNG

480
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,105
-You're the best!
-You're the best!

481
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,612
-Be healthy, Jun-young!
-Be healthy, Jun-young!

482
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:28,037
Another day has passed

483
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:34,710
As if nothing had happened

484
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:41,592
I say it's okay
Over and over

485
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,595
Trying to console myself

486
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,223
But I am not okay

487
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,393
-We love you, Sin Jun-young!
-We love you, Sin Jun-young!

488
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:55,731
SIN YEONG-OK, JANG JEONG-SIK

489
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:01,904
My heart feels empty without you

490
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:08,536
But I cannot fill the emptiness

491
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:12,081
With someone

492
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,751
Other than you

493
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,589
Your eyes

494
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,467
Your hands

495
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,680
Hover around me

496
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,599
Like a wind that does not blow

497
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,978
The only picture

498
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,482
In my head is the one of you

499
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,484
Now

500
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:46,490
I have nowhere to go back to

501
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,666
I can't see anything

502
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,423
Wish you
Love you

503
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,843
But I have to let

504
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:10,639
All the pieces go

505
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,893
Don't fall for him, Eul.

506
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,398
Because you'll be around him all the time,

507
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,609
you'll start to have feelings for him.

508
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,488
But don't even think about it.

509
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,244
Jun-young lives in a different world now.

510
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,624
Your eyes

511
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,919
Your hands

512
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,714
Hover around me

513
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,884
Like a wind that does not blow

514
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,137
The only picture

515
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:54,934
In my head is the one of you

516
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,727
Now

517
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:02,483
I have nowhere to go back to

518
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,198
The only picture in my head

519
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,326
-Take care of her.
-Okay.

520
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,664
Is the one of you

521
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,167
Is the one of you

522
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:27,299
Is the one of you

523
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,115
Are you going to the Prosecutors' Office?

524
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,951
I want to become a prosecutor.

525
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:58,497
I'd love to see you
as a prosecutor one day.

526
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,623
Yes, sir.

527
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,125
What's your name?

528
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,920
We're bound to meet again.
I should autograph it for you.

529
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,338
Some other time.

530
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,924
I'll study hard

531
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,970
and come back with a bar exam certificate.
Give it to me then.

532
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,056
I'll give you my name then, too.

533
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:18,934
Jun-young,

534
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,980
I guess you won't be coming back
for your book.

535
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,866
He went where?

536
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,955
Sin Jun-young's concert?

537
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,959
Why did he go there?

538
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,421
It seems like he went there
because of Ha-ru.

539
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,508
What?

540
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,503
I think about you all day

541
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,050
My heart becomes warm inside

542
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,389
Aren't you supposed to be peeling onions?

543
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,724
I was watching Jun-young's concert
to bash him.

544
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:41,809
What?

545
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,437
But I couldn't find anything
bad about him.

546
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,565
He's so cool.

547
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,775
Go in and peel onions

548
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,069
-and garlic.
-Darn it.

549
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,031
"Darn it"? Hey, what did you say?

550
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,492
Did you just curse at me? You little punk.

551
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,538
Why are you taking your anger out
on Yong-deuk?

552
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,874
Where have you been all day long?
Why are you here--

553
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,711
What is this?

554
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,592
HK BANK CHEQUE

555
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,927
What is this?

556
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,930
It's what Guk-yeong owes Jun-young.

557
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,640
-Jeong-sik.
-I told him

558
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,642
to give it to Jun-young

559
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,645
three years ago,
but he kept it for himself.

560
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,522
That's why it's late.

561
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,526
Where did you get this money?

562
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,030
Well, I went to a friend who owes me money

563
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,906
and made him pay it all back.

564
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,533
Then I took out the deposit from my place.

565
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,995
-Take the interest from my paycheck.
-Jeong-sik.

566
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,416
Everything that
I've held in for five years

567
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,168
is all gone now. What a relief.

568
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,507
I owe you nothing now.

569
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,844
Okay? We are completely equal
by all means.

570
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:03,724
Financially, psychologically
and as a man and a woman.

571
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,771
Also, let's make this clear.

572
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:13,442
He didn't quit law school because he
had to take care of Guk-yeong's mess.

573
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:17,988
First, for some reason,
he quit law school first.

574
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,991
Second, Guk-yeong got into trouble.

575
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:26,580
Third, Jun-young then helped Guk-yeong
deal with the mess he got into

576
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,541
with the front money from his agency.

577
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,628
Can you remember that order? Good.

578
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,514
-All right, he's here.
-Great job.

579
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,141
That was the best you've ever done.

580
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,060
-Give him some water.
-Okay.

581
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,481
-Here you go.
-Okay.

582
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,691
You'll sing the last song
after the guest singer.

583
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,693
Let's finish this to the end.

584
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,153
Let's go!

585
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,031
Yes, let's go!

586
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,835
You haven't done concerts
in a while, right?

587
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,963
-Yes.
-How do you feel right now?

588
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:19,925
Who was that guy?

589
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,678
Sorry?

590
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,807
The guy who picked up
your phone yesterday.

591
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,018
The guy who you saved as "Husband"
on your cell phone.

592
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,145
What's wrong with him?

593
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,730
He's starting again.

594
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,150
Is he your boyfriend?

595
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,571
It looked like some of your fans

596
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:43,323
came from the other side
of the globe to see you.

597
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,075
Could you say hello to--

598
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,326
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?

599
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,999
What did you eat today?

600
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,126
What do you usually eat before--

601
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,128
How long have you been dating him?

602
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,005
Jun-young.

603
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,846
What do you usually do after a concert?

604
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,265
-What's--
-His voice wasn't very attractive.

605
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,391
How does he look?

606
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:13,020
It sounded like he'd be very ugly.

607
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,856
Your boyfriend.

608
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,316
He's not my boyfriend.

609
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:19,943
Good job.

610
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,156
Do you know

611
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:32,456
What I am about to say

612
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:36,084
I won't

613
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,341
Say it too fast

614
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,514
Do you remember

615
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,224
SIN JUN-YOUNG

616
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:57,231
The emotions that we felt
For the first time

617
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:00,359
We did not know

618
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:06,865
We probably did not know then

619
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:13,497
I don't know since when

620
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:18,335
But I cannot remember

621
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,757
THERE'S SOMEONE I LOVE HERE

622
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,552
Into my heart...

623
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,095
THERE'S SOMEONE I LOVE HERE

624
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:36,270
If now

625
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:40,649
Is not too late

626
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:45,195
I have something

627
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,073
I WANT TO CONFESS MY LOVE TO YOU TODAY

628
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:55,080
I want to tell you today

629
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,041
What if it's me? What should i do?

630
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:04,381
I like you

631
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:10,887
I love you

632
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:16,476
Don't hesitate anymore

633
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:21,481
And say you feel the same

634
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:29,031
Hold out your hand

635
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:34,453
We will hold hands

636
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:39,082
And when we look
Into each other's eyes

637
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:45,631
We are going to be together always

638
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:22,876
I like you

639
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:28,548
I love you

640
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,846
Congratulations.

641
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,015
I love you, Eul.

642
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:46,733
Hold out your hand

643
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:52,406
We will hold hands

644
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:57,202
And when we look
Into each other's eyes

645
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:03,792
We are going to be together always

646
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,423
Forever

647
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:15,095
Ha-ru, look at this.

648
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,472
My gosh.

649
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:19,933
Unbelievable.

650
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,604
SIN JUN-YOUNG'S GIRL IS FINALLY REVEALED

651
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,940
My goodness. What is this?

652
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,985
This is a picture that went viral

653
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,988
as soon as an article was released about

654
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,614
how Jun-young proposed to Ms. No.

655
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,410
-Where's Jun-young?
-He's over there.

656
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:42,289
He proposed in front of his fans,
but got rejected.

657
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:46,251
He probably wants to die
out of embarrassment.

658
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:51,089
What is this?

659
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,134
What is this situation?

660
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,512
Ms. No's high school friend
uploaded this picture.

661
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,056
That person took this and uploaded it
a long time ago.

662
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,308
I didn't ask you!

663
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,482
What is this? Is she your ex-girlfriend?

664
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,276
"Eul stole her friend's boyfriend,
Jun-young."

665
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,238
Ms. No's personal information
is all over the internet.

666
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,491
Look at these comments.

667
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,994
"Everyone in Suyu-ri knows this story.

668
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,079
Eul's friend became a mess.

669
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,998
She even tried to kill herself."

670
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,459
"Why would Jun-young
date someone like her?

671
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,629
Unbelievable.
She's definitely a gold digger."

672
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,255
This is driving me crazy.

673
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,054
Who is that? Who wrote that stupid--

674
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,222
"I feel bad for his fans.

675
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:43,433
He shouldn't have done that
in front of his fans.

676
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,352
How do I leave his fan club?"

677
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,478
Keep reading.

678
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:49,815
"The gold digger and the fool
who fell for her are the same.

679
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,650
You're filming a documentary,
not a romance movie.

680
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,443
What does he see in her?

681
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,613
He has low standards."

682
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,410
Take screenshots
and report these to the police.

683
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,623
Tell them I will meet these jerks
in person

684
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:08,583
and kill them with my own hands.

685
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,585
I don't think
that's the problem right now.

686
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,420
If things went this far,

687
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,423
Ms. No is probably facing
bigger problems right now.

688
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:44,578
That's No Eul, right? Unbelievable.

689
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:45,787
How scary.

690
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,748
-Why did she do that to Jun-young?
-I know, right?

691
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,378
-She's crazy.
-Who does she think she is?

692
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,755
She probably hit on him first.

693
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,507
Is she listening?

694
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:04,806
I hate you.

695
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,603
Are you talking to me?

696
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,399
You're a gold digger.

697
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,777
Hey, I'm not a gold digger.

698
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,369
I see.

699
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:32,250
You all must be angry
because of that proposal event.

700
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:37,547
It's all a lie.
It was just a part of the show.

701
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,261
Did you all buy that?

702
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,567
What are you doing? Stop filming me.

703
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:01,488
Congratulations.
That was such a romantic proposal.

704
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,114
It's not like that.

705
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,576
I heard the two of you dated
since high school.

706
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,162
Who said that?

707
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:15,126
Stop speaking nonsense
and move the camera.

708
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:18,421
The story of you two
is all over the Internet.

709
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,303
SIN JUN-YOUNG'S GIRL IS FINALLY REVEALED

710
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,685
Stop this.

711
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:35,188
This is all just a rumor.
You're violating her rights.

712
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:36,398
Hyeon-u.

713
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:32,746
Are you her husband?

714
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,917
I don't care, anyway.

715
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,216
They're filming this right now.
Are you okay with that?

716
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,928
From this point on,
people will think it's real.

717
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,190
I don't care.

718
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,277
But will you be all right?

719
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,906
I'm already a celebrity,
so everyone knows who I am.

720
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,491
If you reveal yourself on camera,

721
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,577
everyone will find out about you
in no time.

722
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,584
Hey! There's Sin Jun-young.

723
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,759
Jun-young!

724
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:38,973
Say that once more
and I'll throw you in the sea.

725
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,934
Have you seen my phone?

726
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:45,563
Can't you think about it one more time?

727
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,482
Will you go out with me, please?

728
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,400
Because of what you did,

729
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,152
I can't be with Eul.

730
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,780
Let's just drown.
I don't really want to live, anyway.

731
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,365
What a psycho.

732
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,158
Put me down.

733
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,618
-My gosh!
-Hey!

734
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,161
Hyeon-u.

735
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:03,540
Eul. Did you really do something stupid?

736
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,416
I heard your husband's missing.

737
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,086
Jun-young! Where are you?

738
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,462
What if he drowned in the sea?

739
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,090
Jun-young's fans will kill Eul in no time.

740
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,801
You're the nation's
most famous gold digger.

741
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,262
People even know
what underwear brand you wear.

742
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,640
Eul. Should I give up on you

743
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,976
and send you off to that guy?
