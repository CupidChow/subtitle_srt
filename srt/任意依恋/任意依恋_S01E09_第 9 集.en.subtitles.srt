1
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,358
She's the girl I like, Mom.

2
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,193
I told you over the phone last time.

3
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,613
I don't know
why I can't stop thinking of her.

4
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,699
She's been on my mind
for the last nine years.

5
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,077
And I realized
that I'm madly in love with her

6
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,955
only about two weeks ago.

7
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,478
They're filming this right now.
Are you okay with that?

8
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,521
From this point on,
people will think it's real.

9
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:07,859
I don't care.

10
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,579
Don't you see me?

11
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,415
Think of what I did for you!

12
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,837
Don't you see me?

13
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,715
What should I do?

14
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,385
This crazy girl who turned her back to me

15
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,598
won't even cast me a glance.

16
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:44,187
Instead, she only wants the guy
who abandoned her. What should I do?

17
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,202
Don't listen to anyone else. Please.

18
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:03,998
Please just listen to me.

19
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,962
I love you, Eul.

20
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,548
I love you, Eul.

21
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,801
I love you,

22
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,470
Eul.

23
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,057
-Hello?
-Hello?

24
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,352
Is this Jun-young's house?

25
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,148
No Eul?

26
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,275
I decided

27
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,154
to trust you just this once.

28
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,409
Hello?

29
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,869
Jun-young.

30
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,871
Are you listening?

31
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,331
I didn't hear that. What did you say?

32
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,000
-I decided to trust you--
-No, don't say it.

33
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,793
Say no more, Eul.

34
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:35,298
I'll come right over. Say it to my face.

35
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,411
Let's stay like this just for a minute.

36
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,846
I don't like tripe. They stink.

37
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,639
Hey.

38
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,142
Our tripes are pre-cooked,

39
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,603
so it doesn't smell bad,
and it's really savory.

40
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,146
You should try it.

41
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,606
Oh, hey.

42
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,907
Eul was waiting for you,
but she left a while ago.

43
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,328
-I came to see you, not Eul.
-What?

44
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,412
Me?

45
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,747
You came to see me?

46
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,167
You should've told me.
I didn't even wash my hair today.

47
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,339
What is this?

48
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,427
What? One million won?

49
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,555
I don't need this kind of money.

50
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,933
I don't care
if you're completely bankrupt.

51
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,267
Please keep this

52
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,021
and use this as payment
for whatever Eul eats here.

53
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,357
What? What are you saying?

54
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,192
I won't ever come back here.

55
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,904
I'm not going to see Eul
from now on, either.

56
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:50,970
I think

57
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,265
it's been over a minute.

58
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,648
Just one more minute.

59
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,229
When did you get here?

60
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,981
Just now.

61
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,734
It's really late.

62
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,321
Why? What's going on? How's your--

63
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,729
Are we going to spend the night like this?

64
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,027
-I'd love that.
-My goodness.

65
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,993
Tell me what you were going
to say over the phone.

66
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,415
Well...

67
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,167
I was saying...

68
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,338
What I meant by deciding
to trust you is that...

69
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,969
Well, I'm not saying
I'm really going to trust you...

70
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,221
So what I'm saying is...

71
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,476
I'm making a living off of you right now.

72
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,897
And it'd be my loss not to trust you.

73
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,403
-Why are you smiling?
-Because you're so pretty.

74
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,535
You look even prettier.

75
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,371
You're so adorable.

76
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,210
-Will you hit me if I ask for a kiss?
-I'll kill you.

77
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,923
What a pervert.

78
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,553
See you tomorrow, Eul.

79
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,597
And the day after tomorrow.

80
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,058
And the day after that.

81
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,977
And the day after that.

82
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,396
I'll see you whenever and wherever.

83
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,574
Cut.

84
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,410
-Why is it so loud?
-Pardon?

85
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,538
Hey, aren't you going
to control the scene?

86
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,333
It's because of the news
that Jun-young and Yu-na are dating.

87
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,252
There are a lot of reporters here.

88
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,336
I'm sorry, sir.

89
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,296
-My gosh.
-I'm sorry. Excuse me.

90
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,384
Mr. Kim.

91
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,470
Hey, Guk-yeong. Let us interview him.

92
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,847
Mr. Kim.

93
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,516
I'll make sure to set up an interview

94
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,518
with both Jun-young and Yu-na

95
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,271
after they're done with the shooting.

96
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,690
So, could you all please wait a little?

97
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,025
-I'm freezing right now.
-I'm sorry.

98
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,821
Also, we're in the middle of a shooting,
so please keep your voices down.

99
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,322
Everyone, be quiet.

100
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,699
Let's begin.

101
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,879
-What?
-What's that?

102
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,172
What's that? Hey.

103
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,049
Hey, who's controlling that drone?

104
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,134
Who's doing that?

105
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,350
-Hello.
-Go on and begin.

106
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,728
Okay, let us begin.

107
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,105
It's your first time at an event together

108
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,941
after you opened up
about your relationship.

109
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,817
Could you share a word with us?

110
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:50,454
I'm so sorry you had to come
all the way here just for us.

111
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,457
We'll continue to cherish each other.

112
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,583
Thank you.

113
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,794
Nice.

114
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,922
Mr. Sin Jun-young, what about you?

115
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,885
Jun-young, say something.

116
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,809
We're both celebrities

117
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,270
and public figures.

118
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,355
But before that,

119
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,732
I believe we have

120
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,904
the rights to have
our personal lives protected.

121
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,076
I don't understand why

122
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,413
everyone has to gossip about my love life

123
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,835
and why the person I love

124
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,549
needs to be hated
and receive unnecessary comments

125
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,135
when she did nothing wrong.

126
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,721
I don't understand why

127
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,432
I have to be in this position.

128
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,770
I'm a bit confused about this.

129
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,616
This is all I have to say
about this issue.

130
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,700
Also,

131
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,245
I won't be doing any more interviews.

132
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,957
If you still want me around
as a celebrity,

133
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,584
please refrain
from showing too much interest

134
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,711
in my private life from now on.

135
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,591
What's going on?

136
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,259
Jun-young. Hey, Jun-young.

137
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,178
-Where is he going?
-He's leaving?

138
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,304
Is he leaving?

139
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,264
-What's going on?
-He left?

140
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,515
We came all the way here.

141
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,017
Ms. No.

142
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,105
You were stigmatized as a gold-digger
due to Sin Jun-young's actions.

143
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,982
Could you say a few words?

144
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,651
Please say something.

145
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,448
I have nothing to say.

146
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,743
Maybe the person who was really used
in this situation was Ms. Kim Yu-na.

147
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,039
Jun-young might have agreed
to his agency's plan

148
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,292
just so that he could protect you, Ms. No.

149
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,462
He may be fooling everyone again.

150
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,840
Excuse me.
Don't you think you're crossing the line?

151
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,592
Am I wrong?

152
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:15,057
Yes, you're wrong.
I have someone else that I like.

153
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,559
He's much cooler than Jun-young.

154
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,228
Do you expect us to believe that?

155
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,732
I'm sure Jun-young's a huge celebrity,
but he's not my type.

156
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,234
And for your information,

157
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,278
I'm a huge fan of Seo Yun-hu.

158
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,406
She's Seo Yun-hu's fan?

159
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,200
-Is she telling the truth?
-What is going on?

160
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,787
What's all this?

161
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,871
Gosh.

162
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:45,337
NO EUL IS A HUGE FAN OF SEO YUN-HU

163
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,052
Why did I have to mention Seo Yun-hu?

164
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,638
You shouldn't have said that, stupid.

165
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,813
So, you're Yun-hu's fan?

166
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,942
He's really crazy. He's a player, too.

167
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,653
Hey, get out. What if people see you?

168
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,572
Am I not your type? What's your type?

169
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,574
Get off, please.

170
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,534
What's your type?

171
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,245
I'll try to become your type, so tell me.

172
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,247
Come on, people might notice.

173
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,331
Notice what?

174
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,333
The fact that I'm actually your type?

175
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,295
-Hey.
-The fact that you actually like me, too?

176
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,512
Hey, it's me, Eul.

177
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,930
Jun-young is in my car--

178
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,224
Hey.

179
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,311
Hello?

180
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,855
What was that?

181
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,398
Hello?

182
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,317
Where did he go?

183
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,111
Everything that happens to me now
is all because of you.

184
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,696
What?

185
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,040
What a baby.

186
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,547
FOR NO EUL

187
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,928
FOR NO EUL

188
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,774
May I help you?

189
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,776
I don't know much about women's rings.

190
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,738
I'll make a recommendation
if you tell me the occasion.

191
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,365
It's for my mother
who's getting discharged

192
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,908
from the hospital. Any recommendations?

193
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,327
Sure. Just a moment, sir.

194
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,499
Hello?

195
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,697
People say we should trust no one,

196
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,992
but I never thought
he'd be the one to betray me.

197
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,328
He and I've been friends for 50 years.

198
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,457
It's been less than a month
since I sent you money.

199
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,670
My goodness, don't say that.
You're making me upset.

200
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,922
Today, I'm not here because of money.

201
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:39,845
I was just curious how Hyeon-jun,
you, and my nephew and niece are doing.

202
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,390
I almost cut ties with Hyeon-jun

203
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,767
because of how he acted last time.

204
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,480
If his nephew got drunk
and accidentally beat someone,

205
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,983
he could've talked to the police chief
and solved it right away.

206
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,194
But he persistently declined to do so.

207
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,154
Because of that,
my son was imprisoned for a month.

208
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,490
The times have changed now.

209
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:05,037
If anyone finds out that a congressman
asked a police chief to do him a favor...

210
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,956
My goodness. Is that so?

211
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,002
You're such a knowledgeable woman.

212
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:16,256
I'm so dumb
that I haven't even thought that far.

213
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,973
This is why people should hang out
with similar people.

214
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:30,979
Jun-young's mom and I were both dumb.
We would have gotten along well.

215
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,065
Why are you mentioning her again?

216
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,567
Because I feel bad.

217
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,070
She was carrying Hyeon-jun's child.

218
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,905
She was such a nice person.

219
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,490
It just kills me to think that I had

220
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,243
to send her off
just because you asked me to do so.

221
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,828
I think you drank
a bit too much, Hyeon-gil.

222
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,996
I'm not drunk.

223
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,084
I only had half a bottle of soju.

224
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,835
I'm sorry.

225
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,630
I forgot that I promised
to meet someone else.

226
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,466
Enjoy your food before you leave.

227
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,349
Do you think I'm a beggar?

228
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,852
My poor brother, Hyeon-jun.

229
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,021
He doesn't even know that his own son

230
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,147
is a huge celebrity

231
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,942
who's right in front of his eyes.

232
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,778
Instead, he's raising someone else's kid,

233
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,238
calling him his own son.

234
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,739
-His own--
-Hyeon-gil!

235
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,163
You didn't have to shout.

236
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,337
Mr. Kim.

237
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,549
Transfer 300 million won to
Hyeon-gil's account by tomorrow morning.

238
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,634
Don't let my husband know
about any of this.

239
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,658
-That's not necessary, Mr. Kim.
-Ji-tae.

240
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,952
If you send him even
the smallest amount of money,

241
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,247
I won't stay silent.

242
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,332
How much do you know?

243
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,753
Everything.

244
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,424
I know as much as you know.

245
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,635
I even know

246
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,596
that Jun-young is his son.

247
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,359
Tell Dad the truth.

248
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,780
Tell him how

249
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,367
Uncle Hyeon-gil threatened you until now.

250
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,495
Tell him everything.

251
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,289
No.

252
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,502
If I do, your father will leave me.

253
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,586
Mom.

254
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,505
I liked him first.

255
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,299
I liked your father

256
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,262
before Sin Yeong-ok liked him.

257
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,850
I made your father into who he is today.

258
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,518
I did it all.

259
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,647
If your father stayed with Sin Yeong-ok,

260
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,569
he would never have escaped
that bottomless pit.

261
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,238
You're right. I agree.

262
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:14,077
So whatever you tell him,
he'll understand.

263
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,954
So tell him everything and...

264
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,123
He'll go back to her, then.

265
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,460
He never forgot her,
and longed for her even in his dreams.

266
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:27,424
If he finds out that she had his child,
he'll probably run over to his son.

267
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,092
I am...

268
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,638
I am his son, too.

269
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,605
We may not be related by blood,

270
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,816
but I am still his son.

271
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,077
MY SON

272
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,500
-Good afternoon.
-Have you eaten?

273
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,628
Of course I have.

274
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,048
It's odd for you to call at this hour.
Aren't you busy?

275
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,550
I love you, Dad.

276
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,472
I love you.

277
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,102
I still can't give you
Greg Norman's autographed ball.

278
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,942
I found a great bar.

279
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,402
Do you want to grab a drink?
I won't tell Mom.

280
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:33,281
Sure. I actually wanted a drink.

281
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,867
My son, you really are the best.

282
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,661
Give me a call when you get off work.

283
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,287
I love you, my son.

284
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,068
I'll tell him everything.

285
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,736
We're a family.

286
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,030
We can't keep living
under threats and lies.

287
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:20,120
He will never leave you.

288
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,372
Even your biological father left us.

289
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:27,919
He left you and me
to live with the woman he liked.

290
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,089
Your father will leave me, too.

291
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:35,343
He will despise me and hate me.

292
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:37,929
That won't happen.

293
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,682
Just give me three months.

294
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,060
I'll take care of everything,
so give me three months.

295
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,645
Why three months?

296
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,231
Just tell him as soon as possible.

297
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,109
Tell him everything and live--

298
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,571
After three months,
Sin Jun-young will be dead, and...

299
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,075
What...

300
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,370
What are you talking about?

301
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,081
Mom.

302
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,503
Sin Jun-young is sick.

303
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,554
Have you thought about your bucket list?

304
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,265
Yes.

305
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,853
Could you tell me one item on that list?

306
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,731
Hearing "You're my type"

307
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,776
from the person who just
asked me that question.

308
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,196
I'll edit that out.

309
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,365
I'll ask you again.

310
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,533
Tell me one of the items--

311
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:45,914
Hearing "I love you" from the woman
standing in front of me.

312
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,586
Stop joking around.

313
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,130
I wasn't joking.

314
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,052
Did you even wash your hair today?

315
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,347
How can you come to film the guy
you like with oily hair?

316
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,640
I did wash my hair.

317
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,058
I see.

318
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,560
That means you do like me.

319
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,646
You even washed your hair to impress me.

320
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,440
Are you kidding me?

321
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,487
To be honest, I didn't wash my hair.

322
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,281
It's oily and smelly.

323
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,700
Do you want to smell it?
It's awful, right?

324
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,288
Right, I haven't showered
for a week either.

325
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,998
No wonder my body has been itching lately.

326
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,877
I can even fart
in front of you, Jun-young.

327
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:36,673
Jun-young.

328
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,801
We'll do the photo shoot soon,
so please stand by.

329
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:40,969
You should come along.

330
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,554
I'm leaving for Seoul.

331
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:46,015
He's been saying weird things.
He must be tired.

332
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,934
There isn't anything useful I can film.

333
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:58,153
What's wrong with him? Is he sulking?

334
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,113
My gosh. What a baby.

335
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,573
Don't call him a baby.

336
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,033
He's a top star in Korea.

337
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,120
I'd say he's more like a child.
I'll get going.

338
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,672
FOR NO EUL

339
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:22,969
That's great.

340
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,388
Try being more intimate. That's nice.

341
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,518
Wow, you two make a wonderful couple.

342
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:32,937
It looks great.

343
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,357
I guess we really do look great together.

344
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,694
Why don't we date for real?

345
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,201
What's your relationship with Ms. No?

346
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,289
I knew you had a unique taste,

347
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,458
but she's way beneath
your level, don't you think?

348
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,710
You're a top star, you know.

349
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:58,922
Now, try to act

350
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,882
as if you're whispering
your love to each other.

351
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,176
Good.

352
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,553
Let's just focus on the shooting.

353
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,513
That's great.

354
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,640
What does she have that I don't?

355
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,728
Why are you making me feel so awful?

356
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,647
You started it.

357
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,731
That's nice.

358
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,026
You did an interview to play along
with the president.

359
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,029
That looks great.

360
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,448
Just take what you'd like out of this
and leave.

361
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,449
Great.

362
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,452
I'm thankful
that you helped me protect Eul.

363
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,415
Wait.

364
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,459
Let's stop for a bit.

365
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,836
Okay, sure.

366
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,847
Wait. Wait a second.

367
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,224
Ms. No, hurry up.

368
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,475
What is it?

369
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,102
What do we do?

370
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,937
Jun-young just got hurt.

371
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,984
-Why?
-The light stand fell on him.

372
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,403
I hope he's not badly hurt.

373
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,282
Where is he?

374
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,366
He's at the hospital.

375
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,620
One of our managers is waiting in our van.

376
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,873
I have to clear things up here,

377
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,876
so could you please run over to him?

378
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,337
-Okay.
-Please, hurry.

379
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,013
Take good care of her.
Don't speed too much.

380
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,641
Let's go.

381
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,827
Is Jun-young

382
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,997
badly hurt?

383
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,666
Yes.

384
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,088
How bad is it?

385
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,215
I'm not sure,

386
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,259
but I heard that his life
may be in danger.

387
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:52,762
Unbelievable.

388
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,866
Why did you stop?

389
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,370
I want to grab a cup of coffee.

390
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,454
Hey.

391
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,874
Are you crazy?

392
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,253
How can you think about getting coffee

393
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,714
when Jun-young's life is in danger?

394
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,007
It'll only take five minutes.

395
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,675
What are you talking about?

396
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,760
Just keep going.

397
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,931
I have something to say to him.

398
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,392
Hurry up and go!

399
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,228
It'll only take five minutes.
I'll be right back.

400
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,105
What kind of jerk are you?

401
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,907
Get off right now.

402
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,410
I'll drive.

403
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:00,079
Give me the address
to the hospital and leave.

404
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,333
Get out of the car, you jerk! Get off!

405
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,433
Why are you crying?

406
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,560
Were you that worried about me?

407
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,900
What did you want to say to me?

408
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,820
Did you want to confess your love
after hearing that I might die?

409
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,202
Jerk.

410
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,286
Hey.

411
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,376
It wasn't completely a lie.

412
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,296
I have a bump on my head.

413
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,341
I'm serious.

414
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,261
Why did you pretend like you didn't care?

415
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,556
Why did you pretend to not like me
when you were

416
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,016
going to be this worried?

417
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,228
My gosh.

418
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,313
Did you fall again?

419
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,233
Why do you always fall?

420
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,243
Is your leg okay?

421
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,287
Hey.

422
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,083
You...

423
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,459
What?

424
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,963
Look at you.

425
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,675
Oh, right.

426
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,720
My face got torn and I have a bruise.

427
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,767
The inside of my mouth is torn too.

428
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:51,732
It's also hard to move my shoulders.

429
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,613
I wanted to go on a date
before going to the hospital,

430
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,865
but that's all ruined.

431
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,950
The coffee over there is excellent,
you know.

432
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,679
Yes.

433
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,765
You're my type.

434
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,517
Happy now?

435
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,521
And yes.

436
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,607
I like you.

437
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,817
Are you happy now?

438
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,696
What a crazy fool.

439
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,742
How can you go on a date

440
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:44,785
when you're this hurt?

441
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,747
What a bunch of nonsense.

442
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,750
How can you think about getting coffee--

443
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,426
Dad, you're going
to the K-Pop Festival today, right?

444
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,346
Can you take me with you?

445
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,978
Dad, come on. Take me, please?

446
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,483
Can you stop the car?

447
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,156
You're a high school student?

448
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,366
Yes.

449
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,619
Then does that mean
I was fooled by a minor?

450
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,621
-You little--
-I never fooled you.

451
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,082
You never asked if I was in high school.

452
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,629
Hey...

453
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,756
-Do you have money?
-Why?

454
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,009
Are you trying to rob me now?

455
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,053
By the way, I'm older than you.

456
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,347
You're a bold one.

457
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,141
Mind your manners.

458
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,185
Eat slowly. You'll get sick.

459
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,272
Did you starve it for days?

460
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,275
I wouldn't know. This isn't my cat.

461
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,652
-Someone must've abandoned it.
-Really?

462
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,488
Poor thing.

463
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,495
-Why?
-Please take care of this kitten.

464
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,665
I have to go to school, so stay with...

465
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,710
I mean, can you please look after it?

466
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:58,794
No way.

467
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,255
Why would I take care of a stray cat?

468
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,844
Because pretty people are usually nice.

469
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,983
Your eyes

470
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,819
Your hands

471
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:28,074
Hover around me

472
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,241
-Like a wind--
-Be quiet.

473
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,160
Stop singing that stupid song.

474
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,495
Okay.

475
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:34,955
Ms. Sin.

476
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,582
-This is bad.
-Why? What is it?

477
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,793
Jun-young is...

478
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,628
-You have to come with me.
-Why?

479
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,546
Hey, go and get her jacket.

480
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,464
-Hurry.
-What?

481
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,049
-What is it?
-Just come along.

482
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,051
-Put this down.
-What's with you?

483
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,140
Why are we here?

484
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,351
I thought he was hurt.
Let's go to the hospital.

485
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:58,020
He got hurt there,
so we called a doctor over.

486
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,940
Ms. Sin, hurry up.

487
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,359
You have to hurry. He's dying.

488
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,581
I knew this would happen. I knew it.

489
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,250
You're a fraud.

490
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:25,214
This wasn't my idea. It was Jun-young's.

491
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,091
He must have had a lot of fun
fooling Ms. No,

492
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,009
and now he's doing it to you, too.

493
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,553
Move. Come on!

494
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,892
What are you doing? Let go of me.

495
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,269
-Can you grab her?
-Okay.

496
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,147
What are you two doing?

497
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:46,402
The Minister of Culture and Sports
is giving you an award today.

498
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:52,074
It's for mothers who raised
Hallyu celebrities.

499
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,243
What?

500
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,580
Why don't you give her a big hand?

501
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,123
Congratulations.

502
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,916
My goodness.

503
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,795
You're so pretty
that everything looks great on you.

504
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,423
I can't pick one.
I'll just take everything.

505
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,716
Yes, sir.

506
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,511
No, I'm not going to buy them,
so don't bother.

507
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,555
Just ignore her.

508
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,602
You must feel like we're on good terms

509
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,770
just because I let you
hang around a couple of times.

510
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,940
Politicians will be there
with their families today.

511
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,650
Ministers will be there

512
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,277
and so will congressmen.

513
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:33,365
I heard Congressman Choi Hyeon-jun
is coming too. Isn't that right?

514
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,950
You're right.

515
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,912
People in Africa sing my songs

516
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,789
and people in Brazil cry over my dramas.

517
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,627
Isn't this enough
for you to be proud of your son?

518
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:53,969
How do I look?

519
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,931
Wow, people say the tailor makes the man.

520
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,684
Are you really my twin brother, Jeong-sik?

521
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,645
You just need to hold your tummy in, Dad.

522
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,523
-Is that good?
-Excellent.

523
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,859
Will Ms. Sin be on TV too?

524
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,320
-I'm not sure.
-Jun-young

525
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:15,366
even sent a tuxedo for you to wear,
asking you to accompany her.

526
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:19,161
Maybe he thinks of you like a father.

527
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:22,873
What are you talking about?

528
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:26,126
He's asking me to accompany her

529
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,505
because she'd feel awkward sitting alone.

530
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,174
I'm a handsome man, you know.

531
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,094
Dad, I'll ask you questions
like a reporter.

532
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,303
Try to answer them.

533
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:41,183
I heard you've been
acquainted with Jun-young

534
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,686
and his mother for a long time.

535
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,398
Could you say something about his mother?

536
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,612
Jun-young's mom

537
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:57,199
is much like Mencius' mother.

538
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:02,079
To make Jun-young a world-renowned star,

539
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:03,914
she...

540
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,753
-What did she do?
-Nothing.

541
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,880
To be honest, she was only mean to him

542
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,382
and said he wasn't her son.

543
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,634
Excuse me, more radish kimchi, please.

544
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,719
Sure.

545
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:21,015
What's taking her so long, anyway?

546
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:25,269
WE LOVE YOU!
JUN-YOUNG, YOU'RE MINE

547
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:28,230
JUN-YOUNG, I MISS YOU
JUN-YOUNG, I LOVE YOU

548
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,778
What is he saying? I can't hear anything.

549
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,717
I don't think it's a technical problem.

550
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,220
What's wrong with this?

551
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,890
Why are you still here?

552
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,935
Where else would I be?

553
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,520
Aren't you going to the K-Pop Festival?

554
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,939
His manager called me
and told me not to come.

555
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,190
What are you talking about?

556
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:56,193
His mom is receiving
an award from the minister.

557
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,194
Hurry up and go.

558
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,071
You'll have a lot to put on camera.

559
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,155
But still,

560
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,200
he told me over
and over again not to come.

561
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:08,288
We're not a PR agency
that does whatever they tell us to do.

562
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,373
Get up and go!

563
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,509
At least brush your teeth
before you leave.

564
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,693
Over here, please.

565
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,679
Over here, please.

566
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,659
Look over here.

567
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,494
Over here, please.

568
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,999
MY NUMBER ONE TREASURE

569
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,585
Hey, Jik.

570
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:01,044
When are you coming home?

571
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:04,172
I have an urgent shooting. I'll be late.

572
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,924
Why? Is something wrong?

573
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,217
No, I just called.

574
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:08,969
Will you be very late?

575
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,222
Okay.

576
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,474
Make sure you eat something...

577
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,602
Hello?

578
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,937
Did you forget what day it is today?

579
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,606
What day is it?

580
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,693
It's not Jik's birthday

581
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,194
and it's not your birthday, either.

582
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,031
It's the anniversary
of your father's death, idiot.

583
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,076
I don't understand what's so important

584
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,121
that you'd forget about today.
You're an awful daughter.

585
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:39,833
Give it to me, Na-ri.

586
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,714
I'm sure Dad will understand
that you're busy.

587
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,382
Don't worry about it.

588
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,136
He's right.

589
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,598
Making a living would be more important
than preparing a rite for your dad.

590
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:58,018
We'll take care of everything here,
so don't worry.

591
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:01,063
Just make some time
to say your prayers, okay?

592
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:03,899
Hello?

593
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,318
Can you hear me, Eul?

594
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:08,737
What's going on?

595
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,530
Did it get disconnected?

596
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:23,043
I guess you'll just have to do it
on your own.

597
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,546
I'm fine. I can do it alone.

598
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,215
I'm so proud of you.

599
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:33,428
How can you two be so different
when you're siblings?

600
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,605
Are you waiting for a call?

601
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,357
You've been looking at your phone all day.

602
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,441
I'm waiting for Hyeon-u.

603
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,568
Oh, right.

604
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,655
Why didn't he call yet?

605
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,533
He always brought the drink for the rite.

606
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,826
You should give him a call.

607
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,202
The number doesn't exist anymore.

608
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,497
-What?
-I've been calling him,

609
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,874
but it says
the number doesn't exist anymore.

610
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:07,337
I hope nothing happened to him.

611
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,760
Why did you bring Ha-ru along?

612
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:59,806
Dad asked me to come along
because he thought

613
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,350
I needed a break from my studies.

614
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,395
He wanted me to eat good food

615
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,690
and relieve my stress
by watching celebrities perform.

616
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:10,317
Right, Dad?

617
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,152
She's right.

618
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,614
Please let her off just for today.

619
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,407
Will there be celebrities there?

620
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,035
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

621
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,871
Like who?

622
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:26,041
You don't even watch TV.
How would you know?

623
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,878
I hardly know any of them, either.

624
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,546
I rarely watch TV.

625
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,053
Will Sin Jun-young be there?

626
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:41,097
You know Sin Jun-young?

627
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,892
Come on, Dad. Everyone knows who he is.

628
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,311
That's what my friends say.

629
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,231
My friends were surprised
that I didn't know him.

630
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,690
Will he be there?

631
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,109
-No.
-No.

632
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,071
He's on an overseas tour.

633
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:01,076
My friend is a fan of his, so she told me.

634
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,122
Why? Are you his fan, too?

635
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,207
No.

636
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:11,086
But I wanted to see him, though.
That's too bad.

637
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,069
You can take Ha-ru home.

638
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:37,529
-Mom.
-Why?

639
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:39,656
She's already here. Let's go in together.

640
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:43,410
I heard today's a very important occasion.

641
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,162
People would think
she's not studying for college

642
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,706
if they see her here.

643
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,666
Why worry about what others would think?

644
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:50,750
Exactly.

645
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,087
Ha-ru, go home. Okay?

646
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,047
No. I didn't even get to see Jun-young.

647
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,382
I can't leave like this.

648
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:00,010
My goodness. Hey! Stop!

649
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,261
Stop.

650
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:04,639
Let's go.

651
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,225
Ha-ru, leave the cat and come here.

652
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,353
Is Sin Jun-young here?

653
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,064
Yes, I heard he is.

654
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,066
Why did you lie, then?

655
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,154
I was afraid you'd send Ha-ru back.

656
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:25,869
You already know that she's his fan.

657
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:27,913
Like she said,

658
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:31,082
she's too busy following him
to get into trouble,

659
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,834
so let's be thankful about that.

660
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,380
Come here. Let's go.

661
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,902
Dad. I'm sorry.

662
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,083
Go away.

663
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,295
I said, go away.

664
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,091
Hey.

665
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,511
I set this all up for my Dad.
He didn't even get to--

666
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,012
Why are you hitting my cat?

667
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,187
It's the gold digger.

668
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,524
Is that your cat?

669
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,151
Do you see this?

670
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,654
You should train--

671
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:43,738
I'll pay for it.

672
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:47,450
I can pay for that.
It won't cost much anyway.

673
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,536
What did you say?

674
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,789
Here. Are we cool?

675
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,169
-You little brat.
-Ouch.

676
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,839
-Why did you hit me?
-How old are you?

677
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,008
Where did you learn your manners?

678
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,511
Didn't you learn
to apologize for your mistakes?

679
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:08,596
Ha-ru.

680
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,016
Dad.

681
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,606
She just hit me.

682
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,903
Did my daughter do something to you?

683
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:30,618
Did my car do something to you?

684
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:45,884
What's going on?

685
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,595
What did you do wrong?

686
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,263
I didn't do anything wrong.

687
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,600
She just hit me for no reason
while I was passing by.

688
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,522
Did you hit my daughter?

689
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,070
Don't you remember me?

690
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,239
Do you know me?

691
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,950
She's a gold digger.

692
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:15,330
She tried to use Jun-young,
but her face got revealed,

693
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,956
so she failed
before she could do anything.

694
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,916
Ha-ru.

695
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:29,886
Did she do this?

696
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,346
No.

697
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,973
It wasn't me. It was the kitten.

698
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,352
But it doesn't know any better.
It's just a kitten.

699
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,523
Today's the anniversary
of my father's death.

700
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

701
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:57,872
Here.

702
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,542
I'm sure the cat didn't mean to do that.

703
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,585
So don't be mad
and buy it again with this.

704
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,463
Why are you giving her 50,000 won?

705
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,340
-That costs less than 3,000 won.
-Ha-ru.

706
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,892
Here. Go on and take it.

707
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,894
You should apologize first.

708
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,797
Instead of giving her money,

709
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,800
you should apologize properly first.

710
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,686
How would you like a different mom?

711
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:47,190
I'll introduce you to mothers
who'd be thrilled to have you as a son.

712
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,318
-Will you hit me if I ask for a kiss?
-All right.

713
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,446
What happened to that man?

714
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,532
The man I hit with my car a long time ago.

715
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,699
I'm sorry, Eul.

716
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,702
I'm so sorry.

717
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:03,498
After Mr. Choi Hyeon-jun stepped in,
everything changed.

718
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:04,707
Eul.

719
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:09,212
Let's go on a trip, Eul. Let's go away
for a month and pretend

720
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,838
like we're the last people on earth.

721
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:11,923
What?

722
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,007
I need a doctor.

723
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,926
I need a doctor!

724
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:16,386
Doctor!
