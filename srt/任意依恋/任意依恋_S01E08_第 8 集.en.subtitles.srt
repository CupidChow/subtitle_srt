1
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,221
I love you, Eul.

2
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,351
Stop it, Jun-young.

3
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,982
The entire nation knows
that you're a good actor.

4
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,901
So stop it already.

5
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,988
Think about what you did to her.

6
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,198
How can you even look at her in the eye

7
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,075
and say that you like her?

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,202
I love you,

9
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:38,997
Eul.

10
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,339
Jik kept telling me to be careful.

11
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:54,387
He said you and I live
in different worlds now.

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,766
He told me not to get confused

13
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,226
by every little thing you do.

14
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,981
He told me not to get shaken or hurt.

15
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,068
He kept warning me.

16
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:18,203
I guess I'm the crazy one here!
I'm the crazy one!

17
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,541
My gosh, I should've listened to Jik.

18
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,763
I never

19
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,310
used you or toyed with you.

20
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,732
Focus only on me.

21
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,402
Listen only to me.

22
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,447
I love you,

23
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,032
Eul.

24
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,130
Don't go.

25
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,428
Don't go, Eul.

26
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,640
We were just coworkers who got along well.

27
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,476
But then things just happened.

28
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,437
We're too busy to see each other nowadays.

29
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,690
My gosh, don't say that.
Stars always say that.

30
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,152
At your birthday party,

31
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,529
I heard Jun-young gave you
a bouquet of 1,000 roses

32
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,490
and sang you a song.

33
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,450
Everyone's talking about it.

34
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,410
JUN-YOUNG CONFESSED HIS LOVE FOR HER
ON HER BIRTHDAY

35
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,411
Well, that was...

36
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,289
He's a busy man. I didn't think he'd come.

37
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,249
He just suddenly showed up.

38
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,751
I was very surprised.

39
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,504
But after his concert,

40
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,546
Jun-young just disappeared

41
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,175
hand-in-hand with the producer
of his documentary

42
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,635
after proposing to her.

43
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,553
Did that shock you?

44
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,722
No, not at all.

45
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,099
I guess not.

46
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,644
It was a show to shield you
from prying reporters.

47
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,772
You knew about it in advance, right?

48
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,774
Yes.

49
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,401
She must be friends with a warlock.

50
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,487
I'm amazed. Your acting was excellent.

51
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,198
If so...

52
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:49,951
Eul.

53
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,452
Did you also know in advance

54
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,372
that Jun-young used you
to cover up their scandal?

55
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,791
Well, first of all,

56
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,128
he's a warm-hearted guy.
He's also considerate

57
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,004
-Of course I did.
-and sincere.

58
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,048
He told me at the concert hall.

59
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,259
He told me what he'd do

60
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,760
and asked me to react appropriately.

61
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,471
So you're saying
you put on an act, as well?

62
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,431
Yes.

63
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,434
What do you think?
Wasn't I pretty impressive?

64
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,437
Maybe I should try a career as an actress.

65
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,315
I'm really out of words.

66
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,777
Why are you telling me this now?

67
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,698
We were so worried about you
because we had no clue.

68
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,617
-Sorry.
-Saying sorry won't cut it this time.

69
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,996
Because of you,
your poor brother skipped school.

70
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,623
He couldn't sleep or eat.

71
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,917
Not to mention Hyeon-u who...

72
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,628
Forget it. You're such a brat.

73
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:44,505
I'll kill you.

74
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,883
You deserve to die.

75
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,843
I'm tired.

76
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,804
Will you please stop?

77
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,606
Would you like to say anything
to our viewers?

78
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,941
Hello, everyone.

79
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,487
I sincerely apologize for confusing you

80
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,322
and not telling the truth.

81
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,491
To protect me,

82
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,577
Jun-young acted a bit drastically,
risking his own reputation.

83
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,580
I hope you don't blame him too much.

84
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,043
Again, I would like to apologize
to his fans and mine.

85
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,424
Yu-na is amazing.

86
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,177
Playing the lead in a miniseries

87
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,095
really helped improve her acting skills.

88
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,015
I'll sue anyone who says
her acting is horrible.

89
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,602
Sir, you're deceiving the whole nation.

90
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,812
We aren't swindlers, you know.

91
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,397
There's no just reason for this.

92
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,565
What are people saying?

93
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,859
"A top celebrity couple is born."

94
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,529
"This is the class of a Hallyu star."

95
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,405
"He cares so much for his woman."

96
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,157
"Jun-young's so chivalrous."

97
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,326
"Where can I find a man like him?

98
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,578
I'm a woman similar to Yu-na."

99
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,663
That's right.

100
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,457
A star like Yu-na

101
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,084
matches Jun-young's level.

102
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,586
Not a common girl like that--

103
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,588
I see why you'd want this.

104
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:11,759
But what does Yu-na get out
of taking part in this con?

105
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,679
Even if she's your cousin's daughter--

106
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,390
She was offered four commercials
since the scandal.

107
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,350
After her movie failed,

108
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,477
people complained
that a supporting actress

109
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,020
had stolen the lead role.

110
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,440
But no one's saying that
after the scandal broke.

111
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,360
This is what you call a win-win situation.

112
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,736
Still, this is wrong.

113
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,489
What does that make Ms. No?

114
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:38,160
"I feel bad for the producer. Was she used
as a shield for the two stars?

115
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:42,540
She's a professional at this. If you
need to avoid a scandal, hire Ms. No.

116
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,627
Call the hotline at 1288-1288.
Call us now."

117
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,339
See? It worked out for her, as well.

118
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,174
If Jun-young's fans saw her anywhere,

119
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,801
she would've gotten killed by them.

120
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,886
But they don't even call her
a gold digger anymore.

121
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,638
I still think this is wrong.

122
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,225
The person Jun-young
actually likes is Ms. No...

123
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,273
But why is Jun-young so quiet?

124
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,735
Right? With his temper,
he would have come and yelled

125
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,195
and grabbed him by the collar by now.

126
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,115
But he's not even showing up.
It's making me nervous.

127
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,241
You're right.

128
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,327
Don't you think that's odd?

129
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,829
He hasn't called once.

130
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,414
This isn't like him.

131
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,540
Maybe

132
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,126
-he didn't read the news yet.
-That's not possible.

133
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,421
The scandal's the only thing on TV,
the papers, and the internet.

134
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,256
Maybe

135
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,343
there's a blackout at his house.

136
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,720
He'd still have access to the internet.

137
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,599
What's going on?

138
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,602
Talking about it just made me feel worse.

139
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,023
Why did you two have to bring that up?

140
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,901
I guess you feel
a little bit guilty after all.

141
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:53,986
Maybe...

142
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,404
Maybe what?

143
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,323
"Mr. Namgung, you jerk,

144
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,534
you must be really crazy for money!"
He could have thought that,

145
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,536
and maybe died from getting too angry.

146
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,289
Your dad grabbed me by the collar
last time, and now you're doing the same?

147
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,375
Does my collar belong
to you two? You jerk.

148
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,675
Hey, this is...

149
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,802
Hello, Grandpa.

150
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,345
Thanks for the food.

151
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,097
You're the best, Grandpa.

152
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,853
-Really?
-This is good.

153
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,313
There's cheese in it.

154
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,898
Hey, Grandpa.

155
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,693
Why didn't you tell us
about your rich friend?

156
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,864
What are you talking about?
I don't have a rich friend.

157
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,116
Thanks, Grandpa.

158
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,034
I love you, man.

159
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,661
Your friend is awesome.

160
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,995
Don't lie.

161
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,748
Your friend bought burgers
for the whole school,

162
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,583
even for all the teachers.

163
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,795
What are you talking about?

164
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,672
You must be mistaken.

165
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,924
Hey, Grandpa, the dean wants to see you.

166
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,717
See you later.

167
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,018
Thank you so much.

168
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,688
-Could you sign this for me?
-Sure.

169
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,566
"To the student dean."

170
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,025
Oh, you're the dean.

171
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,614
-Can I also take a photo?
-Sure.

172
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,199
Here's my favorite student,

173
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,993
No Jik.

174
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,162
My goodness. How could you?

175
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,206
Why didn't you tell us
you were friends with a star?

176
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,749
Could you say hello?

177
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,043
Hi. Study hard, okay?

178
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,577
It's been a while, Jik.

179
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,288
All the students, teachers,

180
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,041
and staff add up to about 930 people.

181
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,419
The burger set costs 6,100 won, right?

182
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,717
You've grown a lot since we last met.

183
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,053
-I wouldn't recognize--
-That's

184
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,223
a total of 5,673,000 won.

185
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:30,809
Give me your account number.

186
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,061
I heard you're really smart.

187
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,188
You want to go to medical school?

188
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,732
I can't pay all of it back right now.

189
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,152
I'll make a transfer every month.

190
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,780
Give me your account number.

191
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,995
Come on, give it to me.

192
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,666
Jik.

193
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,422
I

194
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,260
like your sister.

195
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,014
I like her so much that I'm going crazy.

196
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,060
I can't eat.

197
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,397
I can't sleep or breathe.

198
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,359
I'm barely living.

199
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,365
So I need your help.

200
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,162
Tell her not to run away.

201
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,167
Tell her to look at me.

202
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,007
Tell her to trust me.

203
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,473
I heard she only listens to you.

204
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,031
I'll send 5,673,000 won

205
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,992
to your agency as soon as I get the money.

206
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,167
Jik.

207
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,273
I never

208
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,196
used you or toyed with you.

209
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,201
Focus only on me.

210
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,954
Listen only to me.

211
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:56,956
I love you,

212
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,374
Eul.

213
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,544
I love you, Eul.

214
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:07,716
No...

215
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,552
CHOI JI-TAE

216
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,527
Sir.

217
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,323
I picked up the car you parked outside

218
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,075
Mr. Sin Jun-young's house.

219
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,702
Thank you.

220
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,295
For just one minute,

221
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,966
may I speak freely as a friend, sir?

222
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,469
Sure.

223
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,138
Stop this, Ji-tae.

224
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,473
You went too far already.

225
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,059
Apologize to Jeong-eun,

226
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,438
and give up on Ms. No.

227
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,064
Do as I say.

228
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,483
If she finds out who you are...

229
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,611
If Jeong-eun finds out who she is...

230
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:13,157
If your parents find out
who she is, then--

231
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,367
-Your minute's up.
-Ji-tae.

232
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,456
Your time's up, Mr. Kang.

233
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,332
Sir.

234
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,334
Yes, sir.

235
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,962
Ms. Kim, did you get what I asked for?

236
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,954
Who is it?

237
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,055
Na-ri said you hadn't eaten anything.

238
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,474
It already cooled down.

239
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,309
Eat up.

240
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,236
Here.

241
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,408
Go on.

242
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,493
She has hands, too.

243
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,081
It's not like she's critically ill.

244
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,709
You don't have to feed her like that.

245
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,798
If you don't want abalone porridge, I also
brought your favorite green bean porridge.

246
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,841
Do you want that instead?

247
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,678
I'm fine, so can you please--

248
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,721
If you're fine, eat.

249
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,015
Do you know how you look?

250
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,726
You look like you could die
a minute from now.

251
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,354
Open up.

252
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,279
Gosh.

253
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,448
This abalone porridge is horrible.

254
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,117
Don't eat it. It'll ruin your appetite.

255
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,247
This is my friend's place, not mine.

256
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,791
I can prepare my own food,
so please leave.

257
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,418
Eul.

258
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,712
That's right. Don't eat porridge.

259
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,255
You need to eat rice.

260
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,674
We Koreans need to eat rice.

261
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,564
You're really weird.

262
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,235
I heard you rejected her.

263
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,571
Why are you still hanging around?

264
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,117
You don't want her
but you don't want others to have her?

265
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,872
Does Ms. Kim Yu-na know you're here?

266
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,875
How would she?

267
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,461
I don't even have her number.

268
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,633
Gosh, that tasted really disgusting.

269
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,805
By the way,

270
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:07,849
let me

271
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,562
comment on how you said
I have no right to love Eul.

272
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,856
Do we need a permit to be in love?

273
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,858
I can love whoever I want.

274
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,445
Why else would we have free will?

275
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,949
Why are you smiling?

276
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,412
You're right.

277
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,790
A man loving a woman

278
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,543
isn't about having rights.

279
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,339
If you love someone,

280
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,634
you can just love that person.

281
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,430
I was confused,
but you straightened things out for me.

282
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,765
Thank you.

283
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,935
Who are you?

284
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,692
You're hiding an expensive watch
underneath a cheap jacket.

285
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,527
Who are you and why are you

286
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,904
hanging around Eul
in such a mismatched style?

287
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,617
That watch has such
a delicate mechanism that

288
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,619
no fakes have been made.

289
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,622
Who are you?

290
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,752
You're not a thief or a robber, are you?

291
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,587
Why do you care who I am?

292
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,715
We're just two undeserving men

293
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,550
who happen to like the same woman.

294
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,678
That's the unfortunate tragedy.

295
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,895
12 MISSED CALLS
HA-RU

296
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,819
Why didn't you pick up, Ji-tae?

297
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,655
Mom just collapsed.

298
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,828
Mom.

299
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,876
-Ji-tae.
-Why are you here?

300
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,713
She wanted to go to the sauna,
so I went with her.

301
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,633
She suddenly complained of chest pain
and passed out.

302
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,759
What did you do?

303
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,971
-What?
-What did you do that made her pass out?

304
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,474
What do you mean?

305
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,976
How could she have done something?

306
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,356
Mom's still alive because Jeong-eun
brought her here right away.

307
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,359
Where were you while all this happened?

308
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,820
I called you over ten times.

309
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,323
Sorry, Ji-tae.

310
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,825
I should have taken

311
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,785
extra good care of her.

312
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,621
I'm really sorry.

313
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,414
Why should you apologize?

314
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,416
Dad's on a business trip,

315
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,877
and Ji-tae didn't even pick up.

316
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,590
I would have died of fear
if I didn't have you to rely on.

317
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,261
Don't worry, Ha-ru.

318
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,846
Your mom will be fine.

319
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,363
The doctor said

320
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,490
it could be a side effect
of the kidney transplant.

321
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,660
We'll find out for sure
when the test results are out.

322
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,537
She'll be fine.

323
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,455
Don't worry too much.

324
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,541
Jeong-eun's talking to you.

325
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,876
Why won't you answer?

326
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,796
You didn't even thank our mom's lifesaver.

327
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:25,881
Ha-ru.

328
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,049
Where are your manners?

329
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,969
I'm going to tell Dad about you.

330
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,139
You shouldn't say things like that.

331
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,142
He didn't answer his phone
because he was at work.

332
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,104
It's hard to answer a call
when you're working.

333
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,543
Where is she?

334
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,152
Finish your meal and come out.

335
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,528
I'll wait out here.

336
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,906
Eat up.

337
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:02,978
Excuse me.

338
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,648
Can I have another bowl of rice?

339
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,941
Isn't that Sin Jun-young?

340
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,484
I don't think so.

341
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,528
What would he be doing here? It's not him.

342
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,782
-I think it's him.
-It can't be. Let's go.

343
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,169
You have an upset stomach.

344
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,713
The tip of your hand is cold
and it's lumpy here.

345
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,257
I know a doctor who can help you out.

346
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:15,842
Shall we go?

347
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,596
Ma'am, give us the check, please.

348
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,601
KOREAN FOOD RESTAURANT

349
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,977
Let go.

350
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,941
-Do I seem easy to you?
-No.

351
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,777
-Am I a pushover?
-No.

352
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,487
Then why are you doing this to me?

353
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,571
What did I do?

354
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,157
I'm just upset because you seem sick.

355
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,493
I feel worse because it's my fault,

356
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,870
so I want to help and make you feel okay.

357
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,497
That's all.

358
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,460
You just shed the title of a being
a gold digger thanks to Yu-na.

359
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,712
If people notice us fighting in the open,

360
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,880
it'll look really bad.

361
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,548
You won't die,
so just come with me quietly.

362
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,052
Just let go of my hand.

363
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,054
Mind your business
whether I'm sick or not.

364
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,223
-Say something that makes more sense.
-What?

365
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,642
I have no intention of letting go.

366
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,185
Shall we stand here all day?

367
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:08,645
You lunatic.

368
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,688
You got that right. Now come with me.

369
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,033
Do you want to avoid me that badly?

370
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,619
Yes.

371
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:30,375
My fans wish for a chance
to look at me for a minute.

372
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,795
They'd want to kill you
if they heard that.

373
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,674
Drop me off at the hospital and get lost.

374
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:38,758
Okay.

375
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,304
I'm good at getting lost.

376
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,808
I'll disappear from your sight right away

377
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,685
without leaving a trace.

378
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,563
But just not right now.

379
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,315
-What?
-I'll go after a minimum of three months

380
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,985
and a maximum of four months.

381
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,282
I'm going to cling onto Hyeon-u again.

382
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,785
I'll make a scene until he accepts me.

383
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,996
I'll visit him, call him,

384
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,123
-cry, beg--
-Do what you want.

385
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,584
I like him, not you.

386
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,127
-As if I care.
-Hey.

387
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,004
I don't care who you like.

388
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,340
Pride and jealousy?

389
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,761
I have no time for that.

390
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,894
Why is the hospital so far away?

391
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,897
Is it even in Seoul?

392
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:46,159
IHWASOO YUKGAEJANG

393
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,289
Where's the hospital?

394
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,713
SIN JUN-YOUNG'S FANS ARE NOT WELCOME

395
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,844
If my mom tries to chase you out,
say you're my anti-fan.

396
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,388
Your mom?

397
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:09,641
Yes. My mom.

398
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:14,813
She's an expert when it comes to
folk remedies for an upset stomach.

399
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:25,073
-This time, it's on me.
-Don't say that.

400
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,700
JUN-YOUNG AND YU-NA
HAVE BEEN DATING FOR A YEAR

401
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,329
We'll pay now.

402
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,289
Okay.

403
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,166
Did you enjoy your meal?

404
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,793
Yes, we did.

405
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,045
Welcome to--

406
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,432
Goodbye.

407
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,184
Thanks. Goodbye.

408
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,941
WE'RE CLOSED FOR PERSONAL REASONS

409
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,115
Let go. I won't run away.

410
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,492
Your mom's watching.

411
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,664
I'm sorry for introducing myself so late.

412
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,374
My name is No Eul.

413
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,792
Aren't you

414
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,295
-the gold digger?
-Oh, that.

415
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,006
I'm not a gold digger.

416
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:27,927
I'm just a victim who was used
to stop Sin Jun-young's scandal.

417
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,805
She has an upset stomach because of me.

418
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,432
Please help her, Mom.

419
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,392
No, you don't have to.

420
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,102
I'll just go and buy some medicine.

421
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,146
Sorry for intruding.

422
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,230
Goodbye.

423
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,112
You really don't have to worry.

424
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,865
I'm really not a gold digger,

425
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,366
and your son and I

426
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,244
are not dating.

427
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,412
That's not true.

428
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,248
There's something between you two.

429
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,167
Whether it's indigestion or not,

430
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,128
you're the first girl that Jun-young

431
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,963
ever brought over.

432
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,257
She's the girl I like, Mom.

433
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,051
I told you over the phone last time.

434
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,471
His manager told me that

435
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,599
Jun-young's not exactly
in his right mind these days.

436
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,560
He got hit on the head
with a wooden stick while shooting,

437
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,978
so his brain--

438
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,567
Anyway, I'm just trying to tell you that

439
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,110
he makes poor judgments--

440
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,196
I don't know why
I can't stop thinking of her.

441
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,908
She's been on my mind
for the last nine years.

442
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,620
And I realized that
I'm madly in love with her

443
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,539
only about two weeks ago.

444
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,125
Hey, Sin Jun-young.

445
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,378
This is strange.

446
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,296
Everyone on TV says

447
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,882
you're seeing someone else.

448
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,968
That's the only thing
people are talking about.

449
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,552
But here you are saying that

450
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,471
you like the gold digger,
I mean, gold miner...

451
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,932
No, this girl with the eyes
of a scared rabbit.

452
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,058
No.

453
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,477
That's what he says. It's not mutual.

454
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,145
-No Eul.
-What's going on?

455
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,357
She doesn't like you, but you like her?

456
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,566
Yeong-ok!

457
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,153
I think something is wrong with his head.

458
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,531
Yong-deuk.

459
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,367
Take the sign off and accept customers.

460
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,745
I can't believe we closed the shop
for two clowns.

461
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,288
What nonsense is this?

462
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,625
I'm good at

463
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,962
knowing where I stand.

464
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,677
Whatever your son says,

465
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,679
I'll do my best to avoid him.

466
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:38,057
You don't have anything to worry about.

467
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,934
Nothing will happen.

468
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,185
Hey.

469
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,396
If you don't believe me,

470
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,025
-I'll write it down and sign it.
-Why would you do that?

471
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,568
You're making me angry.

472
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,112
If that's not enough,

473
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,989
-I can just disappear.
-Eul.

474
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,866
I'll disappear to a place

475
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,536
where Jun-young can't find me.

476
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,678
Wait.

477
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:19,599
Don't poke too hard
just because you hate me.

478
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,608
Aren't you going to do it?

479
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,613
I didn't do it yet.

480
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,031
I see.

481
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,829
Please don't hate me too much.

482
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,081
I don't hate you.

483
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,083
Why not?

484
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,544
I'd want to kill me if I were you.

485
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,590
I don't. You know where you stand.

486
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,988
What's seven times eight?

487
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,990
-What?
-The times table.

488
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,575
What's seven times eight?

489
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,327
-It's 56.
-You're sane.

490
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,371
Your head's fine.

491
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,708
When Guk-yeong

492
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,045
fell madly in love with a gold digger,

493
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,089
he said three times three was eight.

494
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,134
What's eight times seven, then?

495
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,802
-It's 56.
-Good.

496
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,220
You're fine.

497
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,474
Why would someone who's sane

498
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,186
fall for someone
who wears cheap sneakers like that?

499
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,605
Girls who wear sparkly high heels

500
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,941
must be around you all the time.

501
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,109
I know, right?

502
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,237
Why did I forego girls
who wear expensive heels

503
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,241
and fall for a girl who wears cheap shoes?

504
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,579
The apple really doesn't fall far
from the tree.

505
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,251
Your father

506
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,754
ignored all the smart
and pretty college girls

507
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,592
and fell for your mother
who thought that Gandhi

508
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,178
was a Korean monk.

509
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,522
When you grow older
and learn how the world works,

510
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,150
you'll see that high heels
are better than sneakers.

511
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,361
You'll forget all about when you fell for

512
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,529
cheap sneakers.

513
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,781
Just like that.

514
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,783
Just like Choi Hyeon-jun.

515
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,077
With all his connections,

516
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,788
he could've easily tracked down your mom.

517
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,625
But all these years, he never did.

518
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,598
Welcome back.

519
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,438
Why don't you get changed?

520
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,234
He might find out

521
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:19,570
that you've fallen for a lowly girl.

522
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,281
Do you like her that much?

523
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,785
Enough to exchange your expensive suit

524
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:30,248
for a cheap jacket to match her level?

525
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,090
I want to spend time with my family today.

526
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,842
I'll have Mr. Kang drive you home.

527
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,720
-Goodbye.
-What?

528
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,431
Ji-tae.

529
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,242
Fortunately,

530
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,744
it wasn't what we feared.

531
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,830
Everything seems normal.

532
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,540
You can leave tomorrow--

533
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,582
No.

534
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,502
I fear for my health and my life.

535
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,129
Pardon?

536
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:21,132
I received my husband's kidney
and it extended my life,

537
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,384
but you can't say I'm cured.

538
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,180
A transplanted kidney
lasts about 10 to 15 years.

539
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,808
That's only statistics.

540
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,811
A kidney can fail at any time.

541
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,772
So you could say I'm terminally ill.

542
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,358
Ma'am.

543
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:43,195
"Our staff will do their best,
but the family members,

544
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,741
especially you, Mr. Choi,
must do your best as her husband

545
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,161
to help her relax and not get any stress.

546
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,413
You need to give her
extra attention and consideration.

547
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:57,376
We cannot guarantee the results
if she ends up getting another surgery."

548
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:02,256
Could you say that to my husband?

549
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,760
Honey.

550
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,598
Honey.

551
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,643
Are the results back?

552
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,312
How is she?

553
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,690
I'm sorry to have to say this.

554
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,736
There are some causes for concern.

555
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,657
Is her body rejecting the kidney?

556
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,119
Her condition
is not that serious yet, but--

557
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,329
What, then?

558
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,375
What can we do?

559
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,460
What must I do?

560
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,639
You and I will become family
in a month's time.

561
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,560
I told your mother at the sauna that

562
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,314
I would like to become
her daughter-in-law soon.

563
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,403
Your parents' wedding anniversary
is next month.

564
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,696
I suggested we get married then.

565
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,575
Your mother looked overjoyed.

566
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,452
You should have

567
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,622
been there to see her face.

568
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,537
Stop!

569
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,664
How...

570
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,084
You can't pour fish sauce like it's water!

571
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,841
It's salty. It's so salty.

572
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:12,845
Well, then...

573
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,895
What are you doing, you fool?

574
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,146
You said it's salty.

575
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,149
My goodness.

576
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:35,910
Isn't Eul pretty

577
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,828
just like how you once were?

578
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,624
But I'm not going to let her
become like you.

579
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,462
I won't let her live the life you did.

580
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,963
I won't let her get discouraged

581
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,841
thinking about our difference
in status or background.

582
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:58,974
The cabbage tastes terrible.

583
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,477
Did they deceive me again?

584
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,771
I won't let her run off like you did.

585
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,817
What's wrong with the cabbage you sold me?

586
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,737
You said they were the best,
but they're so dry.

587
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,741
Didn't I say I wouldn't buy from you
if you lied again?

588
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,829
How dare they lie about this!

589
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,748
Whatever you say, I won't let her go.

590
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,797
I won't give up on her even if I die.

591
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,259
I'm going to do
whatever I want from now on.

592
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,095
Why are they so quiet?

593
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,475
Did Yeong-ok kill him or something?

594
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,939
Did you hear everything?

595
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,983
You could hear from here, right?

596
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,818
Not everything,

597
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,487
but I heard most of it.

598
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,866
Jun-young may look like a top star,

599
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,618
but his mom never cooked him

600
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,121
a warm meal whenever he came by.
He's a poor guy.

601
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,208
All he gets is an earful
of curses from her.

602
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,544
But...

603
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,548
Why aren't they getting along well?

604
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:13,841
Don't even go there.

605
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,427
She expected him to become a prosecutor,

606
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,220
but he quit school to become a celebrity.

607
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,930
His mom lost her mind...

608
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,226
Get the details from Jun-young.

609
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,689
What does your father do?

610
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,829
My mom's a single mother.

611
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,710
She had me when she was 22.

612
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,632
My father...

613
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,220
wasn't in the picture from the start.

614
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:04,975
When I was in high school,

615
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:10,022
she worked at a bar to pay for a tutor.

616
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,319
Then she got caught
trying to bribe my teacher.

617
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,740
I couldn't stand going to school
after that.

618
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:25,287
As if peeling fruits at a hostess bar
was something to show off about...

619
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:30,209
At a picnic in middle school,
she gave the teachers

620
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:36,006
boxes full of apples cut into
all sorts of shapes.

621
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:42,596
That wounded her adolescent son
more than anything.

622
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,647
She also stole something
when I was in second grade.

623
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,778
It's because I said
I wanted to eat tangsuyuk.

624
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,534
We couldn't even afford to buy rice.

625
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,709
Do you still think

626
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,756
I'm out of your league?

627
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,098
Thanks for helping me relieve
my upset stomach.

628
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,100
Bye.

629
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,205
Go home.

630
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,582
You just got back from a business trip.

631
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,043
What if you collapse, too?

632
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,420
I'll stay here.

633
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,796
I will stay

634
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,590
beside your mother.

635
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,677
Ha-ru will be afraid all alone.

636
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,057
Go home.

637
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,517
Dad.

638
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,938
Hyeon-u, do you want some noodles?

639
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,334
DAD

640
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:02,796
Hello?

641
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,298
I'm sorry, Ji-tae.

642
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,383
About what?

643
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,634
About everything.

644
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,471
I'll be good to you.

645
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,932
I promise.

646
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,018
You're doing fine as it is.

647
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:22,107
Please tell Jeong-eun that I thank her.

648
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:24,610
I owe her a lot.

649
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:27,946
Okay.

650
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,115
I'll tell her.

651
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,951
Good. Sleep well.

652
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,453
You too.

653
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,637
EMPTY

654
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,105
I only ordered two acorn jelly noodles.

655
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:05,108
I know. The rest of this is on the house.

656
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,070
-Why?
-I heard you went from

657
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,530
a national gold digger to Ms. Shield.

658
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,534
Your parents didn't raise you
so you could take bullets for someone.

659
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,245
-That's--
-I'm sure you must have

660
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,247
fallen for him at one point.

661
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,417
Instead, those two stars just used you.

662
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,504
Now eat up.

663
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:30,008
When you feel empty after being dumped,
it's best to fill your belly.

664
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:35,305
Since you set it all out for me,

665
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,183
-I might as well eat.
-Go on.

666
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,310
Tell me.

667
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:44,064
Were you dumped only
by Hyeon-u and Jun-young recently?

668
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:45,649
Was there anyone else?

669
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,193
You see, when it rains, it pours.

670
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,696
I know.

671
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,449
You should lower your standards.

672
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,744
Who are you meeting today?

673
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,663
-Hyeon-u.
-Who?

674
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,165
The Hyeon-u I know?

675
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,333
Yes.

676
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,131
Hey.

677
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:13,552
Most people only get crappy cars
after a luxury car drives away.

678
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,971
But for you, a luxury car drove away,

679
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,639
yet a Sedan still comes for you.

680
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,310
You ordered two noodles, right?

681
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:23,603
Yes.

682
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:50,505
MS. NO

683
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,474
MS. NO

684
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:04,311
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave...

685
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,206
Where were you all day?

686
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,834
I brought gobchang, your favorite.

687
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:33,799
Guk-yeong, kneel.

688
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,386
-Just me?
-I'm too old to kneel.

689
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:42,724
The idea for the Jun-young and Yu-na fraud
came out of your head.

690
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,768
-Sir.
-I'm sorry, Jun-young.

691
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,562
I should've run it by you first,
but just know that

692
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,607
I made a hard decision
that would help you in the long run.

693
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,568
If I did it with
the tiniest bit of selfishness,

694
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,654
you can scald Guk-yeong's fingers.

695
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:59,115
Sir, why mine? I didn't do anything.

696
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,325
You did well.

697
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,335
Did he just say I did well?

698
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:12,128
Yes.

699
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,380
Why?

700
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,632
I think he's gone crazy.

701
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,508
My goodness.

702
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:01,469
Look at the state of the noodles.
What a waste.

703
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,639
Where's Hyeon-u? It's been over an hour.

704
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,726
He said he'd come.

705
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,814
-But he hasn't.
-I think this means he won't come.

706
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,318
Oh, my. I think you
just got rejected again.

707
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,363
Wait here.

708
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,662
I was going to ask him to hold me back.

709
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:28,914
What?

710
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,958
I don't care now. It's all his fault.

711
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,376
What do you mean?

712
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:42,594
Right.

713
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,680
No one would be in their right mind
in this situation.

714
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,285
8 MISSED CALLS
MS. NO

715
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:44,572
Hello?

716
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:50,954
No Eul?

717
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,999
I didn't hear that. What did you say?

718
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,543
No, don't say it.

719
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,921
I'll come right over. Say it to my face.

720
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,043
You were sorely mistaken.

721
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,588
If you thought

722
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,593
I would get discouraged,
give up, or step aside

723
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,806
over something like this,

724
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,482
then you were wrong.

725
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,103
Come at me with all you have.

726
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,106
I will never lose hope,

727
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,442
be sad,

728
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,111
or succumb.

729
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,524
I guess we really do look great together.

730
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,108
Why don't we date for real?

731
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,903
Maybe the person who was really used
in this situation was Ms. Kim Yu-na.

732
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:53,863
Come on, people might notice.

733
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,699
Notice what? The fact
that you actually like me, too?

734
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,535
Why are you mentioning her again?

735
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,578
Because I feel bad.

736
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,372
She was carrying Hyeon-jun's child.

737
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,373
Hyeon-gil!

738
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:06,334
The Minister of Culture and Sports
is giving you an award today.

739
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,919
Will Sin Jun-young be there?

740
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,337
Are you his fan, too?

741
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,131
I heard Congressman Choi Hyeon-jun
is coming too. Isn't that right?

742
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,642
It's the anniversary
of your father's death, idiot.

743
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,395
Just make some time
to say your prayers, okay?
