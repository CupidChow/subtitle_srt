00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,267
CHOI JI-TAE

2
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,357
-Hello?
-Are you off to see Jeong-eun?

3
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,322
-Yes.
-You ignored my warning,

4
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:32,782
so I told her everything.

5
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,784
I told her that

6
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,412
you approached her for a personal reason.

7
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,582
I told her that you don't like her

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,043
and that you're using her
to get back at your father

9
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,920
for abandoning you and your mother.

10
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,757
Aren't you grateful?

11
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:53,052
Had I left you alone,
you could have become a total scumbag.

12
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:54,846
You're right.

13
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,599
You're the only one who looks out for me.

14
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,101
I owe you a drink.

15
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,190
Are you eating your meals?

16
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,157
Don't skip meals

17
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,994
or your medicine.

18
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,414
Take care of yourself.

19
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,071
SIN JUN-YOUNG

20
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,204
I plan to get
Jeong-eun's confession today.

21
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,541
The hit-and-run case
where the witness, evidence,

22
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,959
and perpetrator were all manipulated.

23
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,880
Jeong-eun is the person
who killed Eul's father.

24
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,552
I will make her admit it herself.

25
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,598
There's a 90 percent chance
that I'll fail because of you.

26
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,559
If I fail,

27
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,563
you better keep your word.

28
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,439
Leave the revenge to me.

29
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:33,611
Whether it's yours or Eul's,
I'll be the one to do it.

30
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,489
So just die in peace.

31
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,660
I'll trust you and die pitifully
and beautifully

32
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,621
like you told me to.

33
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,457
So if I fail,

34
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,420
make sure you keep your promise.

35
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,006
Why are you telling me this?

36
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:59,137
What if I tell Jeong-eun
and ruin your plan?

37
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,307
If she confesses, it'll ruin my parents.

38
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,976
Why risk telling me this?

39
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,564
You're the only one I could think of.

40
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:16,821
I was so exhausted and lonely
that I wanted to tell someone.

41
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,866
You're the only one I could tell.

42
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,577
I've thought about it for a long time,

43
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,370
and you're the only person
that came to mind.

44
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,832
If you want to ruin my plan, do it.
I won't blame you.

45
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:33,212
I'll just think I lived in a crappy world
with no hope at all.

46
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,549
I'll consider myself lucky to be able to
leave a world like this quickly.

47
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,219
It would help me

48
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,513
die without any regrets.

49
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,597
So tell me it's not true.

50
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,933
Tell me that Ji-tae is lying.

51
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,268
We didn't meet by chance.

52
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,771
I approached you

53
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,440
with a purpose.

54
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,566
It was all planned.

55
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,444
I wanted to get back at my father
who abandoned me.

56
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,620
Let's do this together.

57
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:53,459
I think you and I may share
the same destination.

58
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,752
Let's do it together.

59
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:19,986
SECURITY SYSTEM ON

60
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,744
Hello, this is Sin Jun-young.

61
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,746
Yes.

62
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,418
I was hoping you could send
Ms. No to film me this evening.

63
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,099
I wanted to become a prosecutor
like my father.

64
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,018
So I wanted to visit my father one day

65
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,064
and tell him that I grew up well
even without him.

66
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,067
I wanted to receive his compliment.

67
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,152
But one day,

68
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,363
I found out about my father's true colors.

69
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,575
My father,
whom I respected more than anyone,

70
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,247
was a cruel, evil, and scary man
who'd do anything

71
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,750
to get his hands

72
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,795
on whatever he wanted.

73
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,881
He covered up a hit-and-run case

74
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,466
because a powerful man asked him to do it.

75
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,927
He destroyed the CCTV footage,

76
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,054
appeased the witness,

77
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,974
and made a different driver
make a false confession.

78
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,396
He also relegated a colleague
who wanted to reveal the truth.

79
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,115
That man who died
from the hit-and-run accident

80
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,994
was my girlfriend's father.

81
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,414
And I interfered

82
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,502
when she wanted to reveal the truth
about her father's death.

83
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,048
She had evidence
that could destroy my father.

84
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,552
I snatched her bag
as she headed to the TV station.

85
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,932
He was still my father,

86
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,685
and I tried to protect him.

87
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,736
So I killed my girlfriend.

88
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:15,661
I...

89
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,332
I killed her.

90
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,338
Isn't that scary?

91
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,051
It's a beautiful story.

92
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,095
I envy Mr. Choi.

93
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,266
He has such a loyal son
who loves him this much.

94
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,192
I said I killed someone.

95
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,944
People die anyway.

96
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,031
Numerous people are dying
even right now as we're talking

97
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,785
because of accidents, diseases
or of other causes.

98
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,917
Don't feel too guilty. Let it go.

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,963
People die in due time
even if you had no part in it.

100
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,390
Is this how you rationalized yourself

101
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,725
after you killed a man?

102
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,729
What do you mean?

103
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,982
December 5th, 2006.

104
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,900
At 1:50 a.m.

105
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,613
You hit a man who was
pulling a cart across the road.

106
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,282
Then you fled.

107
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,117
Your car model

108
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,952
was ZEF 320.

109
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,996
The color of your car was red.

110
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,416
Your license plate number
was Seoul-3G-3126.

111
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,127
What are you talking about?

112
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,461
You should know very well.

113
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,507
I should go. My father
will be looking for me.

114
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,883
Let's film some other day.

115
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,971
You were the driver of that sports car.

116
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,354
Is this some kind of fiction plot
you made up?

117
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,647
Is it really fiction?

118
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,484
It's so ridiculous and childish
that I can't stand to listen to it.

119
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,446
Then leave.

120
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,032
I planned to get a confession,

121
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,618
but the evidence I have is enough.

122
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,579
You should go.

123
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,205
Drive safely.

124
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,334
What is all this nonsense?

125
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,171
"I fled because I was scared.

126
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,839
I wasn't in my right mind.

127
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,258
I suffered from guilt all this time.

128
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,179
I suffered as much as the victim did."

129
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,058
I thought you'd be human enough
to say that.

130
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,436
The statute hasn't expired yet.

131
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,148
Let's drink the leftover wine
after you do your time in prison.

132
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,692
Oh, wait.

133
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,111
I might not be available then.

134
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,531
You're messing with the wrong person here.

135
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,909
My father is Yoon Seong-ho.

136
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:04,580
I don't know what evidence you have,
but you can't get me.

137
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,875
Do you think what happened then
won't happen again?

138
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,711
My father is much more powerful now
than he was back then

139
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,714
and there are many more prosecutors
like your father.

140
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,596
Were you testing me?

141
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,849
You don't have any evidence, do you?

142
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,602
You're right.

143
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,813
I don't.

144
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,857
You got rid of everything ten years ago.

145
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,319
But now I have something.

146
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,239
You just confessed.

147
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,076
Eul.

148
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,286
You're watching, right?

149
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,585
This is the truth you wanted so badly.

150
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,213
The woman standing in front of me

151
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,674
killed your father.

152
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,717
And

153
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,554
the jerk who took your USB

154
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,307
and almost killed you

155
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,978
is me.

156
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,817
I wanted to tell you this before I die.

157
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,572
This is

158
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,911
the first item on my bucket list,

159
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,834
and the last one.

160
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,228
Did you two stage everything to fool me?

161
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,234
Where's the camera?

162
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,279
Do you have it?

163
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,615
Do you have the camera?

164
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,244
You don't have to scream
and incriminate yourself.

165
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,749
Things are already going
to be bad for you at court, Ms. Yoon.

166
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,092
-Hello?
-Jun-young. Run.

167
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,510
Get out of there.

168
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,679
Why should he run?

169
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,889
Don't you trust him?

170
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,600
Of course I trust him, but...

171
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,770
Jun-young, then stay right where you are.

172
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,897
If the detectives come, go with them.

173
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,941
We'll be right there.

174
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,652
Don't say a word
until your lawyer gets there, okay?

175
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,153
What are you talking about?

176
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,792
You're under arrest for illegal drug use.

177
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,879
You have the right to a lawyer

178
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,672
and the right to remain silent.

179
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,966
You can refuse to give any statements.

180
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,135
What did you say I did?

181
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,805
We'll take samples
to test for illegal substances.

182
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,098
Please come with us.

183
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,678
What?

184
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:30,971
About Sin Jun-young's rumor...

185
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,058
It wasn't your mother's doing.
It was your father's.

186
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,310
Is that...

187
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,063
possible?

188
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,857
The tests will come up negative.

189
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,276
That's the extent of your father's power.

190
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,489
He can make anything false become true.

191
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,327
But how...

192
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,080
Sin Jun-young

193
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,667
is his own son.

194
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,921
Do we have any soju?

195
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,716
Sin Jun-young's arrest...

196
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,343
Was it you?

197
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,136
I'd like some kimchi stew

198
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,681
over drinks with you.

199
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,724
Honey.

200
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,993
Sin Jun-young...

201
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,079
I abandoned him long ago.

202
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,126
My brother met with Yeong-ok

203
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,671
and told her
she wasn't good enough for me.

204
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,464
He threatened her and sent her away.

205
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,925
Honey.

206
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:53,303
-That was--
-I asked him to do it.

207
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,681
It was my idea.

208
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,185
I sent her away.

209
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,023
I knew she was pregnant with my child.

210
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,277
But I wanted to come to you.

211
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,322
Honey.

212
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,950
I fought so hard to get here.

213
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,328
I can't lose it all for someone like him.

214
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,960
Many more shocking things will happen.

215
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,671
I hope you're prepared for it.

216
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:56,366
YOON JEONG-EUN

217
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,544
Help me, Ji-tae. What should I do?

218
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,297
I'm scared.

219
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,467
Jun-young and Eul set me up.

220
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,220
Help--

221
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,394
We have witnesses. Stop denying it.

222
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,111
The model Ha Su-hui, actor Park Si-gyun,

223
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,948
and singer Cho Yun admitted
to doing drugs with you.

224
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,784
Your supplier, Yoon Il-ju,
said he sold you

225
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,536
the drugs at a club in Itaewon

226
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,540
eight times since last year.

227
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,047
He has a notebook
that lists your name and dates--

228
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,467
Jun-young.

229
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,804
-Jun-young.
-What are you doing?

230
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,765
I'm laughing.

231
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,017
Why are you laughing?

232
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,312
I'm laughing because this is so funny.

233
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,898
Don't you find this funny? Is it just me?

234
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,860
What are you doing? Give that back.

235
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,238
Clearly, someone just wrote down
what they were told.

236
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,532
The spelling is atrocious.

237
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:23,996
This person even misspelled "committed."

238
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,748
This reaction

239
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,210
won't do you any good.

240
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,754
I'm really curious.

241
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,965
Is this some kind of prank?

242
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,592
WE'LL BE CLOSING FOR A WHILE

243
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,302
Hey.

244
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,972
We aren't closing.

245
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:45,184
Can I take the loss from your pay?

246
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,352
It's just that...

247
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,317
Let's close for the day
once those people leave.

248
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:57,946
Everyone who came in talked
about Jun-young and how he did drugs.

249
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,531
I can't take it anymore.

250
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,326
That's all they're talking about.

251
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,245
That's my point.

252
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,496
Put this up.

253
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,582
They're just mistaken.

254
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:12,127
"You're wrong.
Jun-young wouldn't do drugs."

255
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,962
That's all you have to say.

256
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,049
You have a mouth for a reason.

257
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,263
That's my point.

258
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,557
Tear that up.

259
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,184
Yeong-ok.

260
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,821
Could I have your attention, please?

261
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:48,205
Did any of you here read
about Sin Jun-young

262
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,667
doing drugs and things?

263
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,585
-Yeong-ok.
-Ms. Sin.

264
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,630
It's okay. Please raise your hand.

265
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:00,634
If you tell the truth,
I'll give you some dumplings.

266
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,604
I see. You all read about it.

267
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,901
Which of you believe
those rumors are true?

268
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,945
What are you doing?

269
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,364
It's okay. Please raise your hand.

270
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,992
If you tell the truth,

271
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,369
I'll give you bossam as well.

272
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,788
Yong-deuk.

273
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,467
Okay.

274
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,012
I'm sure most of you know

275
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,805
that I am

276
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,558
Jun-young's mother.

277
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,897
If those rumors were true,
would I be here selling yukgaejang?

278
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,274
I'm not crazy.

279
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,737
Goodness. My son is innocent.

280
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,656
The rumors are absolutely wrong.

281
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,117
If you hear anyone talk about Jun-young,

282
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,038
tell that person
that the rumors are all false.

283
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,790
Tell them that for me, okay?

284
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,126
Will you do that?

285
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,921
-Thank you.
-Bye.

286
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,094
I haven't seen you in a while, Eul.

287
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,025
My goodness. Put that down.

288
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,069
What are you doing?

289
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,613
You can't drink someone's leftovers.

290
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,115
You're going to throw it out anyway.

291
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,703
Consider me a trash can.
Throw this away to me.

292
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,748
I don't get it.

293
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,502
I thought you'd change,
but you still act so indecently.

294
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,545
Sit at a clean table and order new food.

295
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,260
Is something wrong?

296
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,057
Okay, I'll leave you alone.

297
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,852
Hey, have you heard?

298
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:20,524
The news about Sin Jun-young.
It's so shocking.

299
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,444
Do me a favor.

300
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,074
Don't mention that name
in front of me today.

301
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,325
Okay.

302
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,663
Sin...

303
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,374
Since when have you worn those shoes?
They're pretty.

304
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,001
I wasn't talking about Sin Jun-young,
I was talking about your shoes.

305
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,045
You're really not going to order anything?

306
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,553
My goodness. Will you stop reading that?

307
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:53,056
Jun-young would never do drugs.

308
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,474
How would you know?

309
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,560
His career is over now.

310
00:23:56,643 --> 00:24:00,272
What do you know about our dear Jun-young?

311
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,566
Your "dear Jun-young"?

312
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,276
You're being ridiculous.

313
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,360
Excuse me.

314
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,905
You're not the only people here.

315
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,949
Could you keep it down?

316
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,993
-What's up with her?
-She must be a lunatic.

317
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,494
Yes, I'm a lunatic.

318
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,122
So shut your mouth and drink.

319
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,499
Eul.

320
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:22,127
No one can drink through closed lips.

321
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,463
Ladies.

322
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,217
She's in a really bad mood.
Just ignore her.

323
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,511
You can speak all you want.

324
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,431
Where else would you go to chat?

325
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,350
Hey, look. There's another article on him.

326
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,686
-Let's see.
-What does it say?

327
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,983
Can't you complete a sentence
without mentioning him?

328
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,361
Politics, economy, and culture.

329
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:52,240
There are so many important issues
other than Sin Jun-young.

330
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,618
He's the only thing my customers

331
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,370
talked about today. So what?

332
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,623
He's the hottest topic right now.

333
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,374
If you can't stand it, get out.

334
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,802
I texted him.

335
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,804
He asked me to do so
if you ever came over.

336
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,768
I think it's her time of the month.

337
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,146
You should stay
at least 500m away from her.

338
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,860
Let's talk.

339
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,908
You must be really dumbfounded.

340
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:39,371
The man you love so much
is Choi Hyeon-jun's son.

341
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,457
I'm sorry.

342
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,377
Me deceiving you

343
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,797
was crazy enough.

344
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,968
I was the only one in the dark.

345
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,806
It must have been fun for you all.

346
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,226
You deceived me and toyed with me.

347
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,355
I bet you enjoyed it.

348
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,773
I didn't.

349
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:10,694
Jun-young suffered as much as you did.

350
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,946
Maybe even more.

351
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,072
Forget it.

352
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:18,118
I have no time to listen
to your hypocritical excuses.

353
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,330
Jun-young got arrested for using drugs.

354
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,007
The test will come back positive.

355
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,009
My father will see to that.

356
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,428
Jun-young stabbed his father in the back

357
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,806
to find out who really killed your father.

358
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,059
This is the payback he gets

359
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,479
from his own father...

360
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:50,984
And mine.

361
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,445
So what?

362
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,492
-Eul.
-What does that have to do with me?

363
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,578
What do you want me to do?

364
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,205
He should have

365
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,961
just turned a blind eye like me.

366
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:13,298
He should have ignored it and moved on.

367
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,842
That's what everyone else does.

368
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,510
But he did that for a woman,

369
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,389
for conscience and for guilt!

370
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,935
He doesn't even have that long to live.

371
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,105
Why throw away
the rest of his life like that?

372
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,443
How is a coward like me

373
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,988
supposed to deal with that?

374
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,869
Hate me for the rest of your life,
but Jun-young...

375
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:46,915
Help Jun-young.

376
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,423
Please, Eul.

377
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,427
No.

378
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,283
Eul.

379
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,456
Jik is upstairs.

380
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,043
What's wrong?

381
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,295
Are you sick?

382
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,006
No.

383
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,596
I told Jik everything.

384
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,314
The story behind your dad's death.

385
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,401
Well,

386
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,362
something happened,
and I just had to tell him.

387
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,157
I had no choice.

388
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,916
I'll come back in after a while.

389
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,962
Text me once your fight is over.

390
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,427
Why didn't you tell me?

391
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,555
Why didn't you tell me
that Choi Hyeon-jun covered up

392
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,223
our dad's accident?

393
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,143
And his wife threatened to kill me.

394
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,269
Why didn't you tell me that?

395
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,898
Why didn't you say
that was why you wanted to leave?

396
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,358
Why did you hide all that from me?

397
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,532
-To save you the pain.
-You still should've told me.

398
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,494
You made me look like an idiot.

399
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,330
That's what I am and one idiot is enough.

400
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,582
-Eul!
-How could I have told you?

401
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,210
It would've ended your life, too.

402
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,420
Every day is full of pain.

403
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,339
Every hour is torture.

404
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,510
My smiles are not real,
and I can barely breathe.

405
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,261
-Eul.
-And if I forget things

406
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,387
and become happy for a while,

407
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,766
I think about how our dad died and wonder

408
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,768
if I deserve to be so happy.

409
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,311
Do I deserve to smile?

410
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,355
Do I deserve to eat something this tasty?

411
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,899
Do I deserve to sleep in comfort?

412
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:21,236
My whole life is filled
with guilt and pain!

413
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,949
-Eul.
-I couldn't put you through that!

414
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,162
Okay, that's enough. I'm sorry.

415
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,498
I'm sorry.

416
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,127
So don't tell me to forgive him.

417
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,631
Don't say that.

418
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,944
What did you just say?

419
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,573
I...

420
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,033
I like men.

421
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,368
Men?

422
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,329
Who's that?

423
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,331
What kind of a name is "Men"?

424
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,001
Bring her over. Is she prettier than me?

425
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,295
Is she cuter? Is she richer?

426
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,423
Men.

427
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,634
The opposite of women.

428
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,851
Do you mean

429
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,104
instead of girls,

430
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,231
you like boys?

431
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,653
You can't be...

432
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,366
Is this a joke?

433
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,453
It's not.

434
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,416
That's why I couldn't touch you.

435
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,461
That's why Na-ri was against us dating.

436
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,046
My gosh.

437
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,302
-No way.
-Sorry for not telling you sooner.

438
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,776
We should stop seeing each other.

439
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,823
I'm really sorry.

440
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,833
It's fine.

441
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,002
Don't get up.

442
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,760
-I'm sorry.
-Don't say you're sorry.

443
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,722
-I apologize.
-Don't apologize.

444
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,894
-Bye.
-Don't say bye!

445
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,529
NO JIK

446
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,613
DELETE NUMBER

447
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,616
I deleted your number.

448
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:19,497
I might have lingering feelings
and call you like some mad woman.

449
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,126
Delete my number, too.

450
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,628
All right.

451
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,593
HA-RU

452
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,803
DELETE NUMBER

453
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,852
-Excuse me.
-Ha-ru.

454
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,148
Don't touch me.

455
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,992
Gwang-su.

456
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,785
It's Ha-ru.

457
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,621
Let's go on a date.

458
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,791
Buy me something nice.

459
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,885
Let's eat, get drunk,
watch a movie and go clubbing.

460
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,346
Okay.

461
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,683
I'll see you there.

462
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,614
Is she still asleep?

463
00:35:58,698 --> 00:35:59,740
Yes.

464
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,203
How can someone sleep for 15 hours?

465
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,373
She's not dead, is she?

466
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,626
I checked a while ago. She's breathing.

467
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,592
Did you end it with Ha-ru?

468
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:20,636
Yes.

469
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,473
I can't believe she let you go
so easily like that.

470
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,808
Have you eaten?

471
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:26,976
No.

472
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,647
Let her sleep a while longer.

473
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,692
We should eat. I'm hungry.

474
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,818
Okay.

475
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,324
She'll wake up
when she's had enough sleep.

476
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,077
Let's go.

477
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,439
Congratulations.

478
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,191
I love you, Eul.

479
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:18,861
You're so cute.

480
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,323
I just can't study because of you.

481
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,367
I'm his girlfriend.

482
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,496
Honey, are your classes over?

483
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,436
Yes, you're my type.

484
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,397
Happy now?

485
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,440
And yes.

486
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,734
I like you.

487
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,736
Are you happy now?

488
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,697
It's not like that.

489
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,115
Just listen to what I say.

490
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,702
Don't listen to anyone else. Please.

491
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,623
Please just listen to me.

492
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,795
I love you, Eul.

493
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,174
I love you, Eul.

494
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,597
Jik kept telling me to be careful.

495
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,186
I guess I'm the crazy one here!
I'm the crazy one!

496
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,984
My gosh, I should've listened to Jik.

497
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,691
What's gotten into you?

498
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,694
I told you to add
the other sauce, not this one!

499
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,990
I confused the two. Sorry.

500
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,826
Jeong-sik.

501
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,328
What?

502
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,706
-I'm crazy, aren't I?
-What?

503
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,002
My son

504
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,213
is at a police station,

505
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,341
and I'm just yelling at you

506
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,259
for adding the wrong fish sauce.

507
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,180
I'm not in my right mind.

508
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,767
To be honest,

509
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,936
you aren't sane.

510
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,729
Ever since yesterday,

511
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:02,024
you've been acting like a total lunatic.

512
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,818
Jeong-sik.

513
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,449
I want to see Jun-young.

514
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:13,953
Let me see.

515
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,748
All right. You're back to normal.

516
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,583
Yeong-ok.

517
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,877
I'll get the car.

518
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,314
Wait.

519
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,193
Are those photographers here
for Jun-young?

520
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,779
I think so.

521
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,993
My goodness.

522
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,620
Why would Jun-young need
to be investigated?

523
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,708
I'm here to take care
of some personal issues.

524
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,169
Jun-young isn't in there.

525
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,796
The rumors about him,
they're true, aren't they?

526
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,591
Did he really take drugs?

527
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:09,842
Drugs?

528
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,470
He's never even been near drugs.

529
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,931
Do you want to end up getting sued
for defamation?

530
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,352
Gosh, where did I leave my phone?

531
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,562
Just a moment.

532
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:22,813
Excuse me.

533
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,486
If you even so much
as write one line about this,

534
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:29,987
you and I

535
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,908
will end up in there
as the accuser and the accused.

536
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,451
So watch out.

537
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,787
Why are you here
when the press all gathered?

538
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,081
We didn't think they'd be here.

539
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,959
-We came to see Jun-young.
-Don't look at me.

540
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,878
Act like you're here for something else.

541
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:49,381
If the reporters find out who you are,
things will get really bad.

542
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,554
How is Jun-young?

543
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,306
Is he doing okay?

544
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,518
We just saw him. He's fine.

545
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:05,397
He told me to tell you that
there's nothing to worry about.

546
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,982
I'm sure it's nothing.

547
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,610
He'll be fine.

548
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:13,614
They won't accept any more visitors today.

549
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,407
-Really?
-Don't look at me.

550
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,886
You're going through a lot.

551
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,934
I owe your wife for this.

552
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,937
What you're going through

553
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,565
has nothing to do with my wife.

554
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,568
I gave the order.

555
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,115
Once you get out, you should retire

556
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,243
and move abroad with your mother.

557
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:06,250
I will see to it that you get to live
a comfortable life.

558
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,502
I'll give you plenty of--

559
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,504
I have more than enough money.

560
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,215
That's good to hear.

561
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,510
Anyway, as soon as--

562
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,512
What happens if I refuse to leave?

563
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,849
Will I be convicted of drug use?

564
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,563
We shouldn't let it go that far.

565
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,650
I'm sure you'll make the right decision.

566
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,949
You really have a lot of power.

567
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,746
Ten years ago and even now.

568
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:45,914
I know.

569
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,501
I did all sorts of things

570
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,839
to get to where I am now.

571
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,638
Did you abandon my mother

572
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,226
so you could gain all that power?

573
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,399
She wasn't the one to leave, was she?

574
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,949
I'll take that as a yes.

575
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,713
If you promise

576
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,259
to leave Korea quietly,

577
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,929
I will drop the drug charges.

578
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,430
Detective!

579
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,811
We're done.

580
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:50,979
Sin Jun-young.

581
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,236
Father.

582
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:09,164
This will be
the last time I call you that.

583
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,335
Also,

584
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,465
the fact that I'm your son...

585
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,305
I will consider it a disgraceful,

586
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,976
embarrassing,

587
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,106
and shameful thing until the day I die.

588
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,840
52 MISSED CALLS

589
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:08,724
RECENT CALLS

590
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,937
This is the truth you wanted so badly.

591
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,814
The woman standing in front of me

592
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,610
killed your father.

593
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,948
And the jerk who took your USB

594
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,702
and almost killed you

595
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:32,664
is me.

596
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,295
I wanted to tell you this before I die.

597
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,925
This is

598
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,306
the first item on my bucket list,

599
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,312
and the last one.

600
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,953
It's Yoon Jeong-eun.

601
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,022
Welcome. Was the traffic bad?

602
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,524
There's no one here.

603
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:43,193
There aren't any customers or staff.

604
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,281
I wanted to talk to you in private.

605
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,116
I'm sure you did.

606
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,243
Would you like some coffee?

607
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,713
I'm innocent.

608
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:08,093
I fell into the trap Jun-young set
and blurted out some nonsense.

609
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,306
You didn't believe
everything you heard, did you?

610
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,977
I'm not the driver who hit your father--

611
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,186
I remember

612
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,190
the face of the driver who hit him.

613
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,244
Shit.

614
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:42,836
Dad!

615
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,384
Hey!

616
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,012
Stop!

617
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,139
I saw it all.

618
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,269
Why didn't I recognize you right away?

619
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:06,902
Did you enjoy your life
of comfort and luxury?

620
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,166
Just so you don't misunderstand,

621
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,795
this doesn't mean I'm admitting anything.

622
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,215
I just pity you for what you went through

623
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,926
and I want to console you.

624
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,938
I'm going to air it on TV.

625
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,190
The whole thing, without any editing.

626
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:49,528
I'll also hand this
over to the police as evidence

627
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,113
of what you did.

628
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,534
You think you can do that?

629
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,453
You're just a freelance producer.

630
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,913
I'll make it happen.

631
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,582
I'm just a freelance producer,

632
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,128
but power doesn't win all the time.

633
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:10,549
That will hurt Jun-young, too.
The man you love so dearly.

634
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,801
If he committed a crime, he must pay.

635
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,262
That goes for everyone.

636
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,847
No Eul.

637
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,228
I didn't get to taste
the coffee you prepared for me.

638
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,648
You can...

639
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,529
You can drink it all yourself.

640
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,866
Hey!

641
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,369
Stop right there.

642
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,204
I said stop!

643
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,207
Stop!

644
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,596
Honey.

645
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,099
Why are you so deep in thought?

646
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,977
Oh, it's nothing.

647
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,187
Drink your medicine.

648
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,521
Thank you.

649
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,398
Ji-tae.

650
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,530
Tell me what to do.

651
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,449
What are you talking about?

652
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,284
However hard I think about this,

653
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,621
there's nothing I can do to stop you two.

654
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:28,084
You two have become monsters
I can't deal with.

655
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,461
Ji-tae.

656
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,630
Please, think carefully.

657
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,007
Is there really no way

658
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,676
to stop you?

659
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,388
Your father is tired.
Stop talking such nonsense.

660
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,098
-Dad.
-Yes.

661
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,269
I'm sorry to say there is no way.

662
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,531
Gyu-cheol.

663
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,285
Gather the press.

664
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:06,540
Say I'll tell them a story
about my parents

665
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:10,669
that will shock everyone who hears it.

666
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,379
Ji-tae.

667
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,507
What about this?

668
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:18,969
Maybe this might stop you.

669
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,595
Have you lost your mind?

670
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,764
Root for me, Dad.

671
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,934
I'd like to win this fight.

672
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,524
It was revealed that the Hallyu star
Sin Jun-young is terminally ill

673
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,734
and that he has a limited time to live.

674
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,152
This is exclusive news from KBC.

675
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:39,781
Sin Jun-young visited the hospital
due to constant headaches

676
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,325
and was diagnosed with a brainstem glioma.

677
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,411
He kept it from his friends and family--

678
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,996
-Did you enjoy your meal?
-Yes.

679
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,082
Everyone is shocked to hear
that he suffered alone.

680
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,959
His good looks--

681
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,794
It's 81,500 won.

682
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,838
That can't be right.

683
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,757
The popular Hallyu star Sin Jun-young is--

684
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:01,094
You had yukgaejang jeongol, bossam,

685
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:03,763
dumplings and three bottles of soju.

686
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,141
You forgot about
the dumplings, didn't you?

687
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,226
Thank you.

688
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,770
We do not know if he will be able
to fight the illness.

689
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,025
Just a moment.

690
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,234
Hello?

691
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:20,238
I saw the article too, and
we're trying to check if it's true. Bye.

692
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,532
I'll call you back in 30 minutes.

693
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,621
Come on, answer the phones!

694
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,503
WB ENTERTAINMENT

695
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:38,506
Hello?

696
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,676
We're not planning to have
a press conference just yet.

697
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,554
I wasn't able to talk to him, either.

698
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,222
Wait.

699
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,184
Is Jun-young

700
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,354
really dying?

701
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,486
SIN JUN-YOUNG HAS A LIMITED TIME TO LIVE

702
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,780
SIN JUN-YOUNG REFUSES TO RECEIVE TREATMENT

703
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,241
SIN JUN-YOUNG IS TERMINALLY ILL

704
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:10,205
IT HAS BEEN REVEALED THAT HALLYU STAR
SIN JUN-YOUNG IS TERMINALLY ILL.

705
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,506
Did you see this?

706
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,633
Is Sin Jun-young really dying?

707
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,218
Man...

708
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,804
Do you think the drugs are killing him?

709
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,597
It's not the drugs.

710
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:30,642
He has something in his brain.

711
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:31,726
In his brain?

712
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,855
It must hurt to die so young
when he has everything.

713
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,190
Too bad.

714
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,402
What are you talking about?

715
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,377
THIS CAN'T BE TRUE

716
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,129
SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME
THAT THIS IS ALL A DREAM

717
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,131
PLEASE SAVE JUN-YOUNG

718
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:06,970
I'll be there in ten minutes.

719
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,222
Are the reporters there?

720
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,350
Okay, I'll be right there.

721
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,334
Well done, Eul.

722
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,507
Did you see the girl's face?

723
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,759
It was a complete success.

724
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,720
She really thought
that you were my girlfriend.

725
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,184
Why don't you try acting as a career?

726
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,938
Okay, I'll dock two.

727
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,361
I couldn't sleep because I had to study.

728
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,154
Give me ten minutes so I can take a nap.

729
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,618
I think I'll get an A for everything.

730
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,745
I'll treat you if I get a scholarship.

731
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,248
Jun-young.

732
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:01,501
I'm going to sleep now. Don't wake me.

733
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,588
Me. I'm the crazy girl.

734
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,092
What am I doing with a psycho like you?

735
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,845
You shouldn't have
committed a crime, then.

736
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,516
I think I did enough for the day.

737
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,934
I'm going home.

738
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,644
I couldn't sleep because I had to study.

739
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,187
Give me ten minutes so I can take a nap.

740
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,605
No way.

741
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,066
From the remaining nine times,
I'll take out two.

742
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,028
In that case, make it three.

743
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,656
Count this as three.

744
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:32,949
Okay.

745
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:39,414
I did well today, so make it four.

746
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,500
-Take out four today.
-Are you kidding me?

747
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:50,967
He may have

748
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:54,137
some delusional memories.

749
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:58,349
He'll temporarily
confuse the past and present.

750
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,769
Don't overreact, and just give him a hug.

751
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,617
After the long, tiresome

752
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,827
and painful period,

753
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,580
Jun-young returned

754
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,751
to the time he missed

755
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,545
and wished to return to the most.

756
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,037
But this is just nonsense.

757
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,081
He's only 28 years old.

758
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,500
I feel so sorry for my poor Jun-young.

759
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,795
I will do anything you tell me to.

760
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,965
So please save Jun-young.

761
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,716
It's a video of Yoon Jeong-eun confessing.

762
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,511
What's the real reason
why you gave me this USB?

763
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,012
What is this place?

764
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:19,681
It's the house I built for us.

765
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,766
Let's live here just for 500 years.

766
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:24,727
Build the world you believe in, Eul.

767
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,104
Where's my sister?

768
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,065
I'm so stupid.
