1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:12,637
SIN JUN-YOUNG

2
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,897
Talk to her one more time, Dad.

3
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,315
Okay.

4
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,401
What did he say?

5
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:31,281
She said she won't come
no matter how big the award is.

6
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,284
Did you tell her
how important this event is?

7
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,785
Gosh. Of course, I did.

8
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,705
I said ministers and congressmen
would be here

9
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,582
and that nothing must go wrong.

10
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,834
I even told her

11
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,128
that you might hang yourself
if she didn't attend.

12
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,964
I repeated myself more than enough.

13
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,510
How would you like a different mom?

14
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,970
I'll introduce you to mothers

15
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,556
who'd be thrilled to have you as a son.

16
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,435
Gosh...

17
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,354
Go and get me a sedative.

18
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,566
And tell my wife
to bring my blood pressure medicine.

19
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,278
Didn't you say
Ms. No wasn't going to be here?

20
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,864
Yes, Jun-young told me
to tell her not to come.

21
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,992
But I saw her outside with a camera.

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,913
Where is she?

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,056
Don't you remember me?

24
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,228
Do you know me?

25
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:45,897
She's a gold digger.

26
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:50,485
She tried to use Jun-young,
but her face got revealed,

27
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,153
so she failed
before she could do anything.

28
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,404
Ha-ru.

29
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,581
Did my daughter do this?

30
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,999
No.

31
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,752
It wasn't me. It was the kitten.

32
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,005
But it doesn't know any better.
It's just a kitten.

33
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,301
Today's the anniversary
of my father's death.

34
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,846
Oh, I'm sorry.

35
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,227
Here.

36
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,607
I'm sure the cat didn't mean to do that.

37
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,943
So don't be mad
and buy it again with this.

38
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,154
Why are you giving her 50,000 won?

39
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,364
-That costs less than 3,000 won.
-Ha-ru.

40
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,832
Here. Go on and take it.

41
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,792
You should apologize first.

42
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,154
Instead of giving her money,

43
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,073
you should apologize properly first.

44
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,459
I think

45
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,253
you should apologize to me first.

46
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,551
I don't know how you know this lady,

47
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,429
but you rudely interrupted us.

48
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,890
Don't you have any manners?

49
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,977
Is this how your parents taught you?

50
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,564
I only asked you to admit your mistake

51
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,776
and ask for forgiveness.

52
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,949
You want me to apologize
because of something

53
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,159
a stray cat did?

54
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,702
I asked you

55
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,789
to admit your mistake and ask for--

56
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,666
I was mistaken about you.

57
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,711
I had no idea you were so rude

58
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,964
and wasted my time waiting for you.

59
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,053
I had a strange feeling that one day

60
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,597
you would come for the book.

61
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,308
That's why I was never able to
throw it away.

62
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,729
I didn't know you'd change
into such a disappointing person.

63
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,695
I understand that society's
moral standards and hierarchy are falling,

64
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,446
but I'm still

65
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,865
old enough to be your father.

66
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,120
I don't know how important
a top star is in Korea,

67
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,582
but you should learn some manners
if you're going to be a star.

68
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,128
You can demand an apology after that.

69
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,256
Let's go, Ha-ru.

70
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,349
I told you not to come here.
You never listen.

71
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,566
What are you doing?

72
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,319
Don't pick that up!

73
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,571
-Then should I throw it away?
-Yes!

74
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,949
Gosh. I should've asked for more.

75
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,201
About a million won more.

76
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,377
Hey.

77
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,837
Why would you rip that?

78
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,340
Leave it.

79
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,551
I said leave it. Are you a beggar?

80
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,346
Yes, I am. Didn't you know?

81
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,575
Just mind your own business.

82
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:11,871
What?

83
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,671
Jun-young.

84
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,341
Why are you out here?
We were looking for you.

85
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,645
Wait for me.

86
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:49,992
Mr. Namgung says he'll

87
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,494
accept the award instead of your mom.

88
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,913
Everyone kept saying

89
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,375
that Jun-young's mother gave birth to him,

90
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,294
but I'm the one who made him a star.

91
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,338
I never said anything like that.

92
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,506
Me, neither.

93
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,425
I know. I wasn't talking about you two.

94
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,386
Who said that?

95
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,513
Right, it was the makeup team.

96
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,141
Ms. Jung, I'm ready for some makeup.

97
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,392
Give me your phone.

98
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:16,853
What for?

99
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,155
I said I won't go.
Why do you keep calling?

100
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,031
Do you have nothing else to do, Guk-yeong?

101
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,617
Hurry up. Move it.

102
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,749
I'm hanging up. Don't call me again.

103
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,002
What did I do wrong?

104
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,298
What did I do?

105
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,886
Is it so wrong that I became a celebrity

106
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,846
and not a prosecutor like you wanted?

107
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,641
You hated me for over five years

108
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,810
and disowned me, saying I wasn't your son.

109
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,396
Was what I did that serious?

110
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,612
I believe a prosecutor

111
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,407
should tell only the truth
in any situation,

112
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,784
punish the wrongdoers

113
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,996
and clear the names of the innocent.

114
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,083
But I'm not like that.

115
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,546
I told you dozens of times
that I don't qualify!

116
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,049
I'm not cut out for the job.

117
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,469
If a person like me becomes a prosecutor,

118
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,058
then powerless and poor people like you

119
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,770
can't survive in this country.

120
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,820
Why don't you qualify?

121
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,198
Why aren't you cut out for the job?

122
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:56,077
You tried to save a girl
from the school bullies

123
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,620
and got suspended once.

124
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,544
Is it because

125
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,172
I used to

126
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,299
work at bars

127
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,677
a long time ago?

128
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,932
Is it because I stole 300g of meat
when you were a kid?

129
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,104
Just...

130
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,482
Say I worked at the bar just
so I could make a living.

131
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,194
And say that I returned
all the meat later.

132
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,449
All right. You don't have to come.

133
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,580
I'll tell them you refused the award.

134
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,625
Why would you do that?

135
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,009
Why are you getting undressed?
We have to go soon.

136
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,013
-Jun-young.
-Jun-young.

137
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,924
Jun-young!

138
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,302
Where are you going?

139
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,803
Move.

140
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,597
You've lost your mind.

141
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,265
The ceremony starts in ten minutes.

142
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,600
I said I won't go.

143
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,145
This isn't like not showing up
for some TV program.

144
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,731
You know what kind of people
are here today.

145
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,775
There are ministers and congressmen--

146
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,151
I said, move.

147
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,528
Right now!

148
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,323
Guk-yeong, get help.

149
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,659
Mr. Namgung just fainted.

150
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,077
What?

151
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,954
Take him to a hospital.

152
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,249
Jun-young.

153
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,334
Hurry, Guk-yeong.

154
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,835
Gosh, that jerk.

155
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,338
Hey.

156
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,048
Wasn't he just pretending to faint?

157
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,884
-No, he wasn't.
-My goodness.

158
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,409
Are you okay?

159
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,453
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,039
I felt fine a while ago.
I don't understand.

161
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,875
I shouldn't have brought you here.

162
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,418
You're still too weak.

163
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,129
Is something wrong?

164
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,131
They need to go home. Get the car.

165
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,424
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,969
Darn it.

167
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,942
Eul.

168
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,066
Were you scared?

169
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,277
-Drive safely.
-Yes, sir.

170
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,822
Aren't you coming with us?

171
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,741
It would look bad if we all leave.

172
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,451
It's an official event.

173
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,121
Go home. I'll come home shortly.

174
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,166
Okay.

175
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,586
Ha-ru, look after your mother.

176
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,382
My goodness, Ha-ru.

177
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,342
Ha-ru.

178
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,636
We should go.

179
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,722
Get some rest. Don't think too much.

180
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,638
I don't deserve such a position.

181
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,140
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

182
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,518
Goodness. You think of me too highly.

183
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,398
Of course, I'll buy you drinks.

184
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,503
Wow, 59th.

185
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,927
Eul came in 59th place out of
all the students in the same grade as her.

186
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,597
Let me see.

187
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,433
You were 138th on the last exam.

188
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:22,398
-How many kids did you overtake?
-Jeez. That's nothing, Dad.

189
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,317
I just never studied hard before.

190
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,403
Once I put my mind to it,

191
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,655
I realized nothing's easier than studying.

192
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,618
Dad, I want tangsuyuk.

193
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,286
Okay.

194
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,039
I'll buy anything you want today.

195
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,666
Just name it.

196
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,503
Sir, can we get a tangsuyuk?

197
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,297
-A small one.
-Don't order tangsuyuk.

198
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:51,427
Do you really want to eat tangsuyuk
by deceiving Dad?

199
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,678
Hey.

200
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,389
What is he talking about?

201
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,641
She lied to you, Dad.

202
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,269
She came in 159th, not 59th.

203
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,479
She scratched off the number one with--

204
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,023
What are you talking about?

205
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,524
It's true!

206
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,985
-No Jik!
-No Eul!

207
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,575
-Come closer.
-My gosh.

208
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,329
You...

209
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,500
You altered your report card
and deceived me?

210
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,336
What will you be when you grow up?

211
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,422
-You little brat.
-I'm sorry, Dad.

212
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,549
I won't do it again.

213
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,801
Dad, I love you.

214
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,511
Dad.

215
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,328
Hey!

216
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,747
Stop!

217
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,833
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

218
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,336
No. It wasn't him.

219
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,881
My father was hit by a female driver.

220
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,467
It was a red sports car,
plate number Seoul-3G-3126.

221
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,928
I'm sorry. I deserve to die!

222
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,889
After Mr. Choi Hyeon-jun stepped in,

223
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,349
everything changed.

224
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,310
A different driver, a different car,

225
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,604
different witness statements

226
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,481
and a different prosecutor.

227
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,442
Choi Hyeon-jun?

228
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,487
Who is he?

229
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,922
It'd be like beating your head
against the wall.

230
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,591
It's not a fight you can win.

231
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,363
Eul.

232
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,664
Just keep quiet and settle.

233
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,167
And just get on with your life.

234
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,738
What?

235
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,490
Are you okay?

236
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,619
I need a doctor.

237
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,954
Doctor!

238
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,872
I need a doctor!

239
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,582
Get a doctor!

240
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,447
After letting you go

241
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,413
-My heart feels empty without you
-Turn it down, Ha-ru.

242
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:36,670
-But I cannot fill the emptiness
-Mr. Park.

243
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,380
With someone--

244
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,923
Your mom's sick.

245
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,174
So am I.

246
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,260
I'm in way more pain.

247
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,096
Do you know what Dad said to Jun-young?

248
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,807
How am I supposed to face him after that?

249
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,561
Your hands

250
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,523
Hover around me

251
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,983
MS. KIM

252
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,446
-Hello?
-The only picture

253
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:06,575
-Ha-ru, I'm on the phone.
-In my head

254
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,951
-Speak up.
-Is the one

255
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,578
-What?
-Of you

256
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,456
I have nowhere--

257
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,999
Turn it off, Ha-ru!

258
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,088
Turn it off.

259
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,929
Say that again.

260
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,598
What happened?

261
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,809
He was almost hit by an oncoming car.

262
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,062
Sin Jun-young saved him.

263
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,591
Why did she do it?

264
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,301
Pardon?

265
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,677
The young lady.

266
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,890
Why did she want to hit me?

267
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:17,771
Did what I say infuriate her that much?

268
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,524
The police will investigate this soon.

269
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,775
No.

270
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,444
There's no need to make a big fuss.

271
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,448
She seemed younger than Ji-tae.

272
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,910
Just let this slide.

273
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,787
Sir.

274
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,580
Call the police and tell them.

275
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,750
Say she was an inexperienced driver.

276
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,169
Yes, sir.

277
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,340
I also thanked Mr. Sin on your behalf.

278
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,178
You could have been hurt badly
if it weren't for him.

279
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,482
Fortunately, it's not a fracture,

280
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,484
but there's a crack in your shoulder bone.

281
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,654
Take things slowly while it heals.

282
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,853
I'm Choi Ji-tae, Director of KJ Group.

283
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,566
Thank you for saving my father.

284
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,114
Congressman Choi Hyeon-jun is my father.

285
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,870
That's why I gave up on Eul.

286
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,833
It was because he's my father.

287
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:09,925
So what?

288
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,318
Sorry for leaving you there.

289
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,743
I'm sorry.

290
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,082
It's my fault.

291
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,312
SARANG HOSPITAL

292
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,662
MY NUMBER ONE TREASURE

293
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,170
How can I help you, sir?

294
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,174
I'm still editing.

295
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:59,094
What kind of show
takes a whole week to edit?

296
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,929
You haven't been home for a while now.

297
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,433
I'll find a job.
Can't you take some time off?

298
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,852
Okay.

299
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:11,398
Send me photos
of whatever you're eating these days.

300
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:15,485
I'm just worried
that you might not be eating properly.

301
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,115
Make sure you send me the photos.

302
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,951
If you don't,
I'll pack lunchboxes and come over.

303
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,039
This is so upsetting.

304
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,752
Give me the cat, please.

305
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:37,215
Did you just say "please"?

306
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,092
You said you're older than me.

307
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,387
Where is it?

308
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,182
Where's the cat?

309
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:47,892
Gone.

310
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,360
Did you lose it?

311
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,948
Did you get rid of it?

312
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,659
No, well...

313
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,995
It was there when I went to class,

314
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,289
but while I went to get some coffee...

315
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,500
-You got rid of it.
-I did not.

316
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,003
I lost it. I swear.

317
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,882
Do you...

318
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,178
Do you know that you're really handsome?

319
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,308
Hey!

320
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,315
Let's go on a trip, Eul.

321
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,836
Let's go to a place
where no one can find us.

322
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,838
Just for one month.

323
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,758
I'll prepare everything.

324
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,301
You just need to come along.

325
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,600
I'll look only at you.

326
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,936
You'll look only at me.

327
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,900
We'll plug our ears and close our eyes

328
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,360
and ignore the world.

329
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,455
I'm sorry

330
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,459
but could I borrow your makeup?

331
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,629
Thank you.

332
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,106
We won't think about anything.

333
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,066
We won't listen to anyone.

334
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,528
Let's go away for a month and pretend like

335
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,281
we're the last people on earth.

336
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,015
It fits perfectly.

337
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,310
How pretty.

338
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:22,982
Let's not

339
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,320
make it a month.

340
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,157
Let's go for a year.

341
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,745
Let's go for ten years.

342
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,959
I'd love that.

343
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,585
All right.

344
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,588
Will you hit me if I ask for a kiss?

345
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,091
I'll kill you.

346
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,594
This situation

347
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,222
calls for more than

348
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,058
just a kiss.

349
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,634
Wait here. I'll get the car.

350
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,357
Perfect.

351
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,669
No Eul?

352
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,423
Are you No Eul?

353
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,593
Yes. Who are you?

354
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,886
We're the police.

355
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,597
You're under arrest
for the attempted murder

356
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,099
of Choi Hyeon-jun.

357
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,906
You have the right to remain silent,

358
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,324
the right to have a lawyer,

359
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,535
and the right to refuse to speak in court.

360
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,661
Come with us.

361
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,122
Wait. Just a moment.

362
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,456
Wait.

363
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,667
Jun-young.

364
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,716
Jun-young!

365
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,447
Jun-young.

366
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,416
The police arrested Eul.

367
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,965
Find out where they took her.

368
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,566
You're locked in.

369
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:41,777
Open the door.

370
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,572
Mr. Namgung gave orders

371
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,117
not to let you out of your room.

372
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,912
One more mess-up and your career's over.

373
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,914
Your phone's here.

374
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,499
I have it.

375
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,461
Open up.

376
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,047
Open the door before I kill you!

377
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,553
Over my dead body.

378
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,057
I agree with Mr. Namgung this time.

379
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,559
Think of how you got here.

380
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,145
You can't ruin everything for a girl!

381
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,480
Let me out right now.

382
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,774
Get a grip, Jun-young.

383
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:21,901
Jang Guk-yeong!

384
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:25,863
Open the door!

385
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,495
Let me out.

386
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,873
Please let me out.

387
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,087
Open the door.

388
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:43,798
Open up.

389
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,677
Open the door!

390
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,887
Let me out!

391
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,771
I have to get out.

392
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,983
SEOCHO POLICE STATION

393
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,462
You didn't even touch it.

394
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,051
Why did you try to kill Mr. Choi?

395
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,596
Why did you try to kill him?

396
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,517
Are you just going
to keep silent like this?

397
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,747
How is it, Dad?

398
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,796
I should reconsider

399
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,632
marrying you off.

400
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,676
Why?

401
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,094
Does it taste that bad?

402
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,556
You're pretty, smart
and even a great cook.

403
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:20,060
Giving you to Ji-tae for free
is a loss on my part.

404
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,735
I will visit you every day.

405
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,200
I'll have breakfast with you.

406
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,659
And lunch, too.

407
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,706
Maybe even dinner.

408
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,251
You aren't even a politician
and you make big promises.

409
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,593
Dad.

410
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,595
Yes?

411
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,597
What happened to that man?

412
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,766
Who?

413
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,102
The man I hit with my car a long time ago.

414
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,106
Why are you suddenly asking that?

415
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,692
No big reason.

416
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,862
He appeared in my dream last night.

417
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,615
I felt horrible all day.

418
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,619
He died.

419
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,625
Good.

420
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,130
I heard he was in a coma.

421
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,675
He seemed poor.

422
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,593
If he were still in a coma,

423
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,012
he'd only be a burden to his family.

424
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,057
I guess so.

425
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,602
It's best that he died

426
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,188
rather than having to live in that state.

427
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,368
Dad.

428
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,831
Where's this wine from?

429
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,083
Can you get me a bottle?

430
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,463
Let me win some brownie points
from Ji-tae's father.

431
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,645
What did you say?

432
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,149
My wife did what?

433
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,910
Haven't you killed it yet?

434
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,746
I can't do it.

435
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,914
I can't kill it with it looking up at me.

436
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,668
My goodness. You'll never
make sushi at this rate.

437
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,712
-Let me do it.
-Gosh.

438
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,340
Gosh. I can't watch.

439
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,133
Take it outside.

440
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,804
Ji-tae, you're home early.

441
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,473
Have you eaten?

442
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,641
Wait just a bit.

443
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,185
Your mother will make you some sushi.

444
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,146
I told you to take it outside.

445
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,231
Did you sue Ms. No?

446
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:17,905
Ms. Jang.

447
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,991
Get a bottle of wine
from the third row of the cellar.

448
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,201
Sure.

449
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,081
Why did you do that?

450
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,752
Was it because she tried to hit Dad?

451
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,422
Did that make you angry?

452
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,968
Did you have to vent
in such a childish way?

453
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,556
I have no idea what you're talking about.

454
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,976
Your father will be home soon.
Go and wash up.

455
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,867
You crushed her three years ago as well.

456
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:07,579
She investigated
our company's illegal funds.

457
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,792
It was all true,

458
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,837
but you sued her for making
false accusations and libel.

459
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,464
She lost the lawsuit
that you manipulated with your power.

460
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,383
She's still running from loan sharks

461
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,593
that she borrowed money from
to pay the fine.

462
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,682
I told you to get washed up.

463
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,725
Don't you feel any remorse?

464
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,894
-Ji-tae.
-A human being...

465
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,188
If you're a human being,

466
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,900
then you must feel some sort of guilt

467
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,735
for ruining No Eul's life

468
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,446
alongside Dad!

469
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,443
No Eul.

470
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,738
No Eul.

471
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,494
I'm No Jang-su's daughter, No Eul.

472
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,205
Remember me.

473
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,333
Don't ever forget me.

474
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,646
Jun-young.

475
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,148
It's me.

476
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,609
Sin Jun-young!

477
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,197
Sin Jun-young.

478
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,243
Jun-young!

479
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,758
Jun-young.

480
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,970
Please help my sister.

481
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,516
I've thought about it,

482
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,312
and you're the only one who can help her.

483
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,189
Out of the people we know,

484
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,984
you're the only one
with power and connections.

485
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:29,448
Only you can help my sister.

486
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,289
Jun-young, please...

487
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,335
Jun-young.

488
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,502
Jun-young.

489
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,304
Jun-young.

490
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,515
Help us.

491
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,530
It's me, your attorney.

492
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,658
You didn't answer your phone,
so I called you at home.

493
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,537
Okay. Do you know

494
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,165
where she is?

495
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:46,376
I think she's at Seocho Police Station.

496
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,380
Get her out.

497
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:53,759
Mr. Pyo.

498
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:55,802
Go and...

499
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,346
Jun-young, are you okay?

500
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:03,185
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can help you with that.

501
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,686
Why not?

502
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:08,523
Mr. Namgung just called me.

503
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,569
He told me not to get involved
with No Eul's case.

504
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,532
Jun-young.

505
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,660
I'm really sorry.

506
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,323
You need to warm your throat
when you keep coughing.

507
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,866
Wear my scarf.

508
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,582
It looks delicious.

509
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,752
-My goodness.
-Enjoy your meal.

510
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:15,340
Our yukgaejang is made
with the best meat and broth--

511
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:18,552
Please enjoy your meal.
Tell us if you want more.

512
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:20,887
Let go.

513
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,394
-Take this off.
-I won't.

514
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,813
You wore it for three days straight
while boiling the broth,

515
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,481
broiling the meat, and cooking the stew.

516
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,732
Is this some sort of protest?

517
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,025
You finally noticed.

518
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,111
Yong-deuk, go and get my sewing kit.

519
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,279
What for?

520
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,906
To sew this onto his skin.

521
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,408
Fine, go ahead.

522
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:44,369
It's the most expensive outfit
I've ever worn.

523
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,912
I'd love to keep it on.

524
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,502
-Ms. Sin.
-Fine.

525
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,920
Splash water on me.

526
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,715
I won't take it off
even if you throw poop at me.

527
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:00,844
JUN-YOUNG'S HOUSE

528
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,387
It's Jun-young.

529
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:05,223
-Don't take it. Don't pick up.
-Let go.

530
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,225
Jun-young, I really meant to go.

531
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,060
I wore the tuxedo you sent

532
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,478
and even prepared for an interview,

533
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,689
but your mom suddenly went--

534
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,275
Jun-young.

535
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:17,736
Hello?

536
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,947
Are you sick?

537
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,245
What's wrong? You sound so weak.

538
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,875
Did someone beat you up?

539
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,422
Shall I put your mom on the phone?

540
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:44,888
Mom.

541
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,682
Mom.

542
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,935
Help me.

543
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,358
I knew that Mr. Namgung guy was a psycho.

544
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,943
That ugly jerk.

545
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,361
How dare he lock Jun-young up.

546
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,196
He only cares about money.

547
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,448
I knew he was weird the day he let out
the fake scandal.

548
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,824
I should beat him for three days,

549
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,035
then wake up and continue beating him.

550
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,995
Be quiet and drive.

551
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,372
Okay.

552
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:42,529
Good for you.

553
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,532
What a saint!

554
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,247
Dad.

555
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:55,417
Do you think you're a rescue team?
Or Superman? Or Batman?

556
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:59,796
Why give away your coat
when you're shivering?

557
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,049
Dad...

558
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,887
Don't you dare cry.

559
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,809
You can't survive this cruel world
if you live like this.

560
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,936
If you're like this,

561
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,190
how will I ever rest in peace?

562
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,484
That's why

563
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,030
I took the money.

564
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,035
I took the money Choi Hyeon-jun offered.

565
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,374
I took it

566
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,085
and tried to forget about you.

567
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,546
I settled, Dad.

568
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,924
I thought I'd die if I didn't.

569
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,385
I took the money.

570
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,931
Who would care for Jik if I died, too?

571
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,018
I wanted to die,

572
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:58,480
but I couldn't stand the idea
of leaving him alone.

573
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:00,690
So, I took the money.

574
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:07,697
Good job.

575
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:11,367
You did the right thing.

576
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:12,911
Dad.

577
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,790
I'm sorry, Eul.

578
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,420
I'm so sorry.

579
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,339
Dad...

580
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,967
It's so hard.

581
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:34,057
Can't you take me to where you are?

582
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,434
Mom.

583
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,696
How dare they lock you up

584
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,699
when you're so sick.

585
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,828
Get up. Let's get you to a hospital.

586
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:37,996
Get up.

587
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,581
Come on.

588
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:40,832
Let's go.

589
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,417
Come with me.

590
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,464
I have to see Eul.

591
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:49,924
Help me.

592
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:58,224
I need to go to her. Please help me.

593
00:57:58,933 --> 00:57:59,934
Mom.

594
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:52,779
Please get Ms. No out.

595
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,280
Do you like her?

596
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,783
Don't you have too much to lose

597
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,576
to risk it all on pity?

598
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,204
It's all because of you. It's your fault.

599
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:05,583
You really have lost your mind
because of that gold digger.

600
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,585
You crazy fool! You don't know anything!

601
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,170
And stop calling him by his name.

602
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,505
He's your father!

603
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,633
Why do you think Eul tried to kill you?

604
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:18,096
I hope this is the last time
I see you in this life.

605
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:21,015
No. You can't let her go.

606
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,101
She'll try to kill you again.

607
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,186
Jun-young.

608
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,604
We decided to go on a trip, remember?

609
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:28,940
Let's live here where no one can find us.

610
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,984
We can return after living here
for 100 years.

611
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,110
Do you remember?

612
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,362
I said I never wanted to see you again,

613
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,823
and that we should end
our ill-fated relationship.

614
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:40,159
Did you want to see how far I would go?

615
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,536
What are you talking about?

616
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,204
Where is she going?
