1
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:18,935
Where are we going?

2
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,104
I don't know.

3
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,273
Don't ask me to pull over.

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,442
I don't plan on stopping.

5
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,811
You're late.

6
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,606
So are you.

7
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,067
I had to listen to a friend whine.

8
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,611
-About what?
-My friend

9
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,946
and my friend's

10
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,199
younger brother

11
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,328
both liked the same girl.

12
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,332
-That's too bad.
-But

13
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,752
my friend's father

14
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,006
had an ill-fated relationship
with the girl's family.

15
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,260
My friend had no choice

16
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,807
but to give up on her.

17
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,726
His brother, on the other hand,

18
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,731
took the girl's hand
and ran away with her.

19
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,654
That sounds like the plot
of a drama Ms. Jang likes to watch.

20
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:55,949
It does, doesn't it?

21
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,373
Let's skip exercise today.

22
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,875
Buy me a drink instead.

23
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,597
It's as far as we can go.

24
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,600
We'll fall and drown if we go further.

25
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,271
Let's just drown.

26
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,524
I don't really want to live, anyway.

27
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,776
Let's just die.

28
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,032
You can't even do it anyway.

29
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,534
What a coward.

30
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,632
-What are you doing?
-You wanted to die.

31
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,758
You're crazy.

32
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,802
You really are.

33
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,555
Die by yourself if you want to.

34
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,983
Where are you going?

35
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,944
Eul!

36
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,495
GUK-YEONG

37
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,166
POWER OFF

38
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:41,054
SANCHON SUPERMARKET

39
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,075
MY NUMBER ONE TREASURE

40
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,712
Your call cannot be connected.

41
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,879
She's not answering?

42
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,677
Where do you think Jun-young took her?

43
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,182
I knew he was a loose cannon,
but he went way too far.

44
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,728
My goodness.

45
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:16,107
The top ten most searched words
are all about them.

46
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,525
Look at the comments.

47
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,028
Jun-young's fans will kill Eul in no time.

48
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,034
THE WORST OF THE WORST

49
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,003
OH JIK

50
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,631
Hello?

51
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,967
Don't you dare harm No Eul.

52
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,635
What?

53
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,971
You're the president
of Sin Jun-young's fan club.

54
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:51,392
If you touch a hair on Eul's head,
you'll pay for it.

55
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,102
Tell your minions that.

56
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,395
Hey!

57
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,315
And if they don't stop posting
malicious comments,

58
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,359
I'll trace their IP addresses
and crush them for good.

59
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,695
Tell them that too.

60
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,572
How dare you.

61
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,657
Do you know who I am?

62
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,368
-How dare you threaten me.
-Hey.

63
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,164
You ordered some people to do
a background check on her, didn't you?

64
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,417
If I ever catch you,
you won't remain in one piece.

65
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,545
You'd better watch out
for yourself at night.

66
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,506
Who are you to...

67
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,216
Where are you?

68
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,427
I'll have my dad send the police
over right now.

69
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,847
Yeowul Villa, Block 102, Suite 201,
Ssangmun-dong.

70
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,143
Come right over. I'll take you on any day.

71
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,732
This jerk...

72
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,572
DAD

73
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,700
Dad, where are you?

74
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,079
Some lunatic is threatening your daughter.

75
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,790
What are you talking about?

76
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,129
Why did you pick up?

77
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,841
We were having a drink.
Dad went to the men's room.

78
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,135
What's going on?

79
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,221
It's just that someone thinks
I told Jun-young's...

80
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,183
Never mind.

81
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,727
Do you know me?

82
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,021
What do you care?

83
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,115
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

84
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,491
Goodness.

85
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,785
Why am I drunk already?

86
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,913
I didn't even drink that much.

87
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,623
You can't drink as well as in the past.

88
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,294
It's because your mother
is overly protective.

89
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,715
-Let's go home. Okay?
-Okay.

90
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,576
My phone.

91
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,288
Is it in here?

92
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,169
Where is it?

93
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,801
-Have you seen my phone?
-No.

94
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,100
Is it in here?

95
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:51,822
Here.

96
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,329
What was the number?

97
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,084
It was three, nine...

98
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,504
No, that's Na-ri's number.

99
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,757
It's seven, three...

100
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,900
My goodness.

101
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,570
Why did he drink so much?

102
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,280
Was this your idea?

103
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,740
Yes. I asked him to buy me a drink.

104
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:39,829
He has to watch his health.
He's not supposed to drink.

105
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,790
He hasn't been sleeping much
because of work.

106
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,961
Why are you all so selfish?

108
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,423
I'll make him honey tea. Help him change.

109
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,175
-Okay.
-This is so upsetting.

110
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,106
Hello?

111
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,317
Hello?

112
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,821
Hello? You called, so speak up.

113
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,489
Do you know

114
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,827
how hard it was for me?

115
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,915
Pretending not to like you was...

116
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,212
You don't know how hard that was.

117
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,180
Why were you nice to me?

118
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,726
Why did you buy me food and clothes

119
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,853
when you didn't even
have money for yourself?

120
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,566
Why did you smile at me,

121
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,277
ask if I'd eaten or not

122
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:57,365
and take me to the hospital
when I was sick? Why did you do all that?

123
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,950
You rejected me twice.

124
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,622
That was in public too,
which was so embarrassing.

125
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,962
Why did you make me so confused?

126
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,313
What makes you so special?

127
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,607
Tell me.

128
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,943
You aren't as rich as Sin Jun-young.

129
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,320
You're older than him, too.

130
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,199
He has three cars and you have none.

131
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,160
You don't have a house or a building.

132
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,789
What gives you the right to reject me?

133
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,834
Give me the phone.

134
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,753
Hyeon-u.

135
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,424
Can't you think about it one more time?

136
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,303
I'm a catch if you really get to know me.

137
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,473
I promise to be really good to you.

138
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,185
Please accept my feelings.

139
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,273
Will you go out with me, please?

140
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:21,949
Hey!

141
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,328
Give it back.

142
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,457
It's mine, not yours.

143
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,751
Still, give it back.
I'm not done talking to him!

144
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,129
What more do you have to say?
You made a fool of yourself already!

145
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,089
I want my phone back.

146
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,760
Hey!

147
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,315
Are you okay?

148
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,818
Do you want water?

149
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,821
No...

150
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,411
It's your fault.

151
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,293
Because of what you did,

152
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,049
I can't be with Eul.

153
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,519
Go and get my phone.

154
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,272
It's mine, not yours.

155
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:39,735
Go and get my phone!
I wasn't done talking to him!

156
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,071
Go and get it yourself, then!

157
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:58,170
What a psycho.

158
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,050
-Get out!
-Let me go!

159
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,511
Get out of there.

160
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,264
-Let go of me!
-My gosh!

161
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,975
Put me down.

162
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,227
Hey!

163
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,979
Hey.

164
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,069
My gosh!

165
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,029
Hey!

166
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,413
Don't you see me?

167
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,917
Think of what I did for you!

168
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,506
Don't you see me?

169
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,843
Hyeon-u.

170
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,930
Hyeon-u.

171
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,017
Hyeon-u.

172
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,377
Hyeon-u.

173
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,772
Oh, my head.

174
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,210
My head...

175
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,272
It hurts.

176
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,531
Why are my clothes up there?

177
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,866
Are you feeling all right?

178
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,410
You drank soju straight up.

179
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,620
Five bottles of it, too.

180
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,123
-Did I really?
-What?

181
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,541
My goodness.

182
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:46,046
I made some hangover soup.
Wait while I set the table.

183
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,298
Wait. Excuse me, ma'am.

184
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,720
Why are my clothes hanging up there?

185
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,056
And why am I wearing this weird outfit?

186
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,059
You really don't remember anything?

187
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,603
You walked into the sea and got drenched.

188
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,523
Then you threw up on yourself.

189
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,983
It was so gross.

190
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,861
Your husband had a horrible time
helping you change.

191
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,530
-My husband?
-Don't you remember him, either?

192
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,491
The tall guy from Seoul.
He's not your husband?

193
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,535
Are you saying

194
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,039
the person who dressed me was my...

195
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,540
No, I mean...

196
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,167
That jerk

197
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,378
-was the one who dressed me?
-Yes.

198
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,505
What's wrong with that? You're married.

199
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,716
It's not like he's never seen
you naked before.

200
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,386
No way.

201
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,566
CURRENT LOCATION
NEUNGPO - 01

202
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,385
Where did he go?

203
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,431
Your husband had a horrible time
helping you change.

204
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,101
What's wrong with that? You're married.

205
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,353
It's not like he's never seen
you naked before.

206
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,234
I can't remember a single thing.
I just can't.

207
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,070
Whatever.

208
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,242
SIN JUN-YOUNG ELOPES AFTER CONCERT

209
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,246
Your phone is fully charged.

210
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,664
Thank you.

211
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:56,593
I was born and raised here
and I never left this place.

212
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,012
Was that for free?

213
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,389
Of course it was.

214
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,684
It's odd how you grew up
in Gyeongsang Province

215
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,477
but you're using a Jeolla dialect.

216
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,605
What are you talking about? No, I'm not.

217
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,235
-What is she wearing?
-Look at her.

218
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,503
Sorry, Jik. You must've been
worried about me.

219
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,505
Why? Is something wrong?

220
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,674
Didn't you see the news?

221
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,093
I'm a student.
I don't have any time for that.

222
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,263
-Why? Is something wrong?
-Everything's fine.

223
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,892
I'm perfectly fine and nothing happened.

224
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,894
-Are you at school?
-Yes.

225
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,520
Where are you?

226
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,399
I left Seoul for work.

227
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,526
I'm on my way back now.

228
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,820
I see. Okay.

229
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,281
Class is about to start. I have to go.

230
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,657
Okay.

231
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,868
Don't skip your meals.

232
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,000
Why did you lie?

233
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,045
You didn't sleep a wink or go to school

234
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,922
because you were so worried.

235
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,174
If I tell her all that,

236
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,302
it'll upset her even more.

237
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,429
Just wait until Jun-young's back.

238
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,598
I'll beat him up.

239
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,935
Hyeon-u, you're unbelievable.

240
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,479
He didn't call even once.

241
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,939
Wasn't he worried?

242
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,236
Hyeon-u.

243
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,821
Hyeon-u.

244
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,615
Stop it.

245
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,576
Hyeon-u.

246
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,578
I'm Sin Jun-young.

247
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,623
I deserve better than this.

248
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,292
You don't know how lucky you are.

249
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,462
Hyeon-u.

250
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,049
Say that once more
and I'll throw you in the sea.

251
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,846
My gosh.

252
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,515
Get off me.

253
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,853
Damn it.

254
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,317
MS. NO

255
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,653
If our restaurant business
were to expand abroad,

256
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,990
it would improve our company's image
and revenue.

257
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,411
That's what business is all about.

258
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,456
But where can I find the proposal?

259
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,209
On page 32, I think--

260
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,920
That is not enough reason or cause!

261
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,091
That's why I'm asking.

262
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,346
-Which is it?
-What do you mean?

263
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,806
While you turned a sandglass

264
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,517
as you nursed a hangover in a sauna,

265
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,686
or swapped clubs as you played golf,

266
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,480
did one of your minions
make a small mistake

267
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,649
out of exhaustion
from working day and night?

268
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,319
Or did you, for once,
try to do this yourself,

269
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,154
but because it's been a while
since you've worked,

270
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:07,451
did you mistake
the pointless for the important?

271
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,622
Is that why you ended up with a proposal

272
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,668
that has no meaning, grounds,
uniqueness or creativity?

273
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,713
-I'm just curious.
-I apologize.

274
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,798
I'll revise it in time for the next--

275
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,300
No, don't bother.

276
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,760
Mr. Jung.

277
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,720
Yes, sir.

278
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,600
Take over the project
and develop it further.

279
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,351
Yes, sir.

280
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,646
That's it for today.

281
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,243
MS. NO

282
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,681
It must be Hyeon-u.

283
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,683
JUN-YOUNG'S MANAGER

284
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:16,853
Hello?

285
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,313
Don't be like this, Mr. Kim.

286
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,607
Why didn't you answer your phone?

287
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,068
-She's not his girlfriend.
-Where's Jun-young?

288
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,737
He's been under a lot of stress lately.

289
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,948
He's not picking up.

290
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,451
Mr. Kim, help me out here.

291
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,787
-I'm--
-She doesn't know, either.

292
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,664
Help me out.

293
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,666
Okay, bye.

294
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,754
Why doesn't she know?
She coaxed him and left with him

295
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,090
-in front of the reporters!
-Did you hear that?

296
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,092
You can tell me.

297
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,761
I didn't coax him. I'm a victim--

298
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,267
I'm a victim too.

299
00:23:55,976 --> 00:24:00,480
He's not naive.
He's a jerk and a sneaky one, too.

300
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,576
Oh, dear.

301
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,203
Here you go.

302
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,581
Wiping her face won't be enough.

303
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,749
Change her into that
so she doesn't catch a cold.

304
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,251
Thank you.

305
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,795
-Ma'am.
-What?

306
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,131
Sorry, but

307
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,968
could you help her get changed instead?

308
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,096
Why should I when you're young and able?

309
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:35,515
You said she's your wife.

310
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,184
I did.

311
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,519
But...

312
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,148
I can't even be bothered
to change my own clothes

313
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:46,193
so I wear the same outfit
for a whole week.

314
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,429
Hyeon-u.

315
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,890
Hyeon-u...

316
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,851
Hyeon-u--

317
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:21,162
"An unknown woman turned
Jun-young's life into a ridiculous drama."

318
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,290
IHWASOO YUKGAEJANG

319
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:30,588
No.

320
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,759
That comment isn't harsh enough.

321
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,931
"Sin Jun-young has lost his charm.

322
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,767
He boarded the retirement express."

323
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,311
How about that?

324
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,565
Not bad, right?

325
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,817
Pretty good, Pretty Spy.

326
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:57,407
"He's gone. The top star has gone bad."

327
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,701
Do you like that?

328
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,872
Nice, right?

329
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,291
Nice one, Deuk Dragon.

330
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,711
It's not nice at all!

331
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,505
I caught you both red-handed.

332
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:16,301
I let you both off because I knew you.

333
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,386
Do you take me for a fool?

334
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,765
Pretty Spy and Deuk Dragon.

335
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,726
I'll sue you both. Check your mail.

336
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,854
-Ms. Sin.
-Ma'am.

337
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,607
They did nothing wrong.

338
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:35,695
I posted the mean comments
and I told them to write them, too.

339
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,365
If you want to sue someone, sue me.

340
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,409
-Ms. Sin.
-How could you?

341
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,581
You should worry about him
and protect your only son.

342
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:49,376
How could you say that?
Are you really his mother?

343
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,795
-Don't, sir.
-Don't stop me.

344
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:56,549
I held back for Jun-young's sake,
but not anymore. I'll speak my mind.

345
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,801
Oh, really?

346
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,805
What do you have to say to me?

347
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,433
Are we talking as equals?
I'm older than you are.

348
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,102
Do you see the white hairs?

349
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,020
-Speak casually to me too, then.
-Ms. Sin.

350
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,606
What do you have to say when you took

351
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,526
my smart son and turned him into a clown?

352
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,861
What, "a clown"? A clown?

353
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,114
He's a famous star, not a clown!

354
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,409
Other parents would worship me

355
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,661
if I made their son
into this big of a star.

356
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:28,998
Then go after someone else's son
and be worshiped!

357
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,750
Why did you go after Jun-young?

358
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,169
Now it all makes sense.

359
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,506
This explains why
he's such a selfish jerk.

360
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,759
No one with a mental mom would be normal.

361
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,637
I actually feel sorry for him now.

362
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,682
-What's this jerk talking about?
-Dad.

363
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,687
Who did you call mental? Do you want to
see what a mental person looks like?

364
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,230
Sir.

365
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,609
-Let him go.
-Apologize right now.

366
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,904
Say you got a bit carried away
and said the wrong thing.

367
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,531
Apologize to her right now.

368
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,117
Let him go already.

369
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,829
Yeong-ok, do you know what he said?

370
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,541
He said "mental" and that means crazy.

371
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:14,377
He just called you crazy. I had to react.

372
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,796
Don't react! Just don't do anything!

373
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,507
You too! Leave my son alone!

374
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,510
You, leave him alone. And you, too.

375
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,472
Don't do anything!

376
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,186
We have to do something.

377
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,480
We have to at least find him.

378
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,899
Guk-yeong, help me out here.

379
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,193
Sir, let him go.

380
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,320
Ms. Sin told you to be still.

381
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,447
You...

382
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,618
I am still. I'm standing on the spot.

383
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:50,955
Yeong-ok told me not to do anything,
so I won't. Got it?

384
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,457
Put me down.

385
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,625
What?

386
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,965
Where on earth is he?

387
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,093
Who's the girl?

388
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:19,484
Choi Hyeon-jun was at your son's concert.

389
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:33,706
IHWASOO YUKGAEJANG

390
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,548
Did you find out why Jun-young
was at the hospital?

391
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:48,429
Hallyu is super popular in China.
Not only Korean dramas and movies,

392
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,516
but music and beauty products
are popular as well.

393
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,603
I'm surprised to see how popular
Hallyu is in China

394
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,605
and I'm grateful for that.

395
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,942
The hottest Korean star in China
right now is--

396
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,820
It's definitely Sin Jun-young.

397
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,991
-My daughter loves him too,
-Really?

398
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,451
and I hate him for that.

399
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,925
Excuse me for a moment. I'm sorry.

400
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,721
-Escort them to the hall.
-Yes, sir.

401
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,402
Sin Yeong-ok?

402
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,282
Yeong-ok.

403
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,049
It's been a while.

404
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,217
Yeong-ok.

405
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,139
You're calling me Yeong-ok again.

406
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,354
It's me, Madam Song.

407
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,523
Bovary in Samseong-dong, five years ago.

408
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,359
Do you remember?

409
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,906
I waited for you for quite a while.

410
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,409
You never came back after the election.

411
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:39,749
MADAM SONG'S SALON

412
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:40,959
Come by some day.

413
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,757
I opened a business in Cheongdam-dong.

414
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,196
-Do I have to do this?
-Yes.

415
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,865
You're the nation's
most famous gold digger.

416
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,703
-Practically everyone's after you.
-What?

417
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,623
Let me tell you how big
the snowball is right now.

418
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:24,043
They say Jun-young's documentary
became your project

419
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,504
because you threatened him
like the woman from Misery.

420
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,590
Apparently, you have a video
that can't go public

421
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,176
and you're blackmailing him with it.

422
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,179
What? That's nonsense.

423
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,640
Do people even believe that stuff?

424
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:41,436
Yes. Even if it turns out
to be nonsense or lies,

425
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:43,563
people only believe what they want to.

426
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,527
The papers blurred me out
in the photo, though.

427
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,990
The papers, yes,
but your face is all over the web.

428
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,199
They know your address.

429
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,577
People even know
what underwear brand you wear.

430
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,621
What should I do?

431
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,290
Do I have to go abroad?

432
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,086
JUN-YOUNG'S MANAGER

433
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:13,176
Do you really not know where he is?
You're with him, right?

434
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,844
You're lying about it, aren't you?

435
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,181
Why would I lie?

436
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,559
I'm already known as a gold digger.
Are you calling me a liar, too?

437
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,604
I don't know where Jun-young is.

438
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,356
If you're that frustrated,
call the police!

439
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,941
He's the kidnapper.

440
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,693
Have the police catch the--

441
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,862
What?

442
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,116
Gosh.

443
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,668
Oh my god.

444
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:48,878
What?

445
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,924
You told me your address
and practically invited me over.

446
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,635
-Are you scared now that I'm here?
-Not really.

447
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,515
I was surprised
to see something so ugly up close.

448
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,851
How do you know her?

449
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:09,816
Why are you trying so hard to shield her
and why did you threaten me?

450
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,275
That's what our relationship is like.

451
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,237
I'm always shielding her

452
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,073
and I'll threaten anyone
who threatens her.

453
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,201
So be careful not to make me

454
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,120
threaten you.

455
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,249
-Where is she?
-Why?

456
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:30,419
So you can tell everyone else
and have her killed?

457
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,587
I wouldn't do that.

458
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,340
Just tell me where she is.

459
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,466
I don't know.

460
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,474
Jun-young disappeared
after he left with her.

461
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,728
No one posted anything on social media
about seeing him.

462
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:51,732
They say she's mad for money.
If she sold him off or--

463
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,737
Hey.

464
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,784
Leave your trashy thoughts in here.

465
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,452
How dare you.

466
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,873
Relax. Consider this your new home.

467
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,333
I will sue you.

468
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,752
I told you my dad is a famous prosecutor.

469
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,673
Why would I get sued
for putting trash in the bin?

470
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,383
I deserve a reward.

471
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,544
JUN-YOUNG'S MANAGER

472
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,759
Is he trying to pick a fight?

473
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,435
Why are you up?

474
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,312
Do you feel like throwing up again?

475
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,241
You really don't know?

476
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,785
Do you really not know where he is?

477
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,705
I really don't.

478
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,041
He was gone when I woke up.

479
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,711
He left his car by the sea.

480
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,339
By now, Jun-young...

481
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,677
I mean, Mr. Sin would have driven it home.

482
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,139
I'll text you the address.

483
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,875
Damn it.

484
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,029
You're a star now, Eul.

485
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,408
It wasn't me.

486
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,079
I know you can't let people know.

487
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,082
Where did you leave Jun-young though?

488
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,792
And why are you with another man?

489
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,543
It's not what you think.

490
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,504
-Bong-suk.
-Yes?

491
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,047
I think the tripes are burning.

492
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,050
Don't worry.
They'll turn over if it gets too hot.

493
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,427
What?

494
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,681
It's a joke. Wasn't it funny?

495
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:57,061
I bet you've never met
such a witty woman before.

496
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,897
Give me an autograph before you leave.

497
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,905
Aren't the sunglasses a bit bothersome?

498
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:12,743
You already trip over often without them.

499
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,245
You're right.

500
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,013
Are you jealous?

501
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:39,103
You'd be a star like me
if you hadn't run away.

502
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,897
You're right.

503
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,984
I guess that's just the end of my luck.

504
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,569
You're a coward.

505
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,990
-Yes.
-Despicable.

506
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,577
-Yes.
-Why are you here?

507
00:40:56,537 --> 00:41:00,708
After that, you should be
too ashamed to show up.

508
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,251
I should be.

509
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,130
I was.

510
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,926
But here I am.

511
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,849
I'm as confused as you are.

512
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:22,855
The noodles are getting soggy.

513
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,108
Should we have eaten
hangover soup instead?

514
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,576
Wait.

515
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,746
How did you know I drank?

516
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:39,955
You called me.

517
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,666
-You were really drunk.
-When?

518
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:48,130
I checked my recent call list
and you weren't on it.

519
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,966
You called me with Sin Jun-young's phone.

520
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,761
When you called me,

521
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,097
was he there with you?

522
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,893
I don't know.

523
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,104
What did I say?

524
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,607
What did I tell you?

525
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,902
I don't remember, either.

526
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,284
JEONG-EUN

527
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,624
I need to take this.

528
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:35,636
What kind of a mess have you made?

529
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,853
-Hi, Jeong-eun.
-What are you doing?

530
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,397
I'm in a meeting.

531
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,692
Sorry for bothering you at work.

532
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,279
It's fine. How are you?

533
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,655
I'm well.

534
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:59,743
Did you go to
Sin Jun-young's concert last night?

535
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,913
No.

536
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,249
I see. It wasn't you.

537
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:07,835
Why?

538
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,922
Someone said they saw you there.

539
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,551
I don't have enough free time
to go to concerts.

540
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:19,263
I know. I guess the person was mistaken.

541
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,016
I said it couldn't have been you.

542
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,897
Jeong-eun, would you like
to have dinner tomorrow?

543
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,406
What makes you so special?

544
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,117
You aren't as rich as Sin Jun-young.

545
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,328
You're older than him, too.

546
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,873
He has three cars and you have none.

547
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,751
You don't have a house or a building.

548
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,713
What gives you the right to reject me?

549
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,881
Give me the phone.

550
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,176
Hyeon-u.

551
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:01,013
Can't you think about it one more time?

552
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,851
I'm a catch if you really get to know me.

553
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:09,063
I promise to be really good to you.

554
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,608
Please accept my feelings.

555
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,904
Will you go out with me, please?

556
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,491
Enjoy your meal.

557
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,714
Eul.

558
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,835
What should I do?

559
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,923
This crazy girl who turned her back to me

560
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,094
won't even cast me a glance.

561
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,267
Instead, she only wants the guy
who abandoned her. What should I do?

562
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,274
I'm Sin Jun-young.

563
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:46,326
Should I tell her to stop?

564
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:54,376
Should I threaten
to hit her if she won't stop?

565
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:00,048
It's obvious that she isn't normal.

566
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,471
Should I take her to see a doctor?

567
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,809
Or...

568
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,275
Maybe I was just too late.

569
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,741
Should I give up on you

570
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,579
and send you off to that guy?

571
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,185
-Where is Eul?
-She just left. Didn't you see her?

572
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:59,900
Is she actually from a rich family,
by any chance?

573
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,444
Your face tells me I'm right.

574
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,614
That's why she eloped with Sin Jun-young.

575
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:10,160
Did I do or say anything to upset her?

576
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,458
Taxi.

577
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,175
-Where to?
-To Geoje.

578
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,178
Take me there. Hurry up, please.

579
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:43,902
We're here.

580
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,915
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

581
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,628
Could you give me a discount?

582
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,590
Taxi fees are fixed.

583
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,466
-I see.
-Okay.

584
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,806
Do you take installments?

585
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,277
Ms. No?

586
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,572
You haven't found him yet?

587
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:33,577
I have men scouring the whole area,
but no one has seen him.

588
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,455
Could he be in Seoul?

589
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:41,168
Would a star like him
have taken a bus or a taxi?

590
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,712
What about the police? Did you call them?

591
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:46,506
How could I?
If the press catches anything,

592
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,676
that would really
take a turn for the worse.

593
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,309
What if he drowned in the sea?

594
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,315
Jun-young! Where are you?

595
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:06,902
If you drowned, tell me so!

596
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,987
What if he really fell in the water?

597
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,407
Then we should go and get him!

598
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:17,746
Did you kill him to take his belongings?

599
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,666
His watch is worth millions of won.

600
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,959
-What?
-You love money.

601
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,755
Yes, I killed him.

602
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:29,675
I wanted his money, so I killed him.
So what?

603
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:33,095
How much do you have?
Shall I kill you, too?

604
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,304
No, I...

605
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,641
I have nothing. Only loans to pay back.

606
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:45,148
He proposed to you in public,
but you rejected him.

607
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,696
He's nothing without his pride and ego.

608
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,449
If he really did do something drastic
because of you,

609
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,910
then I really won't just sit and watch.

610
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,663
Where could he be?

611
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:06,503
My goodness. Are you still here?

612
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,713
Ma'am.

613
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:13,135
JANGSA BED AND BREAKFAST

614
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,054
Eat this.

615
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,438
I heard your husband's missing.

616
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,982
People came here last night.

617
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:31,111
They asked when you came and left,
what you did

618
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,321
and if you had said anything strange.

619
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,366
They acted like you two
were having an affair.

620
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,744
Did he really not tell you
where he was going?

621
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:42,289
He didn't. He told me
to cook you some hangover soup.

622
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,083
Since your clothes weren't dry yet,
he paid me tons

623
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,169
to give you some of my clothes.

624
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:20,744
What a fool.

625
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:24,790
Eul.

626
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,460
Did you really do something stupid?

627
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:34,216
"I hate Jun-young's guts. Go and die.

628
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,552
Why hasn't the Grim Reaper taken him yet?"

629
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,680
I hope I didn't say anything like that.

630
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,267
My goodness.

631
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,149
Ma'am.

632
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,318
Where is this?

633
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,405
That? It's the island over there.

634
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,117
-Is it nearby?
-Yes.

635
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,744
It takes 40 minutes by boat.

636
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,459
CRUISES

637
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,927
DEPARTURE SCHEDULE

638
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,097
Excuse me, sir.

639
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,099
Captain.

640
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,894
Could you give me a ride?

641
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,458
Jun-young.

642
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,045
Sin Jun-young!

643
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:19,839
Jun-young.

644
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,689
WAY TO THE DOCK

645
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:46,324
Jun-young!

646
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,464
Where are you, Jun-young?

647
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,094
Where are you if you aren't here?

648
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,558
Where are you hiding, jerk?

649
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,617
Hello?

650
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:33,663
It's me, Eul.
Have you found Jun-young yet?

651
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,665
No, not yet.

652
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:39,502
I think something bad happened.

653
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:47,135
If we don't find him today,
we're planning to report it to the police.

654
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:50,972
Jun-young...

655
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,799
How can you sleep right now?

656
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,635
How can you sleep
when everyone is worried sick?

657
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,055
Are you filming a movie?

658
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,016
You're an actor to the bone.

659
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,520
I'm so stupid.

660
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:42,649
I can't believe what I did for you. Why
was I even worried about a jerk like you?

661
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,401
I took a taxi here all the way from Seoul.

662
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,446
I waited in the freezing cold for a boat.

663
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,573
I also got bitten by a seagull.

664
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,118
Gosh, my money.

665
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,122
I could've fed Jik meat for days
with that money.

666
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,099
Do you think this is a dream?

667
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,894
It's not. I really am Eul.

668
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,106
I came all the way here to find you.

669
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,569
You really do think it's a dream,
don't you?

670
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,864
It's me, Eul.

671
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,535
Unbelievable.

672
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,246
I should pinch you awake.

673
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,213
Go.

674
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,257
What?

675
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,758
Go away.

676
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,596
-What?
-Get out of my sight.

677
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,652
Didn't I tell you?
I act crazy when I'm drunk.

678
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,196
Gosh, I really do want to apologize.

679
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,448
Hit me until you feel better. Here.

680
00:58:55,532 --> 00:59:00,036
If I ever drink again,
I'm a real lunatic. A lunatic.

681
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:01,788
A brainstem glioma?

682
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:04,582
Apparently, it's in a bad location
so it's hard to operate.

683
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:06,960
I heard you saw that picture.

684
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:10,588
I heard that a Christmas rose means this.
"I have nothing to give you."

685
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:11,965
I'll make sure you regret it.

686
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:18,388
If Jun-young wasn't joking
and was telling the truth...

687
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,683
If he really likes me, what should I do?

688
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,687
I'm not letting her go.

689
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,982
I plan on keeping her.

690
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,651
Stop it, Jun-young.
