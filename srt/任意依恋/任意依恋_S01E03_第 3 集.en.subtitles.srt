1
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,600
Eul. No Eul.

2
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:52,862
Who are you?

3
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,657
Don't you recognize me?
I'm Jun-young's manager.

4
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,991
Right.

5
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,455
Why

6
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,542
am I here?

7
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,670
That's what I want to ask you.

8
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,839
I was on a blind date

9
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,342
when Jun-young called me
to run over here immediately.

10
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,969
He said he'd fire me if I didn't come.

11
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,596
And when I got here, you were lying here.

12
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,724
Where is Jun-young?

13
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,772
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

14
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,607
You're here.

15
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,239
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, YU-NA
FROM JUN-YOUNG

16
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,875
Tell him to come in person
to wish me a happy birthday.

17
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,168
Tell him to bring
the flowers himself, too.

18
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,464
You know that Jun-young doesn't party.

19
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,133
Look! It's Sin Jun-young.

20
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,094
-It's Sin Jun-young.
-He's here.

21
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,513
-Wow, this is awesome.
-He came.

22
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,851
Jun-young.

23
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,437
-Look at him.
-It's Sin Jun-young.

24
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,614
I'm sorry for being late. Happy birthday.

25
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,408
If you're really sorry, sing me a song.

26
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,453
I want to hear you sing a song
for my birthday.

27
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,558
Born in winter

28
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:51,981
You are so beautiful

29
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:59,072
You are as pure as snow

30
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,912
You belong to me

31
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,918
Born in winter

32
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:18,675
You are so lovely

33
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,556
You are as clear as snow

34
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,897
You belong to me

35
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,906
But even in the spring...

36
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,200
If she dies, I'll kill you!

37
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,620
Our country is a mess

38
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,455
because jerks like you
want to be prosecutors.

39
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,166
I know that you are probably

40
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,295
very annoyed with me,
but I'm desperate too.

41
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,049
Did you change your mind?

42
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,511
-Is that why you're back?
-Don't you recognize me?

43
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,805
Do you not recognize me?

44
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,599
I do.

45
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,643
You jerk.

46
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,689
Thanks for this.

47
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,649
It'll come in handy.

48
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,414
-What?
-Why did he stop?

49
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,499
-What is it?
-What happened?

50
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,793
-What was that?
-What's going on?

51
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,046
Why did he stop?

52
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,928
Jun-young.

53
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,265
What was that? What happened?

54
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,100
I'm sorry. I'll buy you dinner next time.

55
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,852
Let me go with you.

56
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,274
I want to be with you tonight, Jun-young.

57
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,692
Let's leave together.

58
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,948
I did nothing with you
that I have responsibility for.

59
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,659
And I never led you on.

60
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,995
-Jun-young.
-Don't overreact.

61
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,914
Yu-na.

62
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:18,211
You are nothing but a colleague to me.

63
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,963
Why did you come to my party, then?

64
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,012
My head was about to burst
because of a certain girl.

65
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,681
I thought this party would distract me.

66
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,599
But...

67
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,769
I was wrong.

68
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,109
My goodness.

69
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,736
You can't leave like this.
You aren't well yet.

70
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,987
It's okay. I'm fine.

71
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,031
You're not okay.

72
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:51,202
You're trying to sue Jun-young
after leaving, right?

73
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,830
You really think I'd stoop that low, sir?

74
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,124
Don't call me "sir." I'm not that old.

75
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,254
Don't post anything on social media

76
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,548
about what happened with Jun-young.

77
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,800
Instead, take this money.

78
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,593
You like money, right?

79
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,013
You got fired from your last job
for taking bribes.

80
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,854
People are watching. Don't do that here.

81
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:18,938
This isn't a bribe.

82
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,066
You gave me this to get lost, right?

83
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,069
My goodness, you don't even look that old.

84
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,530
How can you be so bold and blunt?

85
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,782
It's 950,000 won.

86
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,619
You wanted to give me one milion won,
didn't you? You took 50,000 won out.

87
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,580
No, it's...

88
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,832
Do you really think I'd do that?

89
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,500
It's not like that.

90
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,128
I'm telling you, I didn't.

91
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,716
Do you know what "impudence" is?

92
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,552
Of course. That's my nickname.

93
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,724
Have you ever thought
of how impudent you are?

94
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,019
You got your money,
and now you even want a ride.

95
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,397
It's not easy to live such a bold life.

96
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,734
That's my drink.

97
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,235
How can you

98
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,198
just drink like that without even
asking if you can have a sip?

99
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,116
You were going to throw it out anyway.

100
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,660
It's already flat. It tastes awful.

101
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,912
I wasn't going to throw it out.

102
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,788
I was going to drink it.

103
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,833
You can either buy me a new one,
or spit it back out.

104
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,256
Wow, you're one of a kind.

105
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,051
I lose. You win.

106
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,151
What are you doing?
Why are you taking my stuff?

107
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,488
Then hurry up and pay us back.

108
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,073
I'm doing the best I can.

109
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,992
How will you pay everything back
at this rate?

110
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,411
We'll probably die
before you pay it all back.

111
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,333
Take this and give me my computer.

112
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,418
My brother can't take online classes--

113
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,300
We just took your deposit
from your landlord.

114
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,806
-Who said you could do that?
-I did.

115
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,266
Then what about us?

116
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,976
Where will my brother and I live?

117
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,352
Why are you asking me?

118
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,355
You can't do this all of a sudden!

119
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,607
Hey, you shouldn't have
borrowed money, then.

120
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,192
Next time, I won't leave like this.

121
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,403
I'll bring the paper that says you gave up

122
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,030
-the rights to your body.
-Sure, go ahead.

123
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,199
You can just kill me.

124
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,912
Who are you? Are you her friend?

125
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,082
No, I saw her for the first time today.

126
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,166
Right?

127
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,086
Goodbye, then. Take care.

128
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,708
How can you ignore your son
who's sleeping out here?

129
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,627
I don't know what you're talking about.

130
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,047
My son died five years ago.

131
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,468
-Mom.
-My son died a long time ago, I said.

132
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,928
I'm not your mom.

133
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,265
Hang out with me, Mom.

134
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,398
Hang out with me.

135
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,359
Young man.

136
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,862
-Are you ill?
-Yes, I am.

137
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,281
So come hang out with me.

138
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,662
Mom.

139
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,459
Guk-yeong, where are you?

140
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,754
Please come
and take this fool away from me.

141
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,674
You'll see who it is once you get here.

142
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,185
I CAN PASS THE BAR EXAM
WHILE I'M IN SCHOOL

143
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,272
What a fool.

144
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,359
My goodness. Why did you visit your mom?

145
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,196
Did you think she would welcome you
with open arms?

146
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,783
I just did.
I needed to get my mind off things.

147
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,411
What?

148
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,791
My mom is the one
who makes me think the most.

149
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,919
So did you go
and make your mom feel frustrated

150
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,672
just to get your mind off things?

151
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:43,471
Hey, that crazy girl drank that
and spat it back in there.

152
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,309
Did you just swallow it?

153
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,394
You have a strong stomach.

154
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,146
Then do you want me
to throw up in the car?

155
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,814
Stop talking nonsense.

156
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,524
By the way,

157
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:00,112
it looked like that crazy girl
had a miserable life.

158
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,492
I'm going to sleep, so be quiet and drive.

159
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,493
I'm just saying,

160
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,120
I really didn't like her at first, either.

161
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,040
But I understood her
after I saw the way she lived.

162
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,542
I understood why she had to be like that.

163
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,629
A while ago, these loan sharks came,
threatened her,

164
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,881
and they even took away
the deposit from her house.

165
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:25,471
Can't you just film the documentary
for her sake?

166
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:30,142
It's not like you'll lose anything
from filming that.

167
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,561
Just do it to save her life.

168
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:41,070
It looked like she was going to
a bridge on Han River.

169
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,407
What if she jumped in and died already?

170
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,618
Why don't you search for online articles?

171
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,871
I told you, I want to sleep.

172
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,290
I told you to be quiet!

173
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,930
-Get off.
-Fine.

174
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,224
-I'll be quiet.
-Get off!

175
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,479
Hey, this isn't your car.

176
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,690
It's my car.

177
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:25,739
You are really cruel. Do you know that?

178
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,325
You're an awful man.

179
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,410
Darn it!

180
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,123
Hey, I need my wallet!

181
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,624
Give me my wallet!

182
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,085
Hey, it's me.

183
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,714
Yes. Let's grab a drink.

184
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,301
Where are you?

185
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,636
Okay.

186
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,056
I'll be there in ten minutes.

187
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:53,934
See you soon.

188
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,944
I really didn't like her at first, either.

189
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,947
But I understood her
after I saw the way she lived.

190
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,117
I understood why she had to be like that.

191
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:14,163
A while ago, these loan sharks came,
threatened her,

192
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,874
and they even took away
the deposit from her house.

193
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:25,132
It looked like she was going
to a bridge on Han River.

194
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,385
What if she jumped in and died already?

195
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,013
Why don't you search for online articles?

196
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,061
Hey!

197
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,738
No Eul, are you insane?

198
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,283
Aren't you Sin Jun-young?

199
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,328
Hey, I'm a huge fan of yours.

200
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,248
Hey, wait. Can you take a picture with me?

201
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,459
Hey, where are you going?
Please, just one picture.

202
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,303
What? A bridge?

203
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,349
I'm a fool for believing Guk-yeong.

204
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,241
MY NUMBER ONE TREASURE

205
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,624
Hello. How may I help you?

206
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,378
Eul?

207
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,095
Have you eaten?

208
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,721
I'm eating right now.

209
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,724
What are you eating?

210
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,476
Meat.

211
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,188
Stop lying.

212
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,982
You're eating bread again, aren't you?

213
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,194
You're a student,
so you should stay healthy.

214
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,238
Why aren't you eating rice?

215
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:40,369
Other kids take wild ginseng,
herbal medicine and more.

216
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,080
You need to at least eat some rice.

217
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,874
My gosh, you're nagging again.

218
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,544
I'm really eating meat.

219
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,170
Then show me.

220
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,302
MY NUMBER ONE TREASURE

221
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,556
I knew it.

222
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,559
He's not picking up the video call.

223
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,812
My goodness.

224
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,356
He's really eating meat.

225
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,900
Hey.

226
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:16,029
Have you been eating all right?
My goodness.

227
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,872
-Are we good?
-You should've asked him

228
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,748
to buy you beef, not pork.

229
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,417
It's not like he owes us anything.

230
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,002
Don't be so cheap.

231
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,045
He's already low on money.

232
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,923
I have enough to buy you two a meal.

233
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,136
Eul, I'll take care of Jik's meals,

234
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,346
so make sure you eat too, okay?

235
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,848
Thanks, Hyeon-u.

236
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:47,311
He'll say it's fine,
but buy him more than one serving.

237
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,397
Jik loves meat, so buy him

238
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,275
-a lot of--
-Are we beggars?

239
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,404
-Jik.
-I know things aren't great,

240
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:01,074
but can you at least keep
a little bit of pride?

241
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,367
You're embarrassing.

242
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,998
-What was that?
-It's hard to believe,

243
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,669
but my sister
really wasn't like this before.

244
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,339
She had her pride.

245
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,760
She was really cool and awesome, you know.

246
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,849
Eul is still cool, awesome

247
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,060
and pretty.

248
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,520
What about as a woman?

249
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,607
She's a pretty woman.

250
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,609
Is she really pretty?

251
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,863
Yes, she is. Have some.

252
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,950
Excuse me, can we have another serving?

253
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,870
In that case, I want two more servings

254
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,580
as your brother-in-law.

255
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,635
Were you doing something bad?
You look surprised.

256
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,347
Candidate number two.

257
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,601
"Hypocrite."

258
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,437
"You're despicable."

259
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,522
"A devil that pretends to be an angel."

260
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,152
Did another candidate make you do this?

261
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,743
"I will take off your disgusting mask."

262
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,244
"Die, you jerk."

263
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,066
Have you eaten?

264
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,319
I haven't.

265
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,629
It's been four years, right?

266
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,215
When did you come to Seoul?

267
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,427
LAW DICTIONARY

268
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,058
I got into law school.

269
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,685
I also passed the preliminary bar exam
two days ago.

270
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,899
This is all your fault.

271
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,026
I couldn't do anything
but study without you around.

272
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,029
It's your fault if I become a prosecutor.

273
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,246
Where are you going?

274
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:35,956
To the restroom.

275
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,649
The restroom is not that way.

276
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,818
Don't run away, you criminal.

277
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,825
Give me your ID.

278
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,369
Why do you need my ID?

279
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,122
What if you run away?
It's not your first time.

280
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,503
-Stop going through my bag.
-Wait.

281
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,880
Here it is.

282
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,424
No Eul.

283
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,594
Give me back my wallet.

284
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,970
You're a thief.

285
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,305
Oh, my!

286
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,432
I'll call the police
if you don't give it to me.

287
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,478
ID CARD: NO EUL

288
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,479
No Eul.

289
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,149
Nice picture.

290
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,321
Hello? Is this the police?

291
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,115
Public Official Election Act,
Article 240, Clause 1.

292
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,743
"Anyone who damages
election posters will be

293
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,871
sentenced up to two years
or a fine of four million won."

294
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,999
Tell that to the person who picked up.

295
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,501
Tell him that you just broke that law

296
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,463
and that you have a witness, too.

297
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,340
Should I say it?

298
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:15,055
Hello? Why, hello.
My name is Sin Jun-young.

299
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,098
Yes, I'd like to file a report.

300
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,984
What do you want me to do?

301
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,115
What do you want?

302
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,870
I will let you off with what you did

303
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,916
if you be my girlfriend.

304
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,325
Why aren't you going in?

305
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,576
You said you'll turn yourself in.

306
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,955
You said you'd rather

307
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,999
go to jail than become my girlfriend.

308
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,836
May I help you?

309
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,464
It's nothing. You can go.

310
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,980
You're not really asking me
to go out with you, right?

311
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,693
You just want me to pretend
to be your girlfriend, right?

312
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,155
You said that all you need is

313
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,574
for me to get rid of the girls

314
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,286
that are following you around, right?

315
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,746
Forget it. You just upset me.

316
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,706
You can just go to jail.

317
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,800
How can your love change?

318
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,261
You're driving me insane.

319
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,222
What are you talking about?
I never loved you.

320
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,892
We watched a movie
and had dinner together.

321
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,853
I only did that because you said

322
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,271
you'd lend me money if I did.

323
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,024
-What?
-To be honest,

324
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,818
do you even think we look good together?

325
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,945
Yes.

326
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,823
I think we do.

327
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:40,867
Totally.

328
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,202
Really?

329
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,330
You've never dated anyone, have you?

330
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,373
I have.

331
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,708
I once dated a guy
who looked like Jo In-sung.

332
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,544
And people used to say
I looked like Son Ye-jin.

333
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,797
-Stop lying.
-I'm not lying.

334
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,633
-You're lying right now.
-I'm not lying.

335
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,676
Do you think I'm stupid?

336
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,971
-Stop lying.
-She's not lying.

337
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,434
Jun-young.

338
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,273
We used to date.

339
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,150
We were very passionate.

340
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,825
How sad is this?

341
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,369
If I'd known

342
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,288
you'd become so glamorous,

343
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,375
I would never have let you go.

344
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:41,594
People say that I grew up very ugly.

345
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,139
Do you think so?

346
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,434
Well...

347
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,102
I'm not sure.

348
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:56,693
I did become a little sexy,
but don't I look the same?

349
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,157
I think you're right.

350
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,120
Didn't it look like that guy
was interested in me

351
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:10,081
once he heard that we used to date?

352
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,880
By the way, when did Eul come to Seoul?

353
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,131
Did you meet her?

354
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,966
Yes. She was working for an election camp.

355
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,134
Does she do that now?

356
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,845
She hasn't got any choices to make.

357
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,931
She'll do anything for money.

358
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,560
What about college?

359
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,812
She can't go to college.

360
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,649
She has to look after her brother
and make a living.

361
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,363
Why?

362
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,034
Are you trying to be mean to her again

363
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,327
like you were in high school?

364
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,496
Don't do that.

365
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:55,460
She already has a million people
coming after her.

366
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,422
They're always on her back
and bothering her.

367
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,341
So just leave her alone.

368
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,219
Don't bother her, okay?

369
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,445
Gosh...

370
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,929
Dear beloved citizens,

371
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,932
Candidate Choi Hyeon-jun is

372
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,101
the most trustworthy,

373
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:57,272
righteous, and honest candidate,
and he's a man of dignity.

374
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,439
-Yes!
-Let's go!

375
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,692
-All right!
-Go!

376
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,028
As you all know,

377
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,822
he also gave

378
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,701
one of his kidneys for his sick wife.

379
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:14,205
He is the most romantic
and devoted husband.

380
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,585
-Choi Hyeon-jun is the best!
-Yes!

381
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,254
As you can see from these stories,

382
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:25,800
he is someone who
will love his country and people,

383
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,429
and he's someone
who will work hard for his country.

384
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:42,609
-Choi Hyeon-jun!
-Choi Hyeon-jun!

385
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,152
-Are you okay?
-Choi Hyeon-jun!

386
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,070
-I'm fine.
-Are you hurt?

387
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,280
-Choi Hyeon-jun!
-Choi Hyeon-jun!

388
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,781
You don't look okay.

389
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,617
I'll get some medicine. Will you wait?

390
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,951
It's okay, I'm fine.

391
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,786
You should look at where you're going.

392
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,829
Ha-ru.

393
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,165
I'm sorry for startling you.

394
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,750
Are you really okay?

395
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,251
Yes, of course.

396
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,887
It's your fault, too.
You should've been more careful.

397
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,722
He's so handsome.

398
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,726
Ji-tae, I want to marry him.

399
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,397
Ji-tae.

400
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,029
-It's Jeong-eun.
-Are you Ha-ru?

401
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,616
You became such a lady, Ha-ru.

402
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,701
I thought you were in New York.

403
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,287
I came back yesterday
to help with your dad's election.

404
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,374
My dad said I should take this chance
to win his favor.

405
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:44,754
-Choi Hyeon-jun!
-Choi Hyeon-jun!

406
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,840
-Choi Hyeon-jun!
-Choi Hyeon-jun!

407
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,467
When will you propose to me?

408
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,428
It looks like our parents
are talking about it.

409
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,556
My goodness.

410
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,850
Are you marrying Jeong-eun?

411
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,730
It looks like the victim's daughter

412
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,608
remembers Jeong-eun's
license plate number.

413
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,277
So what? Are you going to let

414
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,532
Jeong-eun's life end here as a criminal?

415
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,951
There are three witnesses.

416
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:18,496
That's why I ran over to you
like an insane person.

417
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,708
If I fall,

418
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,169
it won't be so great for you, either.

419
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,381
Your in-law's company

420
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,801
would've gone down already
if it wasn't for me.

421
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,387
I know.

422
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,682
My wife and I are always grateful.

423
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,476
I don't need your grateful heart.

424
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,479
Humans are different from animals

425
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,108
because they know when to return a favor.

426
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,112
Am I wrong?

427
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,472
SENIOR PROSECUTOR CHOI HYEON-JUN
REVEAL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE REAL CRIMINAL

428
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,363
He'll work to make a just society.

429
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,074
Vote for candidate number two,
Jo Mun-seok!

430
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,701
Vote for candidate number two.
We'll work hard.

431
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,953
-Vote for number two. We'll work hard.
-Jo Mun-seok!

432
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,872
-Vote for number two.
-Vote for number two.

433
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,499
-Vote for number two.
-Vote for number two.

434
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,751
-We'll work hard. Candidate number...
-Hello.

435
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:51,798
It's okay. I'm going to vote
for Choi Hyeon-jun.

436
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,885
-Vote for number two.
-Vote for number two.

437
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,637
-Hello, vote for us.
-Vote for number two.

438
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,639
We'll work hard.
Please vote for candidate number two.

439
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,641
-Hello.
-Vote for candidate number one.

440
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,395
We'll work to make a righteous society.

441
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,523
Vote for candidate number one,
Choi Hyeon-jun.

442
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,775
You can trust him. Vote for number one.

443
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:14,612
-Hello, vote for number one.
-Please vote for us.

444
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,823
Hello, vote for number one.

445
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,741
Are you looking at me?

446
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,619
-Why?
-Please vote for number one.

447
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,372
-Please vote for number two.
-Please vote for us.

448
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,332
-Vote for number one.
-What is she saying?

449
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,377
-Vote for number one.
-I'll do my best.

450
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,213
-Vote for number one.
-Please vote.

451
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,842
Your fake eyelash fell off.

452
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,678
-I see.
-Hello.

453
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,432
And don't work too hard.
Number one is a bad guy.

454
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,560
Excuse me?

455
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,270
-Candidate number one!
-Candidate number one!

456
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,729
JERK

457
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,470
Tell me what the problem is.

458
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,556
Whatever the problem is,

459
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,976
I will make sure to fix it. So tell me.

460
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:35,276
Your eyes, nose, mouth, ears,

461
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,529
voice, height, personality and blood type.

462
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,407
Fine. I will fix everything.

463
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,202
Can we really start dating when I do?

464
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,286
I have a girlfriend.

465
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,330
She's a real feisty one.

466
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,666
You'll probably get buried alive
for hitting on me.

467
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,127
You don't have a girlfriend.

468
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,921
I'm his girlfriend.

469
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:03,638
Honey, are your classes over?

470
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,275
You're so handsome.

471
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,403
It's only been 12 hours

472
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:23,491
since I last saw you,
but I missed you so much.

473
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,209
I missed you
a hundred times more than you did.

474
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,468
I missed you so much

475
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,595
that my eyes melted down.

476
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,186
Eyes.

477
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:54,981
Nose.

478
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,526
Mouth.

479
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,779
Ears.

480
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,323
How can you be so perfect?

481
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,826
There's nothing I'd change about you.

482
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,954
Hey!

483
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,552
Hey, you should be careful.

484
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,929
Jun-young is mine.

485
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,640
If you hit on him ever again,

486
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,143
you'll have your next meal
in your next life.

487
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,229
Do you get it?

488
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,274
Do you?

489
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,902
I must be crazy.

490
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,572
This is insane.

491
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,620
I'm crazy.

492
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,581
Who's crazy?

493
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,917
Me. I'm the crazy girl.

494
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,546
What am I doing with a psycho like you?

495
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,174
You shouldn't have
committed a crime, then.

496
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,555
I think I did enough for the day.
I'm going home.

497
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,349
I couldn't sleep because I had to study.

498
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,059
Give me ten minutes so I can take a nap.

499
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,185
No way.

500
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,395
From the remaining nine times,
I'll take out two.

501
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,733
In that case, make it three.

502
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,319
Count this as three.

503
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,653
Okay.

504
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:31,035
I did well today, so make it four.

505
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,996
-Take out four today.
-Are you kidding me?

506
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,589
Time's up.

507
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,800
Jun-young.

508
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,469
Has it been ten minutes?

509
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,560
Why are you laughing?

510
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,062
Hey.

511
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:07,983
I suddenly wanted to call Na-ri
and tell her this.

512
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,319
Na-ri.

513
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,781
I can't keep that promise I made.

514
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:18,452
I will keep being mean to Eul.

515
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,913
I will keep making fun of her.

516
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,831
I will bother her.

517
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,962
If that's what it takes to keep
seeing her, I will do that.

518
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,777
-Choi Hyeon-jun!
-Choi Hyeon-jun!

519
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,029
Thank you very much. Let's go in.

520
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,824
-Let's go in.
-Oh, my.

521
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:00,786
Come in, everyone. Come in.

522
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,584
Thanks to all your help,

523
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,461
the election campaign ended well today.

524
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,047
You all did so well.

525
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:16,635
Eat as much as you want, and sleep well.

526
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,262
Thank you very much.

527
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,474
Also, I'd like to thank

528
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:27,688
someone for finding
this amazing yukgaejang place.

529
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,149
Where is she?

530
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,819
I'd like to thank Ms. Jang Jeong-ja.

531
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:40,909
The other menus here are great, too.
Help yourselves.

532
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:45,914
-Choi Hyeon-jun!
-Choi Hyeon-jun!

533
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,253
-Please, eat up.
-Thank you.

534
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,945
Mom.

535
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,240
-What are you doing here?
-What?

536
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,119
Well...

537
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,789
My stomach hurts. Gosh, my stomach.

538
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,708
You should go to a hospital, then.
Why are you here like this?

539
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,377
Be quiet.

540
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,673
I'll be okay.

541
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,008
You should go and study.

542
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,515
Let's go to the hospital. Get on my back.

543
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,142
That's unnecessary. I'll be fine.

544
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,311
You're not a doctor. Let's go!

545
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,818
Eat up.

546
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,904
What are you doing?
Go and make yukgaejang.

547
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,322
Come here.

548
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,866
Come over here.

549
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,246
My goodness.

550
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,915
Are you insane?

551
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:14,503
You should be keeping him
away from this place.

552
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,796
How can you drag him here?

553
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,131
I did it on purpose.

554
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,091
I wanted him to meet
Yeong-ok and Jun-young.

555
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,552
Jun-young grew up so well.

556
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,054
It's time that he met his father.

557
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,682
Who are you to decide that?

558
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,892
Why are you meddling in their business?

559
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,477
Think about how startled
Yeong-ok would be.

560
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:34,731
If she has a heart attack,
you'll die in my hands.

561
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,025
What are you saying?

562
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,611
Is Yeong-ok more precious
than your twin sister?

563
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,156
If she's so precious to you,
why don't you ask her out?

564
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,451
"Yeong-ok, forget about Hyeon-jun
and live with me."

565
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,952
You should've said that like a man.

566
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,831
You fool. I'm going to kill you.

567
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:54,001
How dare you speak of
my precious Yeong-ok like that?

568
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,462
Your precious Yeong-ok?

569
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,006
Are you...

570
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,300
What?

571
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,471
-Eat up.
-This way, please.

572
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,348
Excuse me, young man.

573
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,058
Wait a second.

574
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,562
I think we've met before.

575
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,105
Yes, I think so, too.

576
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,737
-Who's that?
-My mother is ill.

577
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,239
Oh, no. You should hurry.

578
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,201
Right.

579
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,037
My car is out in the front. If you need...

580
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,663
No, thanks. It's all right.

581
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,835
Who is that?

582
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,588
He helped me out once.

583
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:43,258
He said he'd come visit me
when he passes the bar exam.

584
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,844
It looks like his life isn't easy.

585
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,017
Lift your head up, Mom.

586
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:00,108
Mr. Choi isn't here,
so you can lift your head up.

587
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,988
I went to meet

588
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,451
Prosecutor Choi Hyeon-jun a long time ago.

589
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,080
I told him that

590
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,832
I'd come back to visit him

591
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,835
once I pass my bar exam.

592
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,091
I will let you boast about me to him

593
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,301
before this life is over, okay?

594
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,515
"I

595
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,519
raised your son

596
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:40,190
to become a great man like you
without any of your help."

597
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,153
I'll let you say that.

598
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,030
Okay.

599
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,078
When something like this

600
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,751
happens again in your next life,
don't run away.

601
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:05,716
There are no barriers to love.

602
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,178
That's so old and tacky.

603
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,287
Get in.

604
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,216
What is this?

605
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,053
Choi Hyeon-jun.

606
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,138
This is the real side of that hypocrite.

607
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,931
How did you tape this?

608
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,144
I saw him while I was working as a driver.

609
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,397
I heard he was crazy for that bar hostess,

610
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,983
so I hid with this camera.

611
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,530
What will you do with it?

612
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,159
He's not someone you can fight.

613
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,744
You'll get hurt.

614
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:21,083
Still, I'm my father's daughter.

615
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,544
I must do anything and everything.

616
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:29,299
If I run away,
no one will find out the truth.

617
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,224
JERK

618
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,019
Your call cannot be connected.

619
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:44,523
No Eul.

620
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,567
I will take two off
if you come here right now.

621
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,697
I'm in a really bad mood,
so come hang out with me.

622
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,498
NO EUL

623
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,336
Your call cannot be connected.

624
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,422
Please call again later.

625
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:13,009
Did she block me?

626
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:25,856
ID CARD: NO EUL

627
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,447
SILLIM-RO 38 DA-GIL 20

628
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,096
I, CHOI HYEON-JUN,
WILL BUILD A JUST SOCIETY

629
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,092
Yes, this is Choi Hyeon-jun.

630
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,595
My name is No Eul.

631
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,264
I don't know if you remember,

632
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,017
but I am the daughter of
No Jang-su, who died

633
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,644
in a hit-and-run accident five years ago.

634
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:49,439
Who?

635
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:53,151
I'm sorry, but I don't remember.

636
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,196
You don't?

637
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,406
I'm sorry, but I'll hang up.

638
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,575
April 10th and May 5th of 2009.

639
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,870
March 4th, April 10th
and May 15th of 2010.

640
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,373
You're probably too dumb to remember,

641
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:10,418
but that's when you went to meet
Madam Song at the bar.

642
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,799
Who is it?

643
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:19,386
You even went to that hostess bar
a week after

644
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,096
your wife had her kidney transplant.

645
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,433
The most devoted husband? No way.

646
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,145
Stop deceiving innocent citizens

647
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,564
and resign from the election.

648
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,650
If a scumbag like you
becomes a congressman,

649
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:36,152
this country will be doomed.

650
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,280
If you apologize

651
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,784
and admit to your faults,
I will stop right here.

652
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,497
If you reveal the real criminal
for my dad's case,

653
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,791
which you manipulated,

654
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,752
I will burn all the data I have.

655
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,882
Do whatever you want.

656
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,593
I don't know who's behind you,

657
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:03,430
but this kind of threat won't work on me.

658
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,392
Who was it?

659
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,436
It's nothing.

660
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:13,899
I think the other candidate
is trying to threaten me.

661
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,511
Hello?

662
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,598
Can you connect me to KBC Broadcast?

663
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,473
Hey!

664
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,183
Give it back to me!

665
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,685
Hey, stop right there!

666
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,520
Hey, stop!

667
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,682
Eul!

668
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,852
Eul, you can't die!

669
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,605
-Calm down!
-Eul!

670
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,959
When I was young, my mom took me to church

671
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,754
and prayed a hundred prayers

672
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,048
to God.

673
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,050
And she asked me

674
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,719
to say my prayers,

675
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,138
saying that God will be listening.

676
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,431
Her pressure is dropping.

677
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,642
But I replied by saying
there is no such thing

678
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:37,936
and refused to pray.

679
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,119
I am sorry.

680
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,747
I will believe that you exist.

681
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,167
So

682
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:04,420
please let Eul live.

683
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,098
If you let her live,

684
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,436
I will give up

685
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,480
all of my happiness.

686
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:24,983
Her vitals are unstable.

687
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,651
Prepare for CPR.

688
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:30,029
If you let her live,

689
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,783
I will give up

690
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,953
the rest of my life.

691
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,124
You can take me

692
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:44,752
and let

693
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:48,965
Eul live.

694
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,557
Is life so meaningless to you?

695
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,893
Is it so easy for you to die?

696
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,357
Let's film that documentary.

697
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,943
I'll do it, you crazy fool!

698
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,781
Let's do this, Eul.

699
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,868
Seeing you again

700
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,497
will be more painful than revealing a scar

701
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:24,000
that I wanted to hide
and stabbing it again,

702
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,920
but let's try this

703
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,589
and see what will happen.

704
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,827
I think you misdiagnosed me.

705
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,121
She's trying so hard to gain your favor.

706
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,165
Are you telling me to seduce Jun-young?

707
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,833
I'm going there for work.

708
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,045
Let's call off the documentary.

709
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:11,506
Let's skip the engagement ceremony
and get married right away.

710
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:12,966
You don't even love me.

711
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,968
If he does that again,

712
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:18,846
Ms. No will go crazy
and try to kill him for sure.

713
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,348
Is fainting your hobby?

00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:21,891
-What do you want?
-A hundred million won.

715
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,059
That's all you need?

716
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,602
I can give you a billion won if you want.

717
