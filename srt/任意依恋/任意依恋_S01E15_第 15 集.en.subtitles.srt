1
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,928
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry?

2
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,680
For what?

3
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,849
How sorry are you?

4
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,395
How dare you...

5
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,772
How dare someone like you...

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:27,277
You don't even deserve my jealousy!

7
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,405
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,282
I really am.

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,453
I didn't mean to hurt you.

10
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,787
I'm really--

11
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,958
If you're that sorry, just die.

12
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:46,713
If you feel that bad,
go kill yourself right now.

13
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,090
Take your own life so that Ji-tae

14
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,176
can't go back to you!

15
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,193
Jun-young.

16
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,029
I had a dream last night.

17
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,078
And in that dream,

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,376
I met you.

19
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,971
Unfortunately,
I met you in the most miserable,

20
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,556
most embarrassing

21
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,475
and most awful moment of my life.

22
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,981
The doors are closing.

23
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,273
Did your coat eat all of your food?

24
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,193
What an awful coat.

25
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,575
You must be hungry.

26
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,036
I knew it was only a dream,

27
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,997
but I was still excited

28
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,915
and my heart fluttered.

29
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,752
And your hand was unbelievably warm.

30
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,011
You're hungry, aren't you?

31
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,513
Try it.

32
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,934
It may look awful, but it'll taste good.

33
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,978
I'm serious.

34
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,522
Come on.

35
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,406
Don't eat it.

36
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,037
I'm serious. Don't eat it.

37
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,667
You might die from eating that.

38
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,216
It's the first meal
you've ever cooked for me.

39
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,759
How could I not eat it?

40
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,305
I knew it was a dream,

41
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,599
and it really tasted awful, but still.

42
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,187
Do you have kimchi?

43
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,147
Of course I do.

44
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,139
You won't know how desolate,

45
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,808
lonely and empty it feels

46
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,269
to be in a dream

47
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,980
when you already know it's a dream.

48
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,495
My goodness.

49
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,291
I think I have a cold.

50
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,625
Stop it.

51
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,294
-It's because of my cold.
-I said, stop it.

52
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,253
Hey.

53
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,264
Come here.

54
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:49,932
Come over here.

55
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,768
No.

56
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,070
It really hurts.

57
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,404
Are you okay?

58
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,242
Hey!

59
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,963
Morning, don't come.

60
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,049
Please don't come.

61
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,342
Look at the stars...

62
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,030
If anyone dares to wake me up
from this dream,

63
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,450
I'll follow them around forever
and get my revenge.

64
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,927
At least let me feel sorry
and guilty towards you.

65
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,055
-Please.
-I'll make sure I kill her.

66
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,433
-Jeong-eun.
-I'll kill her with

67
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,685
my own two hands.

68
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,312
Do you think I can't do it?

69
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,648
I'll do anything to get you back, Ji-tae.

70
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,360
Wasn't once enough?

71
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,947
-What?
-Because of your immature behavior

72
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,991
and selfishness,
you put someone's life in danger once.

73
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,328
Wasn't that enough?

74
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,624
What are you talking about?

75
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,375
I'm saying you shouldn't

76
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,921
talk so easily about killing someone.

77
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,217
You can't go.

78
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,552
-Jeong-eun.
-You can't go to her.

79
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,180
-Let go.
-It's my birthday today, Ji-tae.

80
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,891
Stay with me.

81
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,059
Let go!

82
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,561
-I can't.
-Just let him go.

83
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,994
Let him go. You can hang out with me.

84
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,623
Tell him to leave

85
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,042
and celebrate your birthday with me.

86
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,855
Eul.

87
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,057
CHOI JI-TAE

88
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,606
This is

89
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,483
to make up for your broken shoes.

90
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,528
And this is to wish you a happy birthday.

91
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,573
Thank you for saving me

92
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,658
-every single time.
-I know.

93
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,120
It's like I'm your guardian angel.

94
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,082
Aren't you going to take
your birthday present?

95
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,459
Why are you doing this to me?

96
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,629
I thought you didn't want to seduce me.

97
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,130
But what you're doing is confusing me.

98
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,841
How did you even know it was my birthday?

99
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,930
If I keep acting like this,

100
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,391
will you fall for me?

101
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,146
Not because you want
to take revenge on Eul

102
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,523
for stealing someone you love.

103
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,985
And not because you want to show Ji-tae

104
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,364
what he's losing out on,
like some childish teenager.

105
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,282
Just purely, with no conditions.

106
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,495
Would you like to get seduced by me?

107
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,289
No, wait.

108
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,668
How about you seduce me instead?

109
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,170
But you like Eul.

110
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,547
That's why I'm asking you to seduce me.

111
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,759
I want to forget everything

112
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,719
about Eul.

113
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,514
I want my head to be filled

114
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,475
only with thoughts about you.

115
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,896
Can you do that?

116
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:06,058
CHOI JI-TAE

117
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,771
Hello?

118
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,106
What are you trying to do?

119
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,941
Why did you approach Jeong-eun?

120
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,693
To help you, Ji-tae.

121
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,781
You want to get rid of that woman,
so I'm trying to help you do that.

122
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,991
Aren't you thankful?

123
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,076
You're really thankful?

124
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,037
It's nothing.
We should help each other out like this.

125
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,874
I should do something good
before I die anyway.

126
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,041
Hey, Jun-young!

127
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,044
If you're that thankful,
buy me a drink later.

128
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,735
Hey, what are you going to do?

129
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,987
They took everything.

130
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,823
You little...

131
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,953
The stuff you threw away.

132
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,706
People took everything.
The clothes, the bags, and the shoes.

133
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,875
They only left these empty bags behind.

134
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,795
Now we can't even sell them
or get a refund.

135
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,963
What are you going to do?

136
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,841
Do you want me to buy them again?

137
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,011
You're still talking nonsense.

138
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,180
Do you even realize what you've done?

139
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,058
We're not talking about
just 1,000 won or 10,000 won.

140
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,268
You threw away ten million won overnight.

141
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,189
I said I'll buy them again for you.
I'm really rich.

142
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,273
You little...

143
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,609
I'm going to tell Jik about this.

144
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,321
I'm going to tell him that
you received a billion won

145
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,739
of dirty money so you could

146
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,699
pay for his college tuition
and education abroad.

147
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,203
Are you trying to cut him out of my life?

148
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,539
Then hurry up and return the money
before he finds out.

149
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,083
Fall into debt if you have to,
but make sure you return

150
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,335
all the money you got
from those evil people.

151
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,631
Who is it?

152
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,138
It's Hyeon-u. No.

153
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,598
It's Ji-tae.

154
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,268
Tell him to go. I don't want to meet him.

155
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,479
Eul just told you to get lost

156
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,817
and that she doesn't want
to ever see you again.

157
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,683
My gosh, what's this?

158
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,191
Hey, you don't have to
give me stuff like this.

159
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,193
Try it.

160
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,695
Should I?

161
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,497
Do I look pretty?

162
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,124
Of course.

163
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,459
Stop what you're doing.

164
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,004
What are you two doing?

165
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,797
-Well...
-Stop right there.

166
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,174
Hey.

167
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,471
I heard this place is run
by Sin Jun-young's mom.

168
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,265
Do you know that he's a womanizer?

169
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,767
Yes, I heard.

170
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,062
I heard he can't sleep
without a woman by his side.

171
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,980
I heard he switches girlfriends
every ten hours.

172
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,815
No, every three hours.

173
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,777
Why do women even like a jerk like him?

174
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,112
-My uncle's a plastic surgeon,
-Don't pay attention to them.

175
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,281
-and he fixed his face.
-You're no longer his manager.

176
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,075
You're the manager of this restaurant.

177
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,368
Just ignore them.

178
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,536
Hey, I heard Sin Jun-young

179
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,914
got taller through plastic surgery.

180
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,999
My brother said he saw him at a hospital.

181
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,709
My goodness, is that right?

182
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,630
I'm his mother
and even I didn't know that.

183
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,841
Did he get plastic surgery
for his entire face

184
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,927
and even his height, too?

185
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,011
Well...

186
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,472
I'll give you some money so that

187
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,599
you can get plastic surgery yourselves.

188
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,018
You can change your ugly face

189
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,854
into a good looking one like Jun-young.

190
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,940
And you can fix your short height

191
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,860
and become tall
through surgery like Jun-young.

192
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,362
You stupid jerks.

193
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,489
How can you talk like that
to your customers?

194
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,116
My gosh. Hurry, take a picture.

195
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,494
Is that really him?
He's better looking in person.

196
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,956
-His mother is the owner of this place.
-Really? Is that true?

197
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,794
You should sue her for offending customers

198
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,379
at her restaurant by filing a report

199
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,965
to the Korea Consumer Agency.

200
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,844
And your uncle, the plastic surgeon...

201
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,887
Can you tell me
which hospital he works at?

202
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,347
Can you?

203
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,350
Can I get plastic surgery
to look like Jun-young?

204
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,687
If what you two said was a lie,

205
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,689
may I sue you both for defamation?

206
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,191
What? We didn't say anything.

207
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,609
"Didn't say anything"?

208
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,528
You guys said
that Jun-young is a womanizer

209
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,321
and that he can't even sleep
without women.

210
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,199
You said he changes girlfriends
every three hours.

211
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,160
Did they say that?

212
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,828
Oh, my God.

213
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:21,832
Did you just stand around
even after hearing that?

214
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,043
You're Sin Jun-young's manager.

215
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,837
Of course not.

216
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,381
I was just about to say something,

217
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,925
but Ms. Sin suddenly came and interrupted.

218
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,427
Stop it.

219
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,681
Also, you shouldn't talk to my customers
like that.

220
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,225
You could've upset these jerks.

221
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,436
Apologize to these jerks right away.

222
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,273
My mom's the only person who cares for me.

223
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,691
From now on,

224
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,235
just stay out of my sight.

225
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,987
You can continue working here forever.

226
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,698
Hey, Jun-young. Wait.

227
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,709
Thank you for the ride.

228
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,171
Mom, can you cure my stomach?

229
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:16,303
I feel like I've been getting indigestion
for the past few days.

230
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,556
I've already taken medicine,
but it didn't help.

231
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,319
Did you lose weight?

232
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,780
Yes.

233
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,408
I felt like I got a bit fat lately,

234
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:39,868
so I'm on a diet.

235
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:44,164
You're insane. How can you think
about going on a diet?

236
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,584
You only have bones and skin!
Why would you go on a diet?

237
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,629
You must be out of your mind to--

238
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,840
If you love me, just say that you do.

239
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,886
-What?
-Stop pretending to be mad at me.

240
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,266
Look at me in my eyes and say,

241
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,269
"Son, how have you been?

242
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,313
Why haven't you visited me more often?

243
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,232
I almost got upset at you."

244
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,234
Tell me the truth like that.

245
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,361
Make it sexy.

246
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,406
You're insane.

247
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,883
If you like her, just show your feelings.

248
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,010
I heard from Guk-yeong

249
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,471
that you've been quite mean to that girl.

250
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,182
Are you a kid or what?

251
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,310
You can't go around bullying
the girl you like.

252
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,312
You'll get sick if you keep doing that.

253
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:52,065
Your stomach is probably upset
because of that, too.

254
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,615
Choi Hyeon-jun is

255
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,244
a stranger to us now.

256
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,665
We won't ever have to see him again.

257
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,090
You don't need to

258
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:21,511
stop doing what you want because of him.

259
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,894
Drive safely.

260
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,493
Thanks, Mom.

261
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,330
Thank you for saying that

262
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,042
Choi Hyeon-jun is

263
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,796
a stranger to us.

264
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,477
It's warm in here.

265
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,772
I thought I'd never be able
to come back here.

266
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,330
Thank you.

267
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,008
Is the documentary going well?

268
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,384
Yes.

269
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,763
Mr. Yoon is really good at his job.

270
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,015
I'm much better, though.

271
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,106
I came to say goodbye.

272
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,911
We've known each other for so long.

273
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,123
I thought we deserved
a proper goodbye, my friend.

274
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,090
And this is

275
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,885
one last thing
I want to ask before I leave.

276
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,141
Why are we breaking up?

277
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,773
Aren't you going to say anything?

278
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:09,823
Okay.

279
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,160
Don't say anything. You can just listen.

280
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,246
I'll say what I want and leave.

281
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,751
No matter how hard I think about this,

282
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,047
I don't think I did anything bad.

283
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,884
I didn't cheat on you.

284
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,553
I didn't gamble.

285
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,602
I think the reason is on you.

286
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,940
Either you don't like me anymore

287
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,902
or you have another woman.

288
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,878
I want compensation

289
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,175
for getting hurt, humiliated
and becoming miserable.

290
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:13,053
Also for wasting my heart,
time and energy.

291
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,180
I want compensation for all of that.

292
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,848
You're rich, aren't you?

293
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:23,688
Ji-tae paid me a billion dollars
to get lost.

294
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,400
I just want ten million won from you.

295
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,736
Just ten million.

296
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,284
I thought about asking you to lend me

297
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,245
that money without interest,

298
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,375
but then we'd have to meet again

299
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,335
for me to pay you back.

300
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,464
So let's just end everything today.

301
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,510
Just give it to me here
so that I'll at least be

302
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,470
too embarrassed to appear before you.

303
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,431
Okay.

304
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,476
Wait here.

305
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,431
SIN JUN-YOUNG

306
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,068
You can write the amount you want.

307
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,072
You can write ten million won,
or a hundred million, or a billion.

308
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,200
You can write as much as you want.

309
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,497
What if I ask for all of your assets?

310
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,415
You can have it all.

311
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,167
Is that what you want?

312
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,503
No thanks.

313
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,380
I'm not a thief.

314
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,800
I'm really going to write ten million won.

315
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,345
Don't report this to the police
as a stolen check.

316
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,267
Can you leave if you're done?
I'm a bit tired.

317
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,604
Okay.

318
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:15,819
Bye.

319
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,408
With this, everything between us is over.

320
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,993
From now on,

321
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,246
you can live comfortably

322
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,956
with nothing to worry about.

323
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,458
You jerk.

324
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,188
I'll remember to pay

325
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,193
for what I've done to you

326
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,947
when I die and go to hell.

327
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,046
KANGWOON LIBRARY

328
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,976
What was that? Are you a pervert?

329
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,663
LOVE, TWO HEARTS
100 QUESTIONS ABOUT LOVE

330
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,999
WHY DID I CHOOSE YOU?
A DICTIONARY OF WOMEN

331
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:19,252
A girl that I like suddenly kissed me.

332
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,462
I was so surprised, so I shouted,

333
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,007
"Are you a pervert?"

334
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,633
Am I abnormal?

335
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,553
By the way, that was the first kiss

336
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,805
I've ever had with a girl.

337
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,058
Yes, you're abnormal.

338
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,435
You're the pervert.

339
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,145
He's crazy.

340
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,105
-Are you a monk?
-Even an idiot like him got kissed.

341
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,815
You called the girl you like a pervert?

342
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,234
-I think you're the pervert.
-You like her, but you said that?

343
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,153
-I think he's making this up.
-He definitely

344
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,988
-made it up.
-It's crazier if it is real.

345
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,990
-Stop giving him attention.
-Congratulations.

346
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,575
-I think he wants attention.
-He's crazy.

347
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,868
I feel sorry for the girl.

348
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,746
HA-RU

349
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,417
DO YOU WANT TO TURN OFF THE DEVICE?

350
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,020
He turned his phone off?
I can't believe this.

351
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,815
He ignores my text,
and now he's even avoiding me.

352
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,443
First, he calls me a pervert,

353
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,153
and now, he's treating me like a stalker.

354
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:29,822
No, wait.

355
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,326
Of course. He could've been surprised.

356
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:38,456
He probably never got kissed
by such a beautiful girl like me.

357
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,249
But still.

358
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,293
It's not like I have a disease.

359
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,087
Why would he avoid me?

360
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,818
Ha-ru, I left your breakfast in your room.

361
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,404
-Why?
-Ms. Lee has a visitor.

362
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,488
This early in the morning?

363
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,490
She says it's an important matter

364
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,742
and that you shouldn't come downstairs.

365
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,537
I don't care about her visitor, either.

366
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,592
I went to your office,

367
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,846
but they told me you're taking a sick day.

368
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,097
What is this?

369
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,391
It's the billion won you gave me.

370
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,768
Are you kidding?

371
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,353
I'm not kidding.

372
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,814
How would someone like me

373
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,775
joke around with someone like you?

374
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,361
It's not like I want my life to end.

375
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,241
Even without this money,

376
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,785
I still won't meet Ji-tae.

377
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,998
I won't try to find out the truth
or get revenge.

378
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:06,002
Even if I die at a young age
because of anger,

379
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,421
I won't say a word until the day I die.

380
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,841
Do you expect me to believe you?

381
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,092
Whether you trust me or not

382
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,553
is up to you.

383
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,851
If there is a divine being,

384
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,853
for once, they may side
with someone like me

385
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,773
who's been falsely accused,
powerless and connectionless,

386
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,817
and may actually punish the evil.

387
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,944
That's what I think.

388
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,948
But then again,
you shouldn't worry about that, either.

389
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,742
It feels like

390
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,162
that divine being
has died a long time ago.

391
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,056
Eul.

392
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,025
I was about to call you.

393
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,696
I just gave back the billion won
I got from your mother.

394
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,281
That's good.

395
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,200
You did the right thing.

396
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,704
-Thank you.
-And I'm never going to

397
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,540
meet you again, Ji-tae.

398
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,459
I'm not going to seek revenge anymore.

399
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,546
You're of no use to me now, Ji-tae.

400
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,233
What did you say? Tell me again.

401
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,361
Ji-tae just called
an emergency board meeting.

402
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,864
An emergency board meeting?

403
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,575
Yes, I think he's planning

404
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,995
to talk about your dismissal
at the next general meeting.

405
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,790
Ji-tae is planning to dismiss me?

406
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,418
That's nonsense.

407
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,545
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

408
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,213
Ms. Jang.

409
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:19,802
Ms. Jang.

410
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,846
Hey, Ji-tae.

411
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,683
Did you prepare the suit
I asked you about?

412
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,102
Of course. It's on your bed.

413
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,353
Thank you.

414
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,459
You didn't even knock.

415
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,878
That's not like you.

416
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,088
I think you're the one

417
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,924
who forgot to knock first.

418
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,930
I would've appreciated it

419
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,391
if you had knocked and told me in advance

420
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,644
before holding an emergency board meeting.

421
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,604
I feel hurt.

422
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,147
Why would you feel hurt?

423
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,067
Mom...

424
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,322
Ma'am, your hopeless
and lax management has

425
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,659
done much damage
to our shareholders and subsidiaries.

426
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,078
I don't think

427
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,163
you should be feeling hurt.

428
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:34,210
"Hopeless and lax management"?

429
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,462
On what grounds are you--

430
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,589
Construction, finance, telecommunication
and entertainment.

431
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,592
Think about the projects you pushed ahead

432
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,263
despite the opposition
of most of the board members.

433
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,475
How were

434
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,187
their results?

435
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,026
They were awful.
The teams were disintegrated,

436
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,779
the person in charge was fired,
subsidiaries stumbled,

437
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,448
stock prices went down
and shareholders lost money.

438
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,994
But the person who was responsible
for everything

439
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,913
is still doing fine right now.

440
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:11,956
So

441
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:16,919
you're going to put your own mother
at the mercy of those people?

442
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,963
What would people think?

443
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,256
They'll think I'm an awful son.

444
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,551
They'll think I'm stealing your place
because of my ambition.

445
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,678
That's how they'll gossip.

446
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:29,223
But once they find out the truth,
they'll also think

447
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,100
that KJ isn't such a corrupt company.

448
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,478
I'm sure some people would cheer me on.

449
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,817
See you at the board meeting.

450
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,654
Why are you doing this to me?

451
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,198
You were such a good son.

452
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,284
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

453
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,618
Is that girl

454
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,787
more important to you
than your own mother?

455
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:52,872
No.

456
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,130
It's not because she's important.

457
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,592
It's because you and Dad are wrong.

458
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,991
I want to talk to my son.

459
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,951
Will you step outside for a while?

460
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,094
Are you finally

461
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,638
confident enough to reveal the truth
in front of everyone?

462
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,474
No.

463
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:57,186
I am not yet confident enough to shout,

464
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,399
"My parents are awful and scary people."

465
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,734
Then what?

466
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,154
You can't change the past,

467
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,198
but I want to stop both of you

468
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,784
from violating and crushing more people

469
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,912
using the power and money you both have.

470
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,957
I want to stop you
before things get worse.

471
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,502
Okay.

472
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,630
That's a very grand thought.

473
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:35,558
You can try as much as you can

474
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,101
to stop us.

475
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,354
I will root for you

476
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,149
and hope you'll win this fight.

477
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,539
Do you have an aspirin?

478
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,166
I'll get it for you right away, sir.

479
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,630
I looked into Sin Jun-young's family,
as you requested last time.

480
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,925
He has no father.
He's registered under his mom's name.

481
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,722
-He doesn't have a father?
-No.

482
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,852
That's why his last name is his mother's.

483
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,313
He's registered under his mom's name.

484
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,609
She said she was married
and had a husband.

485
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,986
There aren't any legal records
of her marriage.

486
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,238
I also talked to some reporters,

487
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:35,576
and they said she gave birth to him
and raised him alone.

488
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:50,883
How is it?

489
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,970
This is my new menu.

490
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,723
If you wrap it with this,

491
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,225
it'll taste a lot better.

492
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,478
What are you doing?

493
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,398
Well, I found a grey hair.

494
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,234
Gosh, look.

495
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,528
Here we go. I got two.

496
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:14,365
It's natural for hair to turn grey.
Leave it alone.

497
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:18,869
My gosh, your hair was all black
25 days ago.

498
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,205
But now, you not only have one or two,

499
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,165
but you have three grey hair strands.

500
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:27,086
Have you been observing my grey hair?

501
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:31,840
I think this is because of stress.

502
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,968
It's because of Jun-young, right?

503
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,469
Do you have feelings for me?

504
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:36,804
What?

505
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,514
Do you like me?

506
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,518
Why can't you answer me?

507
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,399
Do you really like me?

508
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,111
-No.
-Come on.

509
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,697
I think he's lying.

510
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,073
When did you come?

511
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,366
Just now.

512
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,910
He does like you.

513
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,997
It's been a while since I noticed.
Didn't you know?

514
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,542
You're more clueless than I thought.

515
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,752
-What?
-Hey, you fool.

516
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:09,837
What are you talking about?

517
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,092
You're being totally ridiculous.
Who likes who?

518
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,927
I know I haven't dated in a while,

519
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,178
but still, why would I like her?

520
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,346
Are you crazy?

521
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,099
Hey, you're being quite harsh.

522
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,642
What's so bad about me?

523
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,478
There are still a lot of men
coming after me.

524
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,315
You're the only one
who doesn't think of me as a woman.

525
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:31,400
No, it's not like that. It's--

526
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,777
Anyway, what brings you here?

527
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,487
Is Jun-young in some kind of trouble?

528
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,531
I'm not here because of Jun-young.

529
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,659
My goodness. I'm here for Guk-yeong.

530
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,371
He's inside. Take him.

531
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,541
You're the one who's crazy!

532
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,464
Yeong-ok.

533
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,886
I thought she was sharp,

534
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,221
but she's rather clueless.

535
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,265
You must be disappointed.

536
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,726
You've been pretty obvious
about your feelings toward her.

537
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,771
How can she be that clueless? Right?

538
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:09,730
Shut it.

539
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,607
Dad, do you really like her?

540
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,692
No. Do you think I'm crazy?

541
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,278
I think you like her, too.

542
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,363
I told you I don't.

543
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,866
Why is everyone still going on about this?

544
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,243
One of my friends is a single father,

545
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,079
and he owns a tofu factory.

546
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,831
May I set him up with Jun-young's mom?

547
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,251
Promise not to get angry
about it later, then.

548
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,670
Okay?

549
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,973
What is Dad and Mr. Namgung doing?

550
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,308
I don't know.

551
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,273
Yeong-ok.

552
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:55,567
Yeong-ok.

553
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,363
-What's going on?
-What did my father say to you?

554
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,739
Why are you making that face?

555
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:03,826
Sir.

FREE MEALS FOR THE ELDERLY
LAST MONDAY EVERY MONTH

557
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:11,750
Yeong-ok.

558
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,675
My goodness.

559
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,593
-Why you...
-You had another grey hair.

560
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:25,514
Just pluck out everything.
Just make me bald.

561
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,057
-Go on.
-I'll stop.

562
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,309
-Pluck everything out.
-No, it's okay.

563
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:33,355
-I'll pluck all your hair out.
-No, don't.

564
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:37,359
-I'll pluck out all your hair.
-There's no more grey hair.

565
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,778
-Gosh.
-I'm sorry.

566
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,702
CONNECTED WITH VISITOR

567
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,003
I got expensive wine as a present.

568
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,921
I wanted to share it with you.

569
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:02,551
That sounds great,
but I have to run out right now.

570
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,386
Would it be okay
if I come back in 30 minutes?

571
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,848
Sure. I'll take a tour
of your house, then.

572
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,805
THE STORIES WE DIDN'T KNOW

573
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:03,195
You should come in.
Why are you standing around?

574
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,030
Why did you want to see me?

575
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:10,202
You filmed these, right?
Please organize them.

576
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:15,040
I was fired
from Sin Jun-young's documentary project.

577
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,500
That's your problem.

578
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,294
You need to at least finish up
what you were doing.

579
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,046
You labeled them all wrong,

580
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,464
and the audio levels are a mess.

581
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,008
-Darn it.
-"Darn it"?

582
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,261
It feels like you're just
being mean to me.

583
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:30,806
You really shouldn't do this
to someone who got fired.

584
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,766
YANGJAE SAVINGS BANK CHEQUE

585
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,429
I'm a professional. I can do this.

586
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,773
I can't do this.

587
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,193
Will you go out with me Ms. No?

588
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,281
Let's say I have three months to live.

589
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,493
So for just three months.

590
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,454
Passionately.

591

KJ GROUP

592
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,015
The board members won't show up
even if you wait.

593
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,477
Ms. Lee must have done something.

594
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,275
Did you think she'd just let you do this?

595
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,360
No.

596
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,411
I just wanted to check and see

597
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,330
how powerful my mother was.

598
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,643
YOON JEONG-EUN

599
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,577
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave--

600
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,884
Who's that guy?

601
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:56,219
The guy who picked up
your phone yesterday.

602
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,765
The guy who you saved as "Husband"
on your cell phone.

603
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,517
Is he your boyfriend?

604
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:04,936
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?

605
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,898
How long have you been dating him?

606
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,401
His voice wasn't very attractive.
How does he look?

607
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,362
It sounded like he'd be very ugly.

608
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,615
Your boyfriend.

609
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,409
He's not my boyfriend.

610
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,495
Good job.

611
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,875
Have you thought about your bucket list?

612
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:28,668
Yes.

613
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,713
Could you tell me one item on that list?

614
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,967
Hearing "You're just my type"

615
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:39,054
from the person who just
asked me that question.

616
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,973
I'll edit that out.

617
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,642
I'll ask you again.

618
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,852
Tell me one of the items--

619
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,647
Hearing "I love you" from the woman

620
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,149
standing in front of me.

621
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,625
-Do this one first.
-What is this?

622
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,502
I don't know. I can't hear anything.

623
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:12,379
Didn't you even check the audio level?

624
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,565
What is he saying?

625
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,495
He didn't make any sound on purpose.

626
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,831
Are you making fun of me?

627
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,420
You cursed me, didn't you?

628
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,545
I thought you said 30 minutes.

629
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:39,257
I'm sorry. Things got complicated.

630
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:41,593
I thought you'd have gone back.

631
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,018
How dare you make me wait?

632
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,896
How dare someone like you make me wait?

633
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,861
Hey.

634
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:03,448
I have a visitor at home,
and she's very drunk.

635
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,742
I can't call a chauffeur,
so could you come?

636
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,911
Hey, Sin Jun-young.

637
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,663
Yes, come to my house.

638
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:18,004
My manager will be here in 20 minutes.
Just wait here.

639
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:22,467
Hey. Hey, you jerk!

640
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,868
"I don't have

641
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,788
a lot of time right now."

642
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,335
What does that mean?
Why wouldn't he have time?

643
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,263
"I don't have much time

644
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,016
to be around you."

645
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,023
"I

646
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:22,902
don't have much time

647
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,155
to be

648
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:29,993
around you, Eul."

649
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,430
Come out, Sin Jun-young.

650
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,849
Come out this instant!

651
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,269
Apologize.

652
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,064
Come out and apologize right now!

653
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,986
Apologize, you jerk!

654
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,406
I'm sorry.

655
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,077
I shouldn't have done such a thing
to someone like you.

656
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,470
MOTHER-IN-LAW

657
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,432
Jeong-eun, where are you?

658
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,894
Jeong-eun. Hello?

659
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,523
Hello? Jeong-eun.

660
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,111
Jeong-eun.

661
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,325
Mom.

662
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,995
If you're here to give up, wait.

663
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,831
I'll call Jeong-eun.
Let's have dinner with her.

664
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,415
I'm not here to give up.

665
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,924
MOTHER-IN-LAW

666
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,927
You should've cleared things up
before coming to me.

667
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:16,891
I wasn't born rich like you,
but I have my own pride.

668
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,060
I'm Sin Jun-young, you know.

669
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,401
You can go to your mother-in-law.

670
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:30,488
Talk to her and make sure
to get Choi Ji-tae back.

671
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,079
Hello, Mother.

672
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,416
I'm away right now.

673
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,418
I will

674
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,378
give up on Ji-tae.

675
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,973
You should give up, too.

676
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,437
Ji-tae won't ever change his--

677
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,171
Jun-young, you just wait.

678
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:06,793
That crazy jerk. That total lunatic.

679
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,795
You were fired.
You have no right to be here!

680
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,505
I told you to leave!

681
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:13,716
Why is Sin Jun-young such a jerk?

682
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,511
How much do you know about
your relationship with Jun-young?

683
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,930
How much do you know?

684
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:20,557
I thought we were over.

685
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,309
I'm falling for Jun-young.

686
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,353
Shall I do it for you if you can't?

687
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,813
Like I did before?

688
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,314
Leave the revenge to me.

689
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,191
Whether it's yours

690
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,317
or Eul's.

691
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:32,569
Why was she there?

692
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,404
I like you.

693
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:35,822
I love you.
