1
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,473
Can you kill her?

2
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:17,183
What?

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,812
She says she wants to die.

4
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,273
Do what you can to kill her.

5
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,460
Excuse me.

6
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,462
Here's your friend's coat.

7
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,297
-Her phone's ringing.
-Okay.

8
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:48,757
Thank you.

9
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,598
SPAM

10
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:02,979
No.

11
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,732
Your client isn't well.

12
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,818
Would you be happy if a telemarketer

13
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,571
called at this hour of the night?

14
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,517
It's been five hours since Jun-young left.

15
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,976
Aren't you worried?

16
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,521
Well...

17
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,022
No, not at all.

18
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,941
He went to see his father.

19
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,360
Wouldn't it be strange to worry?

20
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,530
What if he were to collapse

21
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,406
or something were to happen to him?

22
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,623
I hope something like that never happens,

23
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,708
but if he were to collapse,

24
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,877
someone would help him

25
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,420
and call for help.

26
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,467
He's Sin Jun-young, and the whole of Korea

27
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,220
loves and cares for him.

28
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:19,889
I'm

29
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,934
really good at waiting.

30
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,313
Whether it's 100 times or 1,000 times,

31
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,652
waiting isn't a problem for me.

32
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,825
What I fear the most is the fact

33
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,875
that I might not have to wait one day.

34
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,382
I might wake up one morning,

35
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,844
and Jun-young

36
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,555
might no longer be part of this world.

37
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,739
It's acute enteritis.

38
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,327
The doctor's too busy today,

39
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,622
so he said he'll kill you next time.

40
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,377
Are you No Eul's guardian?

41
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,965
She doesn't have to be hospitalized,

42
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,258
so you can check out.

43
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,344
Get on.

44
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,616
Let me live!

45
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,004
I don't want to die, so let me live!

46
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,175
Who will care

47
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,719
for my mom after I die?

48
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,891
For my whole life,

49
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,189
I was never a decent son!

50
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,945
All I did was break her heart!

51
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,201
There's...

52
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,541
There's so much I want to do for her.

53
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,589
I can't die like this.

54
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,099
I want to live.

55
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,815
I don't want to die. I want to live.

56
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,324
The people I love

57
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,868
are all here.

58
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,834
We were just

59
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,128
about to become happy.

60
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,004
Why do I have to die now?

61
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,966
I don't want to die.

62
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,720
I want to live.

63
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,892
Let me live, please.

64
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,900
I'm scared.

65
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,657
I'm scared.

66
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,545
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,006
I'm sorry.

68
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,218
I'm so sorry.

69
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:05,109
Early this morning,
a video surfaced on the Internet,

70
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,445
and it turned Korea upside-down.

71
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,323
It mentions how a politician
and a prosecutor

72
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,408
covered up a hit-and-run
that resulted in death.

73
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,453
You hit a man who was
pulling a cart across the road.

74
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,496
Then you fled.

75
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,998
I don't know what evidence you have,

76
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,625
but you can't get me.

77
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,461
Do you think what happened then
won't happen again?

78
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:26,506
The story is shocking,
but what caught our attention

79
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,468
were those who appeared
and were mentioned in the clip.

80
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:34,430
Daehan Jeil Party's Yoon Seong-ho,
his daughter Ms. Yoon,

81
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,517
the top star Sin Jun-young,
and the congressman Choi Hyeon-jun

82
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,518
were seen or mentioned.

83
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:42,396
Viewers are signing a petition
to reopen the case,

84
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,816
and around 57,000 people
have signed it so far.

85
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,194
Mr. Choi has stated

86
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,822
that he will come in voluntarily
to explain the matter.

87
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,618
Excuse me. Mr. Choi just arrived
at the police station.

88
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,037
We'll connect
to our reporter at the scene.

89
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,121
Mr. Jeon?

90
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,040
Mr. Choi.

91
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,128
Are you the senior prosecutor
mentioned in the video?

92
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,630
Is everything in the video true?

93
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,258
Is Sin Jun-young your illegitimate son?

94
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,759
Any comments, sir?

95
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,476
I apologize for causing trouble.

96
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,354
I will answer every question sincerely
during the investigation.

97
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,939
CONGRESSMAN CHOI IS BEING INVESTIGATED

98
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,399
Mr. Choi

99
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,819
went straight inside to be questioned
by the police.

100
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,862
If he admits the charges,

101
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,698
he will lose his seat as a congressman

102
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,702
and be sentenced for his crimes
committed while he was a prosecutor.

103
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,921
My gosh. Is Jun-young really
Mr. Choi's son?

104
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,592
Then was Ms. Sin his mistress?

105
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,264
Where's Yeong-ok?

106
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,444
Mr. Choi's aide did an interview.

107
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,321
He said

108
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,908
Mr. Choi himself told him
to upload the video.

109
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,581
The man you never forgot or got over

110
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,044
had a shred of decency after all.

111
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,051
I was asked to cover up the hit-and-run,

112
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,137
so I threatened the prosecutor
who was handling the case.

113
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,515
I told him to fabricate
the evidence and witness

114
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,769
and cover up the case.

115
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,104
But

116
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:51,317
he refused, so I demoted him
to a regional office.

117
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,737
In return

118
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,323
for covering up the case,

119
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,326
Mr. Yoon

120
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,122
nominated me as the candidate
for the by-election.

121
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,627
My plane leaves in an hour.
Clear it up for me, Dad.

122
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,589
I only did as you said!

123
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,342
You said you'd deal with it.

124
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,636
I went to America because you told me to

125
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,846
and laid low because you told me to.

126
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,057
You told me to forget all about it,
so I did.

127
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,433
What did I do wrong?

128
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,601
Ms. Yoon Jeong-eun?

129
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,606
We're the police.

130
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,410
Stop crying, Jik.

131
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,412
Eul.

132
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,957
Do you think Dad can rest in peace now?

133
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,793
He won't feel wronged anymore, will he?

134
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,266
Why did you give it to him?

135
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,017
What?

136
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,479
Why did you give the video
to Choi Hyeon-jun?

137
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,233
I didn't give it to him.

138
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,944
I guess he stole it.

139
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,737
You weren't going to air it, were you?

140
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,698
I was going to.

141
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,826
-I was going to give the video to--
-Eul.

142
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,834
Fine. I gave it to him.

143
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,796
I don't need it anymore.

144
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,426
We found who killed my dad. That's enough.

145
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,886
If you let it go like that,

146
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,222
those people will get away with it

147
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,850
and think it's okay.

148
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,645
They'll do similar things again
to other people.

149
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,315
He didn't, though.

150
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,611
He could have pretended
like it never happened,

151
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,363
but he came clean

152
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,365
and is paying the price for it.

153
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,453
This is the world I want to believe in.

154
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,040
This is the world I believe in.

155
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,085
Home delivery.

156
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,881
Hello.

157
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,841
Right.

158
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,052
You can put it here.

159
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,600
-Bye, then.
-Thank you.

160
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,893
Bye.

161
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,318
What's that?

162
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,781
Pororo's house.

163
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,452
Let's bring him over.

164
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,703
I want to get to know him.

165
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,913
You're allergic to dogs.

166
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,374
Not so much now.
I've been taking medicine.

167
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,793
If I feel sick, I'll take some more.

168
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,879
I'll look after Pororo from now.

169
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,882
Don't you trust me more than Mr. Jang?

170
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,430
PORORO

171
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:24,238
PORORO'S HOME

172
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,619
Hey.

173
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,498
Hey.

174
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,791
-What?
-Hey.

175
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,792
Look.

176
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,964
That night, Eul woke me up

177
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,425
and told me about how she planned

178
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,677
to live without me.

179
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,763
Justice, honesty,

180
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,390
beliefs, morals,

181
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,101
or conscience were still too serious words

182
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,813
for someone like her.

183
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,318
She only talked about common sense.

184
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,071
She said that's how she would live.

185
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,782
She wanted to live

186
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,451
decently enough

187
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,412
so she wouldn't embarrass
her brother, father or me.

188
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,116
When Eul fell asleep around daybreak,

189
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,367
Choi Hyeon-jun,

190
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,787
I mean, my father sent me a text.

191
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,581
He said

192
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,126
he would take pride

193
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,087
and joy in the fact

194
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:49,049
that he was my father
until the day he dies.

195
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,146
Forget it. Take it away.

196
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,190
He doesn't deserve a sip of water.

197
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,612
Do you think I paid you a fortune

198
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,282
to get a result like this?

199
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,910
Your husband was the one

200
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,788
who denied to have me represent him.

201
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,207
What does that mean?

202
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,668
I told him he doesn't need
to represent me anymore.

203
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,759
He did nothing wrong.

204
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,094
It was my idea.

205
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,973
You may leave now.

206
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,391
Okay.

207
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,403
From now on,

208
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,031
I will continue without a lawyer.

209
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,700
I will not appeal.

210
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,454
-Why not?
-There's no reason.

211
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,083
-I want to.
-Honey.

212
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,459
Ji-tae's right.

213
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,676
You and I both

214
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,678
have become monsters

215
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,933
that even we cannot control.

216
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,062
Let's stop this.

217
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,188
Please.

218
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,066
Let's not go any further.

219
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,906
I made you into what you are now.

220
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,493
You were crawling in the gutter,

221
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,662
but I brought you
to the place you're in now.

222
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,038
Honey.

223
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,125
Why? Do you want to go back
to where you came from?

224
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,209
Mom!

225
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,797
You were poor and powerless.

226
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,590
That's why your mother died.

227
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,301
She needed a heart,

228
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,011
but you couldn't even do anything

229
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,013
when people stronger and richer
than you cut in line.

230
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,932
Do you want to go back to those days?

231
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,310
-Eun-su.
-What did you say to me then?

232
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,436
You said

233
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,232
you wanted power so you wouldn't have
to lose anything to anyone.

234
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,234
Do you think you can

235
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,611
gain power by sitting and doing nothing?

236
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,530
Do you think you'll get it with luck

237
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,448
if you live by your conscience?

238
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,368
To get what you want,

239
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,037
you must endure the pain and sacrifice

240
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,331
and pay the price in full.

241
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,793
To protect you, I even

242
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,800
hit my own son with a car.

243
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,440
Get out of this house.

244
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,486
Go back to the gutter.

245
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,989
That's where you came from.

246
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,180
You don't

247
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,145
have to keep your promise.

248
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,150
You said you wouldn't leave her.

249
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,657
But you don't have to keep that promise.

250
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,457
I will suffer with her
for the rest of my life.

251
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,085
-You can--
-She is my wife.

252
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,006
She's also the mother of my children.

253
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,434
Ji-tae.

254
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,895
I will

255
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,815
stay with your mother.

256
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,359
Even if that's

257
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,445
worse than living in the gutter.

258
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,049
Did he not come to work today?

259
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,592
Where is he?

260
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,142
There's a pimple on your forehead.

261
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,977
Did you have a rough few days?

262
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,855
You have one on your cheek.

263
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,773
Did you have a hard time?

264
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,612
Well?

265
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,990
Did you hate that kiss?

266
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,241
No.

267
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,203
It made my heart pound.

268
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,165
You lied about liking boys, didn't you?

269
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,376
You lied to get rid of me
because of my father, right?

270
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,885
Give me your number.

271
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,765
My friends all remember
their ex-boyfriend's numbers,

272
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,017
but I guess I'm stupid.

273
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,269
Didn't we break up?

274
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,063
We did.

275
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,275
I won't see you again.

276
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,111
I won't call

277
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,197
or text you.

278
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,033
-Then what's it for?
-Later on,

279
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,663
if I never find a man as good as you,

280
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,334
I'll call you then.

281
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,425
NO JIK

282
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,346
Okay. Call me then.

283
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,931
I'll take your call.

284
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,475
Take care, Jik.

285
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,896
You, too.

286
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,625
Okay? Good.

287
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,128
But... No.

288
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,137
Gosh.

289
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,972
What is she saying?

290
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,684
Are you even speaking English?

291
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,833
Something went wrong with the delivery,

292
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,543
so the item was returned.

293
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,836
They re-sent it two days ago

294
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,838
and sent you an email. Didn't you get it?

295
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,965
Oh, they emailed me.

296
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:30,010
I don't open emails in English
because they all seem like spam.

297
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,095
You're awesome.

298
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,597
Where's Jun-young?

299
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,599
Well...

300
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,559
He's...

301
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,060
Is he not in?

302
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,645
He is, but...

303
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,730
What is it?

304
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,982
-Is something wrong?
-Hey.

305
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,656
I'm going to go for a walk.

306
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,586
Jun-young

307
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,755
didn't recognize me?

308
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,383
It started a week ago.

309
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,594
One day he calls me Eul,

310
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,846
the next day he asks who I am.

311
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,850
Now, he even forgot what his name is.

312
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,645
He got so confused and upset,

313
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,814
so I'm just acting
like a live-in helper for now.

314
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,855
Are you following me?

315
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:06,940
Yes.

316
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:09,859
Do you know me?

317
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,487
Yes. Very well.

318
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,499
What was I like?

319
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,962
You said you know me very well.

320
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,341
-I do.
-What was I like?

321
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,555
You're a jerk who thinks
you're better than anyone.

322
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,641
You say hurtful things.

323
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,561
-Excuse me.
-You hurt people.

324
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,646
You believe you're
the only one who's right

325
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,773
and always want to look cool.

326
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,027
-Stop it.
-You're rude and say horrible things,

327
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,863
but you're actually always right.

328
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,534
You don't have to, but you do crazy things

329
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,037
and make cowards like me

330
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,873
feel small and ashamed.

331
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,500
-You crush us.
-Is that a compliment?

332
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,754
It is.

333
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,513
Were we friends?

334
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,307
We must've been close.

335
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,351
We weren't.

336
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,729
I really hated you a lot.

337
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,025
I even wished that you'd disappear.

338
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,402
So

339
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,572
next time,

340
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,743
let's meet again.

341
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,080
I'll be good to you then.

342
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,707
I'll be a real big brother.

343
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,003
I'll care for you

344
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,385
and love you.

345
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,595
Forget it.

346
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,889
You're weird.

347
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,801
-What's this?
-I found it on the street.

348
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,261
Keep it.

349
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,722
I'm not a beggar.

350
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,725
Don't give me stuff
you find on the street.

351
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,853
Fine. I bought it.

352
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,148
Keep it.

353
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,236
Why give me a ring?

354
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,323
-Give it to your girlfriend.
-You're my girlfriend.

355
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,576
Yes.

356
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,328
I like you. Is that enough?

357
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,042
-You're crazy.
-I'm not.

358
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,838
I've never been saner.

359
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,383
I'm in no mood to put up with your jokes,
so get out.

360
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,678
Get out before I pour
the dishwater on you.

361
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,736
You lunatic!

362
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,283
Have you lost your mind?

363
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,287
My son is dying.

364
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,876
How can you do this
to the mother of a dying boy?

365
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,961
When you go see him,

366
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,174
make sure you wear that ring.

367
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,801
Wear it

368
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,011
and show it to him.

369
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,971
Brag about it.

370
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,143
Show him what?

371
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,394
You fool.

372
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,814
How could you?

373
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,358
How could you do this?

374
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,484
Jun-young

375
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,029
asked me to look after you.

376
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,115
Show him that ring

377
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,201
and say you'll be fine

378
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,829
without him.

379
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,289
Tell him that I said

380
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,375
I'll make you happy.

381
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,170
Put his mind at ease.

382
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,636
I know you avoid him

383
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,472
and can't bear to see him

384
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,561
because you feel guilty and sorry.

385
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,605
But you're

386
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,190
his mother.

387
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,279
You're his mom.

388
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,615
Why should you

389
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,284
feel sorry or guilty?

390
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,538
Go and see him

391
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:15,832
before it's too late.

392
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,262
I'll be released soon.

393
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:33,141
You will never get what you want.

394
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,059
Sorry about that.

395
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,687
I will get my revenge.

396
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,106
How dare you challenge me.

397
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,733
I will crush all of you.

398
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,651
My father said he'd go after you all,

399
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,236
especially your father.

400
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,364
If my father starts acting,

401
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,618
your father will never get back
on his feet again.

402
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,456
Why are you so quiet?

403
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,126
Why don't you
try to lecture me like always?

404
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,295
If I tell you that I fell for you once,

405
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,382
would you believe it?

406
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,886
"If this woman becomes my girlfriend,

407
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,515
life would be so fun and happy."

408
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,228
If I were to say I once thought that,

409
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,232
would you believe it?

410
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,110
You're going to teach me?

411
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,029
I'm really good at English.

412
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,907
I don't need a tutor to teach me English.

413
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,494
-I need--
-A moving yet unique essay

414
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,205
that will get you into
an Ivy League university.

415
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,375
Excellent tips for making
the interviewers gasp

416
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,836
and say they must pick you at all costs.

417
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,964
Is that what you need?

418
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,844
I didn't bribe my way to get here.

419
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,264
I passed your mother's rigorous interview.

420
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,144
People think I won't be smart
because I'm so pretty.

421
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,146
But my grades are outstanding.

422
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,399
I play two instruments
at a professional level,

423
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,067
and I'm good at sports.

424
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,735
Essays and speeches are my specialty--

425
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,695
What are you doing?

426
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,155
I'm trying to impress you.

427
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,908
I'll introduce myself again.

428
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,078
I'm pretty and have
a variety of impressive skills,

429
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,372
and I've liked you for eight years.

430
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,083
That shows I'm also persistent,
patient and loyal.

431
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,252
I'm Yoon Jeong-eun.

432
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,352
You're right.

433
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,105
You may have the power to get out.

434
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,776
But I want you to stay
and pay for your sins.

435
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,822
I'll wait for you.

436
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,241
What do you mean?

437
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,743
Let's talk again then.

438
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,286
What do you mean?

439
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,830
Let's see if you've already gone too far
to become better,

440
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:03,833
or if

441
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,087
there's at least a bit of hope for you.

442
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,881
If there's hope,

443
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,341
I'll be there for you.

444
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,094
I'll visit again.

445
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,639
Don't.

446
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,349
Don't ever come back.

447
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,934
Not until you die.

448
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,980
I don't ever want to see you again.

449
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,107
If you do, I'll kill you!

450
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,125
Who are you?

451
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,133
May I help you with anything?

452
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,521
Are you here to sell something?

453
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,070
Where is Eul?

454
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,073
Is she out?

455
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,450
She went to get groceries.

456
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,160
Are you here to see her?

457
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,418
You can wait inside.

458
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,100
Well, then.

459
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:46,894
When will

460
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,231
Eul be back?

461
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,817
I don't know.

462
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,444
She ruined the yukgaejang she was making,

463
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,989
so she went to get
the ingredients for curry.

464
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,752
Could you taste it for me?

465
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,797
Sure.

466
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,859
Is it good?

467
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,750
It's awesome.

468
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,461
It's really good.

469
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,059
It tastes exactly
like my mom's yukgaejang.

470
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,262
What's wrong? Does it taste bad?

471
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,057
Did you find a hair or something?

472
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,230
I'll get you a new bowl.

473
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,827
Mom.

474
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,380
Sorry for not recognizing you.

475
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,324
You look lovely today, Ms. Sin.

476
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,162
I had my hair done before coming here.

477
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:00,291
Guk-yeong even bought me a new outfit.

478
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,876
I see.

479
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,880
-Man-ok bought me these earrings.
-I see.

480
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,008
This ring

481
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,886
is from Jeong-sik.

482
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:17,224
He proposed to me.

483
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,642
Really?

484
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,228
Congratulations, Mom.

485
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,857
Guk-yeong and Man-ok...

486
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,861
Now, I have two very sweet stepchildren.

487
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,072
I'm getting blessed at this old age.

488
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,995
I was a horrible son.

489
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,331
I feel terrible now.

490
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,794
No.

491
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,132
You were a great son.

492
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,009
I was not.

493
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,553
Children do all the good

494
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,265
they need to do
before they turn three years old.

495
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,101
You always

496
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,481
slept well and ate well.

497
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,983
You even pooped well.

498
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,611
You didn't cry

499
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,488
or get sick.

500
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,117
Whenever you looked at me,

501
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,079
you smiled for some reason.

502
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,540
Goodness.

503
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,461
You just made me sound
like I'm a great guy.

504
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,382
Okay.

505
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,802
Let's say I was a good son, then.

506
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,018
Mom.

507
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,905
I don't want you to think

508
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,409
that I didn't do my best.

509
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,204
Okay.

510
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,207
I lived hard.

511
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:12,172
Even if I got another chance,
I won't be able to do it better.

512
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,099
But I still feel so sorry.

513
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,311
I'm sorry, Mom.

514
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,229
I'm really sorry.

515
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,905
My door will always be open.

516
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,035
Come visit whenever you miss me.

517
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,247
When the flowers bloom,

518
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,167
I'll think that you're there.

519
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,378
When the wind blows,

520
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,298
I'll think that you're there.

521
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,968
Even when it rains,

522
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,180
I'll think you came by.

523
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,393
When it snows,

524
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,731
I'll also think that you came by.

525
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,572
Thank you, Jun-young.

526
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,578
Thank you for being my son.

527
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,375
Me too.

528
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,213
It was

529
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,049
a great honor

530
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,303
to have you as my mom.

531
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,184
The tax investigation and audit revealed

532
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,145
that KJ Group has many issues.

533
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,605
As a member of upper management

534
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:36,650
and a family of the owner,
I feel responsible.

535
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,194
Mrs. Lee Eun-su and I...

536
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,782
will resign from our positions.
This will be effective immediately.

537
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:56,879
KJ Group will be managed
by professional managers.

538
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:04,511
Mrs. Lee and I will serve only
as major shareholders and owners,

539
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,223
and do our best to improve KJ Group
in various fields such as research,

540
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,516
employee welfare...

541
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:11,935
I have bad news.

542
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,731
They're going to issue
a warrant for your arrest soon.

543
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,025
-Have you eaten?
-Sir.

544
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,485
I haven't had lunch yet.

545
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,070
Find a restaurant nearby.

546
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,239
Someplace with great yukgaejang.

547
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:45,928
You must think you're really pretty.

548
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:52,100
My brother said he misses me,
and asked for my picture.

549
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,103
Did you see your mother off?

550
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:57,940
Yes.

551
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,235
Hey, what are you looking at?

552
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,320
There aren't any photos of us together.

553
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,031
Why didn't you ask a top star like me

554
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,866
for a photo?

555
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,618
Will you pose for one if I ask?

556
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,580
Gosh. I look amazing today.

557
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,833
I shine so brightly
I can barely look at myself.

558
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,673
You're the only one
who says I'm not pretty.

559
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,259
Why do I look so good?

560
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,053
It's a pity that
you're the only one seeing me.

561
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,349
Hey, don't take photos like that
without saying anything.

562
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:49,616
You look really tired.

563
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,412
I am.

564
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,082
I feel really tired today.

565
00:47:58,417 --> 00:47:59,751
Sleep on my shoulder.

566
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,628
You're going to wake me up, aren't you?

567
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,422
I won't. Sleep.

568
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,174
You'll wake me and say you're bored.

569
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:09,177
I won't. Sleep well.

570
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:18,937
Are you asleep?

571
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,272
Yes.

572
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,357
How did you answer, then?

573
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:26,820
Are you really asleep?

574
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,449
Not yet.

575
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,744
Am I not pretty at all?

576
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,787
You're pretty.

577
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,375
You're so pretty that I can't look at you.

578
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,808
Are you asleep?

579
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:07,944
Are you really asleep?

580
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,623
Okay.

581
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,917
I won't talk.

582
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,755
I won't wake you up, either.

583
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:37,724
Fine.

584
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:42,813
You had a really long day today.

585
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,735
I won't wake you again.

586
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:53,115
Forget about your mom.

587
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,784
Forget about your dad.

588
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,286
Forget about me.

589
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,333
Don't think about anything.

590
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:05,836
Just sleep.

591
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,770
Thank you, Jun-young.

592
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,193
See you tomorrow.

593
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,794
Why aren't you taking out the boxes?

594
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,798
Are you going to keep slacking off?

595
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,758
Come and look at this.

596
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,551
The tree's growing new leaves.

597
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:37,844
What are you talking about?

598
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,305
Jun-young said it was dead
and wanted to dig it up.

599
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,473
But look at it now.

600
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,768
-It's growing new leaves.
-You're right.

601
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,062
This is incredible.

602
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,734
-Hello?
-Guk-yeong.

603
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:57,239
Which do you prefer? Red or pink?

604
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,782
No.

605
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,325
What color do you like?

606
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,369
I like you, Na-ri.

607
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,954
Hey.

608
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,749
Right. I know we were supposed
to watch a movie today,

609
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,292
but something came up and--

610
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,253
What's wrong?

611
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,171
We can't watch a movie then?

612
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,756
That's not what I meant.

613
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,718
Something came up, so after the movie,

614
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:22,138
I think we'll have
to eat dinner together, too.

615
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:25,642
Gosh, you scared me.

616
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,602
-What are you doing?
-Hello?

617
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,729
Hello? Guk-yeong?

618
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,982
Who is it? Who's the witch?

619
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,485
-Ouch.
-How dare you say that.

620
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,572
You can't call
my potential girlfriend a witch.

621
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,240
Hey.

622
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,785
I found something while packing up here.

623
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:51,960
SEARCHING FOR SIGNAL

624
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,390
I'm Sin Jun-young.

625
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,608
A few months ago,

626
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,444
my doctor told me

627
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:22,115
that I didn't have much longer to live.

628
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,454
Well, it's a bit baffling,

629
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,249
but everyone dies eventually anyway.

630
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,139
What

631
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,934
worries me the most

632
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,188
is that the people I love

633
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,026
might think I was unhappy.

634
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,992
I was really, truly happy.

635
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,955
I had a great life,

636
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,875
and I couldn't have asked for more.

637
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:25,971
I think

638
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,516
that knowing my time is limited

639
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,146
helped me show my true feelings.

640
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,565
It gave me courage.

641
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:42,779
I consider it as my final blessing.

642
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,790
Yesterday

643
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:02,048
marked the end of the three months
the doctor gave me.

644
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:08,680
Right now,

645
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,393
as you're watching this video,

646
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,445
am I

647
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,282
still alive?

648
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,667
And...

649
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,385
my love,

650
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:50,805
No Eul.

651
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:56,186
How is she doing now?

652
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,538
Sir!

653
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,665
Where are my tapes?

654
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,668
I worked on that for over three months.

655
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,004
I even got death threats over it.

656
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:24,714
Give it back.

657
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,385
Do you think I came back for this?

658
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,763
I'm not doing this to save my skin.

659
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:35,058
Think about who you're dealing with.

660
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:38,645
Illegal rebates are so common,
no one would care about articles on them.

661
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,814
I traced at least three billion won.

662
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,274
Hundreds of doctors are taking bribes.

663
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,985
-We shouldn't cover it up.
-We shouldn't.

664
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,071
But

665
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:52,909
this changes everything.

666
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,539
-My goodness. What's all this?
-Eul.

667
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,792
Turn a blind eye, just this once.

668
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,211
It's not that hard to do.

669
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,005
The freedom of speech

670
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,383
shouldn't give in to capitalism.

671
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,680
But then, I did spend a lot on expenses,

672
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:17,058
and if I give some to the staff,
there won't even be much left.

673
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,143
You're right.

674
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,352
You should take some, too.

675
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,896
No. Don't worry about me.

676
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,356
I have this

677
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,235
and this is all I need.

678
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,572
You got a foreign brand car. I envy you.

679
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,450
Are you getting this?

680
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,118
Getting what?

681
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:39,914
Do you see the camera up there? Say hi.

682
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,042
-Eul.
-Thank you.

683
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:44,878
Thanks to your statement,

684
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,297
I can add bribing the media
to the list of charges.

685
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,675
Make sure no one steals your tapes.

686
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,260
Hey.

687
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:59,350
YOU DID A GREAT JOB TODAY

688
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,744
You think so, too?

689
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,830
I did a great job today, didn't I?

690
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,263
See you tomorrow, Jun-young.
