1
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:12,721
I'll spend some time with Dad.

2
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,347
Wash up and go to bed.

3
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,404
Shit.

4
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,449
Yoon Jeong-eun, 30 years old.

5
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,075
The daughter of Yoon Seong-ho,

6
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,702
the representative of Daehan Jeil Party.

7
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,537
Dad!

8
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,542
Her license plate number
was Seoul-3G-3126.

9
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,377
Her car model was ZEF 320.

10
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,045
The color of her car was red.

11
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,714
She scrapped her car
right after the incident.

12
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,007
Stop!

13
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,009
Hey!

14
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,012
Stop!

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,405
YOON JEONG-EUN POSTED
A PICTURE IN HAWAII

16
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,408
IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS
SINCE I'VE COME TO HAWAII

17
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,453
LET'S FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING
UNDER THE BRIGHT SUN

18
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,999
Please take a look. Thank you.

19
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,463
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES

20
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:35,386
MY LOVE, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

21
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,765
SENIOR PROSECUTOR CHOI
REVEAL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE REAL CRIMINAL

22
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,692
MY 25TH BIRTHDAY
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JEONG-EUN

23
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,737
MY BIRTHDAY PARTY HAS JUST STARTED

24
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,657
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MY BELOVED FRIENDS

25
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,044
I LOVE TAKING PICTURES NOWADAYS
HERE'S A PICTURE OF MY FAVORITE DESSERT

26
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,755
WITH MOTHER AT THE BEACH
THANK YOU FOR LOVING ME

27
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,675
I'M NERVOUS AND EXCITED
FOR OUR ENGAGEMENT CEREMONY

28
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,678
WITH DAD IN THE WAITING ROOM
#LOVE #PROMISE #PARENTS

29
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,017
WITH THE PEOPLE I ADMIRE AND LOVE
I WILL DO MY BEST

30
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,939
I CRIED WHEN WE TOOK THIS PICTURE
I WILL LIVE A HAPPY LIFE DAD

31
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,407
How dare you boss me around.

32
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,117
Know your place.

33
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,037
Why can't I get drunk today?

34
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,894
The surveillance camera
at the site was broken.

35
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:52,607
The witnesses all changed
their statements at the same time.

36
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,025
No witness.

37
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,568
No evidence.

38
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,029
Zero chance of a retrial.

39
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,089
What did you just say?

40
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,051
I said, I'll film that movie.

41
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,678
DAEHAN JEIL PARTY
AND KJ GROUP BECOME IN-LAWS

42
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,720
Why all of a sudden?

43
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,515
I changed my mind.

44
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,600
I heard the new team manager

45
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,185
of the investing company is really pretty.

46
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,062
But

47
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:34,607
that's not why
you changed your mind, right?

48
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,775
It is.

49
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,193
-Come on.
-Please.

50
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,488
I forgot to take
my blood pressure medicine.

51
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,658
So please refrain from
such jokes, Jun-young.

52
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,957
-Do I look like I'm joking?
-Well, aren't you?

53
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:55,211
Ms. Yoon is the future
daughter-in-law of KJ Group's president.

54
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,921
She's not someone you can...

55
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,756
But she's not married yet.

56
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,008
Man-ok, give me my sedative.

57
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,224
Take this, it's good for your body.

58
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,940
There aren't any more sedatives.

59
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,819
Please tell me that you were joking.

60
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,237
No.

61
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,116
I heard Yun-hu started filming.
We should go, too.

62
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,744
Kim Su-chan already took that role,

63
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,537
and there are articles about that, too.

64
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,873
Exactly. I heard from his stylist

65
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,876
that their team is headed there tonight.

66
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,544
In that case,

67
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,840
ask the production company to choose.

68
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,470
They can either choose
the rookie actor Su-chan,

69
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,098
or they can choose me,
the most popular actor

70
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,184
in Korea.

71
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,881
I'm going to go and meet the director.

72
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:25,843
You're not doing the movie
for Ms. Yoon, are you?

73
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,804
-It's a lie, right?
-I'm serious.

74
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,681
She's rich and from a good family.

75
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,183
On top of that, she's pretty.

76
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,810
Since when did you have a thing

77
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,436
for rich girls
who come from good families?

78
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,813
Since a long time ago.

79
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,731
You just didn't notice.

80
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:43,236
But still, she's engaged
and will get married soon.

81
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,404
Hey.

82
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,991
KJ Group... That means
she'll be Congressman Choi's...

83
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,328
It means Ms. Yoon
will soon become his daughter-in-law.

84
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,915
-Don't lie to me.
-He's right.

85
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,959
She’s marrying Lee Eun-su
and Choi Hyeon-jun’s only son.

86
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,379
You didn't think that far, did you?

87
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,799
At least you found out now.

88
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,260
You would've gotten in trouble
if it wasn't for me.

89
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,310
I guess you can focus
on your acting, then.

90
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,230
That movie seemed too good to miss out on.

91
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,443
Yoon Jeong-eun.

92
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,612
Choi Hyeon-jun and Lee Eun-su's

93
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,780
future daughter-in-law.

94
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,659
Choi Ji-tae's fiancée.

95
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,040
What's wrong with him these days?

96
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,127
I thought he liked Ms. No.

97
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,336
I don't know.

98
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,548
How can anyone know
what that crazy guy is thinking?

99
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,895
-I'm fine.
-Many people could be watching,

100
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,272
since this is our subsidiary resort.

101
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,192
Many people from KJ Group are here, too.

102
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,824
Kim Su-chan. He'll join the team tomorrow.

103
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,034
Really?

104
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,702
That's great.

105
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,830
There are only 46 days left
until the statute of limitations expires.

106
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,626
I have a minimum of 30 days

107
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,127
or a maximum of 60 days to live.

108
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,838
-Jun-young's such a jerk that--
-Is someone badmouthing me?

109
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,848
Why are you here?

110
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,726
To shoot a movie. With you.

111
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:39,936
I'm the psychopath.

112
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,604
You turned the role down.

113
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,564
I'm not that irresponsible.

114
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,192
I finish what I started.

115
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,014
I have to go. I'll call you.

116
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,144
There are reporters everywhere. Watch out.

117
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,859
I apologize for the intrusion. Bye.

118
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,029
We've met before.

119
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,118
I was going to pretend not to know you.

120
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,913
I'm Yoon Jeong-eun.

121
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,623
I'm Sin Jun-young.

122
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,375
You must know that, though.

123
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,221
Let me down.

124
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,956
-It's been a while.
-It's been a while.

125
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,048
SIN JUN-YOUNG

126
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,974
NO EUL

127
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,103
You didn't change your number.

128
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,774
You ignored my texts and calls.

129
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,443
So I thought maybe
you changed your number.

130
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,821
I was going to,
but I haven't had the time.

131
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,950
Why did you ignore my texts and calls?

132
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,371
No reason.

133
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,331
"No reason"?

134
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,541
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit busy.

135
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,086
-If you're finished--
-I'm not finished.

136
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,712
I have a lot of things to say.

137
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,798
If I don't want to hear it,
I don't have to, right?

138
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,424
Jun-young.

139
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,969
I'll see you again next time.

140
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,032
I'm going back to my room. Good night.

141
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,509
I'm sorry.

142
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,347
-Is that all?
-If I had made a faster decision,

143
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,058
I wouldn't have confused you.

144
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,102
I am truly sorry.

145
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,229
Ji-tae.

146
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,336
Do you want to grab a drink?

147
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,952
What trouble would I get myself into
after drinking again?

148
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,288
My gosh.

149
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,319
Sir, are you busy?

150
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,199
Do you want to party tonight with me?

151
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,487
You bad guy!

152
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,411
One, two.

153
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,162
And three and four.

154
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,998
Let's go. Five, six.

155
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,001
Let's go! Everyone!

156
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,587
In one, two, three, four.

157
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,297
One, two, three, four.

158
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,132
One, two, three, four.

159
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,675
Let's party.

160
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,552
-We are going to party.
-Party.

161
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,262
Let's go.

162
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,722
Let's go!

163
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,362
Are you here to see Eul?

164
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,197
I came to film a movie.

165
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,699
I thought you turned the role down.

166
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,159
Well, I

167
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,245
changed my mind because Ms. Yoon
was so beautiful.

168
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,331
I have a weakness for beautiful women.

169
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,515
I almost forgot.

170
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,269
You shouldn't be drinking. You're ill.

171
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,315
I'm not ill.

172
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,631
Right?

173
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,263
I will look after Eul.

174
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,474
Just look after yourself.

175
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,601
I don't think

176
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,771
you should be wasting your time like this.

177
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,652
You'll be gone soon.

178
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,654
You can't even take care of her.

179
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,494
So stop confusing her.

180
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,708
I'll take this.

181
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,410
Let's grab another drink.

182
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,619
Get out of my way.

183
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,331
Hey, why are you ignoring me?

184
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,292
Get out of my way!

185
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,379
Wow, you've grown up, Man-ok.

186
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,673
You couldn't even look at me before.

187
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:35,804
You see, Man-ok used to
have a huge crush on me.

188
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,725
She said,
"Will you please go on a date with me?"

189
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,561
Stop it, seriously. Move out of my way.

190
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,646
Your dialect...

191
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,607
It's Man-ok's best feature.

192
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,317
Man-ok, you are

193
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,652
the most attractive
when you speak in a dialect.

194
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,114
Don't use standard Korean,
it doesn't even suit you.

195
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,366
And call me often, okay?

196
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,785
Aren't you going to move?

197
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,703
If you go on like this,
I'll call Guk-yeong.

198
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,747
Fine. Go ahead.

199
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,791
He's nothing

200
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,710
with his little curly hair.

201
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,212
Call him.

202
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,546
I'm not scared.

203
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,799
Get out my way! Move!

204
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,428
She told you to move!
Are you guys deaf or what?

205
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,834
Yes, Jun-young.

206
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,379
-Where are you right now?
-Nowhere.

207
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,673
You jerks.

208
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,591
-Hey!
-You little...

209
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,385
Hey! You little punks.

210
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,512
My goodness, she's so rough.

211
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,975
If you're going to get drunk,
don't become such an asshole.

212
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,893
-You're dead.
-You little punks.

213
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,604
Let's just kill them all today.

214
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,782
-Hey!
-Hey, it's Sin Jun-young.

215
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,160
-Oh, my gosh.
-Look.

216
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,377
What are you doing?

217
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,296
Are you gangsters or what?

218
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,505
It's not like that.

219
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,716
They were picking on Man-ok first.

220
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,800
Be quiet.

221
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,220
Jang Guk-yeong. Jang Man-ok.

222
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,889
Come out this second.

223
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,640
My goodness.

224
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:44,892
We didn't do anything.

225
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,476
-My gosh.
-What did you say?

226
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,728
Stop it, please.

227
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,399
Don't talk to Guk-yeong like that.

228
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,318
He's two years older than you.

229
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,197
Where are your manners?

230
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,707
Mr. Jang did nothing wrong.

231
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,836
Those jerks picked on Man-ok first.

232
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,004
So what?

233
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,257
Well, nothing.

234
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,426
-I mean...
-You mean what?

235
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,603
I got hurt.

236
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,862
I have a scratch here,

237
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,866
and they took out a handful of my hair.

238
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,869
He also kicked me,

239
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,081
so I got bruised here.

240
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,964
I can't really show you,

241
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,091
but I have a huge bruise on my butt, too.

242
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,809
I think my ribs may be fractured.

243
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,067
My ribs... Is it here?

244
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,491
Is it somewhere else?

245
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,121
I think it's here...

246
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,722
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

247
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,640
May I help you?

248
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,934
Is there a hospital nearby?

249
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,936
Yes. You can get there in ten minutes.

250
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,482
I think she's hurt.
Could you take her there?

251
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,734
Yes, sir.

252
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,864
Goodbye, then. Take care.

253
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,952
Please come with me.

254
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,746
Are you hurt badly?

255
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,583
No, I'm not hurt.

256
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,917
I'm sorry.

257
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,506
How did you get in?

258
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,884
You're up.

259
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,928
You drank a lot yesterday.
Do you want coffee?

260
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,763
What are you doing here
without my permission?

261
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,141
Your mother asked me
to call her when you're up.

262
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,146
Mother, Ji-tae is up.

263
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,689
Hold on.

264
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,700
-Yes.
-Good morning.

265
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,035
Did you sleep well?

266
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,247
Jeong-eun became
the investment team leader

267
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,748
instead of you.

268
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,042
Did you hear about that?

269
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,711
I did.

270
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,340
So I want you to be
Jeong-eun's team member.

271
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,967
What do you think?

272
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,636
Sure. I will do that.

273
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,726
I'm thinking of giving
your director position to Jeong-eun, too.

274
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,104
-Is that okay?
-Go ahead.

275
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,693
In that case, you should leave your room.

276
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,780
That room isn't for a regular employee.

277
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,158
Sure. I will leave right now.

278
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,707
Okay. I heard
you drank a lot yesterday. So--

279
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,667
You can do whatever you want with me,

280
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,961
but leave Eul alone.

281
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:27,799
That includes Eul, Eul's brother
and Eul's friends.

282
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,634
If any one of them gets hurt,

283
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,262
I won't stay still.

284
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,891
You know what I have against you

285
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,393
better than anyone.

286
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,729
-Choi Ji-tae.
-If you have nothing else to say,

287
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:41,980
I'll hang up.

288
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,027
Congratulations on your promotion,

289
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,070
Director Yoon Jeong-eun.

290
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,533
I'll wait

291
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,036
until you come back.

292
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,623
-I'll resign when you--
-That won't happen.

293
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,291
Ever.

294
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,184
Things will become harder.

295
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,104
Starting from extreme headaches, vomiting,

296
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,480
and double vision,

297
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,983
you'll also start having problems with

298
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,818
your motor nerves and sensory nerves.

299
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,247
My bruise looks worse
than it did last night.

300
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,963
Is there a hospital nearby?

301
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:34,843
I think she's hurt.
Could you take her there?

302
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,262
That cold-hearted jerk.

303
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:01,077
Hello, I'm the person
who asked for a raw egg a while ago.

304
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,831
I'm sorry, but may I have another one?

305
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,061
Have you seen

306
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,063
a 5,000 won bill anywhere?

307
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,236
No, I haven't.

308
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:20,448
I'm sure I dropped it here somewhere.

309
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,327
Can you lift your shoes up?

310
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,794
Take them off.

311
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,423
You might be hiding my money
inside your shoes.

312
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,806
This is odd. Where did it go?

313
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,684
This one, too.

314
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,789
I don't believe it.

315
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,084
People say

316
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,128
that you're avoiding me

317
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,797
because you're afraid.

318
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,134
They say that you're afraid

319
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,970
that I'll have a bad influence on you.

320
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,347
But I don't buy that.

321
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,310
How can I?

322
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,438
I know what kind of person you are.

323
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,526
You're not someone
who'd avoid me because of that.

324
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,070
I know that very well.

325
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,498
What do you know?

326
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,459
You don't know me.

327
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,548
I do.

328
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:03,176
I know everything.

329
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,430
I even know
what you're thinking right now.

330
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,018
"I missed you, Eul.

331
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,063
I really missed you."

332
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,525
You're saying that right now.

333
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,112
Things must be easy for you.

334
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,034
You're good at imagining things
for your own sake.

335
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,373
If that makes things easier for you,
keep thinking like that.

336
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,668
I missed you too, Jun-young.

337
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:39,838
A lot.

338
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,840
So much.

339
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,384
Very much.

340
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,387
I almost went crazy.

341
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,350
This is my answer to your thoughts.

342
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,737
See you later.

343
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,116
I'll see you tomorrow and the day after.

344
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,493
I'll see you every single day.

345
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,655
IHWASOO YUKGAEJANG

346
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,458
Did you go pick radishes
and onions yourself?

347
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,084
What took you so long?

348
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,004
Why? What's wrong?

349
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,380
Ms. Sin is really weird.

350
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,216
She served bossam to someone
who ordered yukgaejang,

351
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,177
alcohol to someone who wanted water,

352
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,930
and a ladle to someone
who asked for a spoon...

353
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,183
What's all this?

354
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,732
-What's all this?
-You're the one who bought these.

355
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,111
Should I call a psychiatrist

356
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,364
and set up an appointment
for two patients?

357
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,365
Yes, Yeong-ok.

358
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,659
What?

359
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,891
You don't put sugar in your coffee.

360
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,647
Yes, I do. My taste changed.

361
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,327
Have you been well?

362
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,831
Of course.

363
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,500
Hyeon-jun...

364
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,714
Mr. Choi, have you been well?

365
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,166
What were you doing
at Sin Jun-young's house?

366
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,546
Did you

367
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:15,923
get married?

368
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:29,979
Why did you call me over?

369
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,939
-Is something wrong?
-Well,

370
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,526
I wanted you to come
and have some tea, too.

371
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,819
Please, sit.

372
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,494
This is my husband.

373
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,583
Oh, I see.

374
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,170
Hello.

375
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,505
Hello.

376
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:00,301
Sorry, I didn't know.
I didn't get to greet you properly.

377
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,522
Honey, do you want anything?

378
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,608
No...

379
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,318
Water is fine.

380
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,033
Jun-young is our son.

381
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,457
We've been living apart
because he didn't want

382
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,792
Jun-young to become a celebrity.

383
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,878
But we'll live together soon.
We're still a family.

384
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,340
Oh, I... I see.

385
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:46,389
You must be proud to have a son like him.

386
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:47,807
Yes.

387
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,020
But

388
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:57,900
what were you doing
in front of Jun-young's house?

389
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,569
Well, the thing is,

390
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,866
I owe him a lot.

391
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,954
He saved my life.

392
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,001
My goodness.

393
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,712
How uncanny is this?

394
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,845
He's just like his father.

395
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,515
He's too kind of a person just like him.

396
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,313
Honey.

397
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,815
-Do you want some warm water?
-No, I'm fine.

398
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,066
Honey.

399
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:53,331
DAEHAN JEIL PARTY

400
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,019
What else?
What else do you know about Jik?

401
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,271
We told you about his
family, friends, personality,

402
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,523
hobbies, habits, blood type,

403
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,776
height, weight, clothes and shoe size,

404
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,861
and even what lotion he uses.

405
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,863
We told you everything.
You want to know more?

406
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,698
By any chance,

407
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,909
does he have a secretive past?

408
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,786
Why do you want to know about my past?

409
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,584
Is stalking your hobby?

410
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,253
It's not like that.

411
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,172
NO JIK

412
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,966
You really are No Jik, not Oh Jik.

413
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,427
Then is No Eul really...

414
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,639
Is Producer No

415
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,766
really your sister?

416
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,646
I'll kill you if you ever tell her
anything about me.

417
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,196
I'll pay for that table.

418
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,949
Why are you paying?
I'm buying these for your friends.

419
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,867
She's right. She's bribing us
because she likes you.

420
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,078
She wants us to help her out.

421
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,913
Grandpa, you two look great together.

422
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,081
She's really rich.

423
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:24,088
-Date her, date her.
-Date her, date her.

424
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,923
-How much is it?
-My goodness.

425
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,676
You don't have to. I told you, I'll pay.

426
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,013
Let go of me. Why would you pay for
what my friends eat?

427
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,182
Ha-ru.

428
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,936
Really? Is that right?

429
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,025
She lost her mind?

430
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,070
The doctor says she's fine,

431
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,738
but she doesn't remember a thing.

432
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,950
She doesn't know
who she is or where she lives.

433
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,119
And she doesn't want to go to the police.

434
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,663
-Where's her cell phone?
-She must've lost it.

435
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,957
I can't find it. What do I do?

436
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,260
Hello, do you remember me?

437
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,596
What about him?

438
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,097
No.

439
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,223
What's your name?

440
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,350
-Elsa.
-What's the capital of Korea?

441
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,268
San Francisco.

442
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,895
What year is it right now?

443
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,022
Is it the Shilla dynasty?

444
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,192
What is this?

445
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,276
A cow.

446
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:29,862
I need to talk to you.

447
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,955
She didn't lose her memory.
I think she's just crazy.

448
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,125
What do I do?

449
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,169
I'm saying she's gone crazy for you.

450
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:48,672
I think she's pretending to be insane

451
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,509
because she wants to stay with you.

452
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,013
She must have read a lot of comic books.

453
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,057
That tactic is from the comic book

454
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,601
Queen Of Relationships, volume 13.

455
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,812
I'm nothing, though.

456
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,148
-What?
-I mean,

457
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,567
I'm nothing great, but she's

458
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,486
pretending to be crazy for me.

459
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,490
She looks like she'd be
very popular herself.

460
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,116
She's cute.

461
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,994
That's why she's insane.

462
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,749
Jik, what are you going to do?

463
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,340
"Jik's favorite girl group is GFriend.

464
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,468
His favorite movie
is Memories about Murder.

465
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,595
His favorite song is 'Run the Horse.'

466
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,681
His favorite chicken part is the breast."

467
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,182
These are all wrong.

468
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,561
Everything other than my family
and height is wrong.

469
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,563
My favorite girl group is Fin.K.L.

470
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,607
My favorite movie is Memories of Murder,
not Memories about Murder.

471
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,151
My favorite song is "What About My Age?"

472
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,737
My favorite chicken part is the gizzard.

473
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,537
From now on, instead of asking my friends,

474
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,747
just ask me directly.

475
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,625
I'll tell you.

476
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,128
Jik.

477
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,192
Hello?

478
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,445
Seo Yun-hu is already on standby.

479
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,155
What's taking you so long?

480
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,656
Well, that's...

481
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,298
What do you think you're doing?

482
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,133
This job must be a joke to you.

483
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,137
You must be taking this really lightly.

484
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,350
Are you crazy or what?

485
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:08,437
You're supposed to be filming.
Why are you dressed like this?

486
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:11,565
Well,

487
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,526
I had a small problem.

488
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,278
And why do you have sunglasses on

489
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,239
when you're going to be holding a camera?

490
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,117
Do you think you're an actress?

491
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,372
I'm sorry.

492
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,542
Look at you.

493
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,087
Are you kidding me?

494
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,465
Are you here to work or to fight?

495
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,635
You're the one who made her like that.

496
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,095
You're the one who bruised her.

497
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,555
Guk-yeong.

498
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,317
I'm so sorry.

499
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,487
I'll make sure
this won't ever happen again.

500
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,781
What are you doing? Apologize again.

501
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,617
I'm sorry.

502
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,454
-This won't happen--
-Forget it.

503
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,375
Go home.

504
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,752
-Yun-hu.
-Look at her slippers

505
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,671
and her clothes.

506
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,385
When did you

507
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,178
wash these?

508
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,724
Gross.

509
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,187
I can smell kimchi from your clothes!

510
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,613
Didn't you hear me? Go home!

511
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,657
Come on, Yun-hu.

512
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,290
I just need to film well as a camera crew.

513
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,333
Why do I need to be dressed well?

514
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,711
It's not like I'm going to sleep with you.

515
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,713
-What?
-Hey, No Eul.

516
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,259
You must be insane.

517
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,427
I'm not insane.

518
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,472
This is why people call you a pervert.

519
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,183
This could happen
when we're busy with work.

520
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,059
What's wrong with being dirty
from time to time?

521
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,519
It's not like I'm covered in poop.

522
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,520
Hey, get lost.

523
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,397
Get lost right now.

524
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,692
You should know your place.

525
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,320
Oh, right.

526
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,406
So this is why Jun-young fired you.

527
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:28,494
If you had known that she was insane,

528
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,913
you should've told me earlier.

529
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,508
I didn't know she was your staff member.

530
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,344
If I'd known, I would have told you.

531
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,143
No Eul, was it?

532
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,688
You'll never be able
to work in this field again.

533
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:00,609
I'll do anything to get rid of you
from this field.

534
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,195
-And you.
-Yes?

535
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,613
The same goes for you, too.

536
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,950
How dare you let someone
like her work for me?

537
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,493
Do you want to go out of business?

538
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:12,287
No, it's not like that.

539
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,665
Hey.

540
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:16,667
No Eul.

541
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,003
Hey, you can't just leave like that!

542
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,282
Eul.

543
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,747
Why aren't you at the shooting?

544
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,460
I got fired.

545
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,800
I'm sorry. You tried so hard
to get me into the team.

546
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,513
Let's grab a cup of coffee.

547
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:28,947
You were fired too, right?

548
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,951
The team leader changed to that lady.

549
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,786
I almost got engaged to her.

550
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,291
You almost got engaged?

551
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,211
I called it off on the morning

552
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,255
of our engagement day

553
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,257
and ran over to you.

554
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,314
Do you like Jun-young that much?

555
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,818
Mind your own business.

556
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,320
You always get hurt.

557
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,198
Why do you like him so much?

558
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:13,700
Where's your pride?

559
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,161
The same goes for you.

560
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:20,832
You called off an engagement
just to get hurt.

561
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,127
Why do you like me so much?

562
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:26,963
Don't you have any pride?

563
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,718
It's not an issue of pride.
I'm just being smart.

564
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,723
I know you'll come to me

565
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,727
if I wait long enough.

566
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,817
That won't happen.

567
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,153
You and I can never be together.

568
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,197
You know that better than I do.

569
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,283
Don't be so sure.

570
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,536
You never know.

571
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,835
Should the two jobless people
go back to Seoul?

572
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,294
We can go on a date.

573
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,175
Where are you going?

574
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,178
I quit being Jun-young's manager.
I'm going home.

575
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,304
Are you crazy?

576
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,099
Ms. No was being treated unfairly,

577
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:22,185
and he knew that
she got hurt protecting you.

578
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:23,937
"I didn't know.

579
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,732
If I'd known, I would have told you."

580
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,650
How can he say that?

581
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,194
I will work for Dad
and wash dishes if I have to,

582
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,823
but I won't work with that jerk anymore.

583
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,074
I'm leaving.

584
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,014
Stay still.

585
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,099
-I'll shoot if you move.
-I don't want to.

586
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,643
I'm going to move.

587
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:06,980
Hey.

588
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,273
Shoot me.

589
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,775
Go ahead and shoot.

590
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,401
Shoot me.

591
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,903
Hey.

592
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,447
You should get rid of scum like me.

593
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,032
Shoot me.

594
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,075
Hurry up and shoot!

595
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,369
Tell me!

596
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:25,707
Tell me everyone you killed.
Then you can die.

597
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,167
Tell me!

598
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:41,973
Hey, why are you hitting me?

599
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,768
This isn't in the script.

600
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:48,063
Hey, wait! Stop!

601
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,190
Someone stop him.

602
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,942
Cut!

603
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,136
Excuse me. May I have some plastic bags?

604
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,429
I have wet clothes.

605
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:22,973
Please wait.

606
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,101
Our keys, please.

607
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,894
Is the shooting already over?

608
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:29,938
I thought you were shooting
through the night.

609
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,941
There was an accident, so it got canceled.

610
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,498
I read it wrong.
I thought I had to hit him.

611
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,543
Yun-hu is about to sue you.

612
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,045
The producer is talking to him, but...

613
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,380
Tell him to sue me.

614
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,468
I hit someone.
I should pay for what I did.

615
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:08,018
Sin Jun-young.

616
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,111
Wait.

617
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,828
You should apologize to him

618
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,830
before the reporters find out.

619
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,835
Sin Jun-young.

620
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,463
Yun-hu did something like this
to me before.

621
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,884
I broke my nose back then.

622
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,221
He didn't apologize to me.

623
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,266
"When actors

624
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,560
are shooting something,

625
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,897
things like this can happen."

626
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:55,899
That's what he said.

627
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,817
We barely started filming.

628
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,319
Do you want to call it off?

629
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:04,741
Let's call it off.

630
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,243
I don't care.

631
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,536
I care.

632
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:12,248
This is my first project
after becoming a team leader.

633
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,514
The doors are closing.

634
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,018
Which hospital is he at?

635
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,118
I'm sorry.

636
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:49,869
Forgive me.

637
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,371
No.

638
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,082
-Yun-hu.
-I'm sorry.

639
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,292
I wasn't so focused,
and I read the script wrong.

640
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:58,920
You made a mistake like that before,
didn't you?

641
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,215
He came to apologize, so forgive him.

642
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:04,050
I said, no.

643
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,553
He did this on purpose.

644
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:07,929
No way.

645
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,348
Why would I do that on purpose?

646
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,142
I really like you.

647
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,228
-Kneel, then.
-Yun-hu.

648
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,063
I'll forgive you

649
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,940
if you kneel down.

650
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:20,608
What?

651
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,445
-Can't you do that?
-Seo Yun-hu.

652
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,238
You're awful.

653
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,865
What's with you?

654
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,914
I'll kneel down.

655
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,043
I will kneel down instead.

656
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,975
Forgive me, Yun-hu.

657
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:57,187
Be the bigger man.

658
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,897
Let's be friends

659
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,356
and shoot this movie.

660
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:37,936
You did it because of me, right?

661
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,231
Seo Yun-hu.

662
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,399
You hit him because of me.

663
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,652
You did it for me.

664
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,113
You must be imagining things again.

665
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,032
Go take some medicine and sleep.

666
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,378
I'm right. You did it because of me.

667
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,547
Why do you pretend like you don't care?

668
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,549
Why are you being so mean?

669
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,979
I haven't slept since yesterday.
I'm going to sleep.

670
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:23,731
Please leave.

671
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,694
If this is some kind of joke,

672
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:29,529
go ahead and continue.

673
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,699
Whatever you do, I won't get hurt.

674
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:35,410
I won't get upset or misunderstand you.

675
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,703
Go ahead and carry on.

676
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,305
Do you want to sleep with me?

677
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,153
If that's not what you want, tell me now.

678
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,491
I'll open the door for you.

679
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:07,794
Take this and send Ji-tae
back to his fiancée.

680
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,088
You and Ji-tae are both insane.

681
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,881
I sold you for a billion won.

682
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,216
How dare you sell me.

683
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:16,010
What are you trying to protect
by stooping so low?

684
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:20,223
Sorry, but would you mind driving me?

685
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,725
I don't stand a chance.

686
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,352
Why can't I take the money?

687
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,564
You don't know anything about life!

688
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:30,400
I feel so sorry for Jun-young.

689
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:33,695
Shall I give up everything else
and just do what I want before I die?

690
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,197
If you're that sorry, die.

691
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,865
Take your own life!
