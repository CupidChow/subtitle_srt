1
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:27,652
YEAR 2006

2
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:28,820
Who is helping me?

3
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,864
It's Eul from the hotteok stall.

4
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:34,159
The weather is so cold today.

5
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,952
You should have just stayed home.

6
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,914
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

7
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,709
-Goodness. Thank you.
-Grandma.

8
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,628
-Don't freeze to death just to look good.
-I'm fine.

9
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,755
-Here.
-My goodness.

10
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,841
What will you be left with
if you give me all this?

11
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,260
I'm boiling hot.

12
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,095
I feel so bad.

13
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,472
I'll get the rest of the boxes.

14
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,807
Go and enjoy a date
with the grandpa at the dry cleaners.

15
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,936
You look way too good
to just go straight home.

16
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:18,703
That's 2,100 won for the hotteok
plus 1,000 won for the tteokbokki.

17
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,538
It's 3,100 won in total.

18
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,041
Hey, you don't have to pay.

19
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,209
Eul.

20
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,211
Don't say that. Give me the money.

21
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,755
Mr. Handsome, you have a runny nose.
How embarrassing.

22
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:29,923
Blow.

23
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,674
There you go.

24
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,676
Don't pay for the food.

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,180
I told you
that anything you want is yours.

26
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,559
Go on home.
Don't make your dad and brother wait.

27
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,269
-Thank you.
-Wait.

28
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,313
TTOEKBOKKI, ODENG, HOTTEOK

29
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,608
You're too generous.

30
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,276
Are you a saint?

31
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,822
Are we rich? Does money grow on trees?

32
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,281
Do you know how much debt we're in?

33
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,618
His dad got hurt at a construction site
and can't work.

34
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,994
Do you want to take his money?

35
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,372
I do. I desperately do.

36
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,835
Your own dad can't even afford
to buy new clothes.

37
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,420
I lost so much weight
because I barely eat...

38
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,218
If we could get the money
you practically give away,

39
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,138
I wouldn't have to sell food
in the freezing cold!

40
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,015
I'd be in a building with central heating

41
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,893
-sitting in a chair--
-Eul! No Eul!

42
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,104
What's up with her?

43
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:30,150
The bullies called Mun-hui to the gym
to beat her up.

44
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,277
How dare they try to hit her!

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,279
-I should just--
-Stop!

46
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,072
Don't you dare go there.

47
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:40,285
Didn't I tell you not to get involved
in other people's business?

48
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,619
She isn't just some other person.

49
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,746
Mun-hui is my friend.

50
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,456
-Let's go.
-Okay.

51
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,041
Eul...

52
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,626
Eul!

53
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,255
Do you think you're a rescue team?
Or a cop?

54
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,590
Or Wonder Woman?

55
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,801
Try to care for me
as much as you care for others!

56
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,470
What a brat.

57
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,683
I hope she slips on a sheet of ice.

58
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,944
SIN JUN-YOUNG, YEAR 2 CLASSROOM 6,
10-DAY SUSPENSION

59
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,487
What's going on?

60
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,324
What happened?

61
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,783
A suspension?

62
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,869
Why would he be suspended?

63
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:23,995
Mrs. Sin!

64
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,080
Mr. Principal.

65
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,415
Why...

66
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:30,043
She's the mother of the student
we just suspended.

67
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,712
What did Jun-young do wrong?

68
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,716
A group of boys tried to bully this girl,

69
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,677
so he stepped in and hit them,
telling them to stop.

70
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,846
He got hit as well!

71
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,098
You should reward him instead.

72
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,434
Why did you suspend him?

73
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,518
Mrs. Sin.

74
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:51,481
You're a witness,
so tell them what you saw.

75
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,693
Tell them Jun-young is being
unfairly punished for helping you.

76
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,612
Tell them everything.

77
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,991
Why won't you speak?

78
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,827
Mrs. Sin, according to her statement,

79
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,247
the boys did not bother her at all.

80
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,624
They were just standing around talking

81
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:14,003
when your son barged in
and picked a fight with them.

82
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,838
How...

83
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,174
That's impossible.

84
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,097
Is that...

85
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,809
Is that what you really said?

86
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,728
Why did you lie?

87
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,400
Did your parents tell you to?

88
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,486
Instead of standing up

89
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,572
for a poor widow's son
who saved your life,

90
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,574
you decided to defend the rich kids?

91
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,743
Are you hoping
you'd get something in return?

92
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,247
-Did your parents tell you to do that?
-Mrs. Sin.

93
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,916
You bitch.

94
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,295
You ungrateful brat! How dare you!

95
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,673
-Mom!
-You can't do that to her!

96
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,516
Please

97
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,227
cancel the punishment.

98
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,189
My son will become a prosecutor.

99
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,984
This punishment will remain on his records

100
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,611
and that will ruin his whole future.

101
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,864
I promise I will set him straight.

102
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,534
I will make sure
he never throws a punch again.

103
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,871
Please...

104
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,874
Please take it back, sir.

105
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,753
Please, sir.

106
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,423
Hey.

107
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,009
Did you hear Jun-young got suspended?

108
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,179
It was his fault for getting involved
without knowing his place.

109
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,190
-Can I ask you something?
-What's he on about?

110
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,818
Don't you get it? We're powerful people.

111
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,864
We're nobles that commoners like you
must never touch.

112
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:05,948
So,

113
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,869
a nobody like me

114
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,455
interrupted something

115
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,334
you, young masters of noble birth,
were planning.

116
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,669
Don't you think

117
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,297
it shouldn't have ended with
a mere suspension?

118
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,674
So I thought

119
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:28,596
I should just utterly crush one of you

120
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,849
and get expelled instead.

121
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,269
Any volunteers?

122
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,816
Sit up straight.

123
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,901
You still haven't
got your head on straight.

124
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,279
-What would change if I did?
-What?

125
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,531
Would the others

126
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,367
get punished equally regardless
of who their dads are?

127
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,203
What? How dare you.

128
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,830
Because you were raised
by a single mother,

129
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,582
I was trying to show you some pity.

130
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,376
Why are you showing me pity?

131
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,045
-What right do you have, sir?
-Let go.

132
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,672
What's wrong with you?

133
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,590
-I should just--
-Stop right there!

134
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,094
Stop that if you value your job
and your life.

135
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,390
You're beating him like he's a drum.

136
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,018
If you keep beating one that hard,
it'll break.

137
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:20,064
If you keep belittling and mocking him,

138
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,067
I will call his father over.

139
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,863
You wouldn't dare stay seated
if his dad showed up.

140
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,656
You'd be down on the floor

141
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:32,827
begging him for your life
and his forgiveness.

142
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,788
-Jeong-sik.
-Jeez. Is that true?

143
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,585
Call the father then
so I can finally meet him.

144
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,129
I wonder what he's doing

145
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,756
when his son is such a mess.

146
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,509
-I'm quite curious.
-Very well, then.

147
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,596
He's incredibly busy
working for the government.

148
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,599
But if he were to hear his son
was getting hit,

149
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,518
he'd leave everything to come over.

150
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,770
-Stop it, Jeong-sik.
-Keep quiet.

151
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,314
Jun-young's father

152
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,983
will crush the other kids' dads.

153
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,861
A member of the city council?
The chief of police?

154
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,490
-They'd all be dead!
-I said stop it!

155
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,872
A dead man can't come here.

156
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,958
That's just nonsense.

157
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,045
DNA was found

158
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,380
on a steel pipe at the suspect's factory.

159
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,717
Other than that of the seven victims
we knew about,

160
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,554
we found the DNA
of two more female victims.

161
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,308
We handed the DNA samples over to...

162
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,351
Eat the tofu

163
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,478
so you can stay out of prison.

164
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,439
Don't lie about my dad again.

165
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,732
Well...

166
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,109
It might not be a lie.

167
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,487
This was not just a fire.

168
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,823
It was arson intended to destroy evidence.

169
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,785
Do you have evidence
to support that claim?

170
00:08:58,829 --> 00:08:59,705
What if

171
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,124
he is your father?

172
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,669
The fire did not spread up the walls--

173
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:08,589
What if that famous prosecutor
is your father?

174
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,216
I'd kill him.

175
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,594
He abandoned my mom and me

176
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,931
and he's doing just fine.

177
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,977
-He's even on TV.
-It's not on purpose.

178
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,354
Your dad doesn't even know you exist.

179
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,856
Your mom hid the fact she was pregnant
and ran away.

180
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,525
How would he know you exist?

181
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,617
What do you mean by that?

182
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:40,997
Gosh.

183
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,876
I mean...

184
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,795
I just meant

185
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,549
that could be a possibility, that's all.

186
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,092
You know...

187
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,679
Goodness.

188
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,974
I couldn't think straight because of you.

189
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,351
I just blurted out
whatever came into my head.

190
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,355
Where are you going? You need to eat.

191
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,065
I'm going to ask my mom.

192
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,569
-About what you said.
-Don't.

193
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:15,489
You know what she's like.
If she heard what I said about him,

194
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,533
she'd go crazy and kill my whole family.

195
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,828
She'll kill both my kids, I know it.

196
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,204
Sit down.

197
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,209
PROSECUTOR CHOI HYEON-JUN
IS INVESTIGATING THE CRIME

198
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,921
Your father hid

199
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,175
the fact that he was studying law.

200
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,679
He worked as a waiter at a bar.

201
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,056
And your mom

202
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,017
worked in the kitchen there.

203
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,772
The two of them fell in love.

204
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,191
Your mother

205
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,278
had barely graduated from middle school,

206
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,782
but she was incredibly pretty.

207
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,617
Jun-young,

208
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,370
if your mom

209
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,830
finds out I told you this,

210
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,833
she will kill me, so don't tell her.

211
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:08,959
Okay?

212
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,602
One day,

213
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,605
Choi Hyeon-jun's older brother came by.

214
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,524
He told your mom,

215
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,736
"Hyeon-jun goes to the best university
in Korea,

216
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,322
and he will become
a prosecutor or a judge.

217
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,617
He's not the kind of man a woman like her

218
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,539
who didn't get much education
should dream of dating."

219
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:47,748
Mom.

220
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,293
Your mom

221
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,337
acts like she's strong and fierce,

222
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,757
but she's actually soft-hearted and kind.

223
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,758
Do you know that?

224
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,512
She's also great
at knowing where she stands.

225
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:06,308
If she had to die for your father,
she would have.

226
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,646
What are you doing out here?

227
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,190
Were you waiting for me?

228
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,945
Why did they release a bully
who beats up other people?

229
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,074
They should have locked you up.
Why would they let you go?

230
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,785
There are so many criminals,
there was no room for me.

231
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,663
They told me to come back later.

232
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:28,998
What?

233
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,334
Did you skip dinner?

234
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,003
I'm hungry, too.

235
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,007
I don't have food for you!

236
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,051
If you're hungry, go back
and ask the prison guard to feed you.

237
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:49,059
Prison guards work in prisons,
not police stations.

238
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,354
What should I do with you?

239
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,245
Aren't you offering any to your own son?

240
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,714
You get the worst grades in your class,

241
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:22,801
but your mom insists
on making you a prosecutor.

242
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,597
It's all because of your father.

243
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,099
She wants to make you a prosecutor

244
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,811
and then introduce you to your dad.

245
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,775
She wants to show him
that even without his help,

246
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,029
she raised you well to be just like him.

247
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,573
She wants to show off.

248
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:58,963
I'm not getting tutored anymore.

249
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,715
Fire the tutor tomorrow.

250
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,309
We pay 300,000 won a month in rent.

251
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:15,104
How can we pay a tutor
1.5 million won a month?

252
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,278
Why did you help the girl?

253
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,905
Since when did you care so much
about justice?

254
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:29,076
You wouldn't have cared
even if someone died in front of you.

255
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,411
Exactly.

256
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,580
I just lost my mind for a while.

257
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,250
I found out you work at a bar
to afford the tutor.

258
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,466
Gosh.

259
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,730
Forget about it.
I'm just as dumb as you are.

260
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,691
No amount of tutoring
can make me a prosecutor.

261
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,778
Fine. I won't care what you do
with your life!

262
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,488
You can fight for a living,

263
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,575
or fight and end up in prison for years.

264
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,661
Do whatever you want! Punk.

265
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,372
Number three.

266
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,750
ANSWER: 4

267
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,860
It's Sin Jun-young. Oh, my gosh!

268
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,824
-He's getting off.
-Hey!

269
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,367
Get out of my way.

270
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,953
-Darn. Did you see that?
-Gosh.

271
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,539
Gosh, he took the seat.

272
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,462
You must get a lot of offers
from entertainment companies.

273
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,175
You'll find out when you sign with us

274
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,178
that we're not like
all the other entertainment agencies.

275
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,555
If you'll spare me some time...

276
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,347
Hey.

277
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,437
Why did you ignore me?

278
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,108
I passed you seven notes
asking you to see me.

279
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,447
You're not my type.

280
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,950
You're not mine, either.

281
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,082
Ever since you rejected her,

282
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,126
Na-ri stopped eating and drinking.

283
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,544
What will you do?

284
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,129
Must I do something?

285
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,465
Because of you,
my friend won't eat or sleep--

286
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,467
What does that have to do with me?

287
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,138
-She said she wants to die.
-Let her die then.

288
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,682
If she dies, I'll kill you!

289
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,565
I'm telling you, it's serious.

290
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:56,153
She won't eat, sleep or go to school.
She just cries.

291
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,155
Can't you help out?

292
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,992
Bring her back to health
and then dump her.

293
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,370
-Just until she's ready to--
-Is this your job?

294
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,040
How much do you get for this?

295
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,833
Hey.

296
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,098
What are you doing?

297
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,477
I think you're sick.

298
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,437
Get some help.

299
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,191
Shall I call your parents?

300
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,830
Gosh. Stop crying.

301
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,292
You need to eat.

302
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,589
I brought some of my dad's
hotteok and tteokbokki.

303
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,759
I won't eat.

304
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,552
Just let me

305
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,764
waste away like this and die.

306
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,142
Why do you want to die
over a jerk like him?

307
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,103
Is he the only guy alive?

308
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,065
You're our famous neighborhood beauty.

309
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,651
Shall I line up all the boys who like you?

310
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,486
I don't care unless it's Jun-young.

311
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,325
Eul, I envy you.

312
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,911
He isn't your type.

313
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,623
I envy you because you can choose
not to like him.

314
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,953
What are you doing here,
getting your hair done?

315
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,706
I'm going to confess my feelings.

316
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,877
To who? The boy you have a crush on?

317
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,175
-Make me so pretty that he'll fall for me.
-Got it.

318
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,308
Hello, pretty Na-ri.

319
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,020
Remember the pink dress
that you wore last time?

320
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,356
Can I borrow it for just three hours?

321
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,447
It's for an important occasion.

322
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:49,117
I might get a boyfriend really soon.

323
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,830
I'll tell you if you lend me the dress.

324
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,668
Okay, I'll come over for it in a bit.

325
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,930
Sin Jun-young,

326
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,849
my name is No Eul.

327
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,269
I've liked you for a long time.

328
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,484
I know you're really popular
with the other girls,

329
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,821
but I am your destiny.

330
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:31,076
You can't get away from...

331
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,956
I'm not actually going to say that.

332
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,972
Jang-su,

333
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,766
did you sell a lot of hotteok today?

334
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,518
You little brat.

335
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,270
Are you drunk?

336
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,231
Why would a high school kid get drunk?

337
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,567
Can't a girl try to be cute for her dad?

338
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:46,818
What is it now?

339
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,029
Do you need money?

340
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:53,825
Do you have a friend
who can't pay her tuition fees?

341
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,996
Are we rich? Does money grow on trees?

342
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,956
Do you know how much debt we're in?

343
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,876
Dad,

344
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,462
buy me a drink.

345
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,674
You've lost your mind.
Go home and go to bed!

346
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,849
I guess we're family after all.

347
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,810
He knows I lost my mind right away.

348
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,948
Did I wake you, Jik?

349
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,368
I'm waiting for Dad. It's a surprise.

350
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:58,598
I'll spend some time with Dad.
Wash up and go to bed.

351
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,706
Shit.

352
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,885
Dad!

353
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,517
Hey!

354
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:44,978
You!

355
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,355
Stop!

356
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,736
Hey!

357
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,322
Stop!

358
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,769
Choi Hyeon-jun speaking.

359
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,604
It's me, Yoon Seong-ho.

360
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,444
Hello, Mr. Yoon.

361
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,616
Just a moment.

362
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,670
Is something wrong?

363
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,756
My daughter is in trouble.

364
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,841
I need your help.

365
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,353
-We have to close now.
-Okay.

367
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,917
The person who hit your father
turned himself in.

368
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,977
Are you saying he hit my father?

369
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,271
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

370
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,483
No. It wasn't him.

371
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,195
My father was hit by a female driver.

372
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,906
It was a red sports car,
plate number Seoul-3G-3126.

373
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,366
I'm sorry. I deserve to die!

374
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,703
Why are you saying you deserve to die?

375
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,079
It wasn't you.

376
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,583
You didn't hit my father!
Why are you lying?

377
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,757
I'm just leaving the subway station.

378
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,177
I thought the roads would be too busy
so I rode the subway.

379
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,556
I left my car in the office parking lot.

380
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,059
I'll be there in ten minutes.

381
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:15,188
Tell that to the chief prosecutor for me.

382
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,775
Oh, no.

383
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,985
It's raining.

384
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,321
Oh dear.

385
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:26,825
Gosh.

386
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,168
Are you going to the Prosecutors' Office?

387
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,838
Yes. How do you know that?

388
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,382
You're a famous prosecutor.

389
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,008
I saw you on TV.

390
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,516
I want to become a prosecutor.

391
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,522
I plan to go to the university
you went to.

392
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,484
You must be doing very well in school.

393
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,195
Well...

394
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,866
Your parents must be proud.

395
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,495
You have a goal,

396
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,748
and you have enough determination
to reach it.

397
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,877
I have children as well,

398
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,129
and kids these days are useless.

399
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,632
They have no goals or principles,

400
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,342
and no perseverance at all.

401
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,930
I envy your parents.

402
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,736
The rain stopped.

403
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,991
I guess it was just a passing shower.

404
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,660
Have a nice day, sir.

405
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,495
Thank you.

406
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,923
I'd love to see you
as a prosecutor one day.

407
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:07,884
Yes, sir.

408
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,686
Hey.

409
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,774
I hate being in someone's debt.

410
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:25,234
Can you spare me ten minutes?

411
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,530
Yes, I think I can.

412
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,050
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

413
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,733
She vandalized your car, sir.

414
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:12,073
Did my car wrong you in any way?

415
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,078
I came here over 20 times,

416
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,080
but you avoided me with excuses

417
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,290
that you were busy or not in.

418
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,378
I thought this would be the only way
to get to see you.

419
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,216
-Send everyone out.
-Yes, sir.

420
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:39,642
So,

421
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,229
why did you have
to take such measures to see me?

422
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,652
My father's hit-and-run case.

423
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,946
The case shouldn't be closed like this.

424
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,240
You don't have the criminal.

425
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,868
The man who confessed didn't do it.

426
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,873
A rant like that won't really help.

427
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,459
Let's see.

428
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,294
In an organization,

429
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:10,757
there are duties, responsibilities
and hierarchies.

430
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,551
I don't know why you want to see me,

431
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,512
but I can't interfere with every detail.

432
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,431
The detective said so.

433
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,018
That everything changed
after you interfered.

434
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,687
The suspect changed, the car changed,

435
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,982
the statements
and the prosecutor in charge changed.

436
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,489
Will you give the detective
a message for me?

437
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,909
If he has time to pen a lame novel,

438
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,327
he should focus on his job.

439
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,913
He thinks someone powerful is behind this.

440
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,539
That there's nothing we can do.

441
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,167
He said someone like me
couldn't win this fight.

442
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,419
So, I should keep quiet and settle.

443
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,963
I don't have enough time to go on

444
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,591
listening to a third-rate novel.

445
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:58,262
I'm sorry to send you away
when you traveled so far.

446
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,349
I never told you

447
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,768
where I live or where I'm from.

448
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,065
You knew who I was.

449
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,567
That's why you avoided me.

450
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,154
You hid the real criminal and covered up--

451
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,074
You're wearing a uniform
I've never seen before.

452
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,661
I assumed you go to a school
far from here.

453
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,123
Go home now.

454
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,584
You're my daughter's age,
so I was being nice,

455
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,461
but this is where my patience ends.

456
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,658
I envy your parents.

457
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,088
Are you that happy?

458
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,594
Someone has been starving for days
because of you

459
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,555
-but you look so happy.
-Haven't you seen a doctor yet?

460
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,766
Someone as dangerous as you
shouldn't be unsupervised.

461
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,977
Why on Earth does she like you?

462
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,607
I would have snapped both her legs
if she were my daughter.

463
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,491
Our country is a mess because
jerks like you want to be prosecutors.

464
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,912
I heard you dumped Na-ri because
you wanted to focus on your studies.

465
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,874
You don't even rank 200th in your school!
Why do you even bother studying?

466
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,888
Don't meet women and don't date women.

467
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:07,600
Don't even get married.
Waste your whole life studying.

468
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,102
If you study until you are 80,

469
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,813
then maybe you might pass the bar exam.

470
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,956
I'm sorry you had to wait.

471
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,834
Here. It's a gift for keeping me dry.

472
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,087
Hold on.

473
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,756
What's your name?

474
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,591
We're bound to meet again.

475
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,510
I should autograph it for you.

476
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,262
Some other time.

477
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,555
I'll study hard

478
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,685
and come back with a bar exam certificate.
Give it to me then.

479
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,271
I'll give you my name then, too.

480
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,940
Okay, then.

481
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,819
I'll keep this for you until then.

482
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,448
Okay. Thank you.

483
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,763
Sorry, but could you sit somewhere else?

484
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,097
We're friends.

485
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,641
We're not friends.

486
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,244
Try seducing me then.

487
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,164
No boy who's madly in love

488
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,500
would put studying over his crush.

489
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,045
He'd only do that
if he didn't like her that much.

490
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,382
See if you can seduce me.

491
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,052
Make me too crazy to study

492
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,389
so that I'd give up
trying to be a prosecutor.

493
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,401
If you won't seduce me, I'll seduce you.

494
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,708
Please take a look. Thank you.

LOOKING FOR WITNESSES OF A HIT-AND-RUN

496
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,225
HIT-AND-RUN BY CAR
WITH PLATE NUMBER SEOUL-3G-3126

ON DECEMBER 5TH, AROUND 1:50 A.M.
LOOKING FOR THE DRIVER OF A HIT-AND-RUN

498
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,412
Eul, are you asleep?

499
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,415
No, I'm not.

500
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,210
Goodness. I'm so sleepy.

501
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,046
Did your parents find a part-timer?

502
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,591
-Why?
-Can I take the job if there's no one yet?

503
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,135
Are you out of money?

504
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,471
Your dad's hospital bills must be huge.

505
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,015
I just have to work.

506
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,017
Why don't you settle?

507
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,562
-He didn't do it.
-Isn't that Sin Jun-young?

508
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,897
Yes, that's him.

509
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:09,068
-What is he doing here?
-Is that for someone here?

510
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,116
Gosh! It's really him!

511
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,035
Is he here to see Na-ri?

512
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,079
To apologize for dumping her?

513
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,080
Does he

514
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,040
want her back?

515
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,584
It's none of your business,
stay out of it.

516
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,964
Gosh, you're not
in a position to say that.

517
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,203
I skipped school
because it's our 100th day together.

518
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,205
And you're just going to ignore me?

519
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,124
What? Our 100th day?

520
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,709
Who?

521
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:12,381
Congratulations.

522
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,009
I love you, Eul.

523
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,777
You're so cute.

524
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,156
I keep thinking of you
and I just can't concentrate.

525
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,994
-Na-ri.
-Na-ri!

526
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,371
-Na-ri!
-Na-ri.

527
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,081
Na-ri.

528
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,419
We might as well go public.

529
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,797
You did nothing wrong. I'm the jerk.

530
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,467
You're crazy! What are you talking about?

531
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,969
Be quiet. I'll deal with it.

532
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,763
Sorry about this, Na-ri.

533
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:02,890
Things just happened.

534
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,392
Find a guy way better than me.

535
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,167
What's gotten into you?

536
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,795
You've barely laughed in your whole life.

537
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,298
Did you see a turd roll by or something?

538
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:39,927
Not a turd.

539
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,096
I gave someone a warning.

540
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:45,724
"You little brat,
you picked on the wrong guy."

541
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,352
What are you saying?

542
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,775
-Jeong-sik.
-What?

543
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,236
Why am I such an evil jerk?

544
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,654
Who do I take after?

545
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:06,328
Did you overuse your brain?
What's wrong with you?

546
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:11,500
Something really is wrong with you.

547
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:15,671
I think you should quit studying
for your own sake.

548
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,798
Studying isn't for everyone.

549
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,467
What should we do with you?

550
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,344
Stop laughing!

551
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,763
What a jerk.

552
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:25,722
Who?

553
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,808
Sin Jun-young.

554
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,644
What should I do about him?

555
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,521
Jun-young?

556
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:33,981
He's not even a human being.

557
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:37,693
He's anything but a human being.
He's a jerk.

558
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,737
Dad, Eul is saying bad words.

559
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:45,409
I wasn't cursing.
I'm just merely stating a fact, Dad.

560
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,244
It looks like

561
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,664
I stole a friend's boyfriend
and now everyone hates me.

562
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:53,834
Dad,

563
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,587
wake up and take revenge for me.

564
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,381
You want him to wake up
to take revenge for you?

565
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,300
How old are you?

566
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,135
I'm older than you.

567
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:06,263
Dad, wake up and buy me a pizza.

568
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,640
One with sweet potato and bacon
with cheese crust.

569
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:12,769
You want him to wake up
to buy you a pizza?

570
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,605
That's why you're a kid.

571
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,065
Go and watch Pororo.

572
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,904
Dad, I need you to wake up.

573
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:25,240
Use your hotteok spatula
to slap Jun-young--

574
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:33,248
-Dad.
-You shouldn't say things like that.

575
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,126
Dad, wake up and tell her off.

576
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,294
Dad!

577
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,172
Nurse!

578
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:56,688
Patient No Jang-su,
time of death is 11:40 p.m.

579
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,946
No!

580
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,573
Dad, don't die!

581
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:10,786
Doctor, please save my dad!

582
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:14,915
-Eul, tell him to save Dad.
-Dad.

583
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:18,001
Tell him to save Dad.

584
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,545
I'm sorry.

LOOKING FOR WITNESSES

586
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,410
The hotteok guy is dead.

587
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,371
What? Wasn't he in a hit-and-run recently?

588
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,999
Goodness. He didn't wake up in the end.

589
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,001
I feel bad for Eul.

590
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,420
My mom said

591
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:04,423
that she disappeared with her brother
before the funeral.

592
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,341
Why? Where did she go?

593
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,553
I don't know where they went.

594
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:13,181
They found out after he died
that he took a huge loan.

595
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,934
Her mom was sick for a long time
before she died.

596
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,519
Why did they disappear?

597
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,938
To get away from the loan sharks.

598
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:23,233
They came after he was dead
and threatened those poor kids.

599
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,987
-It wasn't a pretty sight.
-Aren't you dating her?

600
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,323
Didn't she tell you anything?

FUNERAL SERVICES INFO

602
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,000
LATE NO JANG-SU
FAMILY: NO EUL, NO JIK

603
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,879
How dare you come back here?

604
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:47,966
We all chipped in to pay for the ceremony.

605
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,303
We paid because
you wouldn't let the kids hold a funeral!

606
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,430
You're human scum.

607
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:57,351
Isn't it enough
that you chased Eul and Jik away?

608
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,811
Are you back for our money now?

609
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,772
No one chased them away.

610
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:04,274
They took our money and disappeared.

611
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,817
They didn't take it.

612
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,445
Where would they even
get the money to pay you back?

613
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:11,198
Don't you have a family? Or children?

614
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,034
Darn it. Why did they borrow from us then?

615
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,870
They should sell their bodies
or something to pay us back.

616
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:20,374
-How dare you!
-Don't you dare say that!

617
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:44,898
The victim of the hit-and-run

618
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,858
died last night.

619
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,698
The man who turned himself in

620
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,741
was let off with a two-year probation.

621
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,743
The case is closed.

622
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,708
Thank you for your work.

623
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:07,212
I will never forget what you did for me.

624
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,507
How is your daughter doing?

625
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:13,260
I sent her abroad that same night.

626
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,679
She was a complete wreck.

627
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:20,308
She needs some time off
to travel and recuperate.

628
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,268
I see.

629
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:22,894
It's just

630
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,605
one small mistake.

631
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,734
We'll still become in-laws, won't we?

632
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,031
Of course.

Here!

637
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:24,080
Well done. Try harder and
let's beat Ho-cheol next time.

638
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,540
-Yes, ma'am.
-Good.

Jun-young.

642
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:37,844
He improved incredibly in this exam.

643
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,849
His ranking climbed over 100 places.

644
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,190
-Gosh.
-Not again.

645
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,109
It's such a pity no one else is here
to see that.

646
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,694
He sleeps whenever he can.

647
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,114
Give him a few minutes and he dozes off.

648
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,493
You're so young but you're so feeble.

649
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,328
Will you ever be able

650
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:05,789
to support a wife and kids?

651
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,500
Me? Support a wife and kids? No way.

652
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,461
-They can support me.
-What?

653
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:17,592
-You idiot.
-Too bad there's no one else to see this.

654
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,885
Give me that.

655
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:23,056
Hurry up already.
Let's not keep the teachers waiting.

656
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,767
Yes, ma'am. Get to work!

657
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:27,394
That hurts, Dad!

658
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,979
It was meant to hurt.

659
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:31,022
I wasn't trying to tickle you, moron.

660
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,440
Will you stop cursing?

661
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,485
Stop calling your own son names.

662
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,196
-I'll tell Mom if you don't stop.
-Go on.

663
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,782
Get lost. I can't stand the sight of you.

664
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,493
She must have been really sick of you

665
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:46,663
if she sent you to me
and then cut off contact

666
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:49,624
after raising you herself
for over 20 years.

667
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:53,670
She sent me to you because she was upset

668
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,422
that her new guy favored his son over me.

669
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,590
Jeez, Jeong-sik!

670
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,842
Can we please hurry?

671
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,555

00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,267
I hope it's to your liking.

Jun-young's grades have improved so much.

684
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,628
He improved more
than any student in his year.

685
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:38,173
As a mother,
I have to do something, right?

686
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,425

-"Your debt."

688
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,722

-Gosh, I told her to use easy words.

00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:47,510
Thank you, Jun-young.

713
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,613
Did you change your mind?

714
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,909
Is that why you're back?

715
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:14,913
You know

716
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,582
I'm not doing this

717
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,503
just so I can work or something.

718
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:26,216
This documentary will work wonders

719
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,053
to change your image of an arrogant punk.

720
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:34,682
-To be honest, the more you earn--
-Don't you recognize me?

721
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:39,854
I do.

722
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,315
You're Sin Jun-young.

723
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:46,361
-Even my landlady's children know you.
-No Eul.

724
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:50,615
Do you not recognize me?

725
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,035
I do.

726
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,206
You jerk.

727
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,132
But so what?

728
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,386
Will you do the documentary if I say so?

729
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,639
You won't.

730
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,603
You'll just be the same jerk
you always were.

731
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,360
Thanks for this.

732
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,279
It'll come in handy.

733
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,233
There's no way she is Eul.

734
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:09,777
She must not be Eul.

735
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,126
That girl

736
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:26,920
cannot be

737
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,214
my Eul.

738
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,960
Are you looking at me?

739
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,549
You should go to a hospital, then.
Why are you here like this?

740
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,550
Be quiet.

741
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,510
Were you doing something bad?
You look surprised.

742
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,762
If a scumbag like you
becomes a congressman,

743
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:20,139
this country will be doomed.

744
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,433
Don't run away, you criminal.

745
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,352
I'm in a really bad mood.

746
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,395
Come here right now.

747
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:29,107
Honey, are your classes over?

748
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,733
We were very passionate.

749
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,610
We used to date.
