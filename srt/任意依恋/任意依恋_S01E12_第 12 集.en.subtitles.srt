1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,592
In one, two, three, go.

2
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,261
On a green field

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,012
On a green field

4
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,639
I'll build a picturesque house

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,391
I'll build a picturesque house

6
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,435
And live with my love

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,311
And live with my love

8
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,772
-Let her sing.
-For 100 years

9
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,774
For 100 years

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,484
We'll sow seeds in the spring

11
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,319
We'll sow seeds in the spring

12
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,988
Flowers bloom in the summer

13
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,322
Flowers bloom in the summer

14
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,991
Whenever my mom was in a good mood,

15
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,201
she would sing this song.

16
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,872
In winter, I'll be happy

17
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,498
"On a green field,

18
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,500
I'll build a picturesque house

19
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,919
-and live with my love
-Jun-young, come on in.

20
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,338
for 100 years."

21
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,592
That's how the song began.

22
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,220
So I don't know since when,

23
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,348
but I naturally started to have a dream.

24
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,517
A dream of building

25
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,603
a picturesque house on a green field

26
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,646
and living there happily

27
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,941
for a long, long time with my love.

28
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,652
Live with my love for 100 years

29
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,542
Even when I found out
I didn't have much time left,

30
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,086
I didn't give up on my dream.

31
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,466
I only

32
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,593
shortened the time from 100 years

33
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,637
to three months.

34
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,687
NO EUL

35
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,897
There's

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,941
five meters left.

37
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,776
There's

38
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,528
four meters left.

39
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,240
THERE'S THREE METERS LEFT

40
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,658
THERE'S TWO METERS LEFT

41
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,080
THERE'S ONE METER LEFT

42
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,415
It may not be 100 years,

43
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,668
but I will spend

44
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,504
the time I have left

45
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,549
loving the person I love.

46
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,511
So let's not be sad

47
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,555
or upset.

48
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,857
THERE'S 20KM LEFT

49
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,983
THERE'S 19KM LEFT

50
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,109
THERE'S 18KM LEFT

51
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,318
THERE'S 17KM LEFT

52
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,240
THERE'S ONE METER LEFT

53
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,580
There's zero distance left.

54
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,669
Let's give up.

55
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,754
Jun-young won't show up.

56
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,214
It's over.

57
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,174
It's really over.

58
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,057
LET'S GIVE UP
JUN-YOUNG WON'T SHOW UP. IT'S OVER

59
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,578
LET'S GIVE UP
JUN-YOUNG WON'T SHOW UP. IT'S OVER

60
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,552
What did you mean? Where are you going?

61
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,267
I'm planning to leave Korea.

62
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,070
But now,

63
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:01,074
I'm going to give up...

64
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,177
on the last dream I ever had.

65
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,768
I won't spend the rest of my life

66
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,063
living in a picturesque house with Eul.

67
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,698
Instead, I will return
the truth and justice

68
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,617
that I took from her.

69
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,705
Lend me 10,000 won.
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

70
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,040
What about the 50,000 won
you borrowed last time?

71
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,584
I'll pay you everything back tomorrow.

72
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,795
Lend me 30,000 won while you're at it.

73
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,173
Hey, I'm not an ATM.

74
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,264
Here. It's for the food you bought me.

75
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,558
Who really hit Mr. No Jang-su?

76
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,059
Who do you think it was?

77
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,936
They caught the culprit.

78
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,272
I don't mean the man
Choi Hyeon-jun stated as the culprit.

79
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:15,982
Who's the real culprit?

80
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,942
What's the matter with you?

81
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,902
Go while I'm asking politely.

82
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,573
I can sue you for obstruction of business
and invasion of privacy.

83
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,162
So when I'm gone,
I hope the world Eul will live in

84
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,831
is going to be like a warm
and clear spring

85
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,584
that comes

86
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,421
after a long, cold winter.

87
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,261
You are not going anywhere.

88
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,096
Get off right now, Eul!

89
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,894
Get out, Eul!

90
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,980
Hyeon-u.

91
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,650
I'm sorry about this.

92
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,112
Can you open the trunk, please?

93
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,447
Sure.

94
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,493
No, don't unload my bags.

95
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,537
Unload her stuff.

96
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,081
Hyeon-u.

97
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,168
Jik, can you take her suitcase upstairs?

98
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,920
-Hyeon-u.
-Now.

99
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,463
Okay.

100
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,218
Tell me later why
you disappeared for so long.

101
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,679
I will.

102
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,223
Jik, wait.

103
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,474
See you.

104
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,642
Jik!

105
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,235
What are you doing?

106
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,653
Where were you until now?

107
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,946
You don't have to run away.

108
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,280
Stay here.

109
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,282
Did Na-ri talk to you?

110
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,451
I found out somehow.

111
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,330
I heard Mr. Choi's wife threatened you

112
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,042
and that she's the reason why
you're running away.

113
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,629
Then don't stop me.

114
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,007
Losing my dad was enough.

115
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,968
I won't lose Jik.

116
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,266
What are you going to do
if I miss my flight?

117
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,602
Jik, bring back all the bags!

118
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,687
Eul.

119
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,941
You should leave
and just pretend not to know me.

120
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,110
If you end up getting hurt
because of me, then--

121
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,319
I'll stop it!

122
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,280
I'll stop it.

123
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:31,617
Those people are much scarier
than you think.

124
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,079
They aren't the kind of people
we can deal with.

125
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,289
They're my parents!

126
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,131
Choi Hyeon-jun is my father.

127
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,759
Lee Eun-su is my mother.

128
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,847
I am their son.

129
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,148
That one was funny.

130
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,359
Your jokes are usually really lame.

131
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,445
Wait.

132
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,740
You weren't joking?

133
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,742
No.

134
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,869
I wasn't.

135
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,958
But your name is Lee Hyeon-u.

136
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,002
Your surname should be Choi
if you're his son.

137
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,337
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,548
I deceived you.

139
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,890
Eul.

140
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,183
Don't come closer.

141
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,353
-No Eul.
-Don't come closer.

142
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,313
Don't come any closer.

143
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,461
What did you do?

144
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,339
-What?
-I took her USB

145
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,259
and almost got her killed.

146
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,219
It was terrible,
but at least I did something.

147
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,430
But what did you do?

148
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,474
What did you do

149
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,686
when your parents

150
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,774
threatened her and tried

151
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,611
to send her abroad?

152
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:42,642
Where's the fiancé? He's ten minutes late.

153
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,312
It must be the traffic.

154
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,132
MOM

155
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,822
He's not picking up?

156
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,743
Has he gone insane?

157
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,567
It's your daughter's birthday, right?

158
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,028
-Go away while I'm being nice.
-Even if you weren't,

159
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,738
I wouldn't until you tell me
who really did it.

160
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,452
What do you mean?

161
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,078
I told you that

162
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,998
the real culprit turned himself in.

163
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,046
This coat of yours,
it doesn't suit you at all.

164
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,466
It's ruining your handsome looks.

165
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,855
I can give you all my coats later,
why don't you take them?

166
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,447
I told you not to come here.

167
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,865
I'm her dad, I had to come.

168
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,033
Her dad?

169
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,035
You're not a dad.

170
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,205
You have no right to call yourself that.

171
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,458
Bo-ram doesn't consider you
her dad, either.

172
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,543
So go away.

173
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,309
Goodness!

174
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,144
-I don't believe this.
-What?

175
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,563
Give me my cell phone.

176
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,233
Sin Jun-young's in room 6101.

177
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,526
-Really?
-Yes.

178
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,403
He said he's Sin Jun-young,

179
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,988
but he's way more handsome.

180
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,282
-My goodness.
-Let's go.

181
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,366
Come on.

182
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,915
-Is it really him?
-Unbelievable.

183
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,001
Happy birthday, Bo-ram.

184
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,212
It really is me.

185
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:48,345
My goodness.
What should I do to convince you all?

186
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,312
"Hello, my sister."

187
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,355
-You sounded like him.
-Right?

188
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,691
-It must be him.
-You're right.

189
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,277
Didn't you watch any of my dramas?

190
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,114
You have to know this, then.

191
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,327
"Don't give me that look.

192
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:12,995
It makes me nervous."

193
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,955
"Hello, new kid."

194
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,166
I knew it.

195
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,877
I knew you were the smartest
the second I walked in.

196
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,798
-Awesome.
-But how does a famous person like you

197
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,884
know Bo-ram?

198
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,721
I'm a fan of Bo-ram's dad.

199
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,224
Her dad used to be a prosecutor

200
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,602
that I respected more than anyone.

201
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,898
Is that true?

202
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,609
Do you really respect him
more than anyone?

203
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:47,363
You bet. Of all the people I know,

204
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,324
your dad is the bravest, most just,

205
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,661
most handsome and the greatest man.

206
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:59,333
His only flaw
is his poor sense of fashion.

207
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:07,174
If only my dad were
as great a guy as Bo-ram's dad.

208
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,134
Hey, Cha Bo-ram.

209
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,303
I envy you so much.

210
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,271
Here you are.

211
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,526
That's gross.

212
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,112
Why are you eating something
that fell on the floor?

213
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,366
Why did you lie to her?

214
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,285
I didn't lie.

215
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,665
I do respect you more than anyone,

216
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,584
except for my mom.

217
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,307
"About No Jang-su's hit-and-run.

218
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,644
Someone else will take the fall.

219
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,813
So cover up the investigation

220
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,940
and follow my orders from now on.

221
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,901
Then your sick daughter

222
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,321
will get operated
at the best hospital in Korea

223
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,906
and it'll all be paid for."

224
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,616
-Stop it.
-That is what

225
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,203
the senior prosecutor at the time,
Choi Hyeon-jun,

226
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,415
said to you, the prosecutor in charge.

227
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,585
-Look, Mr. Sin.
-"Look, Mr. Choi.

228
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,797
Must I cover up the truth
to save my daughter's life?

229
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,258
I can't do that."

230
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,510
That is what you said.

231
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,514
For that, you got demoted
to a regional office.

232
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,935
You couldn't stand the stigma
against you, so you quit your job.

233
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,147
You were seen as a father who abandoned
his family for a petty conscience.

234
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,525
So your wife divorced you
and your child distrusts you.

235
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,486
Use your ridiculous script for a drama.

236
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,409
I don't have

237
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,746
much longer to live.

238
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,624
When I die,

239
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,544
the truth will die with me.

240
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,629
So,

241
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,133
take off the burden
you have to carry forever

242
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,220
and give it to me.

243
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,433
What do you take me for?

244
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,686
Keep that stupid plot for your next drama.

245
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,772
You insane jerk.

246
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,443
Congressman Choi Hyeon-jun

247
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,404
is my father.

248
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,076
He doesn't know

249
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,329
that I'm his son, though.

250
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,083
And...

251
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,130
Mr. No Jang-su,
the victim of the hit-and-run,

252
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,800
is the dad of the woman I love.

253
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:05,978
I'm well-known for holding grudges
and never letting things go.

254
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,022
If I die without doing anything,

255
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,317
I'll become a ghost
and haunt you every night.

256
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,820
That's not a lie.

257
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,858
Who is it?

258
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,904
My name is No Eul.

259
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,489
Please let me in.

260
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,825
No one is at home.

261
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,912
That's a lie.

262
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,706
Let me in.

263
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,334
It's true. No one is at home.

264
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,086
I must speak with the congressman
and his wife.

265
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,631
Let me in.

266
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,551
I promise you that no one's here. Go home.

267
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,327
I know that this is pointless

268
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,248
and I know that you can crush me
like I'm nothing.

269
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,417
That's why I told my dad

270
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,419
to hold back

271
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,924
and to forget about it all
and die in peace.

272
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,218
If it bothers him that much,

273
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:05,681
he can be born again
as a rich and powerful man.

274
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,849
That's what I told him.

275
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,730
I meant to disappear from your lives.

276
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,734
You wanted me gone,
so I was going to get lost.

277
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:22,322
I was going to live in silence
and out of sight

278
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:26,618
as if I were dead, just like you wanted.

279
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,871
But why are you doing this?

280
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,583
Why did you send your son to spy on me?

281
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,544
Did I scare you that much?

282
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,754
What's so scary about me?

283
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,798
I'm a huge coward.

284
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:44,928
You could walk all over me
and I'd never make a sound.

285
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:50,434
People like you are the scary ones,
not me!

286
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,649
Eul.

287
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,943
Are you okay, Mom?

288
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,237
Should we go to the hospital?

289
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,905
I'm fine.

290
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,199
I'm really fine.

291
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,620
How could Ji-tae do this?

292
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,873
Him of all people.

293
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,667
How could he insult you and Dad so badly?

294
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,127
Is he on something?

295
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,755
Ms. Kim.

296
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,633
He could have been in a car accident.

297
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,927
Check with the police and hospitals again.

298
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,220
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,580
-Where's Dad?
-He's probably with Mr. Yoon.

300
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,625
I heard that Jeong-eun's dad
is really scary.

301
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,586
You don't think he'll hit Dad, do you?

302
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,224
I don't know what to say.

303
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,685
I haven't raised him well.

304
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,853
Is Ji-tae

305
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,481
seeing someone else?

306
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,733
No, sir.

307
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,487
He wouldn't do something like this.

308
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,115
-I'm sure something urgent--
-Just send

309
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,575
Ji-tae

310
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,746
to Jeong-eun before the day ends.

311
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,790
This marriage

312
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:41,461
can't be broken by you or anyone else
without Jeong-eun's consent.

313
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,213
We'll be the ones to decide.

314
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,888
However late it is,
as long as you get him to her,

315
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,683
the two can still get engaged.

316
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,852
Mr. Yoon.

317
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,368
-Hello.
-Hello.

318
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,289
How did the ceremony go?

319
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,129
What do you take me for?

320
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,299
How dare you put me in a dress like this.

321
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,633
What do you mean?

322
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,178
Did something go wrong?

323
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,848
I couldn't get engaged
because of this lame and cheap dress.

324
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,683
It's all because of this dress!

325
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:41,813
I got humiliated in front of everyone,
and I didn't even get engaged!

326
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,106
Ms. Yoon.

327
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,691
Don't, Ms. Yoon.

328
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,568
-Don't do that.
-Ms. Yoon.

329
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,111
Stop her.

330
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,454
Are you okay?

331
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,124
Aren't you hungry? Should we go eat?

332
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,004
Hyeon-u.

333
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,631
Yes?

334
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,716
If I see you,

335
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:56,346
your parents would be really upset, right?

336
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,182
I guess so.

337
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,518
If I were to date you,

338
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,312
your parents

339
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,898
would feel devastated.

340
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,817
Right?

341
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:12,988
They would.

342
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,533
It could be

343
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,372
the greatest way

344
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,875
to get back at them.

345
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,295
Right?

346
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,305
Then let's date.

347
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,011
You drank too much, Ms. Yoon.

348
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,554
Ms. Yoon.

349
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,225
How dare you boss me around.

350
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,935
Know your place.

351
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,864
Why can't I get drunk today?

352
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,326
Hey, wake up. Hey!

353
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,462
You still have a lot of things to do.

354
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,174
You can't die without my permission.

355
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,342
Okay?

356
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,889
Ms. Yoon!

357
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,022
-Ms. Yoon.
-My goodness.

358
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,524
-What happened?
-Get her inside.

359
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,693
Careful.

360
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:40,987
It's too late.

361
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,866
There's no evidence or witness.

362
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,828
There's no legal way to catch the culprit.

363
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,913
I told you that

364
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,166
I'll do whatever it takes
to catch the person.

365
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:56,044
Just tell me who did it.

366
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,475
Please tell me before it's too late.

367
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,907
It's Daehan Jeil Party's representative

368
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,243
Yoon Seong-ho's daughter,

369
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,161
Yoon Jeong-eun.

370
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,478
I have one now.

371
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,107
A bucket list I want
to fulfill before I die.

372
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,820
Sin Jun-young's bucket list.

373
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,655
This is exciting.

374
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,199
Shall we begin, then?

375
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,619
Sure. Let's begin.

376
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:58,249
-Cut. That was great.
-Yes!

377
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,294
Mr. Yoon is a veteran for a reason.

378
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,254
The show jumped to a whole new level.

379
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:07,508
The camera angles and movements
are just perfect.

380
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,093
Don't you think so, Guk-yeong?

381
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,306
Yes, everything's different for sure.

382
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,807
Go, Mr. Yoon!

383
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,559
Go, Mr. Yoon!

384
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,187
Nothing has changed.

385
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,357
He and Ms. No are pretty much the same.

386
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,733
Man-ok.

387
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,860
Why are you hitting me?

388
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,529
You must be hungry. You skipped lunch.

389
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,697
Yes, well...

390
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,577
I can get something
to eat on the way back.

391
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,914
If you aren't in a hurry,
you can eat with us.

392
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,624
Let's order Chinese food.

393
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,000
I'll have jjamppong.

394
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,462
Okay, I'll have jajangmyeon.

395
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,797
Order tangsuyuk too.

396
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,215
Okay...

397
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,925
Jjamppong.

398
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,401
Mr. Yoon.

399
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,153
-Good job.
-Pardon?

400
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,489
I guess you prefer
to dip it in the sauce too.

401
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,909
Sorry. I reacted instinctively.

402
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,662
Mr. Namgung is so selfish.

403
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:21,249
I told him many times that I prefer
to dip them in the sauce separately.

404
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,960
You did. Sorry.

405
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,671
I'm a birdbrain.

406
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,549
I'm too stupid to run an agency.

407
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,969
Guk-yeong, I'll retire.
Do you want to take over?

408
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,639
I don't think I'm cut out for this job.

409
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,976
Man-ok, have you ever seen

410
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:43,062
someone become so awkward and sincere

411
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:46,649
over whether tangsuyuk sauce
should be poured or dipped?

412
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:51,696
Someone I know even wants to resign
from being a president of a company.

413
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,324
I think he's overreacting

414
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:59,412
because he feels bad
he replaced Ms. No with Mr. Yoon.

415
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,872
That's correct.

416
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,623
Were you whispering that?

417
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,208
I heard it very clearly.

418
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,798
Speak freely.

419
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,508
Everyone here knows about it.

420
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,012
Mr. Namgung, just act
like you normally do.

421
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,224
You're new here, Mr. Yoon.

422
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,310
Let's all shoot a great show.

423
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,854
We like eating tangsuyuk the same way.

424
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,898
We'll get along very well.

425
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,570
Let's do this.

426
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,497
-Sir.
-Hi, can I come in?

427
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,585
This place reeks of a jobless person.

428
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,920
What brings you here?

429
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,007
Did you eat jajang ramyeon?

430
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,051
-How did you know?
-Down here.

431
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,268
-Ms. No.
-Yes?

432
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,815
I'm here because Mr. Choi sent me,

433
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,192
but I really can't do it.

434
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,401
Can't do what?

435
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:16,239
The next time you see Mr. Choi,

436
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:20,118
tell him that I really tried
to make you take the job,

437
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:23,996
but that you refused.
Could you tell him that?

438
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,040
-Please.
-What?

439
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,333
Please.

440
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,172
Wait.

441
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,801
What's the job?

442
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,887
It's something you can't do.

443
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,848
A VJ for Seo Yun-hu's movie.

444
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,601
Why can't I do that?

445
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,728
Haven't you heard the rumors?

446
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:52,316
He's mean, meticulous and a hygiene freak.

447
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,611
He even decides what kind of perfume
his staff members can wear.

448
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,406
The basic measurements
of the women around him

449
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,533
are all 34-24-35 inches in body size

450
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:04,120
and they're pretty enough
to debut as celebrities themselves.

451
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:08,207
Plus, they always shower
at least twice a day.

452
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:12,712
Why? Because Yun-hu despises
dirty and smelly stuff.

453
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,883
So what?

454
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:17,967
What?

455
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:23,014
I guess you never look at mirrors.

456
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,689
Up here too.

457
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:37,069
Take a long break while you're at it.

458
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,865
I'll find a job that's perfect for you.

459
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,618
So talk to Mr. Choi for me.

460
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,620
Please help me. See you.

461
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,582
She should at least wash her face.

462
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,193
Sir.

463
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,028
It's No Eul.

464
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,531
I'll be Seo Yun-hu's VJ. Sign me up.

465
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,202
I'm going to stay and fight
instead of running away.

466
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,622
If they threaten to kill me...

467
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:32,917
Well...

468
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,878
It's hard to kill a human being.

469
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,385
Let's discuss it again tomorrow afternoon.

470
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,888
Resign, Choi Hyeon-jun!

471
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:49,684
Resign, Choi Hyeon-jun!

472
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,144
We have a right to live!

473
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:56,232
We have a right to live!

474
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,986
You said you'd fight
for justice and the common people.

475
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,531
You just got rid of the shop
I owned for 20 years.

476
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,074
How is that justice?

477
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:09,412
Do you think we voted for you
to do things like this?

478
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,372
Resign, Choi Hyeon-jun!

479
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,166
Resign!

480
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,505
Let me ask you one thing.

481
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,049
The stores you're talking about,

482
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:25,678
were they licensed
by the local government?

483
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,306
Well...

484
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:33,561
We didn't need a license to do business
for all these years.

485
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,396
You're not making any sense.

486
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:40,026
It's illegal to operate
an unlicensed street stall.

487
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,111
You could be jailed for two years

488
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,031
or fined up to seven million won.

489
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,661
The city and the local lawmakers,
including me,

490
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,080
tried our best to prevent this.

491
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,124
We gave you time

492
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,793
-and tried to--
-Are you sure

493
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,213
you did your best and gave them time?

494
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,393
RIGHTS TO LIVE

495
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,313
Maybe you hired as many contractors
as you could

496
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,440
to chase those people out

497
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,109
by using the least amount
of money possible.

498
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,448
It was the legal use
of governmental authority for the majority

499
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,824
of citizens' convenience and--

500
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,035
Is romanticizing violence for convenience

501
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,912
and ruining their livelihoods

502
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,872
for the sake of the majority

503
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,458
what you call justice, congressman?

504
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,217
What about

505
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:51,222
the rent and tax
that they never paid for years?

506
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,183
What about the damage that will affect

507
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,560
the legal store owners who paid all that?

508
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,230
If those who obey the law incur losses,

509
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,023
who would want to abide by it?

510
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,150
Would that society be just?

511
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:07,113
They'd want to obey the law
if only they could.

512
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:10,574
Then they wouldn't have
to deal with discrimination

513
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,993
and constant threats
of losing their income.

514
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,539
Stop trying to pretend
you have an open mind, Mr. Choi.

515
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,751
You've never experienced
what their life is like,

516
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:26,090
so pretending to know and care
makes me very uncomfortable.

517
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:29,593
You were once like them
yet you pretend you never were.

518
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,847
You ignored their plight.

519
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,181
Is that not a discomfort?

520
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,311
From what I know,
your parents owned a street stall as well.

521
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,563
RESIGN, CHOI HYEON-JUN

522
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,232
How could he do this to us?

523
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,213
Did you sort things out?

524
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:09,925
Sort what out?

525
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,893
A man can feel confused
before a life-changing event.

526
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,812
I did too.

527
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,191
You're probably not sure
if it's the right thing to do.

528
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,401
You'll feel nervous.

529
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,362
The responsibility can be overwhelming.

530
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,156
I won't marry Jeong-eun.

531
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,034
No Eul...

532
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,244
Is it because of her?

533
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,920
I will no longer live my life
for you or Mom.

534
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,382
I will not do anything
that will benefit you,

535
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,303
please you or make you smile.

536
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,264
I won't do any of the sort.

537
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,766
Ji-tae.

538
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:03,312
DAEHAN JEIL PARTY

539
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,189
Regardless of my skill set,

540
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,442
if you want me out of the house
or the company, say so.

541
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,445
I will leave right away.

542
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,393
THE TIME OF THE WOLVES

543
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,734
What is this?

544
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,694
A movie my company will invest in.

545
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:37,781
I was going to put Ji-tae in charge of it,
but you should do it.

546
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,661
We're family now.

547
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:48,626
I was dumped by him.

548
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,336
When?

549
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,547
We never called it off.

550
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,591
-Mother--
-That day,

551
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,177
the engagement went as planned.

552
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:03,182
Your dress was beautiful
and you, even more so.

553
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,776
You are my daughter-in-law no matter what.

554
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,069
So from now on,

555
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:18,906
I will share my company's workload
with you.

556
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:23,243
I will also tell you
the secrets and disgraces

557
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,954
that only our family knows.

558
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,395
THE TIME OF THE WOLVES
SEO YUN-HU

559
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,479
Get changed.

560
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:52,356
I'm playing a detective.

561
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,442
I can't wear a tracksuit.
Isn't there anything else?

562
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,777
How about this?

563
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,779
Give it to your boyfriend.

564
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,572
Find me something else.

565
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,282
Where's my cell phone?

566
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,581
You really don't
take me seriously, do you?

567
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:14,253
You hired a producer who got fired
from Jun-young's documentary crew.

568
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,425
My goodness.

569
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:23,053
I take you very seriously.

570
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,306
Why would I look down on
the biggest Hallyu star...

571
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,105
Actually, there's a reason
she left the documentary crew.

572
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,023
She's the best in the field,

573
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,277
but Jun-young kept trying
to make a move on her.

574
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,571
She got sick of it and quit.

575
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,032
Is she that amazing?

576
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:49,329
I heard that Jun-young
has incredibly high standards.

577
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,581
Not at all.

578
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:53,041
See for yourself.

579
00:45:56,128 --> 00:46:00,132
You heard Jun-young
has a perverted taste, right?

580
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,259
Almost everyone knows about it.

581
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,515
The producer is great at what she does,

582
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:12,561
but don't expect
or hope for anything more.

583
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,272
Someone stopped her from entering the set

584
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,399
thinking she was a homeless woman.

585
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:22,863
Another person tossed her a coin
thinking she was a beggar.

586
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,942
Who are you?

587
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,860
Hello.

588
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:05,364
I'm No Eul and I'm here to film you
behind the scenes.

589
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,282
Nice to meet you.

590
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,456
Are you keeping watch?

591
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,209
Yes, I am.

592
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,048
Get lost.

593
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:27,052
Clap once when Jeong-sik comes in.

594
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,099
What are you doing in secret

595
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,142
with Yong-deuk standing guard?

596
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,228
-I'm not doing anything.
-Really?

597
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,230
Step aside.

598
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:41,358
You're packing a lot of food.

599
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,818
Who is it for?

600
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,362
Are you seeing someone?

601
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:46,530
What are you talking about?

602
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,991
Move. Get out of the kitchen.

603
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:53,120
-Get out.
-Then is it for Jun-young?

604
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,080
As if.

605
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:56,206
Don't go.

606
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,043
All he does is scream at you.

607
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,754
Why should you bring him food?

608
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:03,964
Whether he eats ramyeon

609
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,092
or fills his belly with water
is none of your concern.

610
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:11,346
"Whether he eats ramyeon
or fills his belly with water"?

611
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,390
Don't say that about my son.

612
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,434
Whether I bring him food

613
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,020
or get him anything,
mind your own business.

614
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,938
-Stop--
-Yeong-ok.

615
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,316
I'll start the car.

616
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,192
They look so heavy.

617
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,445
You can't take all this in a taxi.

618
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:30,616
You're giving him this, right?
Shall I take it to the car?

619
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:32,826
Come on out.

620
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,202
Gosh.

621
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,133
Stay right here until you hear a clap.

622
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,218
I'll unload everything, okay?

623
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,262
No, it's fine.

624
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,817
My goodness.

625
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,612
You never listen, do you?

626
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,699
I'll be in the sauna across the road.

627
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:14,076
Call me when you're done.

628
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,244
It's fine.

629
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,705
Let's go.

630
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,501
You came all the way here. Say hello.

631
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,544
Watch him eat your food.

632
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:28,131
I said it's fine. I'm just going to go.

633
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,141
Are you ashamed to see him?

634
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,812
Are you embarrassed to see your son?

635
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,231
What are you talking about?

636
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,066
Go on inside.

637
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,107
Yeong-ok.

638
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,116
My goodness. Stop it, will you?

639
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:38,160
You're really making me want to slap you.

640
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,787
-Go on inside.
-I don't want to.

641
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,080
Let's just go.

642
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,249
-I told you already.
-Sin Yeong-ok.

643
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,686
Is that you?

644
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,430
Let's go.

645
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:41,890
Bye.

646
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,559
What are you doing here?

647
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:45,769
Jik.

648
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:50,023
There are some scary people out there.

649
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,650
Someone might hurt you.

650
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,819
You're the scariest-looking person here.

651
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,739
Who would hurt me? I'm not a kid.

652
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,449
Well, you know...

653
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,410
I'm not saying someone will,

654
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:07,082
but I'm scared someone might hit you
with a car like last time.

655
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,292
Let's go. Shouldn't you be at work?

656
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,837
I will go back after I walk you home.

657
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,296
Let's go.

658
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,631
Stop right there.

659
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:20,554
Who's the weirdo?

660
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,348
What weirdo? Me?

661
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,476
-Why are you here?
-To see you.

662
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,648
Why are you ignoring me?
Can't you text back?

663
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:34,109
Is it so hard to write a reply?

664
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,862
I thought you hurt
your fingers or something.

665
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:39,281
We aren't close enough to text each other.

666
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,449
Are you putting up a wall?

667
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,663
I thought we'd gotten quite close.

668
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,582
-No?
-Not at all.

669
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,418
-Dream on.
-Who are you, lady?

670
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,587
Why are you holding Jik's hand?

671
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,671
Me?

672
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,133
We're close enough to hold hands.

673
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:01,595
-What?
-And we're close enough to do this.

674
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,721
What?

675
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,472
I can even

676
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,600
-What?
-do this.

677
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,728
So tell me, who are you?

678
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,187
Why are you--

679
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,148
I like him, okay?

680
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,167
No...

681
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,251
No...

682
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,377
No.

683
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,467
Cut. Okay.

684
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:47,766
Well done, everyone. You did great.

685
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,435
Let's pack up.

686
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:54,272
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

687
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:10,914
Thank you.

688
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,503
Hyeon-u.

689
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,227
You don't have to overdo it like this.

690
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:39,859
I'll do it.

691
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,154
Aren't we dating?

692
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:08,847
Don't try too hard.

693
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,642
You can work for people
other than Seo Yun-hu.

694
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,276
This should be illegal.

695
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,529
An engaged woman shouldn't be this pretty.

696
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,240
You still talk so sweetly.

697
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,875
Thanks so much
for agreeing to be in the movie.

698
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,626
It's a great script.

699
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,463
I felt bad it was put aside
due to the lack of funding.

700
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,300
So...

701
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:50,013
Aren't you being too good of a fiancée?

702
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,390
Can't I be?

703
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,895
Who's the other actor?

704
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,564
It's not easy to play a psychopath.

705
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,610
Kim Su-chan. He'll join the team tomorrow.

706
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:04,903
Really?

707
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,404
That's great.

708
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:11,201
He's not as big of a star as Jun-young,
but his acting is on par.

709
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,244
I heard he's a decent guy, too.

710
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,622
Jun-young's such a jerk that--

711
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,040
Is someone badmouthing me?

712
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:28,885
Why are you here?

713
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:31,096
To shoot a movie. With you.

714
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,305
I'm the psychopath.

715
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,890
You turned the role down.

716
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,392
I'm not that irresponsible.

717
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,853
I finish what I started.

718
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:43,274
I might be a jerk,
but I'm not as bad as you.

719
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,943
-You little--
-Yun-hu.

720
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,237
Answer your phone.

721
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,577
Seo Yun-hu speaking.

722
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:59,124
Hi, Hui-jin. I'm in Namhae for a shoot.

723
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,292
-What?
-What's wrong?

724
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,795
Is she in your hotel room?

725
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,134
I have to go. I'll call you.

726
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:14,472
There are reporters everywhere. Watch out.

727
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,229
I apologize for the intrusion. Bye.

728
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,107
We've met before.

729
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,945
I was going to pretend not to know you.

730
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:32,991
I'm Yoon Jeong-eun.

731
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,246
I'm Sin Jun-young.

732
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,081
You must know that, though.

733
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,739
I will look after Eul.
Just look after yourself.

734
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,950
You can't even take care of her.

735
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,245
How dare you...

736
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:01,955
How dare someone like you...

737
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,124
You're not doing the movie
for Ms. Yoon, are you?

738
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,626
Do I look like I'm joking?

739
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,044
I don't believe it.

740
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,295
What do you know?

741
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,005
You don't know me.

742
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:13,925
She lost her mind?
I think she's just crazy.

743
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,802
If any one of them gets hurt,

744
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:17,762
I won't stand still.

745
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:20,390
No human being should do such a thing.

746
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,141
That cold-hearted jerk.

747
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,143
You should get rid of scum like me.

748
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,064
You'll never be able
to work in this field again.
