1
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,495
This woman standing next to me

2
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,206
is my wife

3
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,669
from this moment on.

4
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,016
Through joy,

5
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,810
sorrow,

6
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,941
difficulties, sickness, aging

7
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,822
or any other hardships that may come,

8
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,329
I won't let go

9
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,498
of my wife's hand

10
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,044
that I'm holding right now.

11
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,829
Hey!

12
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,413
Traitor!

13
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:08,211
How dare you meddle with the boss' woman?

14
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,796
She has always been my girl.

15
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:10,839
What?

16
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,842
What was that?
What gibberish is he saying?

17
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,635
Let's go home.

18
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,762
Kill him. Let's do this.

19
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,473
Let's go!

20
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,425
Honey!

21
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,265
Let go of me!

22
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,497
Let go!

23
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,007
Hey!

24
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,324
Hey!

25
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,946
No!

26
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,925
I don't want to die.

27
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,346
This isn't Hollywood.
Who dies from a gunshot these days?

28
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,062
Why didn't he die?

29
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,939
Director.

30
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,776
-It's so cold.
-Could you get her a jacket?

31
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,862
Director.

32
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,783
What is this all of a sudden?

33
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,662
You agreed to film this
knowing that you'd die in the end.

34
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,915
-I changed my mind.
-What?

35
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,752
I can't die like this.

36
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,756
Please edit the script.

37
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,635
My goodness.

38
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:50,933
Girls, why did you come all the way here?
What's wrong with you girls?

39
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,603
Move aside. You'll hurt yourselves.

40
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,897
They came all the way here
on this cold day.

41
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,066
Damn it.

42
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,860
My goodness, he's such a prince.

43
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,071
And I'm serving the prince.

44
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,624
-What happened?
-The writer said

45
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,459
she won't edit it

46
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,711
and she doesn't care
whether it gets aired or not.

47
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,131
She got really angry
and said she'll get rid of Jun-young

48
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,966
-from the industry.
-What are you going to do?

49
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,676
What are we going to do?

50
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:32,308
But how can she
get rid of a huge star like Jun-young?

51
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,186
She's the one who might end up losing.

52
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,562
It's all over the Internet now.

53
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,773
"Sin Jun-young is on bad terms
with the writer."

54
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,776
"The show may not air
because the star refused to act."

55
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,445
"Sin Jun-young's bossy,"
"Sin Jun-young's rudeness"

56
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,988
and "Sin Jun-young never dies."

57
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,365
You look excited.

58
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,450
Do I?

59
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,997
I'll go meet the director.
You go stop the reporters.

60
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,627
Hey, he didn't say anything
about the script last week.

61
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,587
He was fine with dying back then.

62
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,923
He was excitedly talking about it.

63
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,758
This is why he's crazy.

64
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:10,346
"Sin Jun-young, you're a rude punk.
You still have a lot to learn."

65
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,101
That's what one of the comments said.

66
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,895
There are worse ones.
Do you want to hear them?

67
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,272
Where's Jun-young?

68
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,399
The patient, Yu Jong-sun,
in room number 2011,

69
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,651
seems to have
an atypical parkinsonism disorder.

70
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,737
Take another blood sample
and do an examination.

71
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,242
Mr. Sin Jun-young.

72
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,462
I couldn't get any sleep last night

73
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,924
while thinking this through.

74
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,723
-It doesn't make sense.
-What doesn't?

75
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,641
The fact that

76
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,271
I only have another year or so to live

77
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,233
due to a disease
even modern medicine has no cure for.

78
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,323
Do you even know how healthy I am?

79
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,951
I can run 100m in 11 seconds.

80
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,204
It takes me 30 minutes
to climb up Mount Cheonggye.

81
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,373
I sleep well and I eat well.

82
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,626
Other than a few headaches,
I'm completely fine.

83
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,630
I see.

84
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,349
Did you by any chance...

85
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,189
get me confused
with my character in that drama?

86
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,398
No.

87
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,858
I didn't.

88
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,874
It may be a misdiagnosis.

89
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,255
That often happens
to incompetent doctors, right?

90
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,967
If you can't trust me,

91
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,261
I can refer you to another doctor.

92
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,528
What if I say...

93
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,409
that I refuse to die?

94
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,748
I don't care if you're a doctor.

95
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,169
How do you know when I'll die?

96
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,591
What if I say I refuse to die?

97
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,429
What happens then?

98
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:01,142
Jun-young, just quietly die
just this once, please?

99
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:07,565
They already filmed the scene
of your cremation.

100
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,158
If you keep saying that you won't die,
things will get very serious.

101
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,994
This has to air tonight.

102
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,455
Do you really want to cause a problem?

103
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,835
I will get you scripts
with only happy endings from now on.

104
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,129
So let's just do this.

105
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,382
Please don't be a hassle just this once.

106
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,427
Can you just die without making a scene?

107
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,735
DL Corporation
illegally dumps industrial waste.

108
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,071
Scene 17, film one.

109
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,705
What is it?
Did someone make fun of your weight?

110
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,708
Write their names down.

111
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,045
-I'll get back at them.
-Jun-young is dead!

112
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:23,766
The last episode of his drama just ended.

113
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,144
He was shot

114
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,438
-during the wedding scene!
-How old are you?

115
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,149
You shouldn't be crying
over a fictional character.

116
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,484
Jun-young!

117
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,277
My goodness.

118
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,238
You're--

119
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,783
I'm hanging up. Don't call me.

120
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,734
Why are there only two guys?
I thought I saw three--

121
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,468
Open the door!

122
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,095
I have to go to the restroom!

123
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,266
Open the door!

124
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:52,188
Damn it. Who are you to lock me up?

125
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,316
You're criminals
who dump wastewater illegally!

126
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,902
You're worse than a brute!

127
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,283
If you don't open this door,
I'm going to pee right here!

128
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,422
There's a restroom in here, too.

129
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,385
You illegally dumped wastewater

130
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,055
and took away my belongings by force.

131
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,557
Also, you've threatened me
and locked me up.

132
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,018
-Do you also murder people?
-Of course not.

133
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,521
Mr. Kim.

134
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,619
I am Yang Jun-ho,
a director of this company.

135
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,955
You look like a college student,

136
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,082
but you are very infamous
in the industry you work for,

137
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,001
Producer No Eul of SNU Production.

138
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,711
My goodness.

139
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,590
You erased everything I recorded today.

140
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,135
Did you film anything?

141
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,012
It's all right.

142
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,640
I already have enough cuts.

143
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,309
I just came to see
if I can get some more footage.

144
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,525
The 3rd, 10th, 18th of last month
and the 5th, 13th and 19th of this month.

145
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,026
It's a total of six times

146
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,946
that you dumped wastewater on rainy days.

147
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,740
I already have enough footage.

148
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,288
If you're not going to murder me,
can you show me out?

149
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,958
If I'm late,
my staff member might call the police.

150
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,419
What do you want?

151
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,170
Tell me what you want.

152
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,882
A world where justice,

153
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,176
common sense, and principles prevail.

154
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,681
A world where people like you are
too embarrassed to go out in public.

155
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,605
If you let it go just this once,
it won't happen again.

156
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,941
You can tell me if you need more.

157
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,777
Unbelievable.

158
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,990
-Do you think I'm an idiot?
-Ma'am--

159
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,617
Is this world that easy for you?

160
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,535
Do you think money
is the answer to everything?

161
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,580
Do you think you can cover up
the truth with money?

162
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,139
TOTAL AMOUNT 4,950,000 WON

163
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,601
Your transaction is being processed.
Please wait.

164
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,440
I just sent 4,950,000 won.

165
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:45,486
That means I have 32,250,000 won left.

166
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,363
Keep your accounts right.

167
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:51,367
Why do you care
where I got this money from?

168
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,869
Whether I stole this
or did something illegal for this,

169
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,121
it shouldn't matter
to a loan shark like you.

170
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,096
MR. PYO, ATTORNEY

171
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,112
Yes, Mr. Pyo.

172
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,906
Are you working out?
Isn't it a little late for that?

173
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,033
Yes, but I want to live a long life.

174
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,536
I'm glad to hear that.

175
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,331
-It's about that lady you asked me.
-Yes.

176
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,417
How much would you like me to look into?

177
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,502
Find out where she's living

178
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,171
and what she does for a living.

179
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,590
See if she owns her place
or if it's rented.

180
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,427
Find out about her assets

181
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,053
and her educational background.

182
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,973
Find out if she's married.

183
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,226
If she is,

184
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,688
find out what her husband does.

185
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,483
Anything else?

186
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,777
-That's all.
-Okay.

187
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,155
When I find her,
should I mention that you're involved?

188
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,740
No, don't say anything.

189
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,992
Don't even say that I was looking for her.

190
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,537
Weren't you going to meet her?

191
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,456
No, I wasn't.

192
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,167
Okay. I'll give you a call
as soon as I find her.

193
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,461
Don't work out too hard. Good night.

194
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,545
You too.

195
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,719
YOU DID A GREAT JOB TODAY

196
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,810
YOU DID A GREAT JOB TODAY

197
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,401
Why are you up so early?

198
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,444
What time is it?

199
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,452
Is it already this late?

200
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,141
You know you eat a lot for a dog, right?

201
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,477
And you only like expensive food.

202
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,063
You shouldn't do that.

203
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,025
Guk-yeong will take care of you
when I'm gone.

204
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,652
He's not going to buy you
expensive dog food.

205
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,780
He'll probably give you leftovers.

206
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,325
Should I write a will?

207
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,578
Even if I did write one,
he wouldn't abide by it.

208
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,164
You'll just have to deal with him.

209
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,543
First of all,

210
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,213
start by eating some human food.

211
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,173
And try to change your eating habits.

212
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,720
He's so short-tempered.

213
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,389
Ramen is the best.

214
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,517
This looks so good.

215
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,870
This is why I'm ill.

216
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,040
I never eat a hearty meal.

217
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,445
Destruction, destruction
All will be destroyed

218
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,114
There's the evil lady!

219
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,866
-We can't let her have the Earth!
-Destruction

220
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,910
-Destruction
-Die, you evil scoundrel!

221
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,246
It hurts.

222
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,000
Kids, stop.

223
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,377
If you have something to say,
you should put it into words.

224
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,630
You shouldn't act violently
like this, okay?

225
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,465
Stop talking, you evil lady!

226
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,384
Be quiet, you evil lady!

227
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,138
Hey! What are you doing?

228
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,515
Stop watching those cartoons.

229
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:54,104
You guys are still young, but you're
becoming more and more violent every day.

230
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:58,442
Should my next topic be about
the violence of cartoons?

231
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,152
Why did you make them cry?

232
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:05,115
-She hit me.
-Mom, she hit me.

233
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,491
Did you hit my children?

234
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,244
I didn't. They tried to kill me.

235
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,246
-Do you want to see?
-I don't care.

236
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,957
Even if you do chores around the house,

237
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:17,127
it won't stop me from raising the rent.

238
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,503
Let's go, my babies.

239
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,963
Can't you cut it down by 100,000 won?

240
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,175
Okay, just 50,000 won.
Maybe just 30,000 won then?

241
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,136
If you don't like my price, you can leave.
I won't stop you.

242
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,765
I never liked it, you know.

243
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,725
But still...

244
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,562
I've got nowhere else to go.

245
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,739
Let me see. Bend over.

246
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,091
Look how dark your blood is.

247
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,053
It's because you always eat in a hurry.

248
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,013
I'll bring some porridge.

249
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,015
Have that instead of yukgaejang today.

250
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,975
-I'm fine.
-You punk.

251
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,894
Just do as I say, will you?

252
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,278
I'd like 100 servings of yukgaejang.

253
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,996
What? Do you think I can't eat all of it?

254
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,374
Give it to me and see
if I can do it or not.

255
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,168
We don't sell yukgaejang, sir.

256
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,879
What are you talking about?
This is a yukgaejang place.

257
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,466
Whatever we decide to sell
in this restaurant

258
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,385
is none of your business.

259
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,972
-I'll bring some porridge.
-Okay.

260
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,725
If you want it so badly,
find another place.

261
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,520
I don't want to go elsewhere.
Give me some yukgaejang.

262
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,859
I told you I'm not serving it.

263
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,736
Then what are all these people eating?

264
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:13,285
I'm selling it to them, but not to you.

265
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,415
Then I'll have plain rice and kimchi.

266
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,333
If you continue to hassle me,

267
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,544
I will call the police
for obstruction of business.

268
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,963
In that case, I'll call my lawyer.

269
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,217
I'll report you for denying service
without a reason.

270
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,552
What are you trying to do?

271
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,554
Just give me that yukgaejang!

272
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:33,972
This is incredible.

273
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,975
-Goodness!
-I can't believe he's here.

274
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,311
-This is incredible.
-Excuse me.

275
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,605
Please stop taking pictures.

276
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,107
Please don't take pictures. I'm sorry.

277
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,483
Jun-young, just go.

278
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,861
She won't give you anything
no matter how hard you try.

279
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,571
People are watching. Just go.

280
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,947
Please stop taking pictures.

281
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,742
-Yong-deuk, stop them!
-Okay.

282
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,660
Stop taking pictures, please.

283
00:24:55,911 --> 00:25:00,290
Jeong-sik, pour some salt out in the front
when this guy leaves.

284
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,086
Excuse me, please stop.

285
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,880
Please stop.

286
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,261
Can you charge me
for 100 servings on this?

287
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,598
I even paid for it!

288
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:20,060
I'm going to report you
if you don't serve them to me.

289
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,229
Okay. I’ll do that.

290
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,731
I'll do that. Keep coming
until she gives them to you.

291
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,274
Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow,

292
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,194
or even 10 to 20 years from now,
keep coming.

293
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,738
Don't give up. All right?

294
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,490
Okay.

295
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,213
Excuse me. May I try your yukgaejang?

296
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,733
God, please make money rain from the sky.

297
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,113
I have

298
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,574
exactly 240,000 won
in my account right now.

299
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,454
I have to help my brother study
and send him off to college.

300
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,711
I need to feed him meat, too.

301
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,592
His sneakers are all worn out.

302
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,138
And all his underwear is worn out, too.

303
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,228
Goodness.

304
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,191
You don't need to come
to work starting today.

305
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,528
We don't need trash like you.

306
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,575
My gosh.

307
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,453
You're being too harsh. That was awful.

308
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,247
Jun-young is your own son.

309
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,208
-Is he gone?
-Of course.

310
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:13,340
He had to beg a customer for
a spoonful of yukgaejang before he left.

311
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,052
-Is he a beggar?
-Who made him like that?

312
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:21,222
My gosh. You're so old-fashioned.

313
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,642
Celebrities aren't treated awfully
like in the old days.

314
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,562
You wanted him
to be a prosecutor or a judge,

315
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:31,483
but Jun-young makes much more money
and he is much more famous.

316
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,151
Close your mouth.
You're spitting all over!

317
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,948
Yeong-ok, Jun-young isn't
someone you can look down on.

318
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,868
What will you do when Jun-young

319
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,288
suddenly treats you
like a complete stranger?

320
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,375
This porridge is all yours now!

321
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,336
You spat all over this bowl.
I can't serve it anymore.

322
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,052
I failed again today.

323
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,138
Should I just tell Mom

324
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,140
that I'm dying soon

325
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,102
so before she regrets anything,
she should give me some yukgaejang?

326
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,357
I won't give you a bite. This is all mine.

327
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,026
Why are you refusing
to do this documentary?

328
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,569
Just because. I don't want to do it.

329
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,113
"Just because"?

330
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,365
This is nonsense.

331
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,577
Do you know how much money
and manpower went into this project?

332
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,622
Other celebrities are dying to do this.

333
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,291
That's great. They can take the project.

334
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,794
What are you? A teenager?

335
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,546
You threw a huge fit

336
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:38,466
about how you didn't like
that drama's ending.

337
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,261
Yes, I threw a fit,
but I went with the script.

338
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,889
I won't do anything
I don't want to do from now on.

339
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,558
So don't tell me what to do.

340
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,068
Sin Jun-young!

341
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,654
Is this all you have after a week's time?

342
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,282
Don't you have any better ideas?

343
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,916
I'm sorry for being late.

344
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,297
This is for you.

345
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,632
Chocolate milk tea with tapioca.

346
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,429
And here is taro milk tea for you.

347
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,891
This is my love for you.

348
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:34,397
This is jasmine green tea just for you.

349
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,568
This is grapefruit-flavored green tea ade.

350
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,112
Lastly, for you,

351
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,531
-a mango smoothie.
-No Eul.

352
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,160
-Yes, sir!
-What are you doing?

353
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,995
Didn't you get my text?

354
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,706
I'm sure you received it.

355
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,922
I found a great item.

356
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,551
Gangin Pharmaceutical
recently made new diet pills.

357
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,263
I heard there was an accident
during the clinical test.

358
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,226
-They tried to cover it up by--
-So what?

359
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,770
How much money
are you expecting this time?

360
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:19,317
Gangin Pharmaceutical is really awful.

361
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,569
They tried to keep the victims quiet--

362
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,904
Wasn't that enough?

363
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,240
Didn't you take enough money

364
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,952
to cover up the DL Corporation case?

365
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,956
Yes, it was enough.

366
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,041
But

367
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,169
I didn't take as much as you think I did.

368
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,131
DL Corporation was caught
for the first time.

369
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,426
They've given back to society, too.

370
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,263
And nothing will change even if I--

371
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,472
No Eul!

372
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,766
Are you out of your mind?

373
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,351
You still call yourself a producer?

374
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:57,063
Where are your ethics, common sense and...

375
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,274
How could... Forget it.

376
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,735
Do you even have a thing
called "conscience"?

377
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,654
Of course, I do.

378
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,825
I can't show you, but I do have one.

379
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,827
Unbelievable.

380
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,413
You. Get out of here right now. Now!

381
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,790
Also, give back what you accepted

382
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:20,295
from DL Corporation before I report you
to the police, and never come back here.

383
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,089
Stop disgracing us and just leave already!

384
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,525
You know what?

385
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:47,155
I remember you covered up
the electoral fraud

386
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,949
and accepted 100 million won.
Or was it 200 million won?

387
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,492
Am I wrong?

388
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,703
Hey, are you crazy?

389
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,663
You too.

390
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,083
You covered up Yuil Motors'
supplier corruption

391
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:03,296
and received a car
and a good amount of stocks.

392
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,505
Hey, you!

393
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,466
Are you kidding me?

394
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,176
Can you let this one slide?

395
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:14,140
I will try to hide it as much as I can
just like you two.

396
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,643
Just let this one slide, please?

397
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,271
GOBCHANGGO

398
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,816
Punks.

399
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,697
Asshole.

400
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,532
Who?

401
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,537
It's you.

402
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,456
Who's the asshole?

403
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,459
Everyone.

404
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:47,840
-Everyone in this world.
-Why is everyone that bad?

405
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,135
-People like you who cover up corruption
-Gosh. Damn it.

406
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,805
for money are the bad ones.

407
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,933
-He's so loud. Gosh.
-Why do you blame everyone?

408
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,603
The boss and my senior took
a lot more than I did.

409
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,190
They took way more than I did,
but only I got fired!

410
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,526
-I'm thankful that you were fired!
-Hyeon-u.

411
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,528
People who steal
will keep stealing bigger things.

412
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,239
If you hadn't got fired,
you would have become

413
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,951
a huge thief just like your boss
or your senior.

414
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,620
I'm glad that you got caught
and got fired.

415
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,666
Hey, don't stand around. Take a seat.

416
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,127
No, I'm leaving.

417
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,295
I don't want to drink with her.

418
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,172
-Hyeon-u!
-Okay.

419
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,258
Don't hang out with her today.

420
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,344
-She needs to be punished.
-Bong-suk!

421
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,055
You don't deserve to talk back to us!

422
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,309
Why do you live like that?

423
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:45,857
Do you think your parents would be
proud of you looking down from above?

424
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,654
Stop picking on me.

425
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:55,324
You can't even say anything
to those who are worse than me.

426
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,702
Stop picking on me!

427
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,662
I'm leaving.

428
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,207
Stick your nose into a bowl of water
and reflect on yourself.

429
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,630
Bong-suk.

430
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,884
-Give me a bowl.
-What for?

431
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:17,805
I'll stick my nose into a bowl of water
and die while looking back on myself!

432
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:22,351
Hurry up and give me a bowl!

433
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,984
Give me a bowl!

434
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,572
Give me a bowl!

435
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,783
-Goodness, she's unbelievable.
-Bring me one!

436
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,951
Stop drinking and go home!

437
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:42,747
Bong-suk, I'm going to kill myself!

438
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:48,127
You can die a little bit after I die.

439
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:54,801
I have to put my nose in this tofu soup
and die before you.

440
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,096
So, you put your nose

441
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,556
-in your bowl later.
-What is he saying?

442
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,852
Hey, stop it. Gosh.

443
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,646
No, I'm fine.

444
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,898
I will now try

445
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,110
to kill myself as a sign of resistance

446
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,861
against his overuse of power

447
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:18,741
by putting my nose in this soup.

448
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,620
Guys, don't let my death go in vain.

449
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:28,042
Make sure you tell the son of a bitch,
Sin Jun-young,

450
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,669
that I died because of him.

451
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,129
-Sir.
-Yes?

452
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,089
You've gone a little too far.

453
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,758
Jun-young isn't a son of a bitch.

454
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,386
Did you see a dog giving birth to him?

455
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,930
Guk-yeong, calm down.

456
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,641
Look at him. He's obviously drunk.

457
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,643
Damn it. I'm completely sober!

458
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:49,438
I'm perfectly fine!

459
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,234
Damn it. Sin Jun-young, that jerk.

460
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,611
Is being a celebrity all that matters?

461
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,655
Is being popular all that matters?

462
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,448
What gives him the right

463
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,326
to break contracts whenever he wants

464
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:05,413
and break promises
like they are not important?

465
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,124
Goodness. We will pay the penalty!

466
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,917
We'll pay!

467
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,795
That penalty isn't worth much.

468
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:17,884
You took advantage of us and didn't
even write a proper contract with us.

469
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,722
We worked so hard

470
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,349
to get him to agree
on filming the documentary.

471
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,895
We tried so hard
to attract that much investment...

472
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,273
He was fine with filming it
with us until yesterday.

473
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,275
If he changes his mind
all of a sudden now,

474
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,446
what can we powerless people do? Damn it.

475
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,865
-Come on.
-My gosh.

476
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,368
-Come on. Get up.
-I don't care.

477
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,579
-Let's go now.
-Gosh.

478
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:50,249
-Gosh.
-Do you want me to change his mind?

479
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,128
-The bowl girl.
-I know

480
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,172
what that documentary series is.

481
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,800
The one that starred Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon and Park Ji-sung.

482
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,471
Isn't that right? Sin Jun-young was next.

483
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,140
-Isn't that right?
-Who are you?

484
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,809
I'm in the industry, too.

485
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,145
As you probably heard,

486
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:15,358
it's been five hours
since I was sacked for taking a bribe.

487
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,026
So what?

488
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,278
I will

489
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,657
-convince Sin Jun-young.
-Gosh.

490
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,701
I will make him do the documentary.

491
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,953
Do you know him?

492
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:32,208
-Are you a friend of his?
-Everyone knows who Sin Jun-young is.

493
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,377
-My gosh.
-Excuse us.

494
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,380
We can't sit through your drunk talk.

495
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,881
Can you just leave us? Go.

496
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,218
What if I do persuade him?

497
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,347
-Are you--
-If I do persuade him,

498
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,183
will you give me a job at your company?

499
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,103
I won't take any bribes this time.

500
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,938
I will work clean and fair.

501
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,857
I'm serious.

502
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,235
Should I write this down?

503
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,611
Sure, goodbye.

504
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,030
-What a weirdo.
-Get up.

505
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,545
This is insane!

506
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,298
Damn it.

507
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,595
SIN JUN-YOUNG WAS SEEN AT A CLUB

508
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,682
Hey, have you really seen him there?

509
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,851
Damn it.

510
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,562
I can't believe this.

511
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,939
Look.

512
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,275
This is obviously something
one of Seo Yun-hu's fans did.

513
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,818
How am I supposed to handle this?

514
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,945
What? What is it?

515
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,490
Is this really Jun-young?

516
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,411
Jun-young never goes clubbing.

517
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,831
How are you so sure?

518
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:01,797
The guy that you are talking about...
Is that guy's full name Sin Jun-young?

519
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,841
He's that celebrity, right?

520
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,761
Ha-ru is such
a fanatical fan of his, right?

521
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,305
I'm not a fanatic.

522
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,432
I'm a huge fan.

523
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,809
I'm also a huge fan of his.

524
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,062
Ha-ru helped me join his fan club.

525
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,105
You should join us.

526
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,900
You get ten percent off
on the tickets to his concerts.

527
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,072
-Let's see.
-Dad...

528
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,451
This picture was photoshopped.

529
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,578
Exactly.

530
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,291
Indeed, a former prosecutor is different.

531
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,503
What can I do about them?

532
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,755
Jun-young has been getting a lot

533
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,466
of bad comments
because of that since last night.

534
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,675
Ha-ru.

535
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,345
Do you really like him that much?

536
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,392
I feel like dying
because I like him so much.

537
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,477
I want to marry him.

538
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,479
You can't do that, Ha-ru!

539
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,772
Don't let me down here.

540
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:03,317
I don't approve of guys like him
as my son-in-law.

541
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,861
I don't like his job, either.

542
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,489
I also don't like his looks.

543
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,951
Handsome guys make me feel uncomfortable.

544
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,745
It's not like he wanted to be handsome.

545
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:19,208
His father made him into a handsome man.

546
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,545
Hello, good morning.

547
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,922
-Good morning, Mrs. Lee.
-Hello.

548
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,841
Hi, Mom.

549
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,050
Hi, Ha-ru.

550
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,928
I feel so dizzy.

551
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,431
I think I need to go and rest.

552
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,517
I'll eat breakfast later.

553
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,400
What will I do with her?

554
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,194
She can't sleep or eat
because of her studies.

555
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,029
I feel so bad.

556
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:53,617
If there were something I could do,
I'd do it for her.

557
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,787
Don't worry about our kids.

558
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,665
Just worry about your health.

559
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:03,085
Right, Dr. Kim told you to be careful.

560
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,881
Your liver didn't seem so good
on your last checkup.

561
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,593
I'm not surprised
because you work day and night.

562
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,095
You're not the only congressman
in this country.

563
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,056
No one will recognize you
for your hard work.

564
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,808
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

565
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,603
Could you bring me the newspaper?

566
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,062
Of course.

567
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,984
What is it?
Do you want me to stop nagging?

568
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,612
Why would you make me--

569
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,999
I am still amazed,

570
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,294
happy, and thankful

571
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,338
that you are my wife.

572
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,132
Thank you.

573
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,833
THE MOST POPULAR POLITICIAN

574
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,631
AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS, CHOI HYEON-JUN

575
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,428
CHOI HYEON-JUN

576
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,226
Gosh.

577
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,187
Gosh.

578
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:50,150
-Damn it.
-What is it?

579
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,653
Well, it's...

580
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:56,448
It's not what it looks like.

581
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,827
I wasn't going to give this to Jun-young.

582
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,078
It's just...

583
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:05,082
One of my friends
really wanted to try this.

584
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:09,712
These aren't meant
for Jun-young either. It's...

585
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,550
What's so bad about giving it to him?

586
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,719
Jun-young is very picky.

587
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,556
He won't eat the housekeeper's food

588
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,142
and he just wants to eat your food.

589
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:28,439
Plus, he's been eating
only gimbap and ramen.

590
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,945
It breaks my heart
to think about Jun-young.

591
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,072
How can you be so cold?

592
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,159
You can be his mom then.

593
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,208
Is this Mr. Sin Jun-young's house?

594
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,171
Why is she...

595
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,386
Goodness. She's really here.

596
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,016
Mr. Sin, are you there?

597
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,602
I'm not a solicitor,

598
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:11,023
a fanatical fan or anyone strange.

599
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:26,121
I'm just a pretty, kind and honest

600
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,374
citizen of Korea.

601
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,584
I met her the other day
when we had a drink.

602
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,461
She said that

603
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,714
she can persuade you into filming
that documentary you didn't want to film.

604
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:39,426
She was also a producer,
but she got fired after taking a bribe.

605
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,221
She might be in some kind of strange cult.

606
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,889
She also seems a bit crazy.

607
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,724
I'm not crazy.

608
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,686
I can tell who you are
just by hearing your voice.

609
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,605
Shouldn't you be helping me instead?

610
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:55,317
You had a lot to complain about him too.

611
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,611
Did she just hear what I said?

612
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:02,199
You were complaining
about how Jun-young refused

613
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,159
to do movies, dramas, songs
and everything else.

614
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,661
You said that you'd also lose your job

615
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:09,081
and that you wanted
to give him a good beating.

616
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:12,042
You said it as you were peeing
outside the restaurant.

617
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,378
My gosh, she's insane.

618
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,213
Jun-young, I didn't say that.

619
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,632
Can you meet with me, Mr. Sin Jun-young?

620
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,884
Let's talk face-to-face.

621
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:24,388
If I seem crazy, you can kick me out then.

622
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,890
I'll kick you out now. Goodbye.

623
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,016
Mr. Sin--

624
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,226
Hold on.

625
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,936
Mr. Sin!

626
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,066
Hey! Sin Jun-young!

627
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:39,194
It's not true, Jun-young.

628
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:43,657
It's true that if you stop working,
I'd be unemployed.

629
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,368
But still,
I wouldn't talk about you like that.

630
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:50,622
I keep things like that to myself.
I would never say them out loud.

631
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,124
You know how I am.

632
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,377
Pororo, it's time for your bath!

633
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,045
Should I join in?

634
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,408
A world-renowned bicycle race

635
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,661
is held at this area
with a unique landscape.

636
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,331
These cyclists avoid obstacles
here and there,

637
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,500
riding down the endless roads

638
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,168
like the wind.

639
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:40,339
As you can see,
this exciting competition is--

640
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,472
I UNDERSTAND THAT MY SUDDEN INTRUSION

641
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,392
IS QUITE RIDICULOUS AND IRRITATING

642
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,690
YOU CAN TAKE YOUR TIME
AND DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

643
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,027
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND, GIVE ME A CALL

644
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,533
UNTIL YOU OPEN THE DOOR,

645
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,333
I'LL WAIT OUT HERE QUIETLY

646
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,128
Doesn't it feel good?

647
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,382
Let's rinse.

648
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,152
Does it feel good?

649
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,541
You lost the card.

650
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,376
Damn it.

651
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,631
You need to take care of your health
these days, when your immunity can weaken.

652
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,302
You probably know this well,
it's Korean red ginseng.

653
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,886
Yes, today's product

654
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,430
-is something very popular.
-Very popular.

655
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,265
-The Korean red ginseng.
-The Korean red ginseng

656
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,433
is selling like hot cakes.

657
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,144
We have prepared various products...

658
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,188
Why didn't you send me a picture
of your dinner?

659
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,107
Wait.

660
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,026
Are you eating only bread again?

661
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,905
Why do you never listen to me?

662
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,491
Are you looking down on me, too?

663
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,682
I'LL BE BACK

664
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,928
Good morning.

665
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,930
What are you doing?

666
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,270
Your day starts early.

667
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,689
I nearly missed you.

668
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,610
Are you going ice climbing?

669
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,615
I did some research
on your fan club website.

670
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:39,244
Your likes, dislikes,
hobbies, specialties, and habits.

671
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,581
You go ice climbing or racing
when you're stressed out.

672
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,957
Should I drag you out?

673
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,919
I know that you are probably

674
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,964
very annoyed with me,
but I'm desperate too.

675
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,508
I have to make a living.

676
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,510
I will count to three.

677
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:59,473
-One.
-Let's just film that documentary.

678
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:02,017
-Two.
-We'll do a lot of video revisions too.

679
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,060
-None of your pores will show up.
-Three.

680
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,455
Slow down. We'll--

681
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,583
Is he crazy?

682
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,064
Do you want to get off?

683
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,485
Take this as compensation.

684
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,904
And don't ever come back again.

685
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:42,761
RADIO

686
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,513
There has been an accident
as a heavy snowfall

687
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,349
started coming down.

688
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:51,603
Reporter Kim Eu-na is at the scene.

689
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:53,897
This is Kim Eu-na.

690
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,693
A truck on highway six skidded
on an icy patch

691
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:02,948
and hit a woman in her 20s
who was passing by.

692
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:06,117
This unidentified female

693
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,331
is currently being taken to a hospital.

694
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,209
However, she is said
to be severely injured.

695
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,919
According to the weather bureau,

696
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:18,672
an additional 10 to 15 cm of snow

697
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,674
is predicted to fall.

698
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:24,386
Everyone on the roads
will need to be careful.

699
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,371
MR. PYO, ATTORNEY

700
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,086
Yes, Mr. Pyo. I'm in a hurry, so--

701
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:00,255
I found the woman.

702
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,098
Me too.

703
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,352
I think I found her, too.

704
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,585
YANGJAE SAVINGS BANK CHEQUE

705
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,011
Did you change your mind?

706
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,724
Is that why you're back?

707
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,812
You know

708
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,397
I'm not doing this

709
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,193
just so I can work or something.

710
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,781
This documentary will work wonders

711
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:53,660
to change your image of an arrogant punk.

712
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,372
To be honest, the more you earn--

713
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:58,706
Don't you recognize me?

714
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,091
I do.

715
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,927
You're Sin Jun-young.

716
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,513
Even my landlady's children know you.

717
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,764
No Eul.

718
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,229
Do you not recognize me?

719
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,363
I do.

720
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,369
You jerk.

721
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,967
Gosh! It's really him!

722
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,260
I'm going to confess my feelings.

723
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:36,346
To who? The boy you have a crush on?

724
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,723
Sin Jun-young, my name is No Eul.

725
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,683
I've liked you for a long time.

726
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,061
You're so cute.

727
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:44,145
I love you, Eul.

728
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,106
I might get a boyfriend really soon.

729
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,985
You said you'd rather go to jail
than become my girlfriend.

730
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,487
The restroom is not that way.

731
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,072
It's your fault if I become a prosecutor.

732
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,615
How can your love change?

733
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,493
Are you trying to be mean to her again?

734
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,994
Don't bother her, okay?

735
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,164
I couldn't sleep because I had to study.

736
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,666
Give me ten minutes so I can take a nap.

737
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,671
If I'd known you'd become so glamorous,

738
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,131
I would never have let you go.

739
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,841
Be my girlfriend.
