1
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:11,428
Whatever you do, I won't get hurt.

2
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,930
I won't get upset or misunderstand you.

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,682
Go ahead and carry on.

4
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,701
Do you want to sleep with me?

5
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,380
If that's not what you want, tell me now.

6
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,884
I'll open the door for you.

7
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,390
I'm not going to leave.

8
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,895
I won't budge.
I'm going to stay right by your side.

9
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,816
Please wait here for your turn.

10
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,318
Here you go.

11
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,237
-Bye.
-Thank you.

12
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,613
Excuse me.

13
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,031
Yes?

14
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,785
-What do you need?
-The fire went out.

15
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,538
Did it? Just a second.

16
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,873
-Did you enjoy your meal?
-Yes.

17
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:08,169
A large bossam, three yukgaejangs
and dumplings.

18
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,463
MY SON

19
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,678
-I'll call you--
-Give me three reasons

20
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,430
why I can't date Eul.

21
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,184
I gave you a list of reasons,
but I can't remember any.

22
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,728
Excuse me, but can you hurry?

23
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,272
Okay. I'm sorry.

24
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,524
I'm busy right now. Let's talk later.

25
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,111
I'm so sorry.

26
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,990
Can we have a bottle of soju?

27
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,367
I'll stay with her, then.

28
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,454
If you also can't remember why,

29
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,792
then I'll just pretend
there weren't any reasons

30
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,337
and stay with Eul.

31
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,285
Five years ago,

32
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,164
if only Eul had taken that USB
to the TV station...

33
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,255
If only you hadn't taken
that USB away from Eul...

34
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,050
Today's the anniversary
of my father's death.

35
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,801
Oh, I'm sorry.

36
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,764
I'm sure the cat didn't mean to do that.

37
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,891
So don't be mad
and buy it again with this.

38
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:45,975
Eul.

39
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,613
Eul still remembers everything.

40
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,324
I thought she was okay,

41
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,868
but Eul was still living in darkness.

42
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,959
I'm Sin Jun-young.

43
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,384
A few months ago,

44
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,388
my doctor told me

45
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:53,311
that I didn't have much longer to live.

46
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,693
Well, it's a bit baffling,

47
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,322
but everyone dies eventually anyway.

48
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,161
So...

49
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,422
SIN JUN-YOUNG'S FANS ARE NOT WELCOME

50
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:39,190
SIN JUN-YOUNG'S FANS ARE WELCOME

51
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,783
-Why are you here washing the dishes?
-Me?

52
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,828
I quit being Jun-young's manager.

53
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:56,457
-Why?
-I had pride in what I did.

54
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,418
But I don't think I can deal
with such human scum

55
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,129
like that for any longer.

56
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,755
What did he do?

57
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,259
How did you raise your son
to be like that?

58
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,927
It wasn't just anyone.

59
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,470
It was Ms. No.

60
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,723
No human being should do such a thing.

61
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,017
-What?
-What are you talking about?

62
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,230
You punk. If you're still drunk,
sleep it off.

63
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,524
Why are you here talking nonsense?

64
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,733
It's not nonsense.

65
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,778
If you'd seen what Jun-young did,

66
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,532
you'd have beaten him for
over three days straight.

67
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,992
-How dare you--
-Wait!

68
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,494
Wait. This isn't what I should be doing.

69
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,371
If I'm going to quit, I might as well say,

70
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,831
"Hey, Jun-young.

71
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:40,334
You need to become
a decent human being first."

72
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,087
Then I should kick his bottom
and then quit.

73
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,256
You punk.

74
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,550
Jun-young doesn't deserve a beating.

75
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,344
You do, though. I might as well get to it.

76
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,722
I need a sturdy piece of wood
for a fool like you.

77
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,016
I think this will do nicely.

78
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,311
-Stop it, Dad.
-Say that again.

79
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,897
I'll... Oh, Mr. Namgung, welcome.

80
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,231
You jerk!

81
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,816
You punk.

82
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,777
You little rat.

83
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,529
Come over here.

84
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,283
Dad, why are you always siding
with Jun-young

85
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,993
instead of your own son?

86
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,536
Let me ask you this.

87
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,498
If Jun-young and I are both drowning,

88
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,749
will you save Jun-young first?

89
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,000
What are you saying?

90
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,003
You're in your thirties.

91
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,838
Do you think you're still a kid?

92
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,256
He might as well be, Dad.

93
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,760
You always care for Jun-young
so affectionately,

94
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,346
so he's being jealous. You're so childish.

95
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,431
-You brat. Did you call me childish?
-It hurts.

96
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,392
When was I jealous? I was not jealous.

97
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,604
-You're so rude. I might just hit you.
-Gosh!

98
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,147
Don't hit Man-ok.

99
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,399
Don't hit people. Are you a barbarian?

100
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,610
It hurts. Let go right now.

101
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,111
You guys are so loud!

102
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,280
Do we have to start the day like this?

103
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,157
Yong-deuk, let him go.

104
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:59,664
Tell me. What did Jun-young do
to that No Eul girl?

105
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,334
What did Jun-young do?

106
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,549
I asked to see you

107
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,677
because your brother said
he wouldn't go to college.

108
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,387
My brother

109
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,180
said what?

110
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:20,268
With his grades, he can go
to the best colleges in Korea,

111
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,146
but he told me he doesn't want
to go to college.

112
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,149
Jik.

113
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,905
Why did you call my sister?

114
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,991
I asked you to keep it a secret.

115
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,742
It's such a waste.

116
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,953
You're too smart to not go to college.

117
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,621
You wanted to be a doctor.

118
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,290
I won't go to college.

119
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,417
I already made up my mind, so--

120
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,460
Ouch. It hurts.

121
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,380
I'll have a short chat with him.

122
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,675
It really hurts.

123
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,219
Are you crazy?

124
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,054
Why would you not go to college?

125
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,141
Who do you think I slave away at work for?

126
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,851
Have you lost your mind?

127
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,105
You barely earn enough to pay our debts.

128
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,232
You can't afford my tuition.

129
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,692
Medical school costs a fortune.

130
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,486
I have a lot of money. I have loads, so--

131
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,323
If you're that rich, find a place to stay.

132
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,866
I don't care if it's a basement room.

133
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,952
I'm tired of feeling sorry
toward my friend's parents.

134
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,579
Find us a place to stay.

135
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,248
Fine. I'll find us a place.

136
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,751
-I'll--
-If you're that rich,

137
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,336
pay off our debt

138
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,881
so we won't have to worry
about loan sharks coming by.

139
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,674
Let's live in peace.

140
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,968
Fine. I'll find a place
and pay off the debt.

141
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,345
I'll do all that, so--

142
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,930
I'll go to college once you do all that.

143
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,266
Let's not talk about college anymore.

144
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,186
No Jik!

145
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,527
Hello?

146
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,364
I'm Lee Eun-su of KJ Group.

147
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,824
You remember me, right?

148
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,418
Eul won't come by anymore.

149
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,128
You can stay indoors.

150
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,218
What's that?

151
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,097
You're so clumsy,
getting stuff like this on you.

152
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,740
DOCTOR KANG

153
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,291
Hello, Doctor.

154
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,044
Isn't it a lovely day?

155
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,879
Did you think about it?

156
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,426
You should get admitted right away.

157
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,067
I'll end up dying in the hospital.

158
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,694
If you get treated--

159
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,613
I'll still end up dying in the hospital.

160
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:26,412
As your doctor, I can't
just stand and watch you like this.

161
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,664
I'll call your family.

162
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,917
I considered you my savior.

163
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,045
Don't make me take you to court.

164
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,631
-Jun-young--
-Something urgent came up.

165
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,592
I'll call you back.

166
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,795
What brings you all the way here?

167
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,261
Why did you send me this?

168
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,516
I don't know why you sent me this,

169
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,061
but I'm engaged.

170
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,358
I know that.

171
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,862
But you're not the only one who got this.

172
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,490
The distributor, production staff

173
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,367
and directors all got one.

174
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,202
My company president sent them

175
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,164
to apologize for the trouble I caused.

176
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,801
This really was a bit too much
for an apology.

177
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,637
You can leave it here
if it's too overwhelming.

178
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,437
One more thing.

179
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,606
I'm grateful and sorry.

180
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,109
You knelt in front of Yun-hu.

181
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,988
If I hadn't, you would have.

182
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,866
I couldn't let a pretty lady kneel

183
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,534
in front of a jerk like him.

184
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,388
I should go.

185
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,558
Sure.

186
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,740
What did you say

187
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,409
back then?

188
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,166
I think you said something

189
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,959
when you got me out of the pool.

190
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,212
What did you say?

191
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,006
It's a secret.

192
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,133
Tell me.

193
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,235
You said you're engaged.

194
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,781
-So what?
-I said it without knowing you were.

195
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,532
Forget about it.

196
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,618
It's fine.

197
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,119
Tell me.

198
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,915
Drive safely.

199
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,416
Have a nice day.

200
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,183
-That's how it should be done.
-I know.

201
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,810
Get back to work.

202
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,386
Don't come here if you're going
to greet me like that.

203
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,721
I'm no longer a director.

204
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,805
Then,

205
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,890
I'll speak as a friend.

206
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,769
You're such a bad son.

207
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,521
Do you have to go this far?

208
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,356
I was sent here, and I obeyed.

209
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,108
They never told me to quit,

210
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,235
which is why I'm here slaving away.

211
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,281
I do exactly as my parents say.
I'm not a bad son.

212
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,908
Must you go on
fighting your mother like this?

213
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,245
Being friends with me
might ruin your career.

214
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,164
Don't come here again.

215
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,918
I saw Ms. No in the lobby earlier today.

216
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,424
I think your mother called her.

217
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,676
What for?

218
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,098
You don't look too well.

219
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,059
Did something bad happen?

220
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:41,727
Yes.

221
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,521
I wonder why.

222
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:52,196
You have a staunch supporter
who threatened me

223
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,448
never to touch a hair on your head.

224
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,867
I won't leave Korea.

225
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,745
I'm going to stay.

226
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,499
That's fine. Koreans should stay in Korea.

227
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,875
I didn't tell you not to.

228
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,215
Ms. Kim, bring it in.

229
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,299
Yes, Ma'am.

230
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,650
It's a billion won.

231
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,152
I'll get to the point.

232
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,696
Take this and send Ji-tae

233
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,032
back to his fiancée.

234
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,244
She adored Ji-tae for 20 long years.

235
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,372
You shouldn't do this to another woman.

236
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,749
What did she do to deserve this?

237
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,587
You don't even like Ji-tae anyway.

238
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,806
I thought I told you clearly

239
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,058
not to do anything to Eul.

240
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,685
I said I wouldn't--

241
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,895
I did nothing but give her money.

242
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,898
Can't I do that much for a poor girl?

243
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,150
It's just like a donation.

244
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,234
Mother!

245
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,044
Is this

246
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,630
-a real check?
-Eul.

247
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,632
You can check at any bank
if you don't trust me.

248
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,135
If it's from you, it must be real.

249
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,180
I'll use it well.

250
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,266
No Eul.

251
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,235
Give me that.

252
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,280
You deserve an apology, not money.

253
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,532
"I'm sorry. I wronged you."

254
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,825
They won't apologize.

255
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,620
Your parents

256
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,581
won't apologize, no matter what.

257
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,376
-Eul.
-I can fight them my whole life,

258
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,712
but they'll never apologize.

259
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,424
No one even listens to what I say anyway.

260
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,094
Even if you try to protect me,

261
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,263
they can crush me just like that.

262
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,849
So, why should I fight?

263
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,268
I know I'll lose anyway.

264
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,063
-But this is wrong.
-I sold you for a billion won.

265
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,900
I don't really get
how big of a sum it is yet,

266
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,861
but I got lucky thanks to you.

267
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,280
I'll buy you an expensive drink later.

268
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,479
You're still here.

269
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,900
The river's so beautiful.

270
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:26,034
What made you build a house
in such a beautiful spot?

271
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,997
Aren't you cold? The wind's harsh.

272
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,208
What's your relationship with Ms. No?

273
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,128
Did you stay to ask me that?

274
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:40,465
I think she likes you very much.

275
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,801
I like her very much, too.

276
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,054
That's why I beat up Yun-hu.

277
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,932
It was for her.

278
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:52,602
Why were you so cold to her, then?

279
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,604
She's too pretty for me.

280
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,900
That annoyed me so much.

281
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,238
How ridiculous.

282
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,744
You and Ji-tae are both insane.

283
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,954
How could you fall for a lowlife like--

284
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,664
Watch what you say.

285
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,419
Like I just said, I like her very much.

286
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,987
Are you okay?

287
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,240
No, I'm not okay.

288
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,722
I'll do nothing but help, so stay calm.

289
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,986
You were right.

290
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,071
What?

291
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,366
The thing you gave me.

292
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,660
You said this would bring me luck.

293
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,745
I just won the lottery.

294
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,705
What are you talking about?

295
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,582
How would you win the lottery?

296
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,209
What would you do
if you get a billion won?

297
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,920
Don't you see I'm hard at work?

298
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,547
We can talk nonsense at--

299
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,632
Come on, what would you do
if you have a billion won?

300
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,135
Of course, there's a ton of stuff
I'd like to do.

301
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,178
I'd buy clothes and handbags

302
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,888
-and shoes.
-Okay.

303
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,557
I'll buy you all that.

304
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,892
I owe you so much.

305
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:58,603
Today, I'll buy you everything
to make it up to you.

306
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,274
-Let's go.
-Where?

307
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,442
To buy the handbags, shoes, and clothes
that you want.

308
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,528
I'll buy you everything you want.

309
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,071
Within a billion won.

310
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,156
Hey!

311
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,368
What about this?

312
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,371
It's lovely.

313
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,123
It's pretty, but...

314
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,500
Okay. We'll buy this, too.

315
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,421
Are you going to buy all that?

316
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,673
The clothes here cost a fortune.

317
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,135
I have loads of money.

318
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,596
-What about this?
-Are you in trouble?

319
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,639
Beep, wrong answer.

320
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,442
-That'll be 8,370,000 won.
-Gosh!

321
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,944
No way. That's so expensive.

322
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,196
Just a moment.

323
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,864
Forget it, Eul.

324
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,992
This scarf. Just get me this scarf.

325
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,660
Hey, Na-ri.

326
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,871
Don't be silly.

327
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,457
This store only sells expensive
and high-quality items.

328
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,417
We'll take everything.

329
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,713
Are you crazy?

330
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,424
People like us can never afford this.

331
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,842
Why not?

332
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,594
In this world,

333
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,721
those with money are those who rule.

334
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,310
-I'll pay with this.
-Sure.

335
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,899
Don't worry, it's not a forged check.

336
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,152
My goodness.

337
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,239
It really is a billion won.

338
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,742
Stop what you're doing.

339
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,994
I apologize, miss.

340
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,454
We cannot

341
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,415
accept this as payment.

342
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,043
Why not?

343
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,504
That's not paper. It's money.

344
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,592
-I'll pay for it with this.
-Hyeon-u.

345
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,638
He isn't Hyeon-u.

346
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,765
He's Choi Ji-tae.

347
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,642
He's Choi Hyeon-jun's son.

348
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,602
He lied to us.

349
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,021
What are you talking about?

350
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,233
Put it on my card.

351
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,693
No, don't.

352
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,156
Leave us alone
and go back to your fiancée.

353
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,120
Take this

354
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,330
right back to my mother.

355
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,624
How dare you sell me.

356
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,459
Am I worth only a billion won?

357
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,629
And do you think
I'm the only one you sold out?

358
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,881
What about your father?

359
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,303
If you want to do it properly,

360
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,805
take everything my parents have.

361
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,598
Then it'll be even!

362
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,577
It seems like you've done this before.

363
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,497
Eul trips often.

364
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,542
She always sprains her ankle.

365
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,009
That's enough.

366
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,844
I think I can walk.

367
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,688
Are you sure you can walk?

368
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,664
Sorry, but would you mind driving me?

369
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,751
My ankle hurts too much
when I step on the pedal.

370
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,925
Thank you.

371
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,637
Shouldn't you go see a doctor?

372
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,474
It's just a sprain.
I'll be fine after a while.

373
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,893
The ice pack

374
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,646
was a huge help.

375
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,570
What do you think of me as a woman?

376
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,534
Am I attractive?

377
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,206
I guess so.

378
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,209
As much as your love, No Eul?

379
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,966
You and Eul

380
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,884
have different charms.

381
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,263
Would you consider seducing me?

382
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,605
You're engaged.

383
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,445
My fiancé only has eyes for Eul.

384
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,238
He even broke off our engagement.

385
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,866
I'm sure you heard already.

386
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,954
It seems like Eul
still only has eyes for you,

387
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,041
but Ji-tae still likes her
even when he knows that.

388
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,470
I want to steal you away from her.

389
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,724
I want to make her

390
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,852
feel the pain I felt.

391
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,816
I also want Ji-tae to realize

392
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,361
what a great woman he lost.

393
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,657
Could I do that?

394
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,313
I don't have to carry you upstairs, do I?

395
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,108
I can't have photos
of me carrying you in the papers.

396
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,819
Of course.

397
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,531
The key's in the car,
so you can valet park it.

398
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,574
Take care, then.

399
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,664
You didn't give me an answer.

400
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,923
I want to steal you away from Eul.

401
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,217
Could I do that?

402
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,886
No.

403
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,639
I don't think you can.

404
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,109
Sorry, sir.

405
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:46,362
Could you make a U-turn
at the traffic light over there?

406
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,737
Why isn't she picking up?
She's making me get worried.

407
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,500
Eul.

408
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,502
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

409
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,711
Help me with these.

410
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,676
You really bought those?

411
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,929
I had the check
split into 100,000 won checks.

412
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,350
-Come and help me.
-You're crazy.

413
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,602
You've lost your mind.

414
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,938
Thank you, sir.

415
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,111
Everything here is for you.

416
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,445
That's for Jik.

417
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:13,116
You know the dress you liked
but said was too expensive?

418
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,534
I bought that, too. Try it upstairs.

419
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,743
Are you even human?

420
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,122
Are you a human being?

421
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,167
Of course, I am. Am I a doll, then?

422
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,711
Jeez. You're unbelievable.

423
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,047
That's the money for selling your dad.

424
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,968
You got it from KJ Group
in exchange for backing down.

425
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,429
Yes, that's how I got the money.

426
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,306
I sold out my dad and Ji-tae. So what?

427
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,599
What's wrong with you?

428
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,770
Refusing the money
won't bring my dad back,

429
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,772
and we can't catch the real killer.

430
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,108
No one out there will help me out.

431
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,902
Why can't I take the money?
What's wrong with that?

432
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,696
This is still wrong.

433
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,740
I don't stand a chance.

434
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,074
Should I keep fighting?

435
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,702
Should I go to the police station,
court and then jail?

436
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,621
Must I stay on the run
from loan sharks forever?

437
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,915
You still shouldn't have
taken their money.

438
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,084
What would your dad say?

439
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,919
He'd say I did well.

440
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,089
My dad always disapproved of me.

441
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,301
He always said I was too busy
looking out for others

442
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:17,055
and that I'd never manage
to survive the cruel world.

443
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,848
Now he can rest in peace.

444
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,808
You've really lost it.

445
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,060
How can you say that?

446
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,063
I'll send Jik to college
and let him study abroad.

447
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,857
I'll let him do everything
everyone else does.

448
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,568
Are you jealous?

449
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:34,363
Are you envious that the poor girl
suddenly got rich?

450
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,366
It's just money.

451
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,744
You've changed, Eul.

452
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,705
You weren't like this.

453
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,625
I'll buy a house
and move out of your place.

454
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,002
Jik and I will live in a mansion.

455
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,962
Fine. Move out.

456
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,173
I don't need
such shallow scum for a friend!

457
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,383
Get out! Gosh!

458
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,011
Do you think I won't?

459
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:01,015
I'm going to stay in a five-star hotel!

460
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,534
Jeong-eun's a quick learner.

461
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,791
I thought she was just a good cook,
but she's smart, too.

462
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,669
She learned about investments
and how we do things

463
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,879
in such a short time.

464
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,423
All the executives are impressed that...

465
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,178
Who am I talking to?

466
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:40,930
Honey.

467
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,308
-What?
-Were you listening?

468
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,434
What?

469
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,853
What did you say?

470
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,063
Was I talking to myself?

471
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,400
Sorry. I was thinking
about something else.

472
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,861
What did you say?

473
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,282
-Choi Ha-ru.
-Just a moment.

474
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,411
Read your texts, will you?

475
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,580
Haven't you heard?

476
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,583
Ji-tae.

477
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,667
Ji-tae.

478
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,419
I'll get you some food.

479
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,503
Thanks.

480
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,261
"Ms. Yoon

481
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,806
was given a title she doesn't deserve."

482
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,392
That's what people say behind your back.

483
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:31,814
That's what everyone said
when you were made director.

484
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,194
"Should a young man be given
such a lofty position

485
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,696
just because he's the president's son?"

486
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,156
But

487
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,451
all that disappeared
when you proved yourself.

488
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,871
It's been a while, son.

489
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,333
I haven't seen you
at the dinner table for nearly a month.

490
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,294
Let Jeong-eun go.

491
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,713
I will never go back to her.

492
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,965
You're keeping her hostage.

493
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,552
Stop doing that.

494
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,555
Please.

495
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,506
Where does it hurt?

496
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,103
It must be hard because it's new to you.

497
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,734
Mother gave Eul a billion won.

498
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,153
How far will she go--

499
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,238
So,

500
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,532
did she refuse the money?

501
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,994
"You have the wrong idea of me.

502
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,205
Do you think I'd give up for money?"

503
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,293
Did she yell and insult your mom

504
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,461
and refuse the money?

505
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,798
She accepted her fate.

506
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,886
What are you trying to protect
by stooping so low?

507
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:29,974
Get some rest.

508
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:08,179
GO NA-RI

509
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,020
Hi.

510
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,813
Is this Hyeon-u's... No.

511
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,107
Is this Mr. Choi Ji-tae's number?

512
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,739
Yes.

513
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,407
It's me, Na-ri.

514
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,201
Is money that important?

515
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,372
Does being rich mean
you can destroy people?

516
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:40,795
-Na-ri.
-Eul was never normal,

517
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,631
but she wasn't that weird, either.

518
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,633
Your money

519
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,927
turned her into a monster.

520
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,553
Bring her back!

521
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,680
I want the old Eul back!

522
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:34,890
Gyu-cheol.

523
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,813
I'm going to take away everything

524
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,568
my parents have.

525
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,289
SIN YEONG-OK
SIN JUN-YOUNG

526
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,560
Why are you still here?

527
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,231
-Jeong-sik.
-What?

528
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,317
What if...

529
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,613
What if I had

530
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:35,284
stayed with Hyeon-jun and not run away?

531
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,330
What would have happened to him?

532
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:40,789
I guess

533
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,459
you'd have had a few more kids

534
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,962
and lived with them happily ever after.

535
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,965
If I'd stayed with him
instead of running away,

536
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,176
would he have not

537
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,097
become the horrible man he is,

538
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,353
like Jun-young said?

539
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,982
If you feel bad about it,

540
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,486
you can still steal him back.

541
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,906
The look on his face told me

542
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,033
that he'd leave everything for you

543
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,493
if you asked him to.

544
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,045
I feel so sorry for Jun-young.

545
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,715
Because of what his father did,

546
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,845
he can't be with the girl he loves.

547
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,010
Hey, Jik's trainers.

548
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,722
Do you hate me, too?

549
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,727
What did I do that's so wrong?

550
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,937
Tell me what you think.

551
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,275
No.

552
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,277
Be quiet, old man!

553
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:39,533
If you're going
to lecture me on ethics, don't!

554
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,871
You're still wet behind the ears.

555
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,001
You don't know anything about life!

556
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,679
What a brat.

557
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,516
We were friends for ten years.

558
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,436
How can you call me scum?

559
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,982
Tell your owner

560
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,069
that she's a terrible friend.

561
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,832
Dad.

562
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,384
I'm just calling you for no reason.

563
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:09,892
You did nothing wrong.

564
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,771
You did nothing wrong, Eul.

565
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,680
Eul.

566
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,643
What are you doing here?

567
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,437
You said you'd go to a five-star hotel.

568
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,861
Mom.

569
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,322
Shall I give up everything else

570
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,492
and just do what I want before I die?

571
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,788
I'll hold Eul's hand

572
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,249
and kiss her.

573
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,211
I'll hug her tiny shoulders warmly.

574
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,381
We'll watch movies

575
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,132
and go traveling.

576
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,134
We'll laugh

577
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,928
and be happy.

578
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,264
Shall I do that before I die?

579
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,684
It's not like anyone's going to stop me.

580
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,027
HOW TO BECOME A PUBLIC OFFICIAL

581
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,382
Do you want to study
another year for college?

582
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,845
I can't concentrate when you're around.

583
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,348
But

584
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,184
why are you studying this?

585
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:20,439
I'm studying to become a public official.

586
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:21,857
I need to earn money.

587
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:23,984
Gosh.

588
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,361
Does that mean we can't date
in college together?

589
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:31,158
Can you even get into a college in Seoul?

590
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:35,704
Fine. My brain sucks at studying.
Happy now?

591
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:44,838
Ha-ru.

592
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,760
Are you still a member
of Jun-young's fan club?

593
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,011
I quit.

594
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,056
And I got told off by the other members
because of you.

595
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,475
I got cursed enough to last a lifetime.

596
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,023
I see.

597
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,401
Are you jealous?

598
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,738
As if.

599
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,407
I'm worried you might not get
into college again.

600
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,827
You're too old to be a fangirl.

601
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:17,954
Is that it?

602
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,873
I can't let you worry, can I?

603
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,751
I'll study really hard
and get into college this time.

604
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,228
This problem is about substitution.

605
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,772
Here. Look.

606
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,357
Well, 4log

607
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,150
and 9x

608
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,986
becomes 2log 3x.

609
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:54,074
If we were to substitute that with A...

610
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:20,892
Hey.

611
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,278
What was that? Are you a pervert?

612
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,930
YOON JEONG-EUN'S BIRTHDAY

613
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,150
My head hurts.

614
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:30,879
Why were you sleeping on my doorstep
instead of at a five-star hotel?

615
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:34,466
I cooked you some hangover soup, you brat.

616
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,762
Why was I sleeping outside her door?

617
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,975
Did I come home while I was drunk?

618
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,355
Oh gosh.

619
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,360
Gosh, my stomach.

620
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,000
Na-ri...

621
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,980
Ms. Yoon Jeong-eun wants to see you.

622
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,400
Are you free?

623
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:40,991
I'll take this.

624
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:43,535
It's a birthday present,
so please wrap it up nicely.

625
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:46,329
Yes, sir. I'll get you a new pair.

626
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,885
Hello, this is Sin Jun-young.

627
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:01,845
Yes.

628
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,890
I'd like to meet Ms. Yoon Jeong-eun.

629
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,808
Where is she?

630
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,117
This way, please.

631
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,379
You have a guest.

632
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,974
Today's my birthday
and I have no one to eat with.

633
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,601
Take a seat.

634
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,943
-Can I take your coat?
-No, it's fine.

635
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,990
I want to speak with her in private.

636
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,076
Bring us the food then go home.

637
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,160
Yes, ma'am.

638
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,249
I manage this restaurant.

639
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,543
I wanted to see you in private,

640
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,379
so I told them not to accept any guests.

641
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,923
You know who I am, don't you?

642
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,843
-Yes.
-Who am I?

643
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,639
You're Ms. Yoon Jeong-eun.

644
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:28,890
Other than that.

645
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,396
KJ Group's

646
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,773
director?

647
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,149
Other than that.

648
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,404
That's all I know about--

649
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:44,572
I'm Ji-tae's fiancée.

650
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,702
Although, there was no engagement
because of you.

651
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,539
And now I have to eat alone
on my birthday.

652
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,793
Do you have anything to say to me?

653
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,091
-I'm sorry.
-Other than that.

654
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,969
-I'm really sorry.
-Other than that.

655
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,972
I don't know what to say.

656
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,223
Other than that.

657
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,023
I won't see Hyeon-u...

658
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,316
I mean,

659
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,527
I won't see Ji-tae ever again.

660
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,279
Of course, you shouldn't.

661
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,406
Not after receiving a billion won.

662
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:33,997
CHOI JI-TAE

663
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,252
Hey.

664
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,131
Where are you?

665
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,299
Are you with Jeong-eun?

666
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,510
Yes. She's with me.

667
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,221
She said she'd never see you again.

668
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,973
But she told you about me?

669
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,099
Jeong-eun.

670
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:55,310
She needs to learn a lesson.

671
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,146
She took a billion won
and didn't keep her word.

672
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,066
I should tell your mother.

673
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,567
Send her back and just talk to me.

674
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,652
I'm on my way, talk to me instead.

675
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,908
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry?

676
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,618
For what?

677
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,953
How sorry are you?

678
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,460
How dare you...

679
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,837
How dare someone like you...

680
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:27,342
You don't even deserve my jealousy!

681
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,845
I'm sorry.

682
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,680
I really am.

683
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:36,893
I didn't mean to hurt you.

684
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,186
I'm really--

685
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,398
If you're that sorry, die.

686
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:47,112
If you feel that bad,
go and kill yourself.

687
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,697
Take your own life so that Ji-tae

688
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,616
can't go back to you!

689
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,910
Let her go, Jeong-eun!

690
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,871
Let go of her.

691
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,961
Go outside.

692
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,504
I'm sorry.

693
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,591
-Eul.
-I won't

694
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,220
meet Ji-tae again. Don't worry.

695
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:28,736
How far shall we go?

696
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,364
If I become more cruel,

697
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,116
will you give up then?

698
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,931
The doors are opening.

699
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,171
If you like her, just show your feelings.

700
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:14,425
You put someone's life in danger once.
Wasn't that enough?

701
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,886
I'm not going to seek revenge anymore.

702
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,264
You're of no use to me now, Ji-tae.

703
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,182
Ji-tae is planning to dismiss me?

704
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,726
He doesn't have a father?

705
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,646
He didn't make any sound on purpose.

706
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,064
Are you making fun of me?

707
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:29,691
When are you going to die?

708
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,484
Would you like to get seduced by me?

709
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,861
No, wait. How about you seduce me instead?

710
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:36,781
I want my head to be filled
only with thoughts about you.
