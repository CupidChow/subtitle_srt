1
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,591
No, you can't look through those.

2
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,761
Put these on and look in the mirror.

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,347
You'll find what you wanted to know.

4
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,192
Look.

5
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,487
There are moments when we need the rain.

6
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,739
For nature, for farmers,

7
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,741
and for us.

8
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,962
Why do you look at me like that?

9
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:13,716
Time flows at a different speed
for you and me.

10
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,646
You look just as you did
when we first met.

11
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,400
Are you afraid

12
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,778
of the course of life and death
as a human?

13
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,074
I am afraid.

14
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,162
I am not afraid of aging,
illness, or death,

15
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,831
but how you will stand all those years

16
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,916
alone without me.

17
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,502
That is what I fear.

18
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,059
Time doesn't stay still
even if we try to catch it.

19
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,456
I've caught the time.

20
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,157
I'll live my life fine without you.

21
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,701
Coldhearted jerk.

22
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,830
So throw away your bow
and live a long life,

23
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,334
until you're crippled and
your hair turns gray.

24
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,002
Make me hate you before you die.

25
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,673
Promise me that you still won't change.

26
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,386
If I betray you--

27
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:22,428
Then what?

28
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,349
Shoot me.

29
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,077
Your Highness! I mean, my lady.

30
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,290
Where have you been?
I looked everywhere for you.

31
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,292
Do I have to report my toilet business?

32
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,044
-Of course not.
-A word from the palace has come.

33
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,587
You're to return at once.

34
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,589
What?

35
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,383
You should get changed first--

36
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,718
Who dares

37
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,513
to call in a daughter
disowned by the king?

38
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,889
It's the king's order.

39
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,938
Did you just say it is the king's order?

40
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,940
Please come without delay.

41
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,318
His Majesty is in critical condition.

42
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,892
You've grown a lot.

43
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,812
You do not look well.

44
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,859
How was life outside of the palace?

45
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,362
My eyes burned.

46
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,821
Your eyes

47
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,241
burned?

48
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,162
The streets were filled with smoke.

49
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,666
At first, I thought
people were making food,

50
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,627
but it was not so.

51
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,671
People were cremating family
who died of starvation.

52
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,174
Your subjects.

53
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,927
The country is

54
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,638
in chaos.

55
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,349
I thought the country was in chaos,

56
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,810
but that also wasn't the case.

57
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,521
What's chaotic is the king's mind,

58
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,983
for something wicked is

59
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,861
residing within the king's body.

60
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,254
I should've ended your life
from the beginning.

61
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,091
You must be the serpent.

62
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,386
You're the only one in this palace

63
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,222
who has recognized me through the ages.

64
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,478
Come out.

65
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,357
Come out of his body!

66
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,275
Why?

67
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,611
Why don't you
shout for help as you did back then?

68
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,372
Shoot me.

69
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,082
This body won't last anyway.

70
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,962
It wouldn't be bad for your foolish father

71
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:46,048
to die by the daughter he saved.

72
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,383
Stop your nonsense!

73
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,430
Why do you think
you were driven out of the palace?

74
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,223
It's because…

75
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,936
you stole my father's body

76
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,813
and controlled his mind--

77
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,857
It was your father's choice!

78
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,735
What?

79
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,445
From birth, you've always been

80
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,281
nothing but a sacrifice offered to me.

81
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,450
Your father

82
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:16,162
offered me this body to save you.

83
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,048
Bring me the mountain deity.

84
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,926
Then I'll let your father go.

85
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:37,058
As long as I am attached,
your father won't last

86
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,144
more than three days.

87
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,332
Fine.

88
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,168
I'll hand Yeon over.

89
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,382
However,

90
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,636
mountain deities belong to the mountains.

91
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,930
He cannot leave the mountain
he rules over.

92
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,724
-What?
-Let my father go.

93
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,312
And come with me.

94
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,483
I will let you…

95
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,697
use my body.

96
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,454
I'll get him out of the palace,

97
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,499
and trust Yeon to take care of the rest.

98
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,017
This woman means nothing to me.

99
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,936
No way.

100
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,647
Did you think
you could use this woman to trick me?

101
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,068
Don't you think it was me
who used her to lure you out?

102
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,780
Please spare my life.

103
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,158
I don't want to die.

104
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,246
You promised me.

105
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,333
You promised you won't change
until the day I die.

106
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,088
-Yeon.
-Come out of her!

107
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,099
Did you see it?

108
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,230
Answer me. Did you?

109
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,284
Will you please look at me?

110
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,499
What in the world did you see?

111
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,251
I was

112
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,421
killed in my previous life.

113
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,512
You…

114
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,682
killed me.

115
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,644
You only wanted

116
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,314
to capture the serpent.

117
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,108
Lee Yeon.

118
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,822
You used me…

119
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,743
as a sacrifice.

120
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,873
Is that really

121
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,417
who you are?

122
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,005
It was me.

123
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,050
But you saved me time and time again.

124
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,886
And you couldn't get over

125
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,639
your first love for centuries.

126
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,599
You're right.

127
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,312
I killed you.

128
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,274
With my own hands,

129
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,984
I killed you

130
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,279
Why?

131
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,911
Do you wish to relive that old tragedy?

132
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,621
If you get into this,

133
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,332
it'll be either you or her.

134
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,009
That's just who I am.

135
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,681
That's all?

136
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:13,394
You played with my heart
just as you pleased.

137
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,771
Is that all you have to say to me?

138
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,316
At least make an excuse!

139
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,238
Please.

140
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,912
It was just cost-efficient.

141
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,251
I sacrificed one person
to save the lives of thousands.

142
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,711
I'm a deity, after all.

143
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,970
But why am I…

144
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,640
heartbroken?

145
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,062
Why was I worried about you
until the moment you killed me?

146
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,355
And why am I

147
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,192
in tears because of you?

148
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,828
Don't be deluded.

149
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,415
Those emotions aren't yours.

150
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,336
You just had a peek at your past life.
Don't act like you are that woman.

151
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,423
You asshole.

152
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,717
That's right.

153
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,137
Don't waste your time
on an asshole like me.

154
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,264
Don't make that mistake in this life.

155
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,561
That way, you'll live longer.

156
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,460
Your rice is fully cooked.

157
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,576
TRADITIONAL KOREAN CUISINE: SNAIL BRIDE

158
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,496
Bring me
the most expensive liquor you have.

159
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,834
When will that punk ever grow up?

160
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,837
Should I open up
a bottle of single malt whisky?

161
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,046
Don't give him anything.

162
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,133
It looks like
something bad is about to happen.

163
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,479
Did she see it?

164
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,694
She did! What did she say?

165
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,781
Tell me.
I'll be too curious to sleep tonight.

166
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,284
Rang.

167
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,911
What?

168
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,458
What do you want to be
if you can be reborn?

169
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,626
What's this nonsense?

170
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,838
Tell me.

171
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,675
I don't mind whatever I become.

172
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,553
Well, if I had to choose, a Dokdo shrimp.

173
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,681
I like how it looks great with a mustache.

174
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,099
And it's luxurious.

175
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:44,938
If I can be reborn,
I want to try living as a human.

176
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,816
What a pathetic wish.

177
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,989
I want a life filled with things
that would be my firsts and lasts.

178
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,993
Taking first steps. First picnic.

179
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,663
First love.

180
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,083
What is this pitiful nonsense
you're spewing?

181
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:08,629
Nothing much. I never got a chance
to talk to you this frankly.

182
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,214
Have you gone insane?

183
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,633
Did you let yourself go
after fighting with her?

184
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,176
The serpent--

185
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,180
Where is it right now?

186
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,932
Do you think I'll tell you?

187
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,310
I knew you wouldn't.

188
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,022
So this is your choice.

189
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:41,578
TRADITIONAL KOREAN CUISINE: SNAIL BRIDE

190
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,462
Do you want to play?

191
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,673
We used to play often.

192
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,927
It's not fun playing with you at all.

193
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,804
You've never won against me.

194
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,643
Are you in or not?

195
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,781
Gotcha!

196
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,579
Yeon, why is the sky blue?

197
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,916
No idea. I didn't paint it.

198
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,128
Then why do owls cry, "hoot, hoot?"

199
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,547
No idea. I didn't make them cry.

200
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,134
This thing.
Why do azalea flowers taste sweet?

201
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,719
Why do flowers bloom in spring?

202
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,970
Shut up.

203
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,680
What was that for?

204
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,640
Why do you have so many questions?

205
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,644
I just like listening to you talk.

206
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,011
Your moves are too hasty.

207
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,935
Leave the tail.

208
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,856
Don't play useless empty spots.

209
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,276
I won!

210
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,612
-I won again!
-Darn it.

211
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,405
What a shame.

212
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,577
Not bad, kid.

213
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,120
I'm not a kid.

214
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,966
It'll never fly if you run like that.

215
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,767
It's up! It's flying!

216
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,107
Raising a kid is a lot of work.

217
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,242
You're too slow. Again.

218
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,165
Does it seem odd?

219
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:36,670
How did you manage to beat me every time
with those poor skills?

220
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,214
Shut up.

221
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,722
I let you win.

222
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,309
There was never an exception.

223
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,733
I said shut up.

224
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,902
I won't let you win anymore.

225
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,032
That's what I wanted to say.

226
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,621
Hey, stop right there.

227
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,418
If you leave, that'll be the end of us.

228
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,634
Sorry.

229
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,389
Sorry?

230
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,142
At this point in time?

231
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,894
For saving you

232
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,105
after your human mother abandoned you.

233
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,692
If I hadn't,

234
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,446
we wouldn't have met as brothers.

235
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,393
Mom.

236
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,401
Go away! Let me go!

237
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,545
Mom. Mom?

238
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,422
Mom.

239
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,507
Mom.

240
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,584
Are you that kid?

241
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,044
The one my father had with a human?

242
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,047
Are you a fox too?

243
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,179
I heard you shared our father's blood,

244
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,847
but you aren't much.

245
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,183
You haven't the will to live.

246
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,479
What a waste of time. I'm leaving.

247
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,274
Look, it's still alive.

248
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:48,612
That's an agwi,
a being that cannot die.

249
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,363
Those who starve to death

250
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,324
hold grudges deeper than one expects.

251
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,536
Even so,
I like them over those who give up easily.

252
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:58,705
Wait.

253
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,212
It's up to you
to live as a human or a fox.

254
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,631
But remember this, kid.

255
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:11,301
There is no salvation to those
who won't save themselves.

256
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,486
Wait for me!

257
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,865
Wait for me, big brother.

258
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,748
Big brother!

259
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,406
I'll wait here.

260
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,700
Here? All day long?

261
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,994
If anything, I'm an expert at waiting.

262
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,915
I can sit here not only 24 hours,
but 24 years.

263
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,399
You'll live much longer than me.

264
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,320
Do you want one? You don't look so well.

265
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,781
I'll pass for today.

266
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:06,035
A human soul stinks whenever I eat one.

267
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:10,206
Their memories also seep into our dreams
and give us nightmares.

268
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,002
But it's thanks to their souls
that we can carry on living.

269
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,546
Both me and you, Mr. Lee.

270
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,090
Why bladder cherries of all things? Gross.

271
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:22,969
He said these bladder cherries look
the most similar to the shape of a soul.

272
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,974
Is the serpent home? Let's see his face.

273
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,439
Not right now.

274
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,818
I did all his work for him so far.

275
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,654
shouldn't he be thanking me
in person at the least?

276
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,573
If not, he's just a leech.

277
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,534
You can talk to me.

278
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,911
I don't want to.

279
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:52,081
I'm just worried. I don't want
an important guest like you to get hurt.

280
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,208
What?

281
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:01,049
You two go and take me for an idiot
just because

282
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,717
I played along for a while.

283
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,599
-Why are you laughing?
-Let him go.

284
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,415
Are you the serpent?

285
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,460
Nice to meet you.
I've been wanting to see you too.

286
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,178
What are you doing here?

287
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,305
You wouldn't answer my texts or calls.

288
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,520
I have to talk to you

289
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,272
about the dog you saved, Yu-ri.

290
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,024
Is it dead?

291
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,776
That's not it.

292
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,695
That guy doesn't have…

293
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,824
a name.

294
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,327
Just call it whatever you want.

295
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,872
No, its name is its identity.

296
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:17,000
Then put in a little effort
and name him for me.

297
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,794
But you're the mommy.

298
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:23,965
I'm the mom?

299
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,801
Right, I'm the mom.

300
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,929
Anastasia. Go with that.

301
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:31,890
Anastasia?

302
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,893
That's a pretty name.

303
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,519
He's a boy, but it suits him.

304
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,229
Of course, it does.

305
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,111
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

306
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,197
You really are
the Yu-ri I thought you were.

307
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,160
If you ever look at me
with those eyes again,

308
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,412
you'll lose your eyesight forever.

309
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,751
I don't care how you lived your life.

310
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,713
I don't care why you approached me.

311
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,715
I'll show you

312
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,176
that this world
isn't just filled with wickedness.

313
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:12,639
I'll make sure
you regret what you just said.

314
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,891
I look forward to it.

315
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,935
Look!

316
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,439
I'm seriously going to kill you!

317
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,732
See you around.

318
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,745
I thought you'd still be a kid.

319
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,413
You must have eaten a lot.

320
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,249
Could you give us a moment?

321
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,586
-But--
-I'll be fine.

322
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,887
Why are you so sad?

323
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,684
-What?
-You're deeply hurt.

324
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:58,977
Cut your crap.

325
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:00,937
Your brother?

326
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,318
I can see it.

327
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,821
There's hell in your heart.

328
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:15,576
This thing's much more annoying
than I expected.

329
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,286
Don't you think we're similar?

330
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,081
I personally despise things that molt.

331
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,794
Listen up.

332
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,923
I don't care what you're after.
I'm doing things my way now.

333
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,174
I can't keep waiting.

334
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,968
You want to kill that woman.

335
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,640
I can't let you do that.

336
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,600
Why is that?

337
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,771
She was my sacrifice to begin with.

338
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,774
She'll be my bride.

339
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:55,199
Congratulations on your promotion!

340
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,414
-Are you all crazy?
-That's what I'm saying.

341
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,292
Mr. Choi was just promoted
to general manager.

342
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,128
What did he ever do to get promoted?

343
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,672
If you're jealous, just say so.

344
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,051
I guess they didn't know
you spend most of your time

345
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,427
on self-improvement,

346
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,262
at billiards, gyms, and karaokes.

347
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,974
I only went to that karaoke once
when I got divorced.

348
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,518
-He sang "She's Gone."
-Hey!

349
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,978
Who wants cake?

350
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,408
Why are you so down?

351
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,953
-I'm fine.
-You aren't.

352
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,747
We've worked together for too long.

353
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,792
Did you fight with your boyfriend?

354
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,836
Make up with him.

355
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,255
You'll never date again
if you break up with him.

356
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:52,799
Get a grip.

357
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,302
He's much better in every aspect
except for your young age.

358
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,970
She's not worse off.

359
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,681
Why are you so disheartening?

360
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,850
It's true. What I said is true.

361
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,644
-Only we get to mess with her.
-Yes.

362
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,189
Where have you been?
I looked everywhere for you.

363
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,112
You acted like
such a big shot for nothing.

364
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,988
Did you find a new story?

365
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,241
Yes, just now.

366
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,369
What is it?

367
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,162
Previous life.

368
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,181
Do you want a hug?

369
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,892
-Get lost.
-I'm relieved.

370
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,770
You're still the same Mr. Lee.

371
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,401
I made some fried tofu rice balls.

372
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,446
You haven't eaten or slept, right?

373
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,824
I don't want any.

374
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,287
Try just one.
It's sweet, sour, and delicious.

375
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,830
I'm not a preschool kid.

376
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,169
Look at that!

377
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,757
Hey.

378
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,758
Eat up

379
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,052
to protect her and put up a fight.

380
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,808
Anyway,

381
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,227
why didn't you tell her

382
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,188
it was a misunderstanding?

383
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,649
You could've said,
"What you saw isn't the entire story."

384
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,028
Everything is unraveling again.

385
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,450
If history repeats itself,

386
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,580
I have to let Ji-a remember me
as a bigger asshole than this.

387
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,543
You're afraid.

388
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,089
You're afraid she might try to save you
instead of herself,

389
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,592
just like Lady A-eum did.

390
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,890
Are you sure you won't regret this?

391
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,396
No.

392
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,983
But you're still going to take a step back
and protect her from afar?

393
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,402
-Yes.
-After such a long wait?

394
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,570
Yes.

395
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,031
Are you serious?

396
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,201
It's my decision.

397
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,045
Please keep an eye on her.

398
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,969
The rice ball was good.

399
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,019
I'll go with you.

400
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,564
It's all right.
I know this doctor personally.

401
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,692
-What about lunch?
-You can eat first.

402
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,087
Mister!

403
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,256
Mister.

404
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,135
Why are you ignoring me?

405
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,304
I didn't want to say hi.

406
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,514
I kept waiting for you.

407
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,767
Why would you wait for me?

408
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,896
I did some thinking
on what I wanted to be when I grow up.

409
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:41,110
When I was six,
I wanted to be a triceratops.

410
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,405
But then when I turned seven,

411
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,908
the owner of an internet cafe
seemed really cool.

412
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,870
-Then I turned eight--
-Stop.

413
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,122
Cut to the chase.

414
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,041
I want to be like you.

415
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,002
You're good looking, brave, and you have

416
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,507
You and I are different to the core.

417
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,135
-Why?
-I'm the guy who beats people up.

418
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:11,432
It looks like
someone must have beaten you up.

419
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,769
Was it at school? Or at home?

420
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,063
I wasn't beaten up.

421
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,941
I don't care if you live as a guy
who gets hit or hits others,

422
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,321
but I heard
there's no salvation for someone

423
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,199
who won't save himself.

424
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,507
I heard they were half-brothers,
but there must be more.

425
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,009
I was very moved.

426
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,513
His fractured soul smelled so sweet.

427
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,101
Let's test it out.

428
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,813
He might become
another weakness for Lee Yeon.

429
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,273
How?

430
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,236
We're about to have a guest.

431
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,492
Goodness. I'll take that.

432
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,078
-What are you doing? Take one.
-Thank you.

433
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,372
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

434
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,416
This is…

435
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,920
The green plum smells excellent.

436
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:26,215
It's made with organic green plums
from Hadong.

437
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,217
Hadong? No wonder.

438
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,720
I once went to cover
the Hadong Plum Blossom Festival.

439
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,473
-That was back when…
-Ma'am.

440
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,560
The petals from the flowers
began to flutter down,

441
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,936
and it looked…

442
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,815
Let me take you there one of these days.

443
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:44,942
Goodness.

444
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,072
Why? What?

445
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,199
You never covered that festival.

446
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,665
What brings you here?

447
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:03,377
Why else would I come to a restaurant?
I came to eat, of course.

448
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,755
And I know how good of a cook you are.

449
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:08,966
Leave.

450
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:13,220
I might have rice left over
to feed the mice,

451
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,055
but none for you.

452
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,142
Look at this hag.

453
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,437
Did you bury all your fears

454
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,857
along with those kimchi jars
after living centuries as a widow?

455
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,774
Or

456
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,944
did you forget who I was?

457
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,824
How could I forget you?

458
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,621
You're the one who killed my husband.

459
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,874
Goodness, my dear girl, Snail Bride.

460
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,877
You still didn't get over
that foolish farmer?

461
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,173
Why did you do it?

462
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,968
Everyone has a wound

463
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,137
kept deep inside their hearts.

464
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,223
All I did was

465
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:00,392
mess around with his trauma like usual.

466
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,937
And if he got too caught up
and couldn't return,

467
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,523
you should blame it on his weak will.

468
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,359
Why? Why did it have to be him?

469
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:13,572
Do you actually mean to ask
why it was you?

470
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,617
What?

471
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,410
You know…

472
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,121
I hate your kind the most.

473
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,500
The main characters of famous folk tales.

474
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:28,712
There's no one out there
who even remembers my name.

475
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,509
Are you okay?

476
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,643
Do you need help?

477
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:46,146
-Please don't mind me.
-How can I not mind you?

478
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,524
Excuse me, lady.

479
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:52,278
If you don't like the customer service,
go somewhere else.

480
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:55,489
You'll end up on the news
for abusing your rights as a customer!

481
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,618
What are you the most afraid of?

482
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,163
What?

483
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,252
You're afraid of planes.

484
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,214
What?

485
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,385
Wait, why is this guy here?

486
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,930
You need to leave now.

487
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,069
See you around, then.

488
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:46,415
Is that woman a shaman?

489
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,378
Can you tell that I have a fear of flying?

490
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,016
CHEONHWASUBOK RICE WINE

491
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,772
Today is your son's death anniversary.

492
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,566
You remembered.

493
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,612
Where's Granny?

494
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,614
Probably cooped up somewhere

495
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,533
throwing a fit.

496
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,247
Ever since then,

497
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,626
you both lived
with a sharp pain in your hearts.

498
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,836
That's probably why

499
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,923
she's more strict with you.

500
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:41,303
Yes, I've heard that from her
more than I care to.

501
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,806
"That darned love.

502
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:47,434
It'll escape right through your hands
like grains of sand.

503
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,812
But you keep
putting your life on the line for it."

504
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,023
If you take your own life,

505
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,403
you cannot be reborn.

506
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,532
Just as our Bok-gil.

507
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,685
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

508
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,609
Starting now,
I'm going to do everything I can

509
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,072
to save my life and hers.

510
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,761
I'm sorry, Mother.

511
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:08,098
Why did you kill yourself
if you were sorry?

512
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,945
-Have you been well?
-Yes, very well.

513
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,657
You really did quit drinking.

514
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,742
You look much better now.

515
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,914
I'd love to have my son
be as concerned for me as you do.

516
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,210
So Ms. Nam,
what are you looking into this time?

517
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,756
Is this really our first life?

518
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:25,968
Previous life.

519
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,095
Previous life?

520
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,931
I'm planning a few case studies.

521
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,060
I heard there are a number of children
who say they remember their past life.

522
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,396
That's their argument, at least.

523
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,566
Although this isn't
acknowledged academically…

524
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,706
BOY REMEMBERS PAST LIFE
AND SOLVES MURDER CASE

525
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,667
A Syrian boy
who remembers his previous life?

526
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,043
Since he was four,

527
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:03,714
he kept insisting that he was
a man named Muhammad in his past life.

528
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,716
He singled out the house

529
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,844
he lived in his past life
in a city he had never been to,

530
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:12,139
then even pointed out
the neighbor who murdered him.

531
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,142
That's interesting.

532
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,060
May I borrow this?

533
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,695
So

534
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,656
why did you choose to look into this?

535
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,826
Just trying to make a living,
and I didn't have a good story.

536
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,494
Why?

537
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,956
She asked me the same question
on that same chair.

538
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,042
Who did?

539
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,752
Your mom.

540
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,505
What?

541
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,425
Your mom and I scrapped those together.

542
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:54,556
My mom was a surgeon.
Why did she look into this?

543
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:56,683
You really

544
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,519
don't remember anything at all?

545
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:02,856
What do you mean?

546
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,816
When you were nine years old,

547
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,652
your mom asked me

548
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,363
to do hypnotherapy on you.

549
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,704
Do you believe in a previous life?

550
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:21,249
-Yes, I do.
-Why?

551
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,670
Because of déjà-vu.

552
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,421
Someone you met for the first time

553
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:29,091
might feel like someone you already know,

554
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:32,052
or a strange place
may suddenly feel like home.

555
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,929
You've felt that way?

556
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,472
When I backpacked in Paris.

557
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,392
-At the Versailles Palace.
-Come on.

558
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,603
-What about you?
-Asides from believing it or not,

559
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,689
I wish reincarnation doesn't exist.

560
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,817
-Why not?
-This life is tough as is.

561
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,694
What if I'm reborn as a mosquito?

562
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,278
Then I'll be mosquito repellent.

563
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,909
Don't be obsessed with me
just because you grabbed my hand once.

564
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:09,840
You'll find what you want to know
on that disc.

565
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,169
Which team are you in?

566
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,088
Right.

567
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,007
May I see your ID?

568
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,428
NAM JI-A, HYPNOTHERAPY

569
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,780
Go in deeper and deeper.

570
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:19,701
Slowly. Very slowly.

571
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,915
As you get off, you see a door.

572
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,375
Will you open it?

573
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,212
I don't want to.

574
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,672
It's all right.

575
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,342
I don't want to open it.

576
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,885
Why not?

577
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,097
Something scary might pop out.

578
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,433
If it does, your mom and I will
drive it away.

579
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,354
Try opening the door.

580
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,287
You went in.

581
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,249
What do you see?

582
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,712
People. They're wearing hanbok.

583
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,008
But this is so funny.

584
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,469
What's so funny?

585
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,389
What are the people doing?

586
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,559
-They're lying down.
-Why?

587
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,144
Because…

588
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,231
they were all killed.

589
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,278
Ji-a, can you hear me?

590
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,116
Ji-a.

591
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:47,414
Be quiet, won't you?
I can't sleep with all this noise.

592
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,420
Why did you wake me up?
It's not my time yet.

593
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,798
You are Ji-a, aren't you?

594
00:52:57,382 --> 00:53:00,218
I am that little girl, but also not.

595
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,055
Who are you?

596
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,474
Can you hand me some water?

597
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,482
That's nice.

598
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,453
I was born in a leap month of a leap year
in a snake cave,

599
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,497
a graveyard for plague victims,

600
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:34,002
a place where the living and dead all
struggled to save themselves.

601
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,005
It was hell on earth.

602
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,217
One day,

603
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,969
a beast in human form
walked out of the cave.

604
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,473
What did the people call me?

605
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,684
Yes, the serpent.

606
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:56,024
Anyway, where's the mountain deity now?
I need to find him.

607
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,743
"No food

608
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,704
or drink allowed.

609
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:15,460
If you're the last to leave the room,

610
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:18,505
please turn off the editor."

611
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,385
There you are.

612
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,896
Ji-a, what are you doing here?

613
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,946
I was looking at some records.

614
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,447
What's up?

615
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,324
I have to edit subtitles.

616
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,619
I'll wrap it up.

617
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,792
Basement floor one.

618
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,767
Excuse me.

619
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,602
I'm not buying.

620
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,565
You don't have to buy anything.

621
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,525
Just have a taste, handsome man.

622
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,695
Hey, lady, can't you read?

623
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,905
DO NOT RING BELL

624
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:30,702
Anyway, what are you the most afraid of?

625
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:35,040
Someone like you. Solicitors.

626
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,460
Come on, that's not it.

627
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:40,628
Get lost.

628
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,889
I saw everything.

629
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,758
I ended up in my damned old house?

630
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,762
I can't believe how wasted I am.

631
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,765
You illegitimate kid!

632
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,185
He's born from a fox!

633
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,105
All the livestock in town died
because of him!

634
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:25,358
-He must have eaten their livers!
-That's right.

635
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,236
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

636
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,030
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

637
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,700
-Die!
-Kill him!

638
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,618
-Kill him!
-End its life!

639
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,830
-Die!
-Kill him!

640
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,708
-Die!
-It's all his fault!

641
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,585
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

642
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,420
-Kill him!
-That's enough!

643
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,801
-Kill him!
-Stop, all of you!

644
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,165
How?

645
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:27,795
That day,

646
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,674
you watched the whole thing.

647
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:43,811
You

648
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,106
shouldn't have been born.

649
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:52,612
I've done just about everything

650
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,114
to lose you during pregnancy.

651
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,908
I've had poisonous plants,

652
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,494
rolled down a hill,

653
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:04,040
and even struck my stomach with a rock.

654
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:09,170
But your beastly life was too persistent.

655
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:12,882
How are you still alive
after being beaten by those men?

656
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:18,972
You are

657
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,934
a monster, my baby.

658
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,403
Come. Come with me.

659
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:34,779
Don't touch me!

660
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:50,962
This

661
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:53,506
isn't a dream.

662
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:11,232
Could this be the Forest of Agwi?

663
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,111
It's an agwi.

664
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:27,874
I'm not going to die.

665
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,126
Because this is when…

666
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,253
Sorry for saving you

667
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,965
when your human mother abandoned you.

668
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:37,550
Yeon will

669
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,553
no longer come to save me.

670
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,582
I need you,

671
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,542
Yeon.

672
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,216
Young lady.

673
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,677
Try this.

674
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,261
It's a free sample.

675
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,305
Thank you.

676
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:27,308
Are you new here?

677
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,434
I haven't met you.

678
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,188
We're holding a special event today.

679
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:34,273
An event?

680
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,943
You'll find out soon enough.

681
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:46,202
Young lady,
what are you the most afraid of?

682
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,666
I guess it's Fox Hill.

683
01:01:58,715 --> 01:01:59,674
Ma'am!

684
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,783
Ta-da. Here's your birthday present.

685
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:38,713
Fox Hill.

686
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,871
You ended up in the Forest of Agwi.

687
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,257
-You.
-My condolences in advance.

688
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,802
If this was a game,
it'd be the worst stage.

689
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,222
Did you do this?

690
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:33,392
If you die here, you'll actually die.

691
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,019
I'll tear you to pieces.

692
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:36,479
Here's something funnier.

693
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,192
I plan on telling this news
to your brother.

694
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:45,738
Don't get too excited.

695
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,741
His girlfriend is in a similar situation.

696
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,094
Dad!

697
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:11,514
Dad, can't you hear me?
You have to stop the car!

698
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,224
Mom!

699
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,271
Dad, stop the car.

700
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,942
Dad! Stop the car!

701
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:39,333
Say that again.

702
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:43,337
As you can see, there are two doors.

703
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:47,466
One leads to your brother,
and the other to your girlfriend.

704
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,970
Which one will you choose?

705
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,096
I say number three.

706
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,891
I want to break your neck.

707
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,183
Go ahead.

708
01:04:57,101 --> 01:05:00,229
Once you break the rule,
they'll be stuck in there forever.

709
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,231
The serpent sent you, right?

710
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:07,361
Well, let's say we're business partners.

711
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:11,699
Hey, lady.

712
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:17,121
Just you wait.
I'll repay my debt very soon.

713
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,581
You better hurry.

714
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,959
They both don't have much time.

715
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,668
Mom! Dad! Stop the car.

716
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:07,421
Stop the car! Stop it now!

717
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:27,835
I knew he'd only be concerned
about that woman.

718
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:31,589
Hey, kid!

719
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:41,682
Yeon?

720
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,521
I heard you talking bad about me.

721
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,274
Get your hands off.

722
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,694
This isn't the time to play hard to get.

723
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:35,736
Can I really save both of them
from this hell?

724
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:39,031
I was in my office just moments ago.

01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:41,992
Just think. What's your biggest fear?

726
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,244
Getting abandoned.

727
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:46,539
-I have…
-No!

728
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,082
…never abandoned you.

729
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,793
Yeon already had an idea

730
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,711
of what he was up against.

731
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:55,631
I'm not alone. I trust Yeon.

732
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:59,051
Please don't let my choice be
the wrong one.
