1
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,538
So where are we going?

2
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,043
The place where the story of A-eum and me
began and ended.

3
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,298
It's the forest I used to rule over.

4
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:35,053
My birthplace, my home, and my workplace.

5
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,625
Did you know the Joseon era
had their own Valentine's Day?

6
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,295
On the day of the coming of spring,

7
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,007
couples used to exchange ginkgo nuts
as their token of love.

8
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,551
Why ginkgo nuts?

9
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,595
A male and female ginkgo tree mate
to bear fruit,

10
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,681
and they live long, for over 1,000 years.

11
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,517
So you kept the Valentine's Day gift
from your ex-girlfriend

12
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,435
to this day?

13
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,645
No.

14
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,063
It was a farewell gift.

15
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,358
We broke up after she gave me these.

16
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,193
Here.

17
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,701
I'll protect you.

18
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,664
What?

19
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,500
You said a mountain deity protects
the entire mountain.

20
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,335
Then someone should protect him too.

21
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,129
Why would you do that?

22
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,964
Because I like you.

23
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,188
Who do you think you are?

24
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,316
What can you possibly do?

25
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,526
What's wrong?

26
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,155
Don't think you're special
just because I let you talk to me.

27
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,949
How ridiculous.

28
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,453
You can't be as powerful as I am.

29
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,956
What can you do to keep me safe?

30
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,791
You're merely a human.

31
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,794
Do you mean that?

32
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,339
I do.

33
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,762
So don't ever come back here.

34
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,445
But you didn't mean it.

35
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,906
I was afraid.

36
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,951
I thought an immortal like me

37
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:06,204
shouldn't fall in love
with a mortal human.

38
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,081
How were you two reunited?

39
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,832
Did you go find her?

40
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,796
I was the lord of this mountain,

41
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,798
bound to the very place I rule.

42
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,717
A mountain deity cannot leave his forest.

43
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,970
What happens if you do?

44
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,763
I become weaker.

45
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,767
I can't yield my power as a deity.

46
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,603
I once went over the boundary

47
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,690
as I chased after a group
of tiger-devoured ghosts.

48
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,401
A thousand-year-old
Nine-tailed Fox is here!

49
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,736
-A Nine-tailed Fox?
-It's a Nine-tailed Fox!

50
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,823
-A Nine-tailed Fox!
-Get that thing!

51
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,450
-He's over here!
-It's a Nine-tailed Fox!

52
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,411
Over here.

53
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:47,996
It's a bloodstain!

54
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,123
-Over there!
-Get him!

55
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,916
-Wait for me!
-A Nine-tailed Fox!

56
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,710
Where is it?

57
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,461
He must have gone this way!

58
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,092
How indecent!

59
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,719
That way. Let's go that way.

60
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,804
Oh, dear. That's so indecent.

61
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,079
Go.

62
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,623
Your forest is down this road.

63
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,542
A-eum.

64
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,173
I never saw you here today.

65
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,558
Thank you.

66
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,979
I'll make sure I repay your kindness.

67
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,464
I found you.

68
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,843
I'll come and get you very soon.

69
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,345
Just you wait.

70
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:30,973
What's so funny?

71
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,351
It seems like
the stage is finally completed.

72
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,687
-"Stage?"
-I found out through the Darkness

73
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,606
that Lee Yeon

74
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,275
won't be able to kill the woman
in this life.

75
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,112
So why does it have to be them?

76
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,825
It was mine to begin with.

77
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,829
His role as a deity
and his place by that woman's side.

78
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,667
-Then--
-I'll take his body, become a deity,

79
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,503
and take her as my bride.

80
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,390
This place is mesmerizing.

81
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,362
Why don't you ask?

82
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,285
Why I repaid your kindness with evil

83
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,289
or why I killed you in your past life?

84
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,332
On my way here, I found out

85
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,045
there isn't just one version of the legend
woven around this beautiful waterfall.

86
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,216
It's about a married couple
who were deeply in love.

87
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,051
One ended with the husband's death,

88
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,137
and another, with the wife's death.

89
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,057
The tragic tale of the Nine-tailed Fox

90
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,935
who had to kill his first love

91
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,273
probably has another side of the story
I don't know of.

92
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,255
A-eum.

93
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,135
-Why did you shoot me?
-This woman's shell is rather useful.

94
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,056
I get to shoot as many arrows as I wish

95
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,433
on the body of the impenetrable deity.

96
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,230
Serpent.

97
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,735
Long time no see, Yeon.
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

98
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,863
-Where's A-eum?
-Right here.

99
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,659
She let me use her body
to save her father.

100
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,828
Come out of her body.

101
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,125
I forgot to tell you.

102
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,711
That's evening primrose
picked from a graveyard.

103
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,387
I told you to come out of her.

104
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,847
-This woman is mine.
-Come out!

105
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,072
Should I kill her and come out?

106
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,410
This woman means nothing to me.

107
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:39,996
No way.

108
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,290
You must have thought
you used her to get to me.

109
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,460
Don't you think
I used her as bait to awaken you?

110
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,719
Please spare my life.

111
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,597
I don't want to die.

112
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,477
You promised me.

113
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,813
You promised you won't change
until the day I die.

114
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,942
Yeon.

115
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,709
No.

116
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:10,836
No.

117
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:15,800
A-eum.

118
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,343
Is that you?

119
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,266
Don't come closer.

120
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,487
It's you.

121
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,155
I killed

122
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,034
everyone in the village.

123
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,501
I killed everyone.

124
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,962
It wasn't your fault.

125
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,801
Help me, Yeon.

126
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,555
Stop me from hurting more people.

127
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,976
Please stop me from hurting you.

128
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,064
Kill me.

129
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,779
It's all right.

130
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,281
I'm here for you.

131
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,783
Everything will be okay.

132
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,257
She is one persistent brat.

133
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,431
You can't cut me down or save her,
can you?

134
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,857
I'm what you want.

135
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,362
Take my body

136
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,448
and let her go.

137
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,910
How touching.

138
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,165
I won't say it twice.

139
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,043
Will it be a deity's body or hers?

140
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,385
Fine. I'll let the woman go.

141
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,721
However,

142
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,224
give me your heart.

143
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,979
I heard the spirit of a deity is
in their hearts.

144
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,523
Cut it out.

145
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,736
A-eum.

146
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,324
You're listening, right?

147
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,539
Promise me one thing.

148
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,126
That you'll forget me.

149
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,797
Forget all about me

150
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,591
and live long.

151
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,688
You don't have to be sorry

152
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,066
or grateful to me.

153
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,529
My life was yours to begin with.

154
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,834
How dare you kill yourself?

155
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,462
A-eum.

156
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,469
Let go. I'm fine.

157
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,809
Yeon.

158
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,314
You asked me to forget you,

159
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,941
but I don't want to.

160
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,110
Don't forget me.

161
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,492
-What are you talking about?
-If you see another woman,

162
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,620
I'll crawl out of my grave.

163
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,372
Let me go.

164
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,208
Repay my kindness, Yeon.

165
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,005
No.

166
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,734
Please kill me.

167
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,096
I promised, didn't I?

168
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,516
That I will

169
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,353
protect you.

170
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,169
A-eum.

171
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,740
Thank you, Yeon.

172
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,660
For keeping your promise to remember me.

173
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,914
And

174
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,041
I'm sorry

175
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,252
for making you wait so long.

176
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,230
That was very precious to you.

177
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,735
You aren't a shadow of my past.

178
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,073
I'll face you for who you are,

179
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,076
not as the reincarnation of A-eum.

180
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,397
You're back.
I thought you died in the Forest of Agwi.

181
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,651
Whatever. I was thrilled.

182
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,028
Right now?

183
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,741
Do whatever you want.

184
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,504
Are you okay? Should I get Sin-ju again?

185
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,091
Don't make a fuss. It's nothing.

186
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,679
It's not because of the poison, right?

187
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,557
Your time has come.

188
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,600
I'm right, aren't I?

189
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,563
I lived a pretty long life for a half-fox.

190
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,900
Please just have the bladder cherry.

191
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,819
You can steal those human lives
to live longer.

192
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,654
Yeon is on his way.

193
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,991
I'm going to tell him
all about the serpent.

194
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,493
Only I know what he looks like.

195
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,204
What about you?

196
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,042
I never dreamed of having a future anyway.

197
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,835
Don't. Please don't do that!

198
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,213
Why do you have
to take things so far for him?

199
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,801
Don't say a word to Yeon.

200
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,471
Forget him.

201
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,474
Go ask the serpent to let you live.

202
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,726
Or tell me where he is.

203
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,686
I'll steal some bladder cherries for you.

204
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,146
Yu-ri.

205
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,024
Why do you cry for me?

206
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,692
It's frustrating.

207
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,069
What did I say?

208
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,738
Don't ever cry for anyone else.

209
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,282
Don't turn your life into a soap opera.

210
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,701
You told me to take
instead of getting taken from

211
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,536
when we first met.

212
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,872
You said that while
covered in the zookeeper's blood.

213
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,624
You told me to live that life.

214
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,337
I'm an impulsive guy.

215
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,970
Stop sniffling and go get some naengmyeon.

216
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,472
-I'm craving some in Pyongyang style.
-Darn you.

217
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,324
I want to go back to those days.

218
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,743
I can't seem to remember the taste

219
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,289
of those azaleas.

220
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,758
Hey.

221
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,513
What's on your mind?
You look totally entranced.

222
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,057
I definitely remember
seeing him somewhere.

223
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,809
-Who?
-Ms. Nam's boyfriend.

224
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:56,231
If anything, you do have sharp eyes.

225
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,649
What were our recent stories?

226
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,695
The part-timer story.
The cursed wedding ring.

227
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,196
-The haunted house--
-Wait.

228
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,866
It's somewhere around then.

229
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,492
This is driving me insane.

230
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,994
-Who was it?
-The red umbrella?

231
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,455
What are you talking about?

232
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,497
He's right.

233
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,541
The guy you met on that day was

234
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,879
the guy with the red umbrella
we've been looking for.

235
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:36,897
What's wrong?

236
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,650
Am I not the guest you were expecting?

237
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,659
Where did he go?

238
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,581
Lee Yeon?

239
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,042
Do you know me?

240
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,794
Where's Rang?

241
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,922
No idea. He was gone when I returned,
and he won't pick up.

242
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,175
You have zero manners for your elders,
so you must be her.

243
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,178
The necklace thief and the dog's mom.

244
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,638
The relationship of 99 points.

245
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,474
-What?
-It's a thing.

246
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,310
Hey, it's Pyongyang style naengmyeon.

247
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,521
That's for Mr. Lee. Don't eat it!

248
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,648
It'll taste bad if it gets bloated.

249
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,650
Darn it.

250
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,365
Goodness, you really don't look well.

251
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,200
Can you keep your distance?

252
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,244
You reek of rotting corpses.

253
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,080
It's the smell of death.

254
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:37,958
We lived much longer than we deserved.
Both of us.

255
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:41,920
Want some?

256
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,718
No, thanks.

257
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,263
Will you give up your life
for your petty pride?

258
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,347
Is it worth that much?

259
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,724
Do I look that desperate
to save myself like you?

260
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,184
You don't.

261
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,149
You weren't like that,
but you look full of regrets.

262
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,900
That's not like you, Mr. Lee.

263
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,153
Let's keep it short.

264
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,990
Do you plan on defying our master?

265
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,826
Our master? No, your master.

266
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,579
You must be mad
after the Darkness incident.

267
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,330
But it's just a misunderstanding.

268
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,375
He pushed me into the Forest of Agwi.

269
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,169
That was a misunderstanding?

270
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,172
He took things a bit too far
while trying to catch Lee Yeon.

271
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,091
He wouldn't have left you there forever.

272
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,593
Bad news.

273
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,220
I can't deal with your lies anymore.

274
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,560
You know that, despite my condition,

275
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,812
ending your life is a piece of cake.

276
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,106
Wait. Wait a second.

277
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,529
This is odd.

278
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,825
Your master
should've entered the scene by now.

279
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,161
Let me take a guess.

280
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,419
The serpent

281
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,963
isn't home right now.

282
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,513
That was a good meal.

283
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,397
-What?
-Get out of here. Get lost.

284
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,791
All he has is ice.

285
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,668
I guess he doesn't keep ice cream.

286
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,466
All he keeps is this rude imported fox.

287
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,634
I hate you.

288
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,261
I never asked.

289
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,681
Don't get near Mr. Lee.

290
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,308
-What if I do?
-I'll kill you.

291
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,353
-Who do you think you are?
-Ki Yu-ri.

292
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,897
-I never asked for an introduction.
-You just asked me.

293
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,818
You don't look all that smart.

294
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,444
You two can communicate, right?

295
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,072
-I know him much better than you.
-I wonder.

296
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:17,409
He only adds mustard to naengmyeon,
not vinegar.

297
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,744
And he gets rashes if he eats crabs.

298
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,413
He won't eat gimbap with cucumbers.

299
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,624
It's all about food.

300
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,627
But because of you,
because of someone like you, he--

301
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,337
Don't say a word to Yeon.

302
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,007
What did he do?

303
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,343
Damn it. It's none of your business.

304
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,066
-You're laughing?
-You can't kill me.

305
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,693
You shouldn't do that.

306
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,570
-What?
-I'm the one who saved you

307
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,864
when you were dying
after Lee Yeon cut you down.

308
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,201
You still owe me one.

309
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,787
Who are you?

310
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,123
Just a passerby.
Your life seemed to be in danger.

311
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,584
Cut your crap.

312
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,128
You reek of rotting corpses.

313
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,215
I'm just a man
who somehow lived quite a long life.

314
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,509
Why did you save me?

315
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,719
The reason isn't important.

316
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,181
Just repay my kindness.

317
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,100
There will come a day.

318
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,578
You must stick to the rules.

319
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,664
A fox cannot break away from a contract.

320
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,251
You brought back the serpent thanks to me.

321
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,585
I did that.

322
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,755
All you did was
put on a bit of a performance.

323
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,800
You wanted to use me from the start.

324
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,178
You knew Yeon is my brother.

325
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,932
What worth would a half-fox have
otherwise?

326
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,106
Take the bladder cherry.

327
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,941
You must live to repay my kindness.

328
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,278
What do you want from me?

329
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:01,197
Hand over Lee Yeon. You have two days.

330
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,534
We need his body.

331
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,263
I should go.

332
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,307
Sure, go on. Get lost.

333
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:33,146
He pretended like he was
the most tragic of all,

334
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,357
but it seems like
he wasn't all that unhappy.

335
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,279
If you're going to protect him,
keep him safe to the end.

336
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,116
Give it to him.

337
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,162
It's for the naengmyeon.

338
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,708
What was that?

339
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,890
So let me sum it up.

340
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,144
The guy you're seeing right now is
the suspect of the crime we've been after?

341
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,813
He's not the suspect. The culprit.

342
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,523
He's an ex-convict?

343
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,944
He was never indicted, but he committed
a few more crimes of the same kind.

344
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,403
But you're still seeing him?

345
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,072
-Yes.
-Why?

346
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:28,993
He waited for me to be reborn.
He's my first love from my past life.

347
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,496
Past life is the story
for our next episode.

348
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,914
Is it a figure of speech?

349
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,375
You like him so much
that you feel that way.

350
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,966
Do you think it's a coincidence
that the three of us met?

351
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,634
I think it's fate.

352
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,345
Screw fate. Forget it.

353
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,764
Why are you telling us this?

354
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,475
You two may be exposed to danger.

355
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:59,440
Because you two are the closest to me,

356
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,402
in our past lives and this one.

357
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,779
Why do you keep bringing up
that damned past life?

358
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,699
You two are too educated
for me to persuade you.

359
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,954
See for yourself.

360
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,207
What are these glasses?

361
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,333
It's the Tiger's Brows.

362
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,793
From the folk tale for kids?

363
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,254
That's right. Got a mirror?

364
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,922
Goodness.

365
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,758
Here.

366
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,573
Where are we going?

367
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,617
Somewhere very far from the palace.

368
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,785
Is it just you two?

369
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,787
We apologize, Your Highness.

370
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,081
We will keep you safe to the end.

371
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,019
-Prepare our meal on one table from now.
-Pardon?

372
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,230
We aren't in the palace anymore.
No one is watching us.

373
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,524
Forget the court's customs.
Let's eat together.

374
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,944
-We can't do that. How--
-If you don't do that,

375
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,987
I'm not going to eat.

376
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,199
Your Highness!

377
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:33,826
Are you going out?

378
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,703
I'm going to get some air.

379
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,414
Don't follow me.

380
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,291
But don't go near the northern forest.

381
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,753
-Why not?
-A thousand-year-old fox lives there.

382
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,421
A fox?

383
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,384
Your Highness,

384
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,512
have some fish.

385
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:53,471
Open up.

386
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,933
You got rice here.

387
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,942
Your Highness!

388
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,695
Ta-da.

389
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,118
You didn't have to.

390
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:16,869
Sit with us.

391
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,831
I'm fine.

392
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,624
-It's okay. Join us.
-Sit down.

393
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,918
-Just sit.
-Just sit. We'll make you look pretty.

394
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,841
It looks wonderful on you.

395
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,769
This was our past life?

396
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,106
Are we dreaming or what?

397
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,316
I was just bewitched by something.

398
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,530
These aren't VR goggles, are they?

399
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,449
I can't believe it.

400
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,451
If we really had a past life,

401
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,619
I thought I'd be the princess, not you.

402
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,913
It's better than a eunuch.

403
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,709
Hey, I remember that little boy
who called me a eunuch.

404
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,086
-Those are the same glasses.
-No way.

405
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,256
We're all possessed by something
after doing this show for too long.

406
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,927
Tell us.
You didn't show us just to shock us.

407
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,971
Why did you show this to us?

408
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,932
A guy who's after my life is

409
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,518
much closer than I expect.

410
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,647
He might be someone we already know.

411
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,568
Just as you two kept me safe
in my past life,

412
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,154
I want to keep you safe too.

413
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,744
Then what about your boyfriend? Who is he?

414
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,664
Want to come in?

415
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,753
Hi, you've never met
a Nine-tailed Fox, have you?

416
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,049
Why? You don't believe me?

417
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,931
They were more shocked than I expected.

418
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,226
I knew it wouldn't be easy.

419
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,353
I get how they can't take it in.

420
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,980
Tell me if it goes wrong,
I'll erase their memories.

421
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,275
Did you meet your brother?

422
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,238
No, it seems the serpent got ahead of me.

423
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,365
I see.

424
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:21,577
He used the Darkness to spy on us,
so I'm sure he already knew

425
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,039
that Rang will become a ticking bomb
the moment he gets shaken.

426
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,291
Man, I thought
we were about to get a lead.

427
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,460
Don't be disheartened.

428
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,712
I expected him to do that,

429
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,799
so I took preventative measures.

430
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,496
Where have you been?

431
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,914
I want to be alone.

432
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,832
Your body is…

433
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,130
Did you have a bladder cherry?

434
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,673
Please.

435
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,676
Just leave me alone.

436
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,928
That's for you.

437
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,598
Lee Yeon brought it.

438
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,762
This is unbelievable.

439
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,362
Yes, President.

440
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,198
What is it at this hour?

441
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,410
I would like to ask you
for a personal favor.

442
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,744
A personal favor? To me?

443
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,581
Just say the word.

444
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,668
All right. I'll come and see you tomorrow.

445
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,378
Yes, thank you.

446
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,183
Sleep tight.

447
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,573
Where's Ms. Nam? Is she not eating?

448
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,075
She must've been tired. She fell asleep.

449
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,493
Is she staying here now?

450
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,705
Yes, it'll be safer here as a base camp.

451
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,208
Did you see him?

452
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,628
Not the serpent. But I saw
a middle-aged man take Mr. Lee Rang.

453
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,256
He must be
the one with the forehead tattoo.

454
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,467
We know where he lives,
so that's good enough.

455
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,385
Make sure you be careful too.

456
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,345
Okay.

457
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,724
Here, have some.

458
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,985
Why do I always get the drumstick?

459
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,196
Because it's the drumstick.

460
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,786
Thank you for the food!

461
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,294
Thanks for your hard work
on this case and the Darkness case.

462
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,963
It's thanks to the Samdocheon elders.

463
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,677
That old lady never gives
any information or things for free.

464
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,305
What'd she take? What were her terms?

465
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,766
I signed a slavery contract.

466
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:58,187
-What?
-I'm going to sail a ship at Samdocheon.

467
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,147
I'll be driving the dead to hell.

468
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,149
People don't die early, so she needs help.

469
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,567
You have motion sickness.

470
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,986
I'm going to start working after I die.

471
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,905
Do you think dead foxes get seasick too?

472
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,073
They do.

473
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,790
This is no good.
Let's get you transferred.

474
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,291
I'll bribe the higher-ups.

475
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,002
I'm in your hands.

476
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,464
But I still have a while until I die.

477
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,011
Work things out with that necklace thief
before you die.

478
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,014
She has a perfectly good name, Yu-ri.

479
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,309
Did you meet her?

480
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,770
Yes, she was more good-hearted
than I expected.

481
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,830
You slept in.

482
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,838
Why are you so shocked?

483
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,174
You know me, right?

484
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,846
-Gosh, my stomach.
-My tummy hurts.

485
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,515
-Want some coffee?
-Make it quick.

486
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,445
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

487
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,161
I feel like I'm at a fancy cafe.

488
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,290
-Isn't it sweet?
-It tastes like it's brewed by an expert.

489
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,251
It'd be great
if life was as gentle as this coffee.

490
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,170
That's all I'd ask for.

491
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,756
Hey, about yesterday.

492
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,801
I've been looking everywhere for you.

493
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,845
Wrap it up and come to the office.

494
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:56,680
Come on!

495
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,017
This way. Come in.

496
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,685
Stop fussing over nothing--

497
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,562
Now, say hi to him.

498
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,481
He's our new intern.

499
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,858
Nice to meet you.

500
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,744
How did you get in here?

501
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,955
That's my trade secret.

502
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,957
I looked everywhere. Where is it?

503
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,167
I don't know.

504
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,920
I haven't said what,
and you already say you don't know.

505
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,672
That's what everyone says at first.

506
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,215
I really don't know.

507
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,470
Haven't you heard?

508
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:40,182
Everyone wants to spill their secrets
when they see me.

509
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:41,934
What are you saying?

510
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,310
Look.

511
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,566
It's perfect weather to torture someone.

512
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,822
My name is Terry.

513
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,533
Terry, short for Terrius.
Easy to remember, right?

514
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,909
You're 22, right?

515
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,328
He studied
at a prestigious university in the U.S.

516
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,997
Who's your connection?

517
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:06,166
-Sorry?
-Everyone who does an internship

518
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,876
at TV stations has a connection.

519
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,297
Mr. Choi sounds like your agent,
so it must be someone high up.

520
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,967
What are you talking about?

521
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,136
She's a bit feisty.

522
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,388
Careful.
She's scarier on an empty stomach.

523
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,682
He isn't my dad.
But my guardian is a big shot

524
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,184
-in the same business.
-He's in the media industry?

525
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,477
Yes.

526
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,022
I like that you're honest.

527
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:30,733
I'm Nam Ji-a.

528
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,162
See? That's much better, isn't it?

529
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,705
What a great first meeting.

530
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,416
Take good care of him, okay?

531
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,585
Okay, now.
Hand over the materials I asked for.

532
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:57,468
Have we met somewhere before?

533
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,553
I'm not sure.

534
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,984
Why can't I hear anything?

535
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,866
He's more like a boss than an intern.

536
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,368
Unbelievable.

537
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:25,496
I can't believe
anyone could have such perfect features.

538
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,748
If I get on the president's good side,

539
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,084
I'll become the youngest director ever.

540
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:46,558
He's finally begun to make a move.

541
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,689
The only way to prevent turmoil is--

542
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,779
Is sacrificing her the only way?

543
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,211
Honey.

544
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,715
Today is our wedding anniversary.

545
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,050
You forgot again? Do you even love me?

546
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,095
You surprised me. Darn it.

547
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,641
What time is it?

548
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,311
Why won't you answer the phone?

549
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,357
And where have you been
using my credit card?

550
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:39,778
I knew it. People never change.

551
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:44,158
Honey, what do you think
I brought back for you?

552
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,580
Before I answer that,
what do you think is behind me?

553
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,497
I don't know.

554
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,877
That hurts.

555
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,922
I told you not to go AWOL from your post.

556
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,216
I paid a lot for this.

557
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,303
Goodness. Look at your hair.

558
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,846
This isn't a nightclub!

559
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,655
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

560
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,828
I'm going to do everything I possibly can

561
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,249
to save my life and hers.

562
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,881
What can I do for you?

563
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,844
First, please open up Granny's heart.

564
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,849
That old woman's heart?

565
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,978
She must know a way

566
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,773
to get rid of the serpent.

567
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,610
She was awfully worried
as soon as it awoke.

568
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,237
If she knew, she would've done it.

569
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:08,700
It might be something
that involves breaking the taboo.

570
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,500
Do I have something on my head?

571
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,418
-No.
-No.

572
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,920
-Say what you want to say.
-Hey.

573
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,048
Are you really human?

574
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,217
How can you be so calm after seeing that?

575
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,052
What did you see?

576
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,973
-Nothing.
-Jae-hwan, are you getting fresh with me?

577
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,601
It really isn't a big deal.

578
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,604
If it isn't, then tell me. What is it?

579
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,480
Did you see this breaking news?

580
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,481
Breaking news?

581
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,068
A mummy was found at a construction site.

582
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,195
A mummy in Korea, not Egypt?

583
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,364
Terry, let me see that for a second.

584
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,450
Thanks.

585
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,121
Geumran-gu.

586
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,458
This sounds interesting.
It's a great story.

587
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,251
Hey, Jae-hwan. Get on it.

588
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,212
-I have an interview in an hour.
-Get me a camera.

589
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,923
-I'll go.
-Sure.

590
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,426
May I tag along?

591
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,140
Listen up, intern.

592
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,142
This isn't a field study.
It's a real case.

593
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:01,146
This may be a line on your resume,
but we do this for a living.

594
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,357
If you get in my way on the field--

595
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,775
Fire me.

596
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,819
I'll check the camera.

597
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,908
Where did you learn that?

598
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,954
I studied on my own,
but I'm not sure if I'll be any useful.

599
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,373
Can you shoot?

600
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,875
-Sure.
-Even a dead body?

601
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,795
-I have to get the body on camera?
-Yes.

602
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,464
To be honest, I'm not sure.

603
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,049
Why not?

604
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,427
The deceased wouldn't want that.

605
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:36,431
What do you mean?

606
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,558
No matter what it's for,

607
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:42,145
if my death was shown to the public
through a camera,

608
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,106
it'd make me a little sad.

609
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,696
-You're good enough to take up a camera.
-Sorry?

610
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:54,324
I believe those who get curious
when they're faced with someone's death

611
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,742
shouldn't take up a camera.

612
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,161
Does this mean I passed?

613
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:00,789
You passed.

614
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:05,210
-Why do you laugh?
-I have a good feeling.

615
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,753
About what?

616
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,255
You, Ms. Nam.

617
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,814
Are you looking for a cat?
A female Russian Blue?

618
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,066
Look behind the restrooms at Subyeon Park.

619
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,444
I heard it from the stray cats,
so I'm sure.

620
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,572
You can transfer the reward
of 200,000 won to my bank--

621
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:34,656
Hello?

622
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,533
Darn it.

623
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,494
Hey.

624
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,582
What brings you here, Yu-ri?

625
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:46,877
I wanted a drink,
but couldn't find an open bar.

626
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,046
A drink?

627
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,964
If you don't want to, it's fine.

628
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,217
What are you doing?

629
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,888
Anastasia waited for you.

630
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,097
Don't get so friendly.

631
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,438
-Why are you chuckling?
-He said he wants some,

632
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:07,606
the beef jerky you got.

633
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,406
You're one sharp dog.

634
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,241
I'll give you jerky for dogs.

635
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,331
Hey, Yeon, it's you.

636
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:36,426
Looks like that kid is in a foul mood.

637
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,025
WANTED: LEE RANG

638
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,450
Look who's here.

639
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,327
I have a question.

640
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,663
Let me ask you one first.

641
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,498
You.

642
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,626
What do you take me for?

643
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,381
What do you mean?

644
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,799
Answer my question.

645
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:20,470
The lord of the Samdocheon River,
the boundary between two worlds.

646
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,181
You use your clairvoyance
to discern good or evil--

647
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,809
Wrong.

648
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,021
When was it?

649
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:34,526
This is what Yeon said
when I asked him the same question.

650
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,863
"I hope you get rheumatism."

651
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,741
Show yourself.

652
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:44,828
Damn it.

653
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,419
Did you really think you could trick me?

654
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,212
I thought it might work.

655
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,424
You only took after
your brother's worst sides.

656
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,009
He never disguises himself.

657
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,886
He thinks it's undignified.

658
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:06,183
Disguise or not,
they're both faces of jerks.

659
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,059
But I wonder.

660
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,647
Why did this sinful fox

661
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,400
willingly show up at death's doorstep?

662
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,154
Should I send you to hell?

663
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:21,948
Let me off today.

664
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,409
I already booked for first-class, no?

665
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,827
Hey!

666
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:27,704
You punk.

667
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:31,041
Hell isn't a restaurant
you can come and go as you please.

668
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,918
I'm not scared of hell.

669
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,714
It wouldn't be scary
if you go hand-in-hand with your brother.

670
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,719
Why? Isn't that what you wanted
for those long years?

671
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,390
Murdering your own brother.

672
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,980
Indeed. You really do know everything.

673
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,610
Now that it's come to this,
I'll be frank with you.

674
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,363
I wish to break the contract.

675
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,531
Why did you save me?

676
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,909
Just return my kindness one day.

677
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,079
Hand over Lee Yeon. You have two days.

678
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,289
We need his body.

679
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,228
Long ago, the almighty gave you foxes

680
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:36,523
more power than any humans have,

681
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,067
but you were also put under a restriction.

682
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:43,738
It was to prevent arrogant foxes like you

683
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,991
from trampling and murdering mankind.

684
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,578
I don't care what you say to me

685
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,621
if there's a way.

686
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,165
It's not impossible.

687
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:58,670
What is it?

688
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,008
Die.

689
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:05,969
As long as you're alive,

690
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,972
foxes are bound to their contract.

691
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,152
Don't try to break off your contract.

692
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,279
Unwind the tangle first.

693
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,949
-What?
-Remember.

694
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,994
All contracts involve an exchange.

695
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,218
I'm scared that Mr. Lee might die.

696
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,722
I don't have friends or family.

697
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,015
I don't have anyone.

698
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:56,686
What do you mean?
You got Anastasia and me…

699
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:06,571
If it hadn't been for him, I would've died

700
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,864
in that illegal zoo.

701
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:11,701
I couldn't sleep by day
with kids banging on the window,

702
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:15,205
and I was too itchy to sleep at night
because of wild ticks.

703
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:18,625
I kept losing my hair,
had to eat awful food,

704
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,794
and the zookeeper kept beating me.

705
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,129
What? Where is this place?

706
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,049
I'll go crush that zookeeper into ashes.

707
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,468
How can he beat you up?

708
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,763
Are you drunk?

709
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,057
What?

710
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:35,975
Oh, sorry.

711
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,228
It's nothing to be sorry for.

712
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,897
I like that side of you better.

713
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,816
-Really?
-Yes.

714
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:46,444
People used to call me the Lunatic Fox.

715
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,445
I was called crazy.

716
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,072
Really? You?

717
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,034
I lost three of my baby sisters in traps,

718
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,661
then completely lost my nerves.

719
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,496
Elaborate.

720
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,915
I bewitched everyone including hunters,

721
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,959
woodsmen, salt merchants, and so on.

722
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,502
And several people died

723
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,921
because they got scared out of their mind.

724
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:07,674
You were a bigger asshole than me.

725
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:10,635
The deity of my mountain got furious,

726
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:13,972
so I ran from him
and found myself in Mr. Lee Yeon's forest.

727
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,432
And?

728
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:19,561
My deity screamed at him in anger,
demanding that he give me up,

729
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:21,312
then Mr. Lee said this.

730
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,481
What are you screaming for?

731
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,695
No. Everything that comes
into my forest is mine.

732
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,781
That's when I made my decision.

733
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,491
I belong to Mr. Lee Yeon now.

734
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,453
That's why I learned the art of medicine,

735
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,204
-and I--
-Come to bed with me.

736
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,373
-What?
-Come to bed with me.

737
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,043
I especially love your ragged history.

738
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:49,048
Wait, there are stages
in expressing your feelings.

739
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:52,427
For example, asking someone out first.

740
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:57,265
Or you know, something like,
"This is our first day as a couple."

741
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,059
Let's skip the intro.

742
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:03,062
SIN-JU'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

743
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,983
I've never seen
a stranger corpse than this one.

744
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:10,361
I had nightmares all night long,
and barely got any rest.

745
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,739
-Is this a real mummy?
-See for yourself.

746
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,743
Hey, don't get it on camera, okay?

747
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,454
You couldn't identify her
because of her dry fingerprints.

748
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,624
If you want any informers,
we need to know the details.

749
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,418
I never show anything
without the police's consent.

750
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,129
The mass disappearance of the island--

751
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,047
Okay, fine.

752
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:43,728
Did she lose all her blood?

753
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,231
She's like an old tree deprived of sap.

754
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,652
There's no visible injury.

755
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,362
At a construction site?

756
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,531
The workers there found her.

757
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,865
She was barely hidden.

758
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,160
They wanted to show her

759
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,162
instead of hiding her?

760
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,915
What if she died a natural death?

761
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:07,085
The construction was
shut down for a while,

762
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:09,587
so she could've died alone and dried up.

763
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:14,175
A natural mummy was found
in Gyeonggi Province back in 2002.

764
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,219
I remember.
Lady Yoon of the Papyeong clan.

765
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,471
Lady Yoon had been buried

766
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:21,349
in a tomb as thick as concrete.

767
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:23,184
The tomb cut off the airflow,

768
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,145
so her body wasn't decomposed
thanks to the vacuum.

769
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,399
But she was left at room temperature
at a construction site.

770
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,150
It's impossible.

771
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,237
Then are you saying
someone mummified her on purpose?

772
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,127
What are you looking at?

773
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,005
I think I've seen it before.

774
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,591
Her nail tips.

775
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,487
Detective Baek, I have to go.

776
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:17,822
All of a sudden?

777
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,991
Please pass on anything else to this guy.

778
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,659
Hey, Ji-a!

779
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,694
Do you know the woman who had these nails?

780
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:01,824
Did you see her too?

781
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,829
That corpse only left with flabby skin.

782
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,749
Wasn't it marvelous?

783
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:12,752
Sir,

784
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,587
what are you?

785
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,886
What do I look like to you?

786
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:28,393
SEOGYEONG

787
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,649
The rebel of Seogyeong.

788
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:37,068
There was a trace of a mukhyeong
on his forehead.

789
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,737
Seo as in west, gyeong as in capital.

790
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:46,077
You took my mom and dad!

791
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:34,500
It's the carnation I made.

792
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,627
Flip it over.

793
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:48,848
Ji-a, why won't you come and save us?

794
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,019
They're alive?

795
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:55,605
Where are they?

796
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,567
Give me the deity.

797
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,861
Then I'll return your parents.

798
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:54,372
You. I told you to wait for me, didn't I?

799
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:07,510
JI-A, WHY WON'T YOU COME AND SAVE US?

800
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:16,894
You're still the same.

801
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,437
Still very arrogant.

802
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,439
Do you think you're above everyone else?

803
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,150
At the very least, you're under me.

804
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:24,986
I'd love to trample you.

805
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:27,446
Your brother, your woman,

806
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,075
and her parents' lives are
all in my hands.

807
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:33,911
What do you have?

808
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,747
Let me make a fair offer.

809
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:41,002
Lee Yeon, if you give me your body,
I'll spare everyone.

810
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,708
Your woman and her parents' lives are

811
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:22,460
all in my hands.

812
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:26,172
Is there a way to get rid of that thing
in Ji-a's body?

813
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:28,049
I'm a little scared.

814
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,384
I want to kill him.

815
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,219
What do I mean to you?

816
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:34,555
You've been abandoned again.

817
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,640
I want to live.

818
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:38,559
Since we're on the topic,
will you die for me?

819
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,939
I'm going to put an end
to this tiresome fight.

820
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:50,321
