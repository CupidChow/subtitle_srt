1
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,923
Do you feel better now?

2
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,385
Look at me.

3
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,981
Long time no see, Lee Yeon.

4
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,566
Long time no see, Yeon.

5
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,153
This woman is mine.

6
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,571
This woman is mine.

7
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,248
How does it feel

8
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,543
to live through 600 long years

9
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,464
only to stand as an enemy
before the woman you love?

10
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,590
What about Ji-a?

11
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,802
Where is she?

12
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,805
Right here. She's in here with me.

13
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,724
She's screaming

14
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:43,394
and dreading her hopeless fate.

15
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,188
Let me ask you a question.

16
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,315
Who was that guy?

17
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,236
And who are you?

18
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,654
It's all your fault.

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,658
If she was sacrificed
at the well on the island,

20
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:01,037
we wouldn't have split up
and remained as one in the first place.

21
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,998
We'll be reunited in time anyway.

22
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,627
And when is

23
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,420
that time?

24
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,884
It'll be the day we take your body.

25
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,805
Why are you both so obsessed with my body?

26
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,142
You two can stick together
and live a good life.

27
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,687
Didn't you see how fast it grew?

28
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,649
Does it

29
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,821
age as quickly as it grew?

30
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,492
So that's your curse.

31
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,038
I once had a chance to change my fate.

32
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,624
If you could've become a dragon,

33
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,962
I would've been the mountain deity
of Baekdu Mountain, not you.

34
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,007
This was about revenge.

35
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,095
That's why you were obsessed with my body

36
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,805
among all those immortals.

37
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,310
For your information,
since I'm already out here,

38
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,603
she'll be gone very soon.

39
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,188
I'll kill you.

40
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,398
If you kill me, your girl dies.

41
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,277
If you save your girl,
you'll die, Lee Yeon.

42
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,074
Will you save her?
Or will you save yourself?

43
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,207
Unfortunately,

44
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,377
none of the choices reflect what we want.

45
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,930
No matter what you say,

46
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,641
you can't lay a finger on this body.

47
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,027
You're weak.

48
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,570
What?

49
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,407
Does this body make you weaker?

50
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,954
Most of your strength and power are
with the other serpent.

51
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,747
You're like that thing's heart.

52
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,208
That's why you need Ji-a as a shield,

53
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,669
so I won't find out how weak you are.

54
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,885
You two can't change your fate.

55
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,183
I just need you to disappear. Just you.

56
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,857
You're all I need, Ji-a.

57
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,986
Please.

58
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,613
Just give me your darned body and die.

59
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,544
Ji-a.

60
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,131
Can you hear me?

61
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,384
I know you're there.

62
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,261
Shut up.

63
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,013
Come back.

64
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,018
I will always be waiting for you.

65
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,397
Come back, Ji-a.

66
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,526
I'll always be waiting for you.

67
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,238
I also have been waiting for you.

68
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,451
If anything, I'm an expert at waiting.

69
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,412
I can sit here not only 24 hours,
but 24 years.

70
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,333
I thought I'd run into you
if I waited here.

71
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,711
I'll stay by your side.

72
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,010
I'm yours until the day I die.

73
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,109
Yeon.

74
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,342
Yes, it's me. I'm right here.

75
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,309
Help me, Yeon.

76
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,479
Just kill me…

77
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,441
so that I won't hurt you.

78
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,331
It's okay. It's alright.

79
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,668
Everything will be okay.

80
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,183
Mr. Gu.

81
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,561
Thank you for today. You saved my life.

82
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,105
Don't thank me. You should thank Mr. Lee.

83
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,898
And you two, be careful.

84
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,152
Mr. Lee!

85
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:28,906
I'll be right there.

86
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,372
I don't care for Lee Yeon or the serpent.

87
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,207
All I need is my bladder cherries.

88
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,334
My bladder cherries!

89
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,253
Hey.

90
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,634
You shouldn't drive so recklessly!

91
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,761
Who are you?

92
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,805
I'm Hyeonuiong.

93
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,682
I got a call and came for the cherries.

94
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,017
Who sent you?

95
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,560
Was it the serpent? Or Lee Yeon?

96
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,479
Why is that so important?

97
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,022
It doesn't belong to you anyway.

98
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,398
Don't be ridiculous!

99
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,860
The cherries are mine. Mine!

100
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:08,988
Gosh, it hurts.

101
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,074
I hate the smell of gunpowder.

102
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:13,910
Hey.

103
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,413
You aren't allowed
to defy your lifespan as you like.

104
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,415
What? You're a monster too?

105
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,293
My goodness.

106
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,214
It looks like
we'll see each other again very soon.

107
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,725
Mr. Lee!

108
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,067
SIN-JU'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

109
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,224
Is she back to Ms. Nam right now?

110
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,728
We don't know
when she'll change and attack you.

111
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,231
I let her attack me on purpose.

112
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,026
What?

113
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,655
I wanted to check.

114
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,244
The serpent has split up into two
for his advantage,

115
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,416
but it could also serve
as a fatal weakness.

116
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,418
What do you mean?

117
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,295
The serpent in Ji-a's body

118
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,839
is unlike the one we've seen.

119
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,674
The same serpent is different?

120
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,511
This one is much closer
to the serpent I've met in her past life.

121
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,098
What should I do?

122
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,019
Head over to the Snail Bride
and find the fortune-teller.

123
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,646
The old fart who ran away
with your Fox Marble?

124
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,239
Should we turn these back into humans?

125
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,369
Check the book, and let them return
only if they have time left.

126
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,788
It's a hassle if they jump out at once.

127
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:24,999
Let's eat first.

128
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:28,085
Honey, do you want tteokbokki?
With fried seaweed rolls and sundae?

129
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:30,880
Extra cheese.

130
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,508
Okay, extra mozzarella cheese!

131
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,885
Level three spiciness for you

132
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,970
and level one for me.

133
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,943
THE BOOK OF THE DEAD:
A RECORD OF EACH PERSON'S LIFESPAN

134
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,489
Great turmoil will break out
if I don't stop this now.

135
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,951
NAME: NAM JI-A
BIRTH: MARCH 3RD, 1991

136
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,537
But

137
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,666
I still choose to be with her.

138
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,882
NAME: NAM JI-A
BIRTH: MARCH 3RD, 1991

139
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,510
DEATH: 2020

140
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,356
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,609
Why are you apologizing?

142
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,364
Those were my hands.

143
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:44,662
I was the one
who stabbed you and hurt you.

144
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,379
I know better than
anyone else that it wasn't you.

145
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,843
Will you look at me? Please?

146
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,769
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

147
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,231
Why are you still worried about me

148
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,692
in this condition?

149
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,193
Do you want some coffee?

150
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,656
Or chicken feet?

151
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,576
No.

152
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,164
Do you want to go home?

153
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,499
I don't think I can.

154
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,836
What if I change again

155
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,714
and hurt my mom and dad?

156
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,425
I might really go crazy.

157
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,813
Then should we go somewhere else?

158
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,992
Okay, let's go.

159
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,538
Let's go someplace
where we can be completely alone.

160
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,462
Don't worry too much about your parents.

161
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,464
I asked Sin-ju to keep an eye out.

162
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,592
Thank you.

163
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,557
Where are we going?

164
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,559
Anywhere.

165
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,663
Do you remember the first time we met?

166
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,415
When you were a kid?

167
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,584
No.

168
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,212
Of course, I remember.

169
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,007
My life's work has been
hunting someone down.

170
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,344
You were the first one
to chase me so aggressively

171
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,262
just to catch me.

172
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,392
I should've aggressively confessed to you.

173
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:17,898
Then we could've spent a little more time

174
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,651
being cluelessly happy.

175
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,829
Damn it.

176
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,372
Damn it!

177
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,260
Are you headed somewhere?

178
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,562
Forgive me.

179
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,314
I must've been insane.

180
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,858
I was blinded by the bladder cherries.
You idiot!

181
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:02,943
Lift up your head.

182
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,994
From your birth as a slave
in a shabby house filled with bedbugs,

183
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,370
you've come a long way.

184
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,041
It's all thanks to you.

185
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,711
I was the one who saved you
before you were executed as a rebel.

186
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,464
How could I forget your kindness?

187
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,757
Then

188
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,177
why did you take Lee Yeon's hand?

189
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,812
I heard you told him a lot of things.

190
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,315
Please show me mercy.

191
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,901
-If you give me another chance--
-There's no need.

192
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,862
I don't need anything.

193
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,822
or anyone anymore.

194
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,620
-The plan has changed.
-Pardon?

195
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,628
I want life to turn into hell…

196
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,216
for everyone alive and breathing.

197
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,307
Turn yourself in.

198
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,812
Being a sinner suits you.

199
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,532
Let's play a game.

200
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,118
What game?

201
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,580
Just as you said,
we'll pretend like we don't know anything.

202
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,793
Give me an example.

203
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:47,589
You're an ordinary woman who complains
of your boring and serene everyday life.

204
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,716
And I am

205
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,468
not a Nine-tailed Fox.

206
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,596
Do we know each other?

207
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,475
We are…

208
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,312
a married couple. We're married.

209
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,189
An ordinary couple.

210
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,734
You'll go to work as usual,

211
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,236
and I'll be waiting
with dinner on the table, okay?

212
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,487
So I'm the breadwinner?

213
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,032
I have a lot of real estate and cash.

214
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,410
I'll just stay at home
and take rent from my tenants.

215
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,831
Stop laughing and do it seriously.

216
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,791
Then what should I do?

217
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,170
Wait, hold on.

218
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,755
Wait here.

219
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,431
Okay. You can come home now.

220
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:38,974
You're off work.

221
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,895
This seems a bit silly.

222
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,280
I'm home!

223
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,325
Honey?

224
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,911
"Honey, I'm home?"

225
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,581
Gosh, is my puppy upset?

226
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,708
Why are you so upset?

227
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:07,461
Look at the time.

228
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,214
You always say,

229
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,092
"A woman can be late
if she's working out in the real world."

230
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,094
You said you'd be home by midnight.

231
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,220
You made me a promise.

232
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,180
-So I have a curfew?
-Yes.

233
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,350
You broke your curfew twice last month.

234
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,144
-Does my promise mean nothing to you?
-Yes, I did that.

235
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,437
Forgive me this once.

236
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,235
This isn't right, honey. Take a seat.

237
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,613
Sit down. Let's talk.

238
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:37,491
Honey, you were just treated
for your alcohol abuse!

239
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,660
Me?

240
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,162
I see.

241
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,249
So you're messing with the characters?

242
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,167
You've changed recently.

243
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,419
Do you even love me?

244
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,714
I love you.

245
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,763
Me too.

246
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,392
Let's make up, okay?

247
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,561
Of course.

248
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,355
Our fights never last
longer than five minutes.

249
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,322
It's unfair.

250
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,077
Why can't we have a normal life like this?

251
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,000
This is so unfair.

252
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,970
If you were a human,

253
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,973
we were really married,

254
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,519
and there was no such thing as a serpent--

255
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,606
If we lived in a world like that,

256
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,319
if I had met you there,

257
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,740
it must've been so nice.

258
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,648
I'll keep you safe.

259
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,943
No matter what happens,

260
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,948
you must live on when this fight ends.

261
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,742
That is

262
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,370
all I want.

263
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,758
I've been reborn many times,

264
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,803
but the world is still full of darkness.

265
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,100
Lee Yeon, I'll show you

266
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,979
the end of the world I live in.

267
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:22,049
TERRY

268
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,185
Hello?

269
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,561
The party is about to begin.

270
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,314
I won't be so nice to you from now on.

271
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,649
Look forward to it.

272
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,447
I pity you.

273
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,118
You've never learned
how to love someone or be loved.

274
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,038
All you can do is threaten me.

275
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,706
As you say, this is a threat.

276
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,125
Your body is now a ticking bomb.

277
00:22:58,835 --> 00:22:59,795
Look at yourself.

278
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,265
It will take full control of your body
very soon.

279
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:20,482
When that time comes,
you'll kill Lee Yeon with your own hands.

280
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,601
Are you crazy?

281
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,858
Why did you peek at my computer?

282
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,067
What's your plan?

283
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,486
Why are you tampering with her life?

284
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,241
She's the real thing.

285
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,076
The real serpent.

286
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,203
What are you saying?

287
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,665
What's in her body is
the essence of the real serpent.

288
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,751
I have to kill it
to catch the other one running amok.

289
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,881
Will you sacrifice an innocent girl
to catch the serpent?

290
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,008
You know what she means to Yeon.

291
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,427
I know that better than anyone.

292
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,386
Then how can you?

293
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,221
That's exactly why I'm going to do it.

294
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,308
Yeon will never let that girl die,

295
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,435
and the serpent knows it.

296
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,897
What do you think will happen
if it also gets Yeon's body?

297
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,900
So you'll kill someone
over something that hasn't happened?

298
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,944
What are you trying to protect
by taking things that far?

299
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,864
This is my job!

300
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,491
That's exactly why

301
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,453
our son lost his wife and we lost our son.

302
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,582
You fixed her record in the book,
like you did just now.

303
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,958
Thanks to you,

304
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,253
I haven't found our son's soul yet

305
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,507
after he took his own life.

306
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,133
And I prevented the plague.

307
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,469
Our Bok-gil can't be reborn!

308
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,519
That is…

309
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,813
that boy's fate.

310
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:24,731
I thought

311
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,650
you had changed a little

312
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,694
after our son died like that.

313
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,740
But you haven't changed at all.

314
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,494
A bigger disaster is on the horizon

315
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,496
unless I stop this now.

316
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,165
Fine. You stop that disaster.

317
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,793
I'll stop you.

318
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,880
What are you trying to do?

319
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,841
The moment you change
the date of her death,

320
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,762
we're over.

321
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,886
I'm writing this as I watch you sleep.

322
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:41,099
I decided to go back to Seoul.

323
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:47,147
After spending a night here,
I've come to this conclusion.

324
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:54,571
No matter how far I run,
there's no way to escape from this.

325
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,581
I'm down at the beach.

326
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,460
Let's take a walk.

327
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,547
Let's walk to the end of this beach,
then go back.

328
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,137
I am just a nobody,

329
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,849
so it feels like
the heavy weight of my fate

330
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,978
continues to drag me down
to the bottom of the ocean.

331
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:33,485
But Yeon, you push me up like a buoy.

332
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,904
You help me stay afloat.

333
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,740
You won't let me sink.

334
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,505
I promised

335
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,884
to give her

336
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,555
a boring and serene life
the ordinary people live

337
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,557
as a gift.

338
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:11,022
On that beach, she said

339
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,858
she doesn't want to be alone.

340
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:19,406
She wanted to live together
or die together.

341
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,617
But perhaps

342
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:29,165
that may be the one promise I can't keep.

343
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,216
Bring Mr. Lee back to life.

344
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,844
I've tried everything,
but I couldn't do it.

345
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,637
Why should I?

346
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,725
Why should I do you a favor?

347
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,561
I stabbed him and got framed
because of you.

348
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,062
You better take responsibility.

349
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,232
What do you think of me?

350
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,234
A bladder cherry farmer.

351
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,361
I'm not afraid of you.

352
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,823
You mean that.

353
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,408
But if you wanted to make a deal,

354
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,243
shouldn't I get something out of this?

355
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,787
You don't seem to have
any cards up your sleeve.

356
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,206
And this half-fox is

357
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,584
completely useless to me now.

358
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,384
Take my life and save Mr. Lee Rang.

359
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,677
Are you sure?

360
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,847
One second.

361
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,060
Mr. Lee.

362
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,148
I may be going now,
but please live a long life.

363
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,277
Don't skip meals, put on some weight,

364
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,280
and stop chasing after your brother.

365
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:46,993
And please--

366
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,871
please be a little happier.

367
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,297
Kill me.

368
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,558
Stop taking your time.
That's way more annoying.

369
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,312
Open your eyes.

370
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,899
I'll do this for you.

371
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,776
Instead,

372
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,612
you're coming with me.

373
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,454
When the serpent in her calls,

374
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,082
you will become my soldier.

375
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,427
If you stay in there for too long,

376
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,805
you'll get devoured by darkness.

377
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,414
How may I help you?

378
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,124
I'll turn myself in.

379
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:17,625
Sorry?

380
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,544
I came to turn myself in.

381
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,505
I killed her.

382
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,090
Who did you kill?

383
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,593
The mummy from the construction site
in Geumran-gu.

384
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,929
Are you serious?

385
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,431
There are four more.

386
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,975
Check my car's navigation history.

387
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,020
You'll be able to find
where I buried the rest of them.

388
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,272
Go check it out.

389
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,356
Yes, sir.

390
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,609
Why did you kill them?

391
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:45,153
You're the president of a TV station.
So why?

392
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,531
I just wanted to live a long life.

393
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,119
If you were in my shoes,

394
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,914
I'm sure you'd have done the same.

395
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,298
Should I come in?

396
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,008
No.

397
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,346
I want to get a good look
at my mom and dad.

398
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,808
If anything happens to me--

399
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,310
That won't happen.

400
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,650
But if that's how you feel, then go ahead.

401
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,695
Don't worry.

402
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,574
That thing only comes out
when it feels threatened,

403
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,994
like when it sees blood.

404
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,134
Now that you mention it…

405
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,350
Long time no see, Yeon.

406
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,939
The scales are spreading.

407
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,609
I might not have much time

408
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,028
to stay as myself.

409
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,135
I need to go see the Snail Bride.

410
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,721
Meet me at my place with my part-timers.

411
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,056
Ms. Kim and Jae-hwan?

412
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,734
Where's Yu-ri? Where is she?

413
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,444
She's gone.

414
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,112
She went with the scary man.

415
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,032
She won't come back anymore.

416
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,792
Did you find the fortune-teller?

417
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,253
I've been asking around
through my customers.

418
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,257
He didn't seem like a lowly local deity.

419
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,134
Who is that old geezer?

420
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:17,472
This may be a groundless rumor,

421
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,434
but they say
one of the ten kings of the afterlife

422
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:25,188
sometimes disappears
without saying a word.

423
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,861
Interesting.

424
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:36,532
Anyway, let me know
as soon as you get an update on him.

425
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,535
Here.

426
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,704
-What are these?
-What's all this?

427
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,498
I never got a chance

428
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,958
to treat you with my first paycheck.

429
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,127
It always bothered me.

430
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,464
You must be busy.

431
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,966
When did you find time to get us these?

432
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,302
It's wonderful, isn't it?

433
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,804
Doesn't it look great?

434
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,680
Try it on.

435
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:03,559
I can't put this on.
It's way too precious.

436
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,897
She bought it with her hard-earned money.

437
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,524
We'd better put it to good use.

438
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,400
Try it on.

439
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,236
Should I?

440
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,427
This isn't the right way to my house.

441
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,221
Give me five minutes.

442
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,851
Is it good? Is it?

443
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:47,979
Yu-ri!

444
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,190
What brings you here at this hour?

445
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,911
-What's going on?
-I'm here to say goodbye.

446
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,206
We're breaking up.

447
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,460
-What do you mean?
-Gu Sin-ju.

448
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,087
I just dumped you.

449
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,131
So now,

450
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,259
don't wait for me, and don't look for me.

451
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,386
What's wrong? Did I do something?

452
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,721
I just don't like you.

453
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,098
I'm the type who gets bored easily.

454
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,349
No.

455
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,393
You aren't that type.

456
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,896
It takes you a while to open up,

457
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,148
but once you do,
you love something for long.

458
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,442
You act mean but are gentle and kind.

459
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,444
-What do you know?
-I can tell by the way

460
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,779
you treat Mr. Lee Rang and our dog.

461
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,906
Stop acting so nice.

462
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,992
I hate how you lecture me saying

463
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,702
I need friends and family,

464
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,454
your tacky style,

465
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,664
and that smile you always put on.

466
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,749
I hate it all.

467
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,339
I won't lecture you.

468
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,342
I'll only buy the clothes you pick out.

469
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,010
I'll stop smiling if you don't--

470
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:02,428
Will you please stop?

471
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,932
I don't like you. I hate you!

472
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,935
You're lying.

473
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,776
Stop getting so clingy.

474
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,658
I'm leaving.

475
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,246
I won't break up with you.

476
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,163
Let me go.

477
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,749
No, I won't

478
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,044
until you take back what you said
about breaking up.

479
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,340
Sin-ju.

480
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,220
Doing this will
only make me hate you more.

481
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,016
I'm sorry.

482
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:54,021
I'm sorry for everything, so--

483
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,618
Don't follow me.

484
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,504
Please get out of my life.

485
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,402
She said I pretend to be nice.

486
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,362
She doesn't like my face

487
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,448
and how I have a tacky style.

488
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,868
Now that you mention it,
she's not completely wrong.

489
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,295
That bladder cherry thief is
a total scumbag!

490
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,714
Why is she playing with a fox's heart?

491
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,215
Stop insulting her.

492
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,051
Sir.

493
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,263
Stop crying.

494
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,724
She's my first and last love.

495
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,727
I was going to propose.

496
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,147
I went to Jongno yesterday
to get gold rings.

497
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,441
What am I going to do?

498
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,987
There must be a reason
she suddenly wanted to leave.

499
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,906
That's what I don't know.

500
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,741
It was the serpent.

501
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,284
He took her.

502
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,827
Mr. Lee Rang.

503
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,912
Rang.

504
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,708
What are you doing?

505
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,461
You're up. You're back.

506
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,046
Stop acting so weird.

507
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,923
You might make me want to die again.

508
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,841
How did you get up?

509
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,426
What do you mean,

510
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,761
the serpent took her?

511
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,847
Yu-ri went with him
in exchange for my life.

512
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,474
Su-o saw them.

513
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,435
No, I have to get her back.

514
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,354
You can't like this.

515
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,022
What if he kills her?

516
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,273
Let me go!

517
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,613
You fool.
Do you want to die with her or what?

518
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,449
You wouldn't hit him, so I did.

519
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,789
I promise.

520
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,792
I promise to bring her back alive.

521
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,794
I'll kill that serpent.

522
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:25,798
Let me have him.
He tried to kill me twice.

523
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,553
Wait, where's Su-o?

524
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,138
Isn't he home alone?

525
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:33,973
Of course, he is.

526
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,310
How could you leave a kid home alone?

527
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,479
He won't come even if you dragged him out.

528
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,155
Vroom!

529
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,752
Everyone's here,

530
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,255
including someone
I'm not too thrilled to see.

531
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,174
Who are they?

532
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,593
My part-timers.

533
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:20,978
What?

534
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:24,315
You're as good looking as him,
which can only mean one thing.

535
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,025
You're not human.

536
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,402
Stop talking to me. I'll bite you.

537
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,237
Gosh, I knew it.

538
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,573
Three people and two foxes.

539
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,033
Which one are you?

540
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,243
It's three people

541
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,078
and three foxes.

542
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:42,249
I think we've introduced ourselves.
Shall we begin?

543
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,043
You said it's a strategy meeting.

544
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,085
So why are you here?

545
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,338
I've dealt with the serpent
more often than you.

546
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,714
And you got one in you.

547
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:51,967
Leave her out.

548
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,136
What if he's eavesdropping?

549
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,680
No, Ji-a is the key person
for this operation.

550
00:41:58,057 --> 00:41:59,391
If you don't like it, leave.

551
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,772
All of us here have encountered
the serpent at least once.

552
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,942
And he tried to kill us
in one way or the other.

553
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,902
He also has a hostage.

554
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,574
And he's not just one, he's two.

555
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,202
We have to catch both to end this fight.

556
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,371
On top of that--

557
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,125
On top of that--

558
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,338
this is the main guy.

559
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,555
Hey, serpent's nest.

560
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,142
Why don't you just pass away
instead of causing a nuisance?

561
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,938
Why didn't you stay in bed?

562
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,107
You looked like a perfect Sleeping Beauty.

563
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,904
We can't kill him with physical attacks,
such as stabbing or slicing.

564
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,781
He can also control your mind.

565
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,909
Only Ji-a and I are uncontrollable.

566
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,412
It'll be very hard,

567
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:04,123
but try not to run into him one-on-one.

568
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:07,001
How can we fight him
if we have to avoid him?

569
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,420
There's nothing you can do anyway.

570
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,922
The only thing you'd say is, "Help me."

571
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,882
-I'm warning you.
-"I'm warning you."

572
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:17,344
So what in the world
is Terry trying to do?

573
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,889
He said he'll kill everyone.

574
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,392
And then--

575
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,686
After that, an epidemic will break out

576
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,940
so that no one will dare to be happy.

577
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:30,941
An epidemic?

578
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,283
Mr. Lee Rang, stop playing games!

579
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,453
I'm listening.
Cut it short and get to the point.

580
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,876
Until now,
I only fought the serpent we know

581
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,253
because I was worried Ji-a might get hurt.

582
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:52,838
But from now on,

583
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,008
I'm changing the target.

584
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,969
How are you going to kill
what's inside her body?

585
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,180
Did you find a way?

586
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,141
I did.

587
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,026
TRADITIONAL KOREAN CUISINE:
SNAIL BRIDE

588
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,243
Do you recall
the fortune-teller at the folk village?

589
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,162
Of course, I remember.

590
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,748
I lost the Fox Marble to him.

591
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,668
Rumors say that he's a big shot.
Is that true?

592
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,503
He's one of the ten kings
of the afterlife.

593
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,588
What?

594
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,091
He also has the Uiryeong Sword.

595
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,052
No way.

596
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,513
What's the Uiryeong Sword?

597
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,847
A sword that slays sin.

598
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,058
It can slay sin?

599
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,851
The King of the Underworld

600
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,438
made it with a Uiryeongsu Tree branch,
which can measure the weight of sin.

601
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,649
But didn't it disappear
thousands of years ago?

602
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,027
The Snail Bride just picked it up.

603
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:01,240
But if you cut her with a knife,
she'll get hurt too.

604
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:04,493
She won't. It's a wooden sword.

605
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,663
It only slays things that can't be slain.

606
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,749
In other words,
it'll only slay the serpent's spirit.

607
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,584
Thank goodness, Ji-a.

608
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,133
When are we doing this?

609
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,805
Tomorrow.

610
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,122
How is it to be reborn?

611
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,917
Is it because I was on the verge of death?

612
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,294
The coffee is extra good.

613
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,629
Live long, you fool.

614
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,632
If you die early,
you won't get to drink coffee again.

615
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,550
Isn't it tragic?

616
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,635
Were you scared that I'll die?

617
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,305
Yes, I was scared.

618
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,101
What did you get? Give me a sip.

619
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,187
It's good.

620
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,442
Why are you so nice to me?

621
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,278
No reason.
It's our first time together at a cafe.

622
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,823
All I had to do was reach out.

623
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,326
Why didn't I sooner?

624
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,329
What is that?
You sound like you'll die soon.

625
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,171
Hey, it's really good.

626
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:42,049
Doesn't it taste like the rainbow?
Give me a sip of yours too.

627
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,759
No, not mine.

628
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,844
You ungrateful jerk.

629
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:46,762
Don't drink it!

630
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,359
What happened?

631
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,236
It's not a big deal.

632
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,654
Did she do this?

633
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,197
It's not like that.

634
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,740
You're covering for her, so yes.

635
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,039
The Uiryeong Sword or whatever,

636
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,208
Will it really work on him?

637
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,418
It has been 600 years.

638
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,381
I'm going to put an end
to this tiresome fight once and for all.

639
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,091
What if you fail?

640
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:29,972
What will happen to me?

641
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:33,725
Rang.

642
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,896
That's why I need you.

643
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,656
I struggled my entire life.

644
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,368
I had just one step left
to stand at the top of this country.

645
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,286
Damn it.

646
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,080
Now I'm left in this tiny cell.

647
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,835
But I'm still alive.

648
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,213
I'm alive.

649
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,582
DU-KKI TTEOKBOKKI

650
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,167
Isn't this really good?

651
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,960
How can you want tteokbokki now?

652
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:45,297
I'll eat tteokbokki even if
the world ends tomorrow.

653
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,174
I told you to put more of that in.

654
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,759
-Do you want cheese balls?
-Lots.

655
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,385
A serving of cheese balls, please.

656
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:51,303
Sure.

657
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:57,559
It's hot.

658
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,436
Hey, this is really good.

659
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,981
-This is the best.
-This one?

660
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,567
It tastes so good
even at a time like this.

661
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,244
Don't come and see me for the time being.

662
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,705
I might put you in danger.

663
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:20,499
I'll do what I want.

664
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,834
You two almost died.

665
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,006
Do you remember

666
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,551
when my mom came to Seoul
for her discectomy operation?

667
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,888
She couldn't go because of work,
and she cried a river.

668
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,432
You went to see her in my place, right?

669
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,892
You stayed by my mom.

670
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,436
If I had left her alone,

671
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,648
I would've been more heartbroken
after she passed away.

672
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,651
-Let us help.
-She's right.

673
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,779
We're just ordinary people,
so we can't do much,

674
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:54,741
but I'd like to help out
any way we can in saving you.

675
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,789
For now,

676
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:04,292
going back to the office is
the biggest way you can help.

677
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,046
If all three of us are gone,
what will Mr. Choi say?

678
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,214
He's not there.

679
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:11,466
What?

680
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,677
He turned himself in?

681
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,931
There's no way
the serpent would let him live.

682
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,812
Find out what's going on
at the police station.

683
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:24,980
Okay.

684
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,734
The number you have dialed is not…

685
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,945
Mr. Choi isn't answering.

686
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,458
-Call 911 now!
-Yes, sir.

687
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,461
Is this 911?
This is Geumran Police Station.

688
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,672
Wait, let me help out. Let me.

689
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,008
-Please secure his airway.
-I'm on it.

690
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,360
Snail Bride.

691
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,237
We need to move up the plan.

692
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,208
TRADITIONAL KOREAN CUISINE:
SNAIL BRIDE

693
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,924
He has begun to make his move.
We don't have much time.

694
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:17,926
Today,

695
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,096
we'll slay the serpent in Ji-a first.

696
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,852
From now on,
we are not to make any mistakes.

697
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,562
We all get it, so go on.

698
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,439
The plan is simple.

699
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,818
First, Ji-a will bleed
to summon the serpent.

700
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,530
When it's out,
I'll slay it with the Uiryeong Sword.

701
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,741
Sin-ju, once Ji-a and I
enter the inner room,

702
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,243
lock the door from outside.

703
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:47,414
No one will come closer
until I give you a sign.

704
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,042
Why not?

705
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,628
If he gets away from Ji-a,

706
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,631
you'll be in danger.

707
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,051
It might try to get in your body.

708
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,137
That's why I put out the horse blood.

709
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,348
This one isn't like the serpent
we've seen so far.

710
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,977
We don't know what it looks like,
where it'll go,

711
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,104
or how it moves.

712
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,440
Make no mistakes, not even one.

713
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,942
What if it sticks to you?

714
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,988
That won't happen while I'm conscious.

715
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,824
Shin-ju.

716
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:25,911
It's a snake.

717
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,830
I've prepared
something that suits that thing.

718
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:34,586
So it'll be best
if you could slay him at once.

719
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,171
Even if he runs away,

720
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,507
this snake will be all that's left of it?

721
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:45,347
Let's go. I want to get rid of this
as soon as possible.

722
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,729
This is the sword.

723
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,611
Thank you. You may leave.

724
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:45,031
Please be careful.

725
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,076
Now,

726
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,330
let's get started.

727
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,789
Before we do that,

728
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,543
tie me to the chair with this.

729
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,380
What if I hurt you again?

730
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,007
That's not necessary.

731
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,467
Please do as I say.

732
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,052
Okay?

733
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,934
Why do you keep trying to protect me?

734
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,619
I have a bad feeling about this.

735
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,246
Don't say that. It's bad luck.

736
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,560
Then I'll tie you up.

737
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,021
Okay.

738
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:41,564
Yeon.

739
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,193
Will you give me a hug?

740
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,580
Please don't hesitate because of me.

741
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:02,127
Don't be nervous.
It's just a blunt wooden sword.

742
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,171
I'm prepared for any injury.

743
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,298
Why would I hurt you?

744
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:10,385
And this sword can
only slay things that can't be slain,

745
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:11,970
such as the spirit of a serpent.

746
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,181
Does that mean

747
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,977
it can slay your soul too?

748
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:22,981
Of course, it can.

749
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,533
I've been--

750
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,535
Yes?

751
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,455
wondering for a while.

752
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,125
Who are you?

753
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:47,755
What's going to vanish is your spirit.

754
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,101
-No!
-Move.

755
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,562
If anything happens to him,
I'll kill her right away.

756
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,897
You can't go in.

757
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,815
You'll have to beat me first.

758
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,859
Do you think I won't?

759
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,866
Darn it.

760
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,242
You pathetic fool.

761
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:21,456
I didn't expect you
to get the Uiryeong Sword.

762
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,338
Hey. Are you pretending to sleep?

763
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:41,476
What's going on?

764
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:44,771
Did you really lose your spirit?

765
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,622
It would've ended like this anyway.

766
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,172
Here's my old house.

767
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,675
Give me a new house.

768
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,315
Do you know how high
the housing prices are?

769
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:11,482
What a crook.

770
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,735
-What?
-What do you think?

771
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,112
I wanted to check this.

772
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:21,242
You use your scale
to transfer bodies, don't you?

773
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:28,458
The fortune-teller has been missing
after he was at the folk village.

774
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:32,211
Even the clairvoyant lady of Samdocheon
can't seem to spot him.

775
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,838
Darn it.

776
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,340
What do we do now?

777
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:40,011
Go out and get me
any wooden sword you can find.

778
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:41,095
A wooden sword?

779
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,556
What will you do with a useless sword?

780
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,434
I'll try to cut something
that can't be cut.

781
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:56,402
Why don't we spice things up a little?

782
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:03,826
Stop the car.

783
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,379
Then this sword was never--

784
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,590
It was 10,000 won
at the Cheonggyecheon Flea Market.

785
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,718
That fortune-teller only shows up

786
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,970
whenever or wherever he pleases.

787
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,972
Man, you scumbag.

788
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,599
Look who's talking.

789
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,726
What was that awful impersonation?

790
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,895
-Did you know it was me?
-I smelled it.

791
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:33,648
I smelled blood the moment I came in here.

792
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:35,733
I have a pretty good sense of smell.

793
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,695
Anyway, thanks for the donation.

794
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:44,742
Do you think you turned the tables
just because you have a scale?

795
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,285
Even if you plant it elsewhere,

796
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:49,038
I'll hunt her down and pester her again,

797
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,999
until you surrender and give up that body.

798
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:53,543
That means

799
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:57,547
I can use this to plant you elsewhere.

800
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,759
For example,

801
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:03,761
how about that snake?

802
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:07,348
Go ahead and try.

803
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,018
Okay.

804
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,104
Do you think

805
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,315
I'll let this body go quietly

806
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,235
as I get dragged out against my will?

807
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:38,671
Alright.

808
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,465
To be honest,

809
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:43,050
I like you more than the other serpent.

810
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:46,220
A villain should be wicked as much.

811
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,473
How dare a serpent dream of romance?

812
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:53,436
To me, this woman is
nothing more than a hostage.

813
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,897
He's more interested in Ji-a

814
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,607
than completing your body.

815
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,443
He's nothing but a piece of me.

816
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:02,320
He didn't seem to think so.

817
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:05,656
Do you think we'll split up
if you say that to me?

818
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,617
In your dreams.

819
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,412
Do you know

820
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,748
what he's up to right now?

821
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,794
So

822
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:19,921
that jerk is--

823
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,816
Everyone causes nothing but trouble.

824
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,678
NAME: NAM JI-A
BIRTH: MARCH 3RD, 1991

825
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,264
DEATH: TODAY

826
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,994
Innocent people are dying.

827
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,455
The whole world will fall apart
if I let this go on.

828
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,374
No, you're wrong.

829
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,002
From the beginning,

830
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:43,045
this was just who you were.

831
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,338
Honey.

832
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,132
Don't call me that.

833
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:47,633
Just now,

834
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,678
I decided to quit being your husband.

835
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,472
Nonsense. I won't allow it.

836
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:58,811
Stop right there.

837
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,022
Don't you hear me?

838
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:04,025
You'll lose everything
once you walk out that door.

839
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:05,818
I'll make sure of it!

840
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,144
Hey, are you okay?

841
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,494
Yeon.

842
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,914
Yes, it's me.

843
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:04,418
Let's hurry.

844
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,671
I want to remain as myself

845
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,632
in the last moment of my life.

846
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:14,804
So that I can

847
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:17,306
stay by your side.

848
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:26,399
Let's finish this.

849
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,777
Let's put an end

850
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:32,488
to this tiring fight.

851
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:38,536
THE BOOK OF THE DEAD

852
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:41,414
NAME: NAM JI-A
BIRTH: MARCH 3RD, 1991

853
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,250
NAME: NAM-JI-A

854
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:50,631
DEATH: TODAY

855
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,243
Give me three days.

856
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,829
I can catch it. I can catch the serpent!

857
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:22,747
It's too late.

858
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,206
You'll regret this.

859
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,500
If it weren't for me,

860
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:31,464
Yeon would've been living his life
as a mountain deity to this day.

861
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,090
Yeon will never forgive me.

862
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:36,802
I might regret loving you
for the first time.

863
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,888
I can destroy everything you care about.

864
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,349
Let's take her down together.

865
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:43,684
The lord of Samdocheon.

866
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,811
What's the condition?

867
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:46,729
Let Ji-a go.

868
