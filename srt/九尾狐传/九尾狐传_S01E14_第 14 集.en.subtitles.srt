00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,554
THE BOOK OF THE DEAD

2
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:58,725
NAME: NAM JI-A
BIRTH: MARCH 3RD, 1991

3
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:04,314
DEATH: TODAY

4
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,127
Yeon.

5
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,547
Yes, it's me.

6
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,676
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,679
My body wouldn't move as I like

8
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,058
on my way to the inner room.

9
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,479
It's all right. You've held out just fine.

10
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,317
I can still feel

11
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,654
how it's creeping around in my head.

12
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,702
Let's hurry.

13
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,997
I want to remain as myself

14
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,042
in the last moment of my life.

15
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,338
So that I can

16
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,715
stay by your side.

17
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,598
Let's finish this.

18
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,893
Let's put an end

19
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,688
to this tiring fight.

20
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,051
Hey, are you okay?

21
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:10,732
Let's go.

22
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,567
Why?

23
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,195
Why do you do this?

24
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:16,905
What?

25
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,948
Do you enjoy making a mess of the world?

26
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,950
Is that it?

27
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:21,910
No.

28
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,371
To be honest,
reading books is much more fun.

29
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,332
Then why are you doing this?

30
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,250
I want Lee Yeon to die.

31
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,254
He's not just going to die
even if you do this.

32
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,255
That's exactly why.

33
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,717
He never gets tired
and keeps coming at me.

34
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,470
He keeps trying to defy his fate.

35
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,184
There's no turning back now.

36
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,731
He and I both
have already crossed the line.

37
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,027
Mr. Lee!

38
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,534
Are you hurt?

39
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,578
Not really.

40
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,414
Okay. Then it's time for you to get hurt.

41
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,540
How dare you trick me?

42
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,752
This was the only way.

43
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,003
Shut up.

44
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,090
You should've known when
he gathered us to tell us the strategy.

45
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,091
As if you knew.

46
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,342
If he had the sword,

47
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,219
he wouldn't have talked so much.

48
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,304
He would've started swinging first.

49
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,222
What did you say?

50
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,849
Mr. Lee is a man of action

51
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,143
or something like that.

52
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,521
So did you find the answer
you were looking for?

53
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,939
Well, sort of.

54
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,441
What was the answer?

55
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,111
-The key.
-What key?

56
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,697
The key it needs
to get in and out of its vessels.

57
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,866
Then can we drag it out of Ms. Nam?

58
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,120
That's not good enough.

59
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:50,915
Sorry?

60
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,836
I'm going to bury it for good

61
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,422
so that it'll never come back.

62
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,675
Stop right there.

63
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,011
Don't you hear me?

64
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,556
You'll lose everything
once you walk out that door.

65
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,932
I'll make sure of it!

66
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,990
What do I have?

67
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:29,162
Position as lord of Samdocheon,
powers to rival a deity,

68
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,331
and eternal life, I gave it all to you!

69
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,750
That's not what I want.

70
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,418
I want my wife and son.

71
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,628
Honey.

72
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,548
Living an eternity with you…

73
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,594
is my biggest punishment.

74
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,476
Stop right there.

75
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,853
I said stop right there!

76
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,455
Goodness.

77
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,427
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

78
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,845
Did anything happen?

79
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,055
Are you okay?

80
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,640
What did Mr. Choi say?

81
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,517
A police officer died.

82
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,436
-What's the cause?
-He had a heart attack.

83
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,355
But when Mr. Choi did CPR,

84
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,399
he saw weird spots
covering his entire body.

85
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,484
Also, he vomited an egg.

86
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:43,945
An egg?

87
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,033
Don't tell me
they're with Mr. Choi right now.

88
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:49,951
Where are you?

89
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,665
How can something so awful
happen to me at this age?

90
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,750
I saw a man die right in front of my eyes.

91
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,044
-It was right in my face!
-We told you not to--

92
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,921
Get away from him right now.

93
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,633
Okay.

94
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,683
Did Mr. Choi go to the police station?

95
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,645
Yes. He gave first aid to the deceased.

96
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,646
Is everything okay?

97
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,398
For now.

98
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:23,985
You need to see this.

99
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,281
DEAD BODIES COVERED IN SPOTS

100
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,700
AN OUTBREAK OF MYSTERIOUS DEATHS

101
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,663
The death toll is spiking exponentially.

102
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,374
I need to go out for a bit.

103
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,877
Where?

104
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,129
You can go home first.

105
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,047
But don't go alone. Go with them.

106
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,352
Yeon, you must hurry.

107
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,771
The old woman changed Ji-a's death date.

108
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,698
TRADITIONAL KOREAN CUISINE: SNAIL BRIDE

109
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,244
What's wrong?

110
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,041
Everything is unfolding just as he warned.

111
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,834
What did he say?

112
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,503
He'll spread an epidemic

113
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,255
and kill everyone dear to me.

114
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,968
Wait, my mom and dad.

115
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,221
I'll go. Please go home as Mr. Lee said.

116
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,515
-But--
-Don't worry.

117
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,600
Mr. Lee Rang, please.

118
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,819
Say, "Please escort me home."

119
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,531
-Not over my dead body.
-Then die.

120
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,408
It's not on me if the serpent takes you.

121
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,370
You're both in the same boat to me.

122
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,039
Don't you think that applies to you?

123
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:00,998
The female serpent.

124
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,626
Let's go our separate ways.

125
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,877
As you wish.

126
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,138
What a tough cookie.

127
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,642
What does Yeon see in her?

128
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,336
What? What's going on?

129
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,053
This…

130
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,380
Mr. Hyeonuiong?

131
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,385
Thank goodness.

132
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,221
I got here just in time.

133
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,023
My dear, are you hurt?

134
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:49,940
I'm fine.

135
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:55,488
The ones from Samdocheon
have begun to make a move.

136
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,323
I'm relieved.

137
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,203
It seems like
things will get serious very soon.

138
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,267
Granny.

139
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,562
Choose the words you blurt
out of your mouth very carefully.

140
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,983
I'm just as lousy as you are now.

141
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,152
Did you tamper with the book?

142
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,613
Did you choose to make me your enemy?

143
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,075
Did you really choose the path that

144
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,078
you'll never forgive yourself for?

145
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,540
No matter what you say, I won't revoke
what I wrote down in the book.

146
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,667
That is

147
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:51,961
what I have chosen.

148
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,049
Why is it Jia
over the one who caused this plague?

149
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,887
Were you able to slay it with a sword?

150
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,438
My sword doesn't kill you.

151
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,067
What's inside the girl is the problem.

152
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,737
You have to catch that
to cut down the one outside.

153
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,821
In order to do that,

154
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,991
the girl must die.

155
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,954
I'll say it one last time.

156
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,583
Put everything back to its place.

157
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,507
This is the rightful place.

158
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,968
This is how we end this.

159
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:43,888
No.

160
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,682
No one can

161
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,851
take Ji-a away.

162
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,901
I don't care if it's you, Granny.

163
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,320
It's already out of your hands.

164
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,136
Come.

165
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,148
That means until I die,

166
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,946
things like that car accident
will keep happening.

167
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,118
I'm glad I said goodbye to Mom and Dad.

168
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,746
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,082
Why should you be sorry?

170
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,793
You saved my life.

171
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,296
I tried my best to stop her,

172
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,133
but this was all I could do.

173
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,431
Where's Yeon?

174
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,768
He went to settle this with her.

175
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,063
Will he be okay?

176
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,690
I'm not sure.

177
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,484
She has never changed her mind

178
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:25,114
when it comes to something
that she thinks is right.

179
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,324
Yeon knows that too.

180
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,953
Then because of me, he--

181
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:35,499
He's putting everything he has
on the line right now.

182
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,970
I'll pay with my life.

183
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,099
Give me three days.

184
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,103
If I don't catch that thing in three days,

185
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:00,858
slay me.

186
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,986
I can't do that.

187
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,531
He's already out of control.

188
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,412
I have its scale.

189
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,206
-It's too late.
-I can catch it. I can catch the serpent!

190
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,252
How many lives do you think
it'll take in the next three days?

191
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:24,006
Who can say their lives are less worthy
than the one you wish to protect?

192
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,693
Let her live.

193
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,119
Please don't kill her.

194
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,873
I'll do anything.

195
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,291
I'll do whatever you tell me.

196
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,960
Grab the sword instead.

197
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,713
Stop acting like an idiot.
Just be yourself and fight me!

198
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,215
Please.

199
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,055
Yeon.

200
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,060
I wouldn't have started this
if I could undo it.

201
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,107
How could you do this to me?

202
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,694
I lost my son and my husband.

203
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,864
I can always lose you too.

204
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,456
You'll regret this,

205
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,709
Granny.

206
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,636
Where did it all go wrong?

207
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,140
If it weren't for me,

208
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,978
Yeon would've been living his life
as a mountain deity to this day.

209
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,732
No.

210
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,277
If I hadn't been born at all--

211
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,780
Dear, it's not your fault.

212
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,241
Why do you despise yourself

213
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,202
and try so hard
to deny your relationships?

214
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,496
I feel like it's all my fault.

215
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,332
We immortals are just like you.

216
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,752
We all live our lives
leaning on certain memories.

217
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,546
For me, it was the son I lost.

218
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,215
For Snail Bride, it's her loving husband.

219
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,595
And Yeon could go on because of you.

220
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,306
The serpent said

221
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,726
I'll end up

222
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,688
killing Yeon with my own hands.

223
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:49,359
That's why you two are
putting up a fight to protect each other.

224
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,737
Both you and Yeon.

225
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,984
Either way, it's a dead end.

226
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,670
Damn it. This thing doesn't light up.

227
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,673
You said you were going to quit.

228
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,763
I tried just about everything
to quit smoking.

229
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,059
I tried taking eundan,
nicotine patches, and chewing gum.

230
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,811
There's even medicine these days.

231
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:11,066
What I'm saying is I couldn't quit
even after all that fuss.

232
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,485
What are you saying?

233
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,157
What if nothing changes
no matter how much you struggle?

234
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,662
What if only one of you can live?

235
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,956
So nothing will…

236
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,459
change in the end.

237
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,449
Want me to blow on it?

238
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,783
This is already on you.

239
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,285
Or do you want this car?

240
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,913
Gosh, there's no point in talking to you.

241
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,080
And you,

242
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,583
do something about that runny nose
around me.

243
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,543
I have a weak stomach.

244
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,966
How long have you been wearing that?
Did you even wash it?

245
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,397
Run to the store and get new clothes.

246
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,650
I'm highly concerned about my hygiene.

247
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,239
I'm going to the bathroom.

248
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,619
Hey, why are these stickers on me?

249
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,120
I'll kill you when I get out!

250
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,920
The weather is nice.

251
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,213
It's very sunny.

252
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,340
Here's your coffee.

253
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,052
This tree has grown a lot.

254
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,682
You're right. It grew up so well.

255
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,812
So what's on your mind?

256
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,439
As all these years passed by,

257
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,567
where in the world were we?

258
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,986
Tell me about it.

259
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,364
Apparently, we've been missing
for a long time. Isn't it odd?

260
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,741
All I remember is being asleep.

261
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,703
It's weird we don't have any bedsores.

262
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,455
And Ji-a looks anxious for some reason.

263
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,959
I thought of Ieo Island's legend.

264
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:35,877
Ieo Island?

265
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:39,840
A fisherman accidentally
drifted into a fantasy island,

266
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,341
and when he returned,

267
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,635
a hundred years had passed.

268
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:50,225
But I'm grateful Ji-a grew up well
just like that tree.

269
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,417
Is this all we have?

270
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,501
It's delicious.

271
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,379
I want some naengmyeon.

272
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,089
Yu-ri.

273
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,091
When is she coming back?

274
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,553
I'm thinking about a good time
to bring her back.

275
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,096
Why do you only think about it?

276
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,558
Once I've thought it through,

277
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,186
Yeon will end up losing something.

278
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,105
It has been 600 years.

279
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,317
I'm going to put an end
to this tiresome fight once and for all.

280
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,610
What if you fail?

281
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,028
Rang.

282
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,240
That's why I need you.

283
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,078
If anything happens to me,

284
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,540
I want you to finish this.

285
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:01,338
I want you to be my final weapon.

286
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,132
I refuse.

287
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:09,554
I don't care if the serpent
destroys this world or kills your woman.

288
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,598
We want to protect different things.

289
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,520
-Rang.
-You can protect her.

290
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,731
I'll get Yu-ri back

291
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,943
and save you.

292
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,411
Why are you laughing?

293
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,623
I don't think I'm cut out
to be a good kid.

294
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,375
I'm leaving.

295
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,715
Keep the house safe, Geomdoong.

296
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,759
Why do you call me Geomdoong?

297
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,391
Si-yeong.

298
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,810
Why, hello.

299
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,312
What brings you here at this hour?

300
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:03,066
I came to have some samgyetang.

301
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,905
By the way, are you feeling okay?

302
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,032
What are you talking about?

303
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,785
I may look weak,
but I do 200 squats a day.

304
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,620
Do you want to see my thighs?

305
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,956
Come on. Take a seat.

306
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,040
Sure.

307
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,585
Si-yeong.

308
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,629
Seven police officers
were hospitalized just this morning.

309
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,089
What about Mr. Choi?

310
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,258
You already saw how he's totally fine.

311
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:32,053
I keep telling him to see a doctor,
but he won't listen.

312
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,972
If he's fine,

313
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,016
shouldn't we be fine too?

314
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,435
Let's worry about editing first.

315
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,603
Come along.

316
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,063
Goodness.

317
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:45,775
I'm sorry to bother you
before you're open.

318
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,654
I've been feeling queasy all morning,
but I feel so much better now.

319
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,327
What's wrong?

320
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,415
Why do you look so pale?

321
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,626
Do I have a fever?

322
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,755
Not at all. Goodness, you're so cold.

323
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,672
Give me your hand.

324
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,966
Your hand is cold too.

325
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,801
How can a person turn this cold?

326
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,655
It's a snake egg.

327
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,369
He's asleep again.

328
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,620
Time to wake up.

329
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,789
Sir, time to wake up.

330
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,748
Sir?

331
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,708
Director?

332
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:46,795
What's going on?

333
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,593
He's dead.

334
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,264
Hey, call 911 now.

335
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,390
I'll go get help.

336
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,884
What? Dead?

337
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,096
Everyone on our floor?

338
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,764
One second.

339
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:49,524
Breaking news. There's been an outbreak
of mysterious deaths all over Seoul.

340
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,361
It has been two days since the first death
from a hospital in Geumran-gu.

341
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,823
The authorities presume
this is caused by an unknown disease

342
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,075
that is highly lethal
and highly contagious.

343
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,288
The victims were covered with red spots
all over their body.

344
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,624
The autopsy result
of the first victim showed

345
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:09,169
serious damage on the inside,
as if his organs were

346
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,421
mutilated by an animal.

347
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:15,425
Kim, a 32-year-old man,
did not have any pre-existing conditions…

348
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,608
What do you think?

349
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,776
It's tacky.

350
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,527
It's not my style.

351
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,737
Then it must be fine.

352
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,407
Where are you going?

353
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,950
To get a cup of tea.

354
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,119
To celebrate, I'll let you see him.

355
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,998
-See him?
-Your boyfriend.

356
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,583
You can go see him.

357
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,848
Yu-ri.

358
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:04,933
Yu-ri, are you okay?

359
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,352
I need to see you now.

360
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,645
Now?

361
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,315
Where?

362
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,777
I'll go to you.

363
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,258
Come out.

364
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,970
I know you're hiding inside me.

365
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:43,680
Come out.

366
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,476
If you don't come out in three…

367
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,982
I'll kill myself.

368
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,193
One.

369
00:28:58,528 --> 00:28:59,696
Two.

370
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,531
Three.

371
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,168
You crazy broad.

372
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,465
You're just a shell.
How dare you summon me?

373
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,925
"A shell"?

374
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,304
You live in someone else's body
without paying rent.

375
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,097
Stop acting like you're the landlord.

376
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,183
There will be a new owner soon.

377
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,686
in a day or two.

378
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,607
Your body will soon be completely mine.

379
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,567
That's longer than I expected.

380
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,319
Why?

381
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,405
The Fox Marble disappeared
a long time ago.

382
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,865
It's just an aftereffect.

383
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,201
That marble made me sleep for too long.

384
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,204
Say your goodbyes in advance.

385
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,456
Once I take over,

386
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,626
the one who'll be trapped
and asleep forever

387
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,045
will be you.

388
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,924
That means until that time,

389
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,426
you're incomplete.

390
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:07,472
Darn it. What can you do anyway?

391
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,474
What if I died before then?

392
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,602
You could never do that.

393
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,729
When humans have

394
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,942
something they want to protect,
they can do anything.

395
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,989
They can end up doing something crazy.

396
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,245
Help!

397
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,412
What's wrong?

398
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,248
-Miss!
-Get up!

399
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,582
What's wrong?

400
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,838
Is anybody around? Someone call 911!

401
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,048
Is anyone there? What do I do?

402
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,804
Listen to this brat.

403
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:48,763
That's all.

404
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,599
You can go back inside.

405
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,602
That's all I wanted to know.

406
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:57,981
Girl.

407
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,192
Lee Yeon will be doomed because of you.

408
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:05,488
He will never give up on you.

409
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,116
If you have time
to be concerned about my love life,

410
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,326
look after your other half.

411
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,622
He couldn't get over his broken heart,

412
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,834
and seems to want to drag
both you and me to hell.

413
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,836
He wouldn't do that.

414
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,462
My death date was changed.

415
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,177
Do you think he didn't know
the lady of Samdocheon would do this

416
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,721
if he massacred innocent people?

417
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,723
Are you in there?

418
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,309
Yes, I'll be out in a second.

419
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,116
Yu-ri.

420
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,203
Are you alright? Let me see you.

421
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,080
I'm not hurt.

422
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,209
That's a relief.

423
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,087
I was worried to death.

424
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,130
How did you get here?

425
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,132
Did you run away?

426
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,593
Why didn't you tell me it was the serpent?

427
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,971
Where's Mr. Lee Rang?

428
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,264
He's up.

429
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,143
He won't say it,
but he's very worried about you.

430
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,187
I'm relieved.

431
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,981
Let's go.

432
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,858
Mr. Lee will be thrilled--

433
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,318
We can't.

434
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:26,945
What?

435
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,865
We can't go.

436
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,576
Both me or you.

437
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,162
What do you mean?

438
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,248
I'm holding you down
and stalling right now.

439
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,584
What do you…

440
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,508
No.

441
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,429
Let me go.

442
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,058
I already said we can't go.

443
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,938
To celebrate, I'll let you see him.

444
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,690
Your boyfriend.

445
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,066
You can go see him.

446
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,654
Why should I do as you say?

447
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,409
Because if I see Sin-ju today,

448
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,786
he'll die.

449
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,093
Hey, Dad.

450
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,137
Hey, Ji-a. Where are you?

451
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,597
I'm outside. Why?

452
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,183
A friend of yours came to see you.

453
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,145
My friend? Who?

454
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,064
I told you not to let anyone in.

455
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:48,276
No, it's because I know him.

456
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,821
Mom or you wouldn't know anybody.

457
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,282
Is it Yeon?

458
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,952
No, the fair-skinned young man
I told you about.

459
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,704
The carnation.

460
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:02,832
What?

461
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,005
I told you.

462
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,841
I won't be nice to you from now on.

463
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,634
I won't let you do this.

464
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,511
If you hurt my parents, I'll--

465
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,138
Don't fight against your fate.

466
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,309
I can destroy everything you care about.

467
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,731
Who are you?
You aren't her friend, are you?

468
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,524
No, Mom.

469
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,776
Don't do that!

470
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,361
I want to hang myself.

471
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,322
No!

472
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,120
You can't go out.

473
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,122
No, I have to go.

474
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,459
My parents are in danger. Please.

475
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,586
No.

476
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,135
Go to sleep.

477
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,400
How did you know I was here?

478
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,986
I just came back from Samdocheon.

479
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,988
It was the old woman's clairvoyance.

480
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,323
She changed Ji-a's death date,

481
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,368
thanks to that plague you spread.

482
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,536
She's still alive.

483
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,955
I just got off the phone with her.

484
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,374
Lord Hyeonuiong is protecting her for me.

485
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,043
Well, that won't last too long.

486
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,380
You said you were just there.
Why didn't you beg her for her life?

487
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,550
I've begged enough.

488
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,970
It didn't work.

489
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,057
Once Ji-a dies,

490
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,518
your other half that's in her
won't be safe either.

491
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,062
So?

492
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,066
What is it you really want?

493
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,693
Do you want to guess?

494
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,239
Your existence itself is destitution,

495
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,910
back when you were a human child
and even now.

496
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,078
You're so cursed

497
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:49,332
it feels like the almighty wanted
to screw with your life.

498
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,291
That's the serpent.

499
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,047
Are you picking a fight?

500
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,591
No, it's the contrary.

501
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,301
What?

502
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,429
What if there's a better way
to make up for your neediness

503
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,139
than obsessing over me or Ji-a?

504
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,686
What if you took over a position
that a lowly mountain deity

505
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,605
wouldn't even dream of?

506
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,732
Try to make some sense.

507
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,567
The deity of deities.

508
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:19,820
No way.

509
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,577
I'm talking about the lord of Samdocheon.

510
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,160
Let's take down
the lord of Samdocheon together.

511
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,666
That's new.

512
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,293
It's unexpected.

513
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,045
I can't believe
you decided to betray that old lady.

514
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,589
If I can save Ji-a,

515
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,716
I can do anything.

516
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,304
So, you're going to join hands with me?

517
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:31,183
Of course, even if it means
I must team up with the likes of you.

518
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,519
What's the condition?

519
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,479
Let Ji-a go.

520
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,067
Take back your other half that's in her,

521
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,777
and don't ever look for us again.

522
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,863
That's my only condition.

523
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,324
Would you believe that this isn't a trap?

524
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,410
I wouldn't if I were you.

525
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,329
What?

526
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,672
Then try to guess.

527
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,550
What do you think I'll say?

528
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,055
No is what you'd like to say,

529
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,432
but you'll end up accepting my offer.

530
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,312
What makes you so confident?

531
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,194
We're both at a dead end.

532
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,739
If you don't accept my offer,

533
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,407
you'll lose your other half,

534
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,409
and I'll lose Ji-a.

535
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:35,122
Then we'll both end up going to hell
after a bloody fight.

536
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,419
That's all I've wanted
since my last date with her.

537
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,259
Call me if you change your mind.

538
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,471
You have until sunrise tomorrow.

539
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,737
You knew the serpent went to kill them,

540
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,407
but you're holding me down? Why?

541
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,243
Did he threaten you?

542
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:16,372
Or were you mind-controlled
like when you stabbed Mr. Lee Rang?

543
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,125
-It's neither.
-Then why?

544
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,876
Why did you do that?

545
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,630
Who cares about those petty humans?

546
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,763
"Those petty humans"?

547
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,477
I thought you came to see me.

548
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,064
I was worried sick about you!

549
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,608
But

550
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,486
I was nothing but bait.

551
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,615
You took advantage of me.

552
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,326
-Sin-ju--
-Stop.

553
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,495
If you say another word…

554
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,501
I might regret loving you
for the first time.

555
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,445
You must've been worried.
They're both fine.

556
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,907
I erased their memories too.

557
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,619
They won't even remember
having met the serpent.

558
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,245
Thank you, Yeon.

559
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,920
It's all my fault. I was away.

560
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,588
It's not your fault.

561
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,758
I know you've been protecting my parents.

562
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,599
Thank you, sir,
for protecting Ji-a in my place.

563
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,228
What are you going to do now?

564
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,687
I'll work with the serpent.

565
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,856
What?

566
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,233
What do you mean?

567
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,026
Because of my old woman?

568
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:10,861
Yes.

569
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,154
So she

570
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,115
ended up letting go of you.

571
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:19,370
She gave me a chance.
Another chance to fight.

572
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,080
Can you be more specific?

573
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,958
We got two more days.

574
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,793
You'll be safe in the meantime.

575
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,462
Then I'll be--

576
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,966
Of course. Why would you die?

577
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,759
I'm still here guarding you.

578
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,302
Then you're working with him to--

579
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,097
Of course, that's what it is.

580
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,015
I knew it, Mr. Lee.

581
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,894
-What was her condition?
-Nothing.

582
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,146
I just have to bring in the serpent.

583
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,440
-Yeon.
-Later.

584
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,818
I'll tell you the details later.

585
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,444
I'm going out to eat with Ji-a.

586
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:55,823
I'll go get changed.

587
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,187
What if the ending won't change

588
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,607
no matter how hard you try?

589
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:31,650
What if

590
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,486
only one of you can live?

591
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,405
So the ending…

592
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,034
won't change.

593
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,179
Then I don't even need to think about it.

594
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:05,893
What's your plan?

595
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,022
I'll eat

596
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:11,940
this thing.

597
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,862
I'll take the serpent in Ji-a in my body,

598
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,073
take the other half, then jump

599
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:20,532
into the Samdocheon.

600
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,371
I'll make sure
he never comes back to life.

601
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,456
If you jump in there yourself, you--

602
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,457
I know.

603
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,168
I won't be allowed to be reborn.

604
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,549
And that
I'll never go back to be with Ji-a.

605
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,342
I'm sorry to cause you trouble.

606
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,637
I could've gone to the hospital.

607
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,723
They couldn't help you.

608
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,851
This disease isn't
what you people think it is.

609
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,980
It's very cold.

610
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:36,817
Hang in there.

611
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,113
This terrible fight will end soon.

612
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,950
So until then, hang in there.

613
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,912
I knew it.

614
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:53,625
Hye-ja, you aren't
an ordinary person, are you?

615
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,386
Goodness, my lord.

616
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,474
I was wondering why you were closed today.

617
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:10,851
I'm sorry.

618
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,356
My goodness.

619
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:18,609
Come on out.

620
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:19,526
I--

621
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,744
Did you bring him here knowing who he was?

622
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,662
What in the world are you talking about?

623
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,289
He's your husband.

624
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:33,749
What?

625
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:37,461
He's your husband from the past life,
the man you never got over.

626
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:43,842
Is anybody there?

627
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,470
Hey! Someone's dying here!

628
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,933
Damn it. Damn it!

629
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,358
Are you okay?

630
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,653
-Goodness, you have spots all over.
-Detective.

631
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,696
Get me to a hospital.

632
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,948
It's no use.

633
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,826
It'll only postpone death.
The mortality rate is 100 percent.

634
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:10,869
Goodness.

635
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,706
What happened to you?

636
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,546
Wait.

637
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,131
Since when did detectives

638
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,260
put on shoes
that didn't have a speck of dust?

639
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,429
Man, this darned dress code.

640
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,021
Who sent you?

641
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,315
Was it Yeon? Or--

642
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,943
What does it matter on the brink of death?

643
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,613
I'm sure you aren't here to watch me die.

644
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,240
I like doing that a lot.

645
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,826
Look, I even brought popcorn.

646
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,454
I even take tours of funeral halls.

647
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,583
What do you want? Tell me.

648
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,918
You're dying.

649
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,962
How dare you try to make a deal?

650
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,383
Are you still stuck in the past
when you had that serpent behind you?

651
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,051
Once the serpent dies,

652
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,054
this damned sickness
will also disappear, right?

653
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:11,972
Probably.

654
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,432
Get me out of here.

655
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,267
Why should I?

656
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,561
I've served him
much longer than you realize.

657
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:20,230
Which means
no one knows him better than I do.

658
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,024
So?

659
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,943
Are you trying to
talk your way out of this?

660
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,403
And get well for free?

661
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,490
No, thanks.

662
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:34,077
I'm not such a good fighter,
and I hate getting scars.

663
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,582
I get what you mean.

664
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,335
That's why you're here.

665
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,295
You don't want blood on your hands.

666
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,318
He ran away!

667
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,153
Who?

668
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,450
The serial murder suspect.

669
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,285
Who let him out?

670
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,288
Well, the CCTV shows--

671
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,874
What? Why can't you say it?

672
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:21,875
It was you.

673
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:23,961
What?

674
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:28,173
GOPBUN'S GRILLED TRIPE

675
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,008
Let me take your order.

676
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,220
Yes, an order of grilled tripe set
and a bottle of soju.

677
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,346
And lots of cheese.

678
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:35,347
Sure.

679
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,989
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

680
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,326
That's a lot of cheese.

681
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,045
What?

682
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,047
You're so pretty.

683
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,258
Gosh.

684
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,103
Promise me.

685
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,440
What promise?

686
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,234
Let's come back
on the day of the first snow.

687
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,363
Okay.

688
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,700
And you'll spend Christmas with me.

689
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,077
We'll go back to the beach
we went to together.

690
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,290
Okay.

691
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,083
Also, on New Year's Day,

692
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,753
come to my house
and have rice cake soup with my parents.

693
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,298
And on my birthday…

694
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,387
What do you want?

695
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,272
Okay, I'll buy it for you.

696
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,860
And what must you do
to keep all these promises?

697
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,286
I need to live a long life.

698
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,043
Cheers.

699
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:44,017
What is this?

700
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,979
-Did someone force you?
-Why didn't you say it was your birthday?

701
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:51,691
People don't remember lunar birthdays
nowadays.

702
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,652
Only their moms would.

703
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:58,198
It smells good.

704
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:07,499
I have two tropical fish in my apartment.

705
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,334
Do they have names?

706
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,461
Deok-bae and Chun-sam.

707
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,339
Both are of the Gyeongju Kim clan.

708
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:19,678
I promised to buy them a huge tank
once I get paid this month.

709
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,014
Will you adopt them from me?

710
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,646
You need to make a wish first.

711
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:39,531
I want to eat cake from Jae-hwan again
on my next birthday.

712
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,006
That was the last.

713
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,888
This might be

714
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:06,266
the last bottle of soju
we'll drink together.

715
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,312
I'll drink it little by little.

716
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,358
Why would you say that?

717
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:19,070
Earlier, the half inside my body said

718
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,698
I have only two days at max.

719
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,035
After two days,

720
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,787
I'll become an empty shell.

721
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,623
That won't happen.

722
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,417
Won't everything be okay if I disappear?

723
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:36,213
Once I die, the serpent will be gone.

724
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:40,425
Then everyone I love--
including my family, friends, and you--

725
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,720
won't be hurt anymore.

726
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,435
Don't ever think like that again.

727
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,562
But you know,

728
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,648
if that happens,

729
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:57,275
how will you live once I leave you?

730
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:01,529
Then

731
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,950
I'll live a long time blaming myself

732
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,621
thinking, "I failed to protect you again."

733
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,457
I feel the same way.

734
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,921
I don't think
I can live a good life without you.

735
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:23,260
That's why we have to protect each other.

736
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,638
Let's never give the serpent
what he wants.

737
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,439
Hey, Jae-hwan.

738
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,526
What?

739
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,452
I told you not to come.

740
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:51,788
Why are you here?

741
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,460
How did this happen to you?

742
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,130
How?

743
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,840
Don't touch me.

744
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:02,799
It's contagious.

745
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:25,655
Let's not see
each other's ugly faces again.

746
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,707
I didn't think this would be our farewell.

747
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,587
I know. You should've died by my hands.

748
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,883
Now that it's come to this,
try your best to survive.

749
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:46,926
You just made up with your brother.

750
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,470
Can you handle the consequences?

751
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:49,971
No.

752
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,098
Yeon will never forgive me.

753
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,642
I might never see him again.

754
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,937
It's still better than him dying.

755
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,857
That's enough.

756
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,694
People who live a sad life like you
never have a happy ending.

757
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:10,241
The bladder cherries are gone,
and I only have one human life left.

758
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,785
Don't curse me.

759
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,079
I'll use all my money before I die.

760
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,123
Bye.

761
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:32,972
You can protect her.

762
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,643
I'll get Yu-ri back and save you.

763
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,689
How could I not recognize him?

764
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:46,778
He kept bothering me,
so I gave him such a tough time.

765
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:50,532
He must have known you missed him a lot,
then came to find you here.

766
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,825
What's the point?

767
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,327
I finally found him again,
but look at how he's doing.

768
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,204
This is too much. Seriously.

769
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,795
Do you think it's a coincidence?

770
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,130
What?

771
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,507
These complicated relationships

772
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:12,220
all began to gather in one place
around Yeon and that girl,

773
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,889
the woman from the past life,

774
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,184
his family, friends, and

775
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,228
enemy.

776
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,984
I feel uneasy.

777
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,319
It feels like

778
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:33,241
something we can't handle
might begin to unravel.

779
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,596
You should stay here for a while.
Stay with me.

780
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,349
Hey, send him away.

781
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,768
Don't stay. You might catch it.

782
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,520
I would've caught it already.

783
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,855
Maybe it's a latent period.

784
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,815
Come on. Beat him up.

785
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,150
I still won't leave.

786
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:10,069
I'll protect you. You'll need a caretaker.

787
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:13,490
I'm going to talk to him for a minute.
Keep an eye on her.

788
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,547
How's Mr. Choi?

789
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:34,594
He coughed up an egg,
but he didn't get any better.

790
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,180
What's with the egg?

791
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,100
There's a baby snake in there.

792
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,394
That's what eats people up.

793
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,649
I can't bear to see her die.

794
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,317
Never.

795
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,782
Everything will be over soon.

796
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,828
I just need him to take my bait. Then…

797
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,503
So until then,
hang in there a little longer.

798
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:10,964
Give me a little more time.

799
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,807
Let's take down
the lord of Samdocheon together.

800
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,351
Call me if you change your mind.

801
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,354
You have until sunrise tomorrow.

802
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,322
Just one more bite.

803
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:29,751
I'm finished.

804
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:33,755
Ms. Kim.

805
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,007
-Ms. Kim.
-Ms. Kim!

806
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,091
Ms. Kim.

807
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:26,891
Fine.

808
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:30,561
Let's take down
the lord of Samdocheon together.

809
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,261
Yeon and the serpent?

810
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,431
You must be kidding.

811
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,016
No.

812
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,685
Sorry?

813
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,395
He's committing suicide.

814
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,105
That idiot is

815
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,774
going to kill himself with the serpent.

816
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:24,240
Lee Yeon,
you will fall into your own trap.

817
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:28,453
And now, we're up on the same stage.

818
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:31,789
It's a stage

819
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,794
we can't come down from
until we're both dead.

820
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,271
What are you doing here?

821
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,899
You have to die for me to survive.

822
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:00,485
I'm going to end everything myself.

823
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,278
Don't do this.

824
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:03,988
If you do this, you'll--

825
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:04,906
Goodbye.

826
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:19,629
What?

827
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:22,423
There was no rain in the forecast.

828
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:53,412
When did you get here?

829
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,542
As soon as the unexpected shower fell.

830
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,293
To take me home?

831
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:01,879
I don't want you to get wet.

832
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,969
What about work? Are you all done?

833
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:11,138
It was an easy video,
so I edited everything quickly.

834
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:14,183
Who in the world is
trying to ruin Ji-a's reunion?

835
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,434
It's Mr. Choi.

836
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,603
-And me.
-What?

837
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:18,896
I didn't drive today.

838
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,399
You're right. You left your car.

839
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:23,568
Your house is only 20 minutes away.

840
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:27,029
We don't have time to go on dates
because of your parents.

841
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,285
Buy me a bowl of ramyeon.

842
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,578
Then I'll let you go.

843
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:34,495
Okay.

844
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,594
Isn't this too little?

845
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,095
It is. We're way short.

846
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:52,930
I said we should get two.

847
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,933
Do you know the two conditions
that make ramyeon delicious?

848
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:58,185
One is kimchi. What's the other?

849
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,687
Someone who steals a bite.

850
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:03,399
I'll help you make it delicious.

851
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,619
You eat so well.

852
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:17,705
I want some soup, but I'll pass.

853
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,123
Why?

854
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,459
I might crave soju.

855
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:23,711
I knew you were smart.

856
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,466
Did you know it reaches 40m
if you line up the noodles?

857
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:30,217
That's the height of the 13 floors.

858
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,511
Are you showing off your trivia?

859
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:35,723
I don't even want to be
half a bag of ramyeon away from you.

860
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,517
Is that sweet talk with ramyeon?

861
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,854
You're always cute, aren't you?

862
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,899
I've been known for being cute
since my Baekdu Mountain days.

863
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:56,118
You look happy
for the first time in a long time.

864
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,453
I am.

865
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:01,165
My parents are waiting for me at home.

866
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,167
And I have you in front of me.

867
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:07,755
All my hopes and dreams came true.

868
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,758
Who'll make your dreams come true?

869
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:18,516
How would it feel to live as a human?

870
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:29,944
I don't care if you're a human,
or a Nine-tailed Fox.

871
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,655
We're here together now.

872
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,153
If I don't stop her,

873
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:15,406
she'll try to protect me again
instead of herself.

874
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:16,532
Don't do this.

875
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:19,410
You have to understand me.

876
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:20,828
I'm going to wait for you.

877
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:21,996
Just as you waited for me.

878
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,873
This is hell,

879
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:25,875
where I'm standing right now.

880
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,334
Do you know what it means?

881
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,420
If I fail, you kill me.

882
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:32,339
If anything happens to Yeon…

883
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:33,716
How did you…

884
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,426
This was your plan all along.

885
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,136
No.

886
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,804
-I can't do this.
-No!

887
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:45,311
