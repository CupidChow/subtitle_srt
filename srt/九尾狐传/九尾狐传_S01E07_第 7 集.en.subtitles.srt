1
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,538
Hello.

2
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,584
The one from the well disappeared
as soon as he came out.

3
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,964
I found a piece of him

4
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,215
just now.

5
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,051
A piece?

6
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,178
Is it--

7
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,097
The Fox Marble--

8
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,893
the Fox Marble you gave her is gone.

9
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,898
And now, something has awoken in her body.

10
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,237
What?

11
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,800
Why is that thing

12
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:59,846
in her body?

13
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,143
She was finally reborn after 600 years.

14
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,481
The only desire she had in her life…

15
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,485
was to live an ordinary life

16
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,988
with her family day by day.

17
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,616
Why?

18
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,037
Why is that thing in Ji-a's body?

19
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,124
It's all her fate.

20
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,419
Fate?

21
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:32,962
Who says so?

22
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,673
What did she ever do?

23
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:40,386
Do you dare humiliate the heavens
in the realm of the higher beings?

24
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,139
You knew everything, didn't you?

25
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,143
That's why
you kept telling me not to see her.

26
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,230
I feel like

27
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,566
I saved up my money for 600 years

28
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,486
only to get it robbed from me.

29
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,572
So?

30
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,453
I'll have you
pay back some of the principal.

31
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,149
I took you in
when you were nothing but a defaulter.

32
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,402
How dare you bring up the principal?

33
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,001
That's enough!

34
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,803
Calm down, Yeon.

35
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,471
Honey, you too.

36
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,392
Listen up.

37
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,103
The moment Ji-a loses a day of her life,

38
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,189
this world and the afterlife will
both turn into chaos.

39
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,775
Get out of my sight. Take him away.

40
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,862
Did you see it?

41
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,242
I wonder how you feel right now.

42
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,995
I feel like I'm about to cry.

43
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,123
I had to leap over many years

44
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:36,586
to meet her like this.

45
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,969
You're having complicated thoughts.

46
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,723
-Sorry?
-"That's a strange little boy.

47
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,684
Is he not the same serpent I knew before?"

48
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,230
If I seem different, it's because
the world is a different place now.

49
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,649
Both serpents and Nine-tailed Foxes

50
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,860
only exist in video games.

51
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,988
There's no need to stick
to such archaic backdrops, is there?

52
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,743
They'll begin looking for us as well.

53
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,827
Just as I hoped.

54
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,705
I want to see them as soon as possible.

55
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,589
Despite what she says,
she doesn't mean it.

56
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,051
She may be pretty harsh,

57
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:29,222
but that old woman thought of you
like one of her own.

58
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,060
Don't try to comfort me.

59
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,813
I already feel like crying.

60
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,650
Yeon, don't get too caught up in this.

61
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,777
Just turn a blind eye and move on.

62
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,823
There's no need
to jump into an obvious pit of fire.

63
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,991
She'll get hurt if I don't go.

64
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,368
Do you wish

65
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,329
to relive that old tragedy?

66
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,124
If you get into this,

67
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,376
it'll be either you or her.

68
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,003
One of you will die.

69
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,966
Your fate and her fate
were decided as such…

70
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,637
the moment it was reborn.

71
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,394
No.

72
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,689
Ji-a won't die.

73
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,816
I promised her

74
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,236
that she'll live an ordinary life
this time.

75
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,366
I'll protect her with my life.

76
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,650
There are many moments
when a kid needs his parents,

77
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,985
more often than I realized.

78
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,613
When you take your first steps.

79
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,115
There's no one other than your parents

80
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,868
who'd be thrilled
to see you get up and walk a few steps.

81
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,371
When I was the only one
who didn't bring gimbap to a picnic.

82
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,707
After a fight, when my friend said,

83
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,168
"I'm going to tell on you to my mom!"

84
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,837
I could never win against
anyone who had a mom.

85
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,508
Why couldn't my parents be meaner to me?

86
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,802
Then could I have forgotten everything

87
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,264
and lived an ordinary life
like everyone else?

88
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,892
What made you wait
for your parents so long?

89
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,477
It's simple for me.

90
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,938
I just miss them.

91
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,121
The Fox Marble?

92
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,749
Was it that significant?

93
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,795
It was the fortune-teller, right?

94
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,548
He said something about my fate,

95
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,008
then offered to let you go
in exchange for that.

96
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,011
But still,
how could you have given it away so easily

97
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,139
as if it were some candy?

98
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,558
I couldn't lose you.

99
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,985
I'm staying here for a while.

100
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,820
You want to stay here?

101
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,697
At my house?

102
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,324
-You'll eat and sleep here?
-Yes.

103
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,326
You're very liberal for a fox.

104
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,869
Or you can come to my house.

105
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,955
That's not what I mean.
Why all of a sudden?

106
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,416
It's the least I can do for your safety.

107
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,878
Please don't make me risk my life

108
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,964
every single time I try to save you.

109
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,728
I meant if you'll be okay with the sofa.

110
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,230
If you're using yourself to negotiate,

111
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,440
I can't argue with that.

112
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,569
Why are you up anyway?
I remember putting you to bed.

113
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,780
Oh, I had a weird dream.

114
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,828
-A dream?
-I saw this little kid,

115
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,205
and he said hi to me.

116
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,459
-And?
-That's all.

117
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,339
At first, he really creeped me out,

118
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,757
but once I woke up,

119
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,801
it felt sort of nice to see him,

120
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,720
as if he were someone I knew.

121
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,487
So it is.
He's the most precious thing to you.

122
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:55,905
Your brother.

123
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,538
I'll take a cola.

124
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,459
Cola?

125
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,796
I gorged on the neighborhood doves
the last time I got drunk,

126
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,089
so I'm holding back.

127
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,256
I had a stomachache.

128
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,384
Did you leave that dove by my door?

129
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,512
Did I take it that far?

130
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,180
I don't remember anything.

131
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,015
You aren't a stray cat.

132
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,600
So did you find it?

133
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,944
These are the Tiger's Brows.

134
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,947
You can use these
to see someone's previous life?

135
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,160
But why do you look so sad?

136
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,621
-I'm not sad. I'm pissed.
-Why?

137
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,958
I can't take how
I still have human feelings in me.

138
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,336
Is it because I'm impure?

139
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,966
Right, you said your mom was a human.

140
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,387
Did she hold you
and give you piggyback rides?

141
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,306
Did she cook chicken
and give you all the meat?

142
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,810
Quit it.

143
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,731
I was just curious
what it's like to be loved.

144
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,190
Love?

145
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,373
Mom.

146
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,348
Wait here for a moment.

147
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,642
I don't want to. It's scary here.

148
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,645
I'm just going to pick some hazelnuts.

149
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,065
I want to go with you. I want to go too.

150
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,650
Why do you trouble me so much?

151
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,945
I have nothing else to live for.
Do you want to die with me? Do you?

152
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:29,934
Mom?

153
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,773
Love is something

154
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,984
that can devour you if you aren't careful.

155
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,238
The one who loves more gets eaten.

156
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,199
I don't want that.
I'd rather be the one to eat.

157
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,122
Was it Sin-ju?

158
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,960
What did he say to shake your heart,

159
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,962
and make this naive carnivore

160
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,839
bring up a word like love?

161
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,757
I'll never be shaken.

162
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,342
Even if the sky falls,

163
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,427
your enemy is my enemy too.

164
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,808
Go home. I want to be alone.

165
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,950
Seven. Eight.

166
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,414
Nine.

167
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,125
Ninety-nine points.

168
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,462
Mr. Lee and Ms. Nam only got 25 points.

169
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,049
See that?

170
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,677
According to this scientific method,

171
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,929
there's something going on between us.

172
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,892
Despite that foxes from abroad
may be more liberal than us,

173
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,019
she still kissed me when we first met.

174
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,318
Goodness, watch what you say.

175
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,153
Why would I get neutered?

176
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,448
What do you mean, I'm in heat?
You shouldn't talk like that.

177
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,701
Anyway, your mom

178
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,038
didn't sound too happy,
but she finished that samgyetang.

179
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,750
She can be mean with her words,
but she's not heartless.

180
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,251
You know, right?

181
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,795
What? You want samgyetang too?

182
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,381
You had your food
less than half an hour ago.

183
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,425
You don't remember?

184
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,595
You drive me nuts!

185
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:30,512
Hey!

186
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,072
How long are you going to stand there?

187
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,657
-All night long.
-All night?

188
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,533
Don't mind me.

189
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,203
You're staring at me with such fiery eyes.

190
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,955
How can I not mind you?

191
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,331
Then I'll watch from outside.

192
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,463
That's terrifying.

193
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,925
If you don't like anything I do,
how am I supposed to protect you?

194
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,218
Go sleep on the sofa.

195
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,345
No, I can't see you from there.

196
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,555
-Then sleep here.
-Okay.

197
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,145
I didn't mean my bed.
I just meant this room.

198
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:24,024
I'm more modern than I look.
I can't sleep on the floor. My back hurts.

199
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,609
Go down if you're scared.

200
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,528
I'm not scared.

201
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,254
Aren't you going to sleep?

202
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:46,964
I'm not sleepy.

203
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,430
This is something

204
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,932
my dad taught me long ago.

205
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,767
If you can't sleep,

206
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,187
try to imagine something
that makes you feel great.

207
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,566
Like mint chocolate ice cream?

208
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,575
For me,
it's the smell of freshly cooked rice.

209
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,289
The sound of a pencil getting sharpened.

210
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,793
A new pair of sneakers.

211
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,298
Baseball season.

212
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,176
World literature collections.

213
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,845
Puppy paws.

214
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,768
My dad's gimbap.

215
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,855
No one writes them anymore,

216
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,982
but letters.

217
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,946
Your turn.

218
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:56,909
Are you asleep?

219
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,204
Yes. I say

220
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,917
a red umbrella.

221
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,494
No!

222
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,502
What are you doing?

223
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,171
Why are you laughing?

224
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,673
Wasn't I really cool just now?

225
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,678
I moved fast like Spider-Man
and saved you.

226
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,268
The kind of human I hate the most.

227
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,897
And look at his runny nose.

228
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,108
Mister, do you like Spider-Man?

229
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,110
-No.
-Why not?

230
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,279
-I just don't.
-I like him.

231
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,572
I don't care.

232
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,574
Hey.

233
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,576
Stop talking to me.

234
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,619
I feel crappy plenty enough.

235
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,031
I woke up at 4:30 a.m.

236
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,159
It's almost done.

237
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,577
What are you doing right now?

238
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,121
-Pollack soup?
-Yes, it's pollack soup.

239
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,164
Did you burn these?

240
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,542
Incredible.

241
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,961
I wouldn't say it's burnt.
How do I put it--

242
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,172
I was making pollack soup,
but I ended up--

243
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,383
-Go get more. I used it up.
-You used it all?

244
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,472
I put sugar in that one.

245
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,266
I'll do it. You can leave.

246
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,844
Hey.

247
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,306
Did you sleep well?

248
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,977
-Yes.
-Let's eat breakfast.

249
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,814
Pollack soup is the best for hangovers.

250
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,691
You made all this alone?

251
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,317
That's not what's important.

252
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,988
-It's the thought that counts.
-That's amazing.

253
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,120
Good morning, Ms. Nam.

254
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,625
Mr. Gu, why are you here?

255
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,419
I heard you two moved in together.

256
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,630
I brought him a change of clothes,
and to check in.

257
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,632
Where do you keep bleach?

258
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,758
Bleach? Why?

259
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,136
Your sink is covered with mold.

260
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,513
I rubbed the tiles
with baking soda and vinegar,

261
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,598
but I have to remove
hair from the drain too.

262
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,601
Don't keep leftovers in the fridge.

263
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,061
It's a big pile of germs.

264
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,272
-He sounds like a mother-in-law.
-I know.

265
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,025
I'm sorry to intervene on your household,

266
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,861
but, although Mr. Lee
never has done any chores,

267
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,405
-he's a sort of a neat freak.
-What?

268
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,241
Eat your food. So where's the bleach?

269
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,494
It's in the bathroom drawer.

270
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,372
Why didn't he keep searching?
Why did he even come out?

271
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,124
Wait.

272
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,343
-Did you burn these?
-I wouldn't say I burned those.

273
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,969
I failed to control the heat.

274
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,352
Don't be acting cute about it.

275
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,689
The pollack has infested me.

276
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,317
I'm not cute. I'm over 1,000 years old.

277
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,361
-Let's eat.
-Yes, let's eat.

278
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,282
Soft-boiled eggs.

279
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,752
Let's split it.

280
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,637
Yes?

281
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,058
May I--

282
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,684
Come in.

283
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:17,813
Here.

284
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,108
-Thank you.
-Sure.

285
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,403
And Ms. Nam.

286
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,448
I may be crossing the line
telling you this,

287
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,700
but please be safe.

288
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,869
If you get hurt,

289
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,705
Mr. Lee will get hurt by two, three,

290
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,332
or even tenfold.

291
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,503
I'm so jealous of Yeon.

292
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,256
He has such a thoughtful friend.

293
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,342
He's very dear to me.

294
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,263
I promise

295
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,931
to be as safe as I can be.

296
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,353
Yeon has also become very dear to me.

297
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:04,276
-Let's go. We're going to be late.
-Okay.

298
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,653
Coming!

299
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,085
Where are you going?

300
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,837
Me? To work.

301
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,391
By work,

302
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,935
do you mean my office?

303
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,520
Yes, of course.

304
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,148
You can't come in without an ID.

305
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,360
I'm a Nine-tailed Fox.
No one can stop me. I'll manage.

306
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,988
But why are you dressed like that?

307
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,202
Like an ordinary office worker
to blend in. You don't like it?

308
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,828
It's not that I don't,

309
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,455
but only the executives wear ties.

310
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,249
-Really?
-Yes.

311
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,126
Let's just lose the tie.

312
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,629
No, I'll be an executive.

313
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,051
-Hello, Director.
-Hello, Director.

314
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,719
Hey, good work.

315
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,183
What did you do?
Did you just hypnotize them?

316
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,267
Yes.

317
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,020
Why are you a director?

318
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,981
Good-looking rich guys
always play directors in dramas.

319
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,653
So Mr. Director, what's your plan now?

320
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,197
I'll wait here.

321
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,533
Here? All day long?

322
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,118
If anything, I'm an expert at waiting.

323
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,205
I can sit here not only 24 hours,
but 24 years.

324
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,584
-Here.
-Okay.

325
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,016
Have a good day.

326
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,061
Call me if anything happens.

327
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:04,896
Sure.

328
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,989
Thanks, Yeon. For being there for me.

329
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,251
If you get into this,
it'll be either you or her.

330
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,128
One of you will die.

331
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,714
You and her fate was decided as such

332
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,091
the moment it was reborn.

333
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,804
This might be the end of my life.

334
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,857
It's not so bad.

335
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,162
I forgot to take off my nail tips.

336
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,634
Hello, I'm the new baby sitter.

337
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,473
Don't worry about everything else.
Just make sure he's fed well.

338
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,355
Today is the day.

339
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,316
The serpent will be fully grown
after today

340
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,860
with a new face and a new body.

341
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,250
TATTOO PUNISHMENT
IN JAPAN'S EDO PERIOD

342
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,756
A man in a navy suit came to see me.

343
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,467
He said there would be an accident
on March 3rd

344
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,510
at Fox Hill.

345
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,761
It was very faint,

346
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,347
but there was a trace of a mukhyeong
on his forehead.

347
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,599
Seo as in west, gyeong as in capital.

348
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,103
Tattooing the face as punishment was

349
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,356
one of the most severe sentences
which mutilated one's body.

350
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,776
Those with mukhyeong became shunned

351
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,112
and couldn't live with other people.

352
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:22,617
Seogyeong was an old name for Pyongyang.

353
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,620
SEOGYEONG

354
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,706
But why Seogyeong?

355
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,212
SEOGYEONG, MUKHYEONG

356
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,882
The leaders of the Myocheong Rebellion

357
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,968
were tattooed and exiled

358
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,512
after attempting
to move the capital to Seogyeong.

359
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,139
The Myocheong Rebellion.

360
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,892
A mob caused civil unrest
through divination and prophecies.

361
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,062
The criminals were tattooed with the word

362
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:55,108
Seogyeong or Seogyeong Rebel.

363
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,696
The bastard was a rebel.

364
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,634
Your parents weren't the target
to begin with.

365
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,845
He was after the daughter from the start.

366
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,564
Where are you?

367
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,066
I just got on his tail.

368
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,492
He's going somewhere in a rush.

369
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,328
-Alone?
-Yes, he's alone.

370
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,706
Keep your eyes on him.

371
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:56,127
So you're telling me to find a man
with a criminal's tattoo on his forehead.

372
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,587
And he's in with the serpent.

373
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,883
Yes, there must be a connection
between the serpent and Rang.

374
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,515
Damn it.

375
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,062
Did he lose his wallet or something?

376
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,242
Find the glasses.

377
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,619
Do whatever it takes to find it.

378
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,329
Glasses?

379
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,458
Who's he talking to?

380
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,046
-She's here.
-Begin the hearing.

381
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,340
Time out. Jae-hwan, show me your forehead.

382
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,175
What? Why?

383
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,514
Never mind.

384
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:51,891
Who's that guy?

385
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,893
-Who is he?
-A boyfriend?

386
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,895
-An informer, right?
-How much is the bet?

387
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,941
-It's 50,000 won.
-Tell us. Who is he?

388
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,486
I wonder. What is our relationship?

389
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:04,946
I want to know too.

390
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,155
What is that?

391
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,616
If you want to know
what that relationship is,

392
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,787
simply check your heart rate.

393
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,622
Your body doesn't lie.

394
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,628
Why is his heart racing?

395
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,589
His body could lie, I guess.

396
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,217
Did you hold hands with him?

397
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,054
We haven't held hands yet.

398
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,770
You didn't start by holding hands?

399
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,355
What did you hold?

400
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,232
Did you get a hold of a story?

401
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,610
Look at this rare item.

402
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,865
Why? What? What's with you? What?

403
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,826
I just want a good look at your forehead.

404
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,397
I know who took the glasses.

405
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,358
-Who is it?
-A little kid.

406
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,068
A kid?

407
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,324
You must've been drunk yesterday.

408
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,621
He's not family. He saved me from the zoo.

409
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,207
-So he's your savior.
-Precisely.

410
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,917
He tore the zookeeper in half.

411
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,545
You'll meet him soon enough.

412
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,358
Bye.

413
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,734
Did you think I wouldn't catch on?

414
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,127
Anyway, make yourself available tonight.

415
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,171
The president invited us to dinner.

416
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,422
Where is he treating us?

417
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,257
We're going to his house.

418
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,885
His house? That's so uncomfortable.

419
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,930
Uncomfortable? How so?

420
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,474
Only his closest associates
get invited there,

421
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,518
and he went out of his way to invite us.

422
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,520
Do you get what that means? Do you?

423
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,191
Anyway, forget it.
You're all eating samgyetang.

424
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,571
What's this?

425
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,533
I think there's a mistake.

426
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,827
We were about to order samgyetang.

427
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,454
Please enjoy. It's on the house.

428
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,456
-On the house?
-On the house?

429
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,127
What's with the VIP treatment, Ms. Bok?

430
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,129
I heard we had a very important guest.

431
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:36,300
Well, it's not an overstatement
when I say I brought

432
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,137
eighty percent of our office
to this restaurant, right?

433
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,473
You might go out of business

434
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,434
if you keep giving VIP's such as myself
so much free food.

435
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,061
Are you low on magnesium?

436
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,231
One of your eyes is twitching.

437
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:53,985
Please enjoy.

438
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:58,281
There are joyful and sorrowful legends
in each and every ingredient

439
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,116
used in our traditional dishes.

440
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,993
Just as the chef here.

441
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,623
Isn't she so eloquent?

442
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,417
Let's eat. Eat up.

443
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,586
You get such special treatment

444
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,505
only because you have me as the boss,
you good-for-nothings.

445
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,303
What have you been looking at?

446
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:21,929
At what?

447
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:24,974
It's nothing.

448
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,267
Come on.

449
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,440
Hey, it's that guy.

450
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,567
It's him, right?

451
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,071
It is. You sly fox.

452
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,282
Come and join us.

453
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,539
Me?

454
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,125
What a small city, right?

455
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,003
We all ran into one another
by coincidence.

456
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,463
It's not a coincidence.

457
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,215
Then why are you here?

458
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,467
Because Ms. Nam is here.

459
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,178
What's going on between you two?

460
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,179
Jae-hwan.

461
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,807
She doesn't like me,
but I've been hitting on her.

462
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,309
A crush?

463
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,311
While you let your looks go to waste?

464
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,189
It's true he's hitting on me,
but it goes both ways.

465
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,042
Why were you tailing me?

466
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,879
Why did Yeon put you on me?

467
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,218
Hey, bastard.

468
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:46,013
Do you think I'm the same little brat
that used to follow Yeon around?

469
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,599
I know that you aren't.

470
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:50,893
And I know

471
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,813
you can kill me right here
without leaving a trace.

472
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,776
Then tell me. Why did you follow me?

473
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,778
I'm sure

474
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,447
you know that best.

475
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,994
Are you playing games with me?

476
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,454
I lived my life for Mr. Lee Yeon.

477
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,374
And I lived thanks to him.

478
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,584
I mean that

479
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,005
I won't do anything to harm him
even if I was to die here.

480
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,854
Is that your loyalty or sympathy?

481
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,315
Or are you just plain stupid?

482
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,318
It's the same reason

483
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,821
why you can't seem to leave him alone.

484
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,451
We like him.

485
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,626
May I ask what you do for a living?

486
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,669
I don't work.

487
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,505
I knew it. I knew that was the case.

488
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,132
He follows Ji-a around

489
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:06,218
because he has too much free time
and doesn't know any better.

490
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:10,806
Can I break his ribs?

491
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,226
No. Calm down.

492
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,813
So are you really unemployed?

493
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,274
He's a landlord.

494
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,276
You own a building?

495
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,653
It's worth around 30 billion won.

496
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,573
Me?

497
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,370
Do you have any siblings?

498
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,747
-I have a younger brother--
-Brother-in-law!

499
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,253
Then how old are you?

500
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,631
I'm not that young.

501
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,967
-A thousand--
-He's older than he looks.

502
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,055
-Been there, done that, right?
-What do you mean?

503
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,225
He's asking if you've divorced as he has.

504
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:55,351
I see.

505
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,853
The guy who was married
for less than a year--

506
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:58,979
You're right!

507
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,815
So you've heard.

508
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,860
He doesn't have such a history.

509
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,238
He's like the main character
of a fantasy drama.

510
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,202
What's with him?

511
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,870
His routine. It's his thing.

512
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,373
Mr. Choi.

513
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,919
-Mr. Choi.
-Just eat.

514
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,513
I need to be somewhere.

515
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,191
Kid, are you okay?

516
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,409
You're so pretty.

517
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,619
I'm pretty?

518
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,747
Kids these days have really bad eyesight
because of smartphones.

519
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,377
-A eunuch.
-What?

520
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,420
What's a eunuch?

521
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,840
-Oh, it's a very sad situation.
-No, it's not!

522
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,301
-I can't show you--
-Don't do that around a kid.

523
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,219
He called me a eunuch.

524
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,096
Kids never lie.

525
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,561
Kid, are you ill?

526
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,566
You're scary.

527
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,111
-What?
-Your face is

528
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,030
really scary.

529
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,291
Is that the vibe I give off?

530
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,461
I just heard that kids never lie.

531
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,883
Hey, you're here.

532
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,054
-Where's Sin-ju?
-He's still breathing.

533
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:58,307
This wasn't necessary.
You should have just come to me.

534
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,352
You must adore him a lot.

535
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,939
Much more than the little brother
who's been in puberty

536
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,440
since the Joseon Dynasty.

537
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,321
Why did you tail me?

538
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,824
We both never beat around the bush, so,

539
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,578
why the serpent?

540
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,497
You finally caught on.

541
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,333
There are millions of ways to hurt me.

542
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,544
So why did you choose that?

543
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:30,089
Well, I wanted to see how it'll be
if history repeated itself.

544
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,590
I have a soft spot for drama.

545
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,842
Does it have something on you?

546
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,638
It does.

547
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,432
It's more of a deal
since I'm getting something in return.

548
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,979
Listen well.

549
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,649
There are certain beings
you should never make deals with.

550
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,025
I need to make a living too.

551
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,360
It's not too late to stop.

552
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,656
If you don't,
you'll pay a terrible price later on.

553
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,537
If I was ever in a situation,

554
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,081
where my life was in real danger,

555
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,834
would you come and save me?

556
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,716
You can save yourself.

557
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,346
Having fun with your first love recently?

558
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,725
But would she still stick around
if she found out

559
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,727
everything that happened in her past life?

560
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,358
If you lay a finger on her,

561
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,070
I'll really kill you this time.

562
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:47,207
Mr. Lee, I found that little boy.

563
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,712
I'll gladly let you kill me.

564
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,303
Let Sin-ju go.

565
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,725
You owe his life to me.

566
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,497
Mr. Lee.

567
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,342
Give me the glasses.

568
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,927
No, these are my magical glasses!

569
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:57,945
I don't go easy on kids.

570
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,827
Stop it. I hate it when people cry.

571
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:10,290
I would've killed you
if this was long ago.

572
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,627
I'll let you off
since the birth rate is low these days.

573
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,149
Come on, no way.

574
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,943
This can't be.

575
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,866
A black dog?

576
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,951
Yay! I'm so excited!

577
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,286
Faster!

578
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,333
Geomdoong, no.

579
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,431
I'll never love
such an insignificant thing again.

580
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:08,974
I'll never--

581
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,204
Why did you follow me?

582
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,830
Mister, are you Spider-Man?

583
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,793
You moved quickly just like him.

584
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,836
I honestly hate kids like you.

585
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,088
Then why did you buy me chocolate bread?

586
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,800
I'm paying my debt back.

587
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,802
"Take this, get lost."
Something like that.

588
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,846
A net? Like a hairnet?

589
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,349
And he seems stupid too.

590
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,019
Why did you have to be reborn as a human?

591
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,505
Let's go inside.

592
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,198
Ms. Nam, come on.

593
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,243
-Come quickly.
-Okay.

594
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,998
There's even a second floor.

595
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,710
I wonder how much this house is.

596
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,628
Why? Are you going to buy one?

597
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,257
It's not bad,
but it's too far from the subway station.

598
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,466
Goodness.

599
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,224
I can't believe
I'm seeing a bladder cherry here in Seoul.

600
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,020
This is a bladder cherry?
It looks like a lantern.

601
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,063
We used to pick the insides out

602
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,149
to make a flute out of these.

603
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,985
-These make sounds?
-Of course.

604
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:29,740
Mom used to scold me, saying that
snakes will appear if I blew on it.

605
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,786
Don't touch that.

606
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,294
It's very special to me.

607
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,503
Of course, I'm sorry.

608
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,798
There's just two rules to follow
in my house.

609
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,842
First, don't touch the bladder cherry.

610
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,179
-And no flutes.
-Yes, we don't want snakes.

611
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,515
Second, don't ever go up
to the second floor.

612
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,017
Is somebody there?

613
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,936
No, I live here alone.

614
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,521
And the caterers.

615
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,442
Just do as you're told.

616
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:06,526
You must be hungry.

617
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,532
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes?

618
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,533
Water.

619
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,869
-What?
-Water.

620
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:16,954
"Water."

621
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,212
Here.

622
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,380
The cap.

623
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:27,965
"The cap."

624
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,345
You want me to feed you?

625
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:34,972
I'm wounded.

626
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,562
Here.

627
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:53,657
Where's Ms. Nam?

628
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,992
A dinner occasion.

629
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,493
Shouldn't you be there?

630
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,745
She's with her colleagues.
I'll see her later.

631
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,751
Where's the fried chicken?

632
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,878
Right, the fried chicken.

633
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:09,840
It's on its way.

634
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,009
-One garlic fried chicken.
-Drumsticks.

635
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,597
-Did you order just regular?
-Yes.

636
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,224
You're really--

637
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,937
I'll let you off. That's good too.

638
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,566
Go feed the dog before the chicken comes.

639
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:28,984
Okay.

640
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,695
Wait.

641
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,197
Are you sure you're hurt?

642
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,825
Are you pretending just to boss me around?

643
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,118
I'm hurt physically

644
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,454
and emotionally.

645
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,582
Exactly. What did I tell you?

646
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,792
That necklace thief was suspicious.

647
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,878
Don't call her a thief.

648
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,212
She has a name. It's Yu-ri.

649
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,797
Yu-ri or whatever,

650
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,300
Rang is just using her to make use of you.

651
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:57,179
We just got off to a bad start,
but our relationship got 99 points.

652
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,308
You don't trust me. Here.

653
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,481
I checked our compatibility by name.

654
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,068
KI, GU, YU, SIN, RI, JU

655
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,778
NAM, LEE, JI, YEON, A

656
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,823
Nam Ji-a and Lee Yeon, "25 points?"

657
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,785
My back, my head,
my legs, and my broken heart.

658
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,829
I'm doing this again. This can't be.

659
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,794
Let's all make a toast.

660
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:34,174
Urban Legends team, keep the ratings up,
and stay on air for a long time.

661
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,385
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it!

662
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,640
-Tell him that story.
-When we went to Gonjiam,

663
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:44,726
I had a cross, a rosary, and a talisman,
the whole lot.

664
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,728
He even had a box of calming pills.

665
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,523
Of course, he was completely ready.
Even so,

666
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,192
his camera began to shake
as shooting started.

667
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,194
He almost got killed by Ji-a.

668
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,823
That's when I realized
humans can be much scarier than ghosts.

669
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,201
Ji-a has always been bold.

670
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,204
I caught that during the interview
and made sure she worked here.

671
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,289
I remember that. You said,

672
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,126
"You have to come work for us
no matter what."

673
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,086
I remember a story too.

674
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:14,422
It was when we were at that retreat.

675
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,050
We got there
and the microphone broke, so--

676
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,261
Were we ever at a retreat together?

677
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,096
Yes, we have.

678
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,060
Anyway, do you believe
in urban legends and ghost stories?

679
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,357
Long ago, I almost died once.

680
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,652
But I survived miraculously.

681
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,238
What I met back then wasn't a human.

682
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,449
Then what was it?

683
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:44,995
A miracle.

684
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,788
Gosh.

685
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,211
Where's the bathroom?

686
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,839
Straight down the hall.

687
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,048
I'll be back.

688
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:04,681
Sir, we once went to the awards ceremony…

689
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,066
Is somebody on the second floor?

690
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,454
I must have misheard.

691
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,407
What am I doing in someone else's house?

692
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,549
A nail tip?

693
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,201
I must be a champagne kind of guy.

694
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,079
-Stop him.
-That's enough, Mr. Choi.

695
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,124
How insolent of you.
Champagne isn't even hard liquor.

696
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,126
What's taking Ji-a so long?

697
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,796
-Should I go look for her?
-No, you're a guest. Stay here.

698
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,092
Return soon.

699
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:07,947
Come in.

700
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:09,342
Hey.

701
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,302
What time will you be done?

702
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,638
In about half an hour.

703
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,890
-Are you still at the animal hospital?
-Yes.

704
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:18,059
Give me the address. I'll be there.

705
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:22,063
No, Jae-hwan, Sae-rom, and I are
going to grab a cab.

706
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,566
Okay, then. See you at home.

707
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,234
See you later.

708
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,199
Sir.

709
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,076
The second floor is off-limits.

710
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,287
I'm sorry.

711
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,707
But is somebody in this room?

712
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,168
I heard something in there.

713
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,628
Probably the wind. I left the window open.

714
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,255
I see.

715
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,799
-Let's go eat some dessert.
-Okay.

716
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,083
Why are you crying?

717
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,838
I haven't seen you this happy in ages.

718
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,471
Sure.

719
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,057
Take a good long look.

720
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,392
And only try to remember me like this.

721
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:46,231
-You sound like someone about to leave.
-Leave? Where to?

722
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:48,816
Live long.

723
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,403
And be as happy as you can be

724
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,239
while Ms. Nam is alive.

725
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:56,866
Okay.

726
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,204
It's a misconception.
Ji-a, you're here. Are ghosts bad?

727
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,914
Is that why they're exorcised?

728
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,708
In that case, they should be arrested.

729
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,877
That's my take, sir.

730
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,754
I believe we're in a community.

731
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:13,633
It doesn't matter if they're ghosts
who have supernatural powers.

732
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,010
When we run into them,

733
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,097
when we meet them,
we should thank them.

734
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,140
"Thank you for letting us make a living.

735
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,810
Please do more weird stuff for our sake."

736
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,396
The least we can do is
ask them for such a favor.

737
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:37,490
You picked this up at his place?

738
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,242
-Yes.
-It's gross.

739
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,160
It's a glue-on nail tip.

740
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,245
Looks pretty cheap.

741
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,038
Whose is it?

742
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,540
It wasn't you or me.

743
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:48,459
The caterers had clean nails too.

744
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,878
And his wife passed away a decade ago.

745
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,797
You should ask

746
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,215
if he's seeing anyone.

747
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:55,675
To the president?

748
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:59,554
How will you get through life
with a mind like that?

749
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:03,808
It'd make more sense
if he had a secret hobby.

750
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:07,061
Doing nail art?
What kind of a hobby is that?

751
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,155
Your rice is fully cooked.

752
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,042
You're home.

753
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:32,837
Did you make rice?

754
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,088
I already ate.

755
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:37,467
I know that. But you said you like
the smell of freshly cooked rice.

756
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,594
When it comes to cooking, I'm--

757
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,429
I can at least make rice.

758
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,559
So this is how it feels

759
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,978
to come home to the scent
of freshly cooked rice.

760
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:52,231
I'll let you smell this every day
while I stay here.

761
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:55,401
Here.

762
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,530
-What's this?
-I picked it up on the way.

763
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,952
-Mint chocolate chip?
-I'll go get changed.

764
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,753
I thought you picked up recyclables.

765
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,263
What do you usually do at night?

766
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:27,809
Don't you enjoy American TV?

767
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,771
I also read books and watch the news.

768
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,857
I usually watch movies.

769
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:37,151
Shall we?

770
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,154
Should we?

771
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,782
-What's that?
-What is that?

772
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:57,880
It's over here.

773
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:01,175
Hey, is there a way out?

774
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,177
This is no joke, really.

775
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,555
What people said on the internet was true.

776
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:08,391
Did you get that on camera? Did you?

777
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,615
Why? Is the movie boring?

778
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:28,953
No, it's fun.

779
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:34,792
So much so that
I want time to stop right now.

780
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:41,299
Me too.

781
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:45,321
For me,
it's the smell of freshly cooked rice.

782
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:47,323
A new pair of sneakers.

783
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,233
Put these on and look in the mirror.

784
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,403
You'll find what you wanted to know.

785
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,374
New sneakers.

786
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,544
I have no idea what women like.

787
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,600
Excuse me-- Darn it.

788
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:03,441
What?

789
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:06,193
I sent your woman a gift.

790
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,946
It's a thing called the Tiger's Brows.

791
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:18,039
LEE YEON

792
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,334
How silly.

793
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,712
This woman means nothing to me.

794
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:51,132
Don't you think it was me
who used her to lure you out?

795
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:52,216
Yeon.

796
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,043
Did you see it?

797
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:33,090
Answer me. Did you?

798
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,143
Will you please look at me?

799
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,781
What in the world…

800
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:00,826
did you see?

801
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:03,454
I was

802
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,749
killed in my previous life.

803
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:12,713
You…

804
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:15,966
killed me.

805
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:20,012
You only wanted

806
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:23,265
to capture the serpent.

807
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:26,519
Lee Yeon.

808
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:32,817
You used me…

809
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:36,654
as a sacrifice.

810
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,699
If I'm reborn,

811
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:25,202
I want to try living as a human.

812
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,538
I won't let you win anymore.

813
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:29,832
Where is the serpent right now?

814
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:34,295
From birth, you've always been
nothing but a sacrifice offered to me.

815
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:35,671
She'll be my bride.

816
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:38,132
What are you most afraid of?

817
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:39,300
The Fox Hill.

818
01:09:39,925 --> 01:09:42,595
Starting now,
I'm going to do everything I can.

819
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,555
Mom!

820
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,182
A little bit.

821
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,558
Hold out just a bit longer.

822
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:53,647
