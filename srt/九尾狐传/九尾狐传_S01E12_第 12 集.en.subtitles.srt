1
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,465
Mom.

2
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,219
Dad.

3
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,771
Are you really here?

4
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,315
Are you really my parents?

5
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,833
Mom.

6
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,087
Don't you recognize me?

7
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,717
Dad.

8
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,303
I'm Ji-a, your daughter.

9
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,729
Right.

10
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,775
It has been over 20 years.

11
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,987
My daughter.

12
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,074
You've all grown.

13
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,207
But you're still a crybaby.

14
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,877
Do you

15
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,755
recognize my face?

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,884
What kind of a parent wouldn't recognize
their own child's face?

17
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,805
Mom.

18
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,725
I'm sorry for making you wait so long.

19
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,103
Mommy is sorry.

20
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,816
I missed you.

21
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,196
I missed you so much.

22
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,460
You brothers have done a great job.

23
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,880
She'll finally sleep in peace
after 20 long years.

24
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,548
If I said I'd do it, I do it.

25
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,674
And Mr. Lee's contract?

26
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,467
-It's gone.
-You're so cool.

27
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,677
Go on.

28
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,095
The world is so unfair.

29
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,556
You're good-looking,
and you're good at everything.

30
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,557
How dazzling.

31
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,023
Have you made up with Lee Yeon?

32
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,401
I wouldn't say we've made up.
I just let him off.

33
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,654
But I don't like him.

34
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,281
Why not?

35
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:22,160
He has been bullying you for ages.

36
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,205
You won't live with him, will you?

37
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,706
Do you think I'm crazy?

38
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,668
Don't forget about me
just because you two made up.

39
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,961
What if I do?

40
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,463
I'll bite you.

41
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,758
I've raised you into an awful woman.

42
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,514
5 YEARS AGO

43
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,038
Darn it.

44
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,665
That's how you do it.

45
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,669
If someone bites you, you bite them back.

46
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,422
The world will be cruel to anyone
who won't scream when they're bitten.

47
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,050
-Who asked you to save me?
-You're right.

48
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:23,263
I never asked, but he took me in,
fed me, made me get attached,

49
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,682
then when he got sick of me,
he just threw me out.

50
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,101
I hate those kinds too.

51
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,940
So when you're done, get out of my house.

52
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,068
What?

53
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,386
I told you not to follow me.

54
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,213
Swing it.

55
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,468
Again.

56
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,261
Right here, here,

57
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,097
and here are the vital spots.
Remember those.

58
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,435
Again.

59
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,770
Again.

60
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,981
Again. Again.

61
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,789
Mr. Lee.

62
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,876
I stabbed his vital point in one try.

63
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,337
Well done.

64
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,269
Do you want some jokbal tonight?

65
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,187
No.

66
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,357
That dish is tainted
with my awful history.

67
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,526
Instead of jokbal, how's bossam?

68
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,154
No, jokbal feels perfect for tonight.

69
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,994
Stop that!

70
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,456
Let's get half and half.

71
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,542
Half and half it is.

72
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,967
I'M LOOKING FOR MY MISSING MOM

73
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,718
My goodness.

74
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,929
What is all this?

75
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,643
At first, I handed out flyers.

76
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,395
But no one would believe me.

77
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:22,608
That's why I decided to become
a TV show producer to find you myself.

78
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,778
And see? I found you.

79
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,323
Ji-a.

80
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,535
I'm so proud of you.

81
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,957
How are you feeling? Are you in any pain?

82
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,042
We're completely fine.
Don't worry about us.

83
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,422
But let's go see a doctor just in case.

84
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,049
This is the music box from that day.

85
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,470
That accident at Fox Hill

86
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,097
feels just like yesterday.

87
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:57,477
Everything seems the same.
I can't believe 20 years have passed.

88
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,688
Where have you been all this time?

89
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,648
I'm not sure.

90
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:08,279
It just feels like
I woke up from a very long sleep.

91
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,781
-And you too, Dad?
-Yes.

92
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,911
In that case,

93
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:16,996
what's this?

94
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,623
Didn't you write this?

95
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,709
"Ji-a, why won't you come and save us?"

96
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:27,340
There was one time
when I woke up from my sleep.

97
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:31,093
A sharp-looking young man with fair skin
showed up and said

98
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,680
I can meet you if I write this down.

99
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,390
He must have helped us.

100
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,228
It wasn't him. It was Yeon.

101
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,063
Yeon saved you two.

102
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,856
The guy we just met?

103
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,358
Yes.

104
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,609
What's he like?

105
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,780
Someone who only cares about me.

106
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,326
He waited for me for a long time,

107
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,247
and he doesn't hesitate
to risk his life for me.

108
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,915
Is he your boyfriend?

109
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,171
My daughter really has grown all up.

110
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,091
I'm so heartbroken.

111
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,342
When you get a boyfriend,

112
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,387
I wanted to be the first one to know
and nag you a lot.

113
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,305
Do it! I really want to hear you nag.

114
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,686
There were so many things
I wanted to do for you.

115
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,649
You can make up for everything
you haven't done for me starting now.

116
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:28,818
I will.

117
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,904
I'm proud of you, my baby.

118
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:36,617
You grew up into a strong woman
and even became a TV producer.

119
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,464
JI-A

120
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,639
A video call?

121
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,475
I thought my little puppy
might be too scared to sleep alone.

122
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,352
What? Your puppy?

123
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,563
Let's do everything that couples do.

124
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,857
Give each other nicknames,
get matching rings,

125
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,569
and get all lovey-dovey on the phone.

126
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,487
Lovey-dovey?

127
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,575
Stuff like this.

128
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,453
You're in a great mood.

129
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,414
Yes, I am. So great that I could just fly.

130
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,625
But please don't fly away.

131
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,876
Your puppy will cry.

132
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,715
Thank you, Yeon,

133
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,302
for keeping your promise
that you'll bring my parents back.

134
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,430
I wish all of your nights were like this.

135
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,350
I'll make sure it stays this way.

136
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,144
Ji-a, let's sleep!

137
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,812
I have to go.

138
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,148
Goodnight.

139
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,983
Goodnight. Dream about me.

140
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,259
That was close.
Those crazy Nine-tailed Foxes!

141
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,237
I was just about to call you.

142
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,574
I was 99 percent there,
but those jerks tricked me in the end.

143
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,369
Yes, it's just a small mishap.

144
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,871
You lost the bladder cherries
and the hostages.

145
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,541
Thanks to you,
I don't have many cards left.

146
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,711
I can bring everything back.
Please give me your trust.

147
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,587
That being said,

148
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,506
where are you now?

149
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:58,718
I'm on the street.

150
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,177
I can hear everything.

151
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,972
I can hear your troubled heart
over the phone.

152
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,433
Come inside.

153
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,851
Then you'll find out

154
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,145
if what's waiting for you is life

155
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:10,813
or death.

156
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,120
I'm not going to die. Never.
I did so much to keep myself alive.

157
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,413
I won't die. I won't.

158
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,330
I won't die.

159
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,084
Why am I here?

160
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,833
Welcome.

161
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,256
Serpent.

162
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,968
I like Terry, rather than the serpent,

163
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,595
the name you first called me.

164
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,683
So, it was you.

165
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,269
How did you get me here?

166
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,520
I didn't.

167
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,105
You called me.

168
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,192
-What?
-This is your dream,

169
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,694
and it means we're connected.

170
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,238
Connected or not,
I'm not doing this with you.

171
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,159
Our fates are linked.

172
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,495
Get lost. Get out of my dream!

173
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,835
Take a good look.

174
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,753
I'm you.

175
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,700
I have to catch the serpent,

176
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,832
but in a way that Ji-a won't get hurt.

177
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,294
In that case,

178
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,547
where should I begin?

179
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,309
It's me, Lee Yeon.

180
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,938
I'm also not glad to talk to you.

181
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,692
I called to see if you needed
anything like the bladder cherries.

182
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:25,859
Never mind, then.

183
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,613
Is that so?

184
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,491
Then come and see me.

185
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,704
Fine.

186
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,913
Let's do this.

187
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,541
All I need is the bladder cherry.

188
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,293
Be it the serpent or Lee Yeon.

189
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,670
Who gives a damn anyway?

190
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,593
I CAME RUNNING TO YOU

191
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,761
Ta-da.

192
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,221
What is this?

193
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,684
It's a new phone.

194
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,187
Someone sent it to me
thinking I won't have time to get one.

195
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,107
Sent it to you?
Can cell phones be delivered?

196
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,568
They bring it over within an hour.

197
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,194
That's amazing.

198
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,571
Okay, then.

199
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,117
Press this to call me.

200
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,161
MY DAUGHTER, MY MOM

201
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,584
Don't pick up any calls
that aren't from me.

202
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,085
And don't let anyone in either.

203
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,754
Don't worry about us and go.

204
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,926
It'll take us a while
to get used to the year 2020,

205
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,887
but your parents are not kids.

206
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,099
Please depend on me. You can do that.

207
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,393
Ji-a.

208
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,146
Let's have a meal with that guy.

209
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,481
Who?

210
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:47,816
Yeon?

211
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,818
Fate? A connection?

212
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,030
He showed up in your dream and said that?

213
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,783
I don't think it was just a dream.

214
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:01,497
My face was covered in awful scales.

215
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,542
If something inside of me is calling him,

216
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,877
what should I do?

217
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,006
Why me?

218
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,468
I'll make sure I catch him.

219
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,973
Do you trust me?

220
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:22,976
I do.

221
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,360
Are you free this evening?

222
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:32,945
Tonight?

223
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,781
My mom and dad want to meet

224
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,616
my boyfriend.

225
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,286
That's me.

226
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,424
Could you look at this cat?

227
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,884
I was on my way out.

228
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:58,971
Is it hurt?

229
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,348
It's a stray cat.
It must be caught in a trap.

230
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,600
I'll pay for everything.
Please take a look.

231
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,688
There aren't many young men like you.

232
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,439
I'll see it.

233
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,692
Right here.

234
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,575
Did it hurt? Did it?

235
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,618
It's okay. It's all right.

236
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,705
Luckily, the wound isn't that deep.

237
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,081
Really?

238
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,168
Little kitty, who did this to you?

239
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:40,929
What?

240
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,349
Who? Who did this?

241
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:50,981
Why?

242
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,192
Does the cat talk?

243
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,905
Where did you find this cat again?

244
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,865
At the trail out front.

245
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,040
He's the serpent.

246
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,251
So this is

247
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,670
the serpent.

248
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,675
It's lotus leaf short ribs.

249
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,302
It's a good day, so this is on me.

250
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,304
Thank you.

251
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,306
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

252
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,060
Eat up.

253
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,938
-So what's the job?
-Wait.

254
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,148
Tell us the payment first.

255
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,025
We don't come that cheap, you know.

256
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,820
I'll throw in an extra zero
on the minimum wage.

257
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,906
85,900 won?

258
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,866
What should we do first?

259
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:47,037
I need you to do
what you TV industry folk do best.

260
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,914
I need details on someone.

261
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:49,873
Who?

262
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:52,918
The serpent.

263
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,338
Look for fables, legends,
folk tales, fairy tales,

264
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,714
and even comic books.

265
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,093
Bring me everything that's written
on the serpent.

266
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,428
Why?

267
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,596
A weakness.

268
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,936
I'm going to find his weakness.

269
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,192
Why is your hand shaking so much?

270
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,366
A vet shouldn't be like that.

271
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,663
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

272
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,758
You'll die today if you touch that.

273
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,480
You know who I am, right?

274
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,985
Gu Sin-ju, Lee Yeon's right-hand man.

275
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,238
You can understand animals.

276
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,658
What do you want?

277
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,619
I'm playing Catch the Tail
with Lee Yeon right now.

278
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,288
"Catch the Tail"?

279
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,581
That being said…

280
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,544
will you serve as a good hostage?

281
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,213
Just kill me.

282
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,550
If I must become Mr. Lee's weakness,

283
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,302
I'd rather die.

284
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,892
You're that type.

285
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,395
I'm not afraid.

286
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,730
Kill me.

287
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,523
It's a sort of hypnosis.

288
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,322
One day,

289
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,075
when the serpent in her calls,

290
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,409
you will…

291
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,931
Were we killed by that serpent
in our past lives?

292
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,225
-And he's our intern?
-Yes.

293
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,644
Man, this is so wrong.

294
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,356
Why are all good looking men in Korea
either Nine-tailed Foxes or a serpent?

295
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,565
Sorry about that.

296
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,569
-Then you three can talk.
-Where are you going?

297
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,656
I need to hand in the edited footage
then I'm going home.

298
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,950
I'm getting groceries with Dad.

299
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,076
Do you want a ride?

300
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:31,993
It's okay.

301
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,496
I'll see you at home.
Make yourself pretty.

302
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,003
We'll get going too.

303
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,046
Sit down.

304
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,048
Now.

305
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:49,803
Why--

306
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,932
What I'm about to say is more important.

307
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,101
I need some tips.

308
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:03,358
What's the best way
to impress someone's parents?

309
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,867
-Over here, Mom.
-Okay.

310
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,160
That's so pretty.

311
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,704
Is it seasoned well?

312
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,747
-Open up.
-I'll clean that.

313
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,632
How is it?

314
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,343
I think you're doing this on purpose.

315
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,678
What if I undo one more?

316
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,263
Stop that, and get back in there.

317
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,312
This one? Do I look okay?

318
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,730
-This is it.
-This one?

319
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,610
So parents like this style?
Thanks, part-timers.

320
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,369
You're here.

321
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,663
-You're here.
-Hello.

322
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,040
You met them yesterday.

323
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,542
Let me make a formal introduction.
I am Lee Yeon.

324
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,753
It's a pleasure.

325
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,130
I asked you to come
so we could eat together.

326
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,798
Then let's go in.

327
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,050
Wait, one second.

328
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,303
You know the drill, right?

329
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,554
"Thank you for having me.

330
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,722
This is a small gift."

331
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,933
Red ginseng,
traditional snacks, or cosmetics.

332
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,018
You mean that I should flaunt my wealth.

333
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,396
Thank you very much for having me.

334
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,733
And a little something from me.

335
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,651
A lighter?

336
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,945
I don't smoke.

337
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,410
It's my favorite model too.

338
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,829
Feel free to use it.

339
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,293
He's quite generous.

340
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,962
Let's go inside.

341
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,005
-Please come in.
-All right.

342
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:49,965
Get in there.

343
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,474
It has been a while
since I cooked with Ji-a.

344
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,060
I don't know if you'll like it.

345
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,813
To be honest, it doesn't suit my taste.

346
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,982
The bulgogi is a bit salty.

347
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,068
It's good. Everything tastes great.

348
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,113
You're such an honest man.

349
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,200
When her parents ask something,
keep the answer honest and short.

350
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,326
Answer honestly.

351
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,786
How old are you?

352
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,871
You'll probably be shocked.

353
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,124
How old are you?

354
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,710
I may not look like it,
but I'm a lot older than--

355
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,380
He's 36 in Korean age.

356
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,425
You've sort of lived abroad
for a long time, right?

357
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,135
You studied abroad?

358
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,929
We also met when we were studying abroad.

359
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,681
Did you go to college abroad?

360
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,974
I didn't go to college.

361
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,603
Well, you don't have to go to college.

362
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,396
Not even high school.

363
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,689
I was never educated.

364
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,485
What do you do for a living?

365
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,070
Nothing, really.

366
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,075
You're quite the liberal fellow.

367
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,829
But I have a lot of money.
You saw how I got you a car.

368
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,232
What can I get you?

369
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,693
Before I order,

370
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,445
isn't it a bit loud?

371
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:37,989
Pardon?

372
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,451
I'm so sleepy.

373
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,578
I want to sleep.

374
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,175
You must be the Snail Bride.

375
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,135
Why are you here?

376
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,638
I'm here to eat. Take my order.

377
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,182
I--

378
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,600
What would you like?

379
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,769
What does Lee Yeon usually get?

380
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,273
I'll have the same thing he usually does.

381
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,278
Sir, you're a professor at a university,

382
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,197
and you're a doctor, right?

383
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:25,036
She's a TV producer who graduated from
the most prestigious university in Korea.

384
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,415
Come to think about it,
I have nothing to brag about.

385
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,376
But

386
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,129
I really like her.

387
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,967
What do you like about Ji-a?

388
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,391
I've been through a lot in life.

389
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,685
Much more than you can imagine.

390
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,271
Life has been pretty tough.

391
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,773
But isn't it strange?

392
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,485
Eating a meal next to Ji-a

393
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:01,364
makes me feel as if
I've become a part of this family.

394
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,410
And this is just insanely comforting.

395
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,414
I feel that way too.

396
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,836
I lived a lonely and tough life
in this house without you two,

397
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,546
then realized this after I met him.

398
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,886
Everyone lives under the shadow
of someone they can rely on.

399
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,805
And I want to be someone like that too.

400
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,563
You both grew up well.

401
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,818
It's a bit salty, but please enjoy. Okay?

402
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,862
Thank you.

403
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,038
You're a good cook.

404
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,876
What do you want from Mr. Lee?

405
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,462
He endured many years in loneliness,

406
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:00,173
and he's just about to be happy. So why?

407
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,056
There are many versions
of the Tail of the Snail Bride.

408
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,225
However,

409
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,977
every single version ends in a tragedy.

410
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,563
It's just like our story.

411
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,648
This is

412
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,068
a story that will only be finished
after one of us dies.

413
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,240
Now, listen to me.

414
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,033
You.

415
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,171
Look at her. Isn't she pretty?

416
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,382
When she was 100 days old.

417
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,633
She's so cute.

418
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,802
Her hands and feet are so tiny.

419
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,972
But this little kid was
already short-tempered.

420
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,223
Who does she take after?

421
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,224
Not me.

422
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,227
The one who feels self-conscious
is the culprit.

423
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,229
She got her personality and my looks.

424
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,940
Hey, see what I mean?

425
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,235
You can't share
your daughter's photo like that.

426
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,237
I couldn't find a day you looked bad.

427
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,239
That's me.

428
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,074
Oh my.

429
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,785
-Ta-da! Look.
-What is this?

430
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,996
You can't show him this one, Dad.

431
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,581
What's wrong? It's cute.

432
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,625
You were cute. Don't worry.

433
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,252
Just look at the cute ones.

434
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,092
Damn it.

435
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:34,851
I want to kill him.

436
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,533
You're here.

437
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,372
I thought you only had Americanos.
You're having a latte today?

438
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,462
It's to remember.

439
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,714
I won't see another day like this.

440
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:54,138
I never knew my bitter life could

441
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,724
could be as smooth as this latte.

442
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,851
Were you that happy?

443
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:04,649
I daydreamed for a moment

444
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,402
as I looked over your albums.

445
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,238
I imagined marrying you.

446
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,992
One day, we'll have a baby
who looks just like us.

447
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,370
We'll eat the gimbap I make
by the Han River,

448
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,455
then we'll end up fighting.

449
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,999
-But I'll end up losing.
-Yes.

450
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,377
I imagined this immortal body

451
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,005
turning old with gray hair.

452
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,300
Even then, you'll still be by my side.

453
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,639
If I were a person--

454
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,904
How nice would it be
to be an ordinary person?

455
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,840
Did life get bitter again?

456
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,177
Should I soften it up again?

457
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,136
Sure.

458
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:25,855
What's this?

459
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,107
Look.

460
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,108
Matching rings.

461
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,904
-I've always wanted to do this.
-Really?

462
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,864
I was going to buy it for you.

463
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,532
You gave me more than enough.

464
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,284
All I did was take from you.

465
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:40,912
Do you like it?

466
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,388
Why--

467
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,183
Why did you--

468
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,965
No.

469
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,925
It wasn't me.

470
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,052
I didn't do this.

471
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:27,643
What happened?

472
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,148
I did this.

473
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,819
I did that to Mr. Lee with my two hands.

474
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,696
Have I gone crazy?

475
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,323
Why would you do that?

476
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,409
I don't know. What was I thinking?

477
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,662
I really don't know.

478
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,788
Yu-ri.

479
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,373
Calm down and think.

480
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,256
On my way here after Mr. Lee called,

481
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,969
I bumped my shoulder
with a guy in front of his house.

482
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,180
And he said--

483
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,184
Did he say, "I want to kill him"?

484
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,311
Then I don't remember--

485
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,437
Who was it?

486
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,813
The serpent.

487
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,277
The guy you ran into

488
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,279
had to be the serpent.

489
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,161
He hypnotized you
and took control over your mind.

490
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,375
It's not a coincidence.

491
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,546
He came to you with a plan.

492
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,258
Why would he come and find her?

493
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,720
He wanted to give a warning

494
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,389
to me.

495
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:51,519
If I gain one, I'll lose another.

496
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,313
He used the only one

497
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,983
whom Rang isn't wary of.

498
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,151
That's why

499
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,114
a young and weak fox like you could
catch him off-guard.

500
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:06,033
That coward. I'll kill him now.

501
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,664
You're no match for him.

502
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,459
Darn it!

503
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,507
So what will happen now?

504
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,884
He'll live, right?

505
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,470
I stopped the bleeding,
but his breathing is weak.

506
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,055
And his heart is barely beating.

507
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,515
And?

508
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,644
He's too weak right now,

509
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,646
so all we can do is watch.

510
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,982
Do something, please!

511
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:42,778
What about the cherries?

512
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,281
We have the bladder cherries.

513
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,577
It's for the Granny at Samdocheon.

514
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,537
You can give it to her after we use a few!

515
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,998
Each and every one of them is
a human life!

516
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,253
Do you want me to kill those people
just to save him?

517
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,047
So what if they die?

518
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,924
I'll do it. It'll be fine if I do it.

519
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:05,926
Mr. Lee.

520
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,013
It's a matter of his life.

521
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,355
You aren't allowed to kill any humans.

522
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:22,318
But Lee Rang will never wake up
unless you break the taboo.

523
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,822
What will you choose to do this time,
Lee Yeon?

524
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,581
Where is it?

525
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,500
Where did you put it?

526
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,336
At home.

527
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,922
Is that so? Let's go.

528
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,801
You can't.

529
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,135
What?

530
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,305
It kept bothering me.

531
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,682
Why is no one coming back to life

532
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,395
except for Ji-a's parents?

533
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,191
It's as if
he wants me to use the cherries.

534
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,404
Could he be testing you?

535
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,325
If I violate the taboo and kill someone,
I'll be dragged to hell.

536
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,828
I'll be gone for days, even a few weeks.

537
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,746
I'll be away from Ji-a.

538
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,416
He's after…

539
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,878
my absence.

540
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,469
I won't use the cherries.

541
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,596
I'll catch the serpent first.

542
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,230
I'll save my brother my own way.

543
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,067
Give it to me!

544
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,319
-Yu-ri.
-Give me the bladder cherries!

545
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,237
No, stop!

546
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,373
Who's this?

547
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,208
Mr. Nine-tailed Fox.

548
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,044
Do you want me to be your friend?

549
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,337
-No.
-Why not?

550
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,132
Runny nose.
I don't like guys with a runny nose.

551
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,094
The runny nose kid?

552
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,679
Why are you here?

553
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,107
Do you also think I'm a pushover?

554
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,193
No. What do you mean, a pushover?

555
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:31,363
Then why do you get me flowers
and buy me drinks?

556
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,782
Flowers and drinks mean

557
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:37,995
nothing more than "sleep with me"
for a widow who runs a restaurant!

558
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,080
That's a very sad sentence.

559
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,790
Personally,

560
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:45,419
I've always thought flowers and alcohol

561
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,255
to be very grand and lavish.

562
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,466
I didn't know
I could hurt your feelings deeply

563
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,927
with those words, Ms. Bok.

564
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,678
I--

565
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,264
But why me?

566
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,310
You aren't a bad guy, Mr. Choi.

567
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:04,355
It has to be you. No one else.

568
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,272
In my eyes,

569
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,900
you don't look like a widow
who runs a restaurant alone.

570
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,444
You don't seem like an ordinary person.

571
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,366
I really want to find out

572
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,535
what you're hiding

573
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,579
behind those charming eyes.

574
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,299
Yu-ri, get some sleep.

575
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,012
Can you ask him to hand over the cherries?

576
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,430
Won't he listen to you?

577
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,517
Let's trust him and wait a little longer.

578
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,477
He'll find a way.

579
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,062
You jerk.

580
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,147
You coldhearted jerk.

581
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,233
Think about whose fault this is.

582
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,320
Technically speaking,
it's not because of Mr. Lee Yeon.

583
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,281
He warned Mr. Lee Rang many times

584
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,825
that the serpent will cause trouble.

585
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,369
Whose side are you on?

586
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,791
Mr. Lee.

587
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:08,502
Mr. Lee--

588
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,672
Mr. Lee--

589
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,383
Yu-ri.

590
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,052
Yu-ri.

591
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,806
Is he sick?

592
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,349
Get out!

593
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,938
Su-o, come with me.

594
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,317
Is he a Nine-tailed Fox too?

595
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,278
Says who?

596
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:36,822
He's that other man's brother.

597
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,535
That man is a Nine-tailed Fox.

598
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,584
It's a matter of his life.

599
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,592
You can give it to her after we use a few!

600
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:58,886
-Give it to me!
-Yu-ri!

601
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,679
Give me the bladder cherries!

602
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,756
What's the disinfectant?

603
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,385
This one.

604
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,888
Don't act so snobby.

605
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,644
That's not how you do it.

606
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,605
Hey, what do you know?

607
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,585
How do you know this?

608
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:17,965
My mom would be in pain
after my stepdad beat her.

609
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,801
So I'd always do this and that for her.

610
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,094
Is that so?

611
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,346
Then you can stay here
and do this and that.

612
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,849
If anything happens to him, you're dead.

613
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,894
Where are you going?

614
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,191
Mr. Lee, I'll save you!

615
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,749
No.

616
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:03,946
No, Mr. Lee.

617
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,448
Mr. Lee!

618
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,708
Forgive me.

619
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:17,960
I should've stopped her.

620
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,672
And they all withered away
once she stole them?

621
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,424
-Yes.
-How's Rang?

622
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,969
He's not doing any better yet.

623
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,014
Keep an eye on the cherry thief.

624
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,683
She'll end up getting in trouble.

625
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,476
I'm sorry.

626
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,063
Should I take the remaining cherries
to the lord of Samdocheon?

627
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,815
-No.
-Then--

628
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:44,528
Not yet. I'm in the middle
of a game of Catch the Tail.

629
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,132
You've aged 12 years in just 2 days.

630
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,508
I have no idea

631
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,343
where I can go to avoid him.

632
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,678
I'm as good as dead.

633
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,346
And you deserve it.

634
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,806
I'd kill you if I were him.

635
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,808
His right-hand man let him down.

636
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,895
Help me.

637
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,688
I'll do anything you say.

638
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,106
Please give me a cherry.

639
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,357
My cherries.

640
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,818
Don't you dare.

641
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,822
-Tell me what you want.
-Help me catch the serpent.

642
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,533
The information will decide
how many you get.

643
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,160
Anything. I'll tell you anything.

644
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,830
But how do I know I can trust you?

645
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,001
I've watched you all day
when I disguised as Rang.

646
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,669
You're a born spy.

647
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,672
I understand why you can't trust me.

648
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,383
I'd feel the same way.

649
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,384
But

650
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,845
it's not like I wanted to do that.

651
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,430
At this point?

652
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,724
I wanted to live.

653
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,519
I just wanted to live.

654
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,522
I'm holding onto my pathetic life
by his side,

655
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,941
but I'm only human.

656
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,109
I was once just an ordinary man.

657
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,614
I lost my family to him.

658
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,699
I wanted to get their revenge if I could.

659
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,078
If I ever get another chance,

660
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,121
I want to turn over a new leaf.

661
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,583
My goodness.

662
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,380
There, there.

663
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,256
Lift up your head.

664
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,809
Don't come crying to me with this.

665
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,395
How is this convincing?

666
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,607
It's covered in evening primrose
from a graveyard.

667
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,361
How did you know?

668
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,279
People don't change that easily.

669
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,448
You're smarter than you look.

670
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,617
But this isn't going to kill me.

671
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,827
It's not loaded.

672
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,459
I just wanted to check.

673
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,336
Is the greatest mountain deity

674
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,006
stupid enough to believe
my crocodile tears?

675
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,967
I can't put my life
in the hands of an idiot, can I?

676
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,554
Now we're talking.

677
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,598
The records of the serpent

678
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,476
have a similar pattern
to the famous legend

679
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,353
of the Gimnyeong Snake Cave in Jeju.

680
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,939
They're from different regions and times,

681
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,858
but they all have a leery ending.

682
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,651
You're right.

683
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,195
A beautiful virgin is
given as a sacrifice,

684
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,240
then a warrior comes and defeats
the serpent after much suffering.

685
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,785
But it's never a happy ending.

686
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,121
The warrior of the Gimnyeong Snake Cave

687
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,665
stabbed it to death with a sword.

688
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,418
But it says
he was killed by the dead serpent.

689
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:50,297
He definitely killed the serpent,
but it didn't die?

690
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,673
Maybe it's more than one.

691
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,509
Maybe there were two of them
from the start.

692
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,786
You're going to attack him head-on?

693
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,204
What do you think?

694
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,999
If I end up liking your answer,

695
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,752
take the whole thing.

696
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,341
This is something only I know.

697
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:37,511
The shaman on that island said
he never dies,

698
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,428
but only sleeps.

699
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,680
I already know that.

700
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,516
It's how you put him to sleep.

701
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,975
It's like waking him up.

702
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,353
Don't you remember?
It's the well where he woke up.

703
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,565
You need to elaborate.
Do I push him back in the well?

704
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,652
If there's water, anywhere is fine.

705
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,070
It's all about the materials.

706
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:56,863
The materials?

707
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,616
The flesh of the living.
The blood of the sacrifice.

708
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:05,747
And the power of the one
who's close to the almighty deity.

709
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,961
My power as a mountain deity.

710
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,092
You were the last material we needed
to wake him up.

711
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,683
Damn.

712
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:29,020
There are many records of people
who fought against the serpent,

713
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,439
but I can't find the weapon they used.

714
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,357
I found one.

715
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:33,942
What is it?

716
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:36,528
Look.

717
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,780
There's a snake that lives underwater.

718
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,700
The protagonist fights the serpent
who lives in a swamp

719
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,660
by covering himself with horse blood.

720
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,204
I guess it doesn't like horse blood.

721
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,123
-Send that to him now.
-Okay.

722
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,670
Ms. Kim.

723
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,590
Should I use emojis or not?

724
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:58,758
Should I?

725
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,355
SERPENTS DON'T LIKE HORSE BLOOD.

726
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,693
You had nothing special.

727
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:19,696
All we need are
those three ingredients and water.

728
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,490
The problem is that
he won't sit on his hands

729
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,201
and go down without a fight.

730
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:37,172
A DETAILED STUDY
OF KOREAN MONSTERS: SERPENT

731
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:40,258
I'll make him go down without a fight.

732
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:42,677
That being said--

733
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,679
What are you trying to do?

734
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,684
I need the flesh of the living.

735
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,363
Yes, sir.

736
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,240
Where's the bladder cherry?

737
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,574
We need to come and get it?

738
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:09,329
Okay, leave that to me.

739
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,540
Is that so?

740
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,000
Really?

741
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,127
All right.

742
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,255
Be careful. Bye.

743
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,049
What did he say?

744
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,052
He says he can catch the serpent!

745
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,347
He found out something
by deceiving the serpent's stooge.

746
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,432
I'll go and confiscate
the bladder cherries.

747
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,142
No.

748
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,313
What do you mean?

749
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:36,940
Should I leave it?

750
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,068
No, I meant Yeon.

751
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,487
He won't be able to catch the serpent.

752
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,700
What are you talking about?

753
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,494
Since it's Yeon.

754
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:54,958
It's impossible
because this is the Yeon we know so well.

755
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,803
Just think. What's your biggest fear?

756
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,263
My biggest fear is…

757
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,599
being abandoned.

758
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,770
My mom abandoned me…

759
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,108
and so did you.

760
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,169
I will never abandon you.

761
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,174
I promise I'll save you.

762
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,560
I will catch

763
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,104
the serpent.

764
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,293
Jae-hwan! Ms. Kim!

765
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,253
Can't you hear me?

766
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,630
It's no use.

767
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,090
They're under my hypnosis.

768
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,800
Don't lay a finger on them.

769
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,760
I'm going to kill you!

770
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:29,969
Will you go out with me?

771
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,429
Then I might let them live.

772
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:33,348
What?

773
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,350
Wear the outfit I picked out.

774
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:36,935
Hello?

775
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,436
Hey!

776
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,483
Ji-a.

777
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:47,487
I found these boxes for you
on our doorstep.

778
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,529
What should I do?

779
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,407
I got Ms. Kim and Jae-hwan in trouble.

780
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,617
Should I call the police?

781
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,870
They'll be fine. I'll find them.

782
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:41,040
I've already asked Sin-ju
to follow their smells.

783
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,876
You don't have to see him today.

784
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,129
No.

785
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,423
I'll go.

786
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:50,550
I'll meet him.

787
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,846
Let's catch him today.

788
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,006
It looks good on you.

789
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,258
The dress, the necklace, all of it.

790
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:36,471
Put down "playing with dolls" as a hobby
on your resume instead of reading.

791
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:39,265
I love the look on your face
when you talk like that.

792
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,477
Let's eat.

793
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:48,983
I missed you.

794
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,613
People don't even bother dogs
when they eat.

795
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,324
I hope you would be nicer to me.

796
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,834
They'll jump down on my word.

797
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:10,380
Why me?

798
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:14,342
You might be the one
to help me find the thing

799
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,718
I truly desire.

800
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,680
Something you truly desire?

801
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,598
Something only I don't have.

802
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:22,809
Perhaps

803
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,562
something I lost from birth.

804
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,986
Once upon a time,

805
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:36,990
the ninth son was born
into a royal family in Silla.

806
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,868
The baby never even let out a cry,

807
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,121
but the mother wailed.

808
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,875
The baby's limbs were dented
like a degenerated snake.

809
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,128
It was a monster

810
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:54,340
without any eyes, ears, or even a voice.

811
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:01,347
What happened to the kid?

812
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:08,605
His father, a nobleman, wanted
to get rid of that awful monster himself,

813
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,982
but the midwife stopped him

814
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,234
saying he might be cursed.

815
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,614
Thanks to her,
the child was kept in a fine chest.

816
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,866
Other than the midwife who fed him,

817
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:23,286
his parents or siblings
never came to see him.

818
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,540
Children who don't cry are forgotten.

819
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:30,918
You were human.

820
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,423
You weren't a monster.

821
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,300
You were a human too.

822
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,386
He was thrown
into a cave of plague victims.

823
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:42,847
Then…

824
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:46,809
he was eaten.

825
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,361
Is this horse blood?

826
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,279
Yes.

827
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:18,216
Over time, the cave became
a graveyard for plague victims,

828
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,260
and a white snake crawled out.

829
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,057
People called it a serpent
and considered it ominous.

830
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,434
Well, it's a boring story.

831
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,563
I know the answer.

832
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,817
I know what you truly desire.

833
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:39,570
The human heart.

834
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:42,281
Can you find it for me?

835
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,283
What if I say no?

836
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,743
I'll kill you.

837
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:48,079
I'll kill Lee Yeon.

838
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,957
I'll kill everyone dear to you,

839
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:53,584
and then you.

840
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,881
After that, an epidemic will break out

841
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:03,678
so that no one will dare to be happy.

842
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,909
SEARCHING FOR URBAN LEGENDS

843
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:18,336
The night air is so nice, isn't it?

844
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,506
Sure.

845
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,091
Are you waiting for someone?

846
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,092
No.

847
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:26,552
But

848
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,972
I don't think I got an answer yet.

849
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:32,058
Your heart.

850
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:37,480
I'm sorry, but I'm out of credit.

851
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,858
I used up every penny of my heart

852
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,777
and gave it all to Yeon.

853
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:44,695
What does he mean to you?

854
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:50,785
Tell me.

855
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,583
How dare you touch her?

856
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,418
I'll cut your hands off.

857
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,546
It's none of your business.

858
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:03,381
We're on a date right now.

859
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:04,799
Go on a date with me starting now.

860
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,970
I don't like it
when people break promises.

861
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,411
I want to fly.

862
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,086
I got you!

863
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:49,886
It looks like they didn't fly.

864
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,852
A serpent shouldn't be on land,
but on water.

865
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:07,653
This is horse blood.

866
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,531
I spent a lot of money
trying to find your weakness.

867
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:20,917
This is my blood.

868
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,793
Our date is over.

869
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,471
He's not it, Yeon.

870
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:35,932
It's not him.

871
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:52,406
What is this?

872
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:55,826
What went wrong?

873
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,787
You found the wrong tail.

874
01:05:58,621 --> 01:05:59,580
What?

875
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:03,793
The serpent you're looking for isn't me.

876
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:06,629
Then…

877
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:16,597
It's hot.

878
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:19,600
What's wrong?

879
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,477
I'm burning up.

880
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:23,980
Are you hurt?

881
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,564
It's so hot.

882
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:33,531
It's okay.
You're going to be okay. Please.

883
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:55,803
Do you feel better now?

884
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,473
Look at me.

885
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:14,280
Long time no see, Lee Yeon.

886
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:24,832
This woman is mine.

887
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:29,545
Get out of her body!

888
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:14,632
I might not have much time

889
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,717
to stay as myself.

890
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:20,471
Take my life and save Mr. Lee Rang.

891
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:25,142
I'm going to put an end
to this tiresome fight once and for all.

892
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:28,020
A sword that slays sin.
It'll only slay the serpent's spirit.

893
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:31,315
You must live on when this fight ends.

894
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:32,817
-No.
-Move.

895
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,568
You tampered with the book?

896
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,530
I won't let anyone take Ji-a.

897
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:38,989
Come at me.

898
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:44,578
