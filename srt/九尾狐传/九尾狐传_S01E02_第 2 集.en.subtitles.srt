1
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,386
Let me tell you that

2
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,305
these were my glory days.

3
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,570
I was the lord over Baekdu Mountain,

4
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,114
and a mountain deity
who ruled over the weather.

5
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,284
A Nine-tailed Fox
who was in a different league

6
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,620
from the other foxes
who appeared in Korean Ghost Stories.

7
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,038
Or so I was.

8
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:34,886
Do you wish to die?

9
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,305
That's strange.

10
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,390
My dog loves it when I pet him like this.

11
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,351
Goodness, this kid.

12
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,936
-Do you know who--
-A fox, right?

13
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,605
I'm A-eum.

14
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,609
If I could change my past just once,

15
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,945
I would return to this moment
without hesitation,

16
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,406
and I won't let her find me.

17
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,617
Yeon!

18
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,955
You never forget your way here, do you?

19
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,759
Here.

20
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,723
Some say

21
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,769
it was the scandal of the century
that shook the entire Baekdu Mountain.

22
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,105
A mountain deity who loved a human?

23
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,775
In this day and age,
I'd end up in a hearing.

24
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,986
But I didn't care.

25
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,988
I liked

26
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,699
having her in my forest.

27
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:05,768
As you guessed,
this love story ends in a tragedy.

28
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,940
Someone stole her life.

29
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,718
Once she crosses the Samdocheon River,
I'd never be able to see her again.

30
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,806
I couldn't hold onto her,
but I couldn't let her go either.

31
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,897
So I decided to abuse my power.

32
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,762
How dare you!

33
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,660
Be reborn.

34
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,207
I will…

35
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,296
come and find you.

36
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,404
I've encountered a few lookalikes.

37
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,371
Excuse me.

38
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,668
Yes?

39
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,880
But they didn't have the Fox Marble
I gave her.

40
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:03,798
I'm sorry.

41
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,299
Are you A-eum?

42
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,603
You're not A-eum.

43
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,152
Forget everything you saw today.

44
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,321
If you don't…

45
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,366
I'll kill you.

46
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,284
I've been

47
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,077
waiting for you.

48
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,879
Should I have killed her back then?

49
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,692
Do you want to die?

50
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:08,446
If I was afraid of that,
I wouldn't be here drinking flower tea.

51
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,575
Do you want some?

52
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,622
Gosh, darn it.

53
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,004
You caused that ruckus,

54
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,757
and the first thing you do is
offer me a cup of tea?

55
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,801
When a man and a woman get this close,

56
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,221
don't they usually grab
a cup of tea and a meal too?

57
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,182
People don't seem to like
a chaste type these days.

58
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,812
Whatever the case may be,
if you want something,

59
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,483
shouldn't you let your pride go
before you come and ask?

60
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,611
Hear me out first before you decide
which one of us is more in need.

61
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:50,821
However,

62
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,324
if I don't change my mind to the end,

63
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,118
you'll pay a price for testing me.

64
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,454
A price?

65
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,626
Your eyes.

66
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,880
I'll take those eyes that saw things
they shouldn't have seen.

67
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,805
Sure.

68
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,852
EUNHA FUNERAL HALL

69
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,735
Could you make it more obvious?

70
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,487
-What?
-Your tail.

71
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,239
Oh, my.

72
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,243
I'm sorry.

73
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,665
Are you Director Ki Yu-ri
from the Moze Corporation?

74
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,542
Oh, yes.

75
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,380
I'm here to see the bereaved family
from the bus accident.

76
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,299
Thank you for coming, ma'am.

77
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,384
Goodness. Let's go.

78
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,432
Mr. Lee.

79
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,393
How much condolence money
does a daughter of a rich family give?

80
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,895
Why do you think we're here?

81
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,482
Because you killed them.

82
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,652
I'm here to witness their misfortune.

83
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,738
Shouldn't we pay a good price

84
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,906
for a good show like this?

85
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,243
In that case,

86
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,162
I'll pay this much and watch all night.

87
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,842
You look the same

88
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:35,968
as 21 years ago.

89
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,804
I'm sure you don't want to know
how I look so young.

90
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,014
Who are you?

91
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,140
A Nine-tailed Fox.

92
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,187
You're a fox who's disguising as a human.

93
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,066
Why are you so indifferent?

94
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,734
Most humans would

95
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,237
-at least scream and--
-No.

96
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,490
I knew you'd be out there.

97
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,283
I knew a being like you would exist.

98
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,245
I gave my life to this urban legends show
to catch you.

99
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,711
Who knows
if you caught me or if I caught you?

100
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,546
Let's decide after your story.

101
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,389
At Fox Hill 21 years ago

102
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,682
on the day we first met,

103
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,393
what happened there?

104
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,981
I smelled blood
and ended up saving this kid.

105
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,071
And that kid is now
trying to repay my kindness with evil.

106
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,573
You saved me?

107
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,158
Why?

108
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,037
You reminded me of someone.

109
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,039
I was wrong, of course.

110
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,500
Where are my parents?

111
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,669
Dead, probably.

112
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,212
They never found their body.

113
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,633
You're the only lead I have.

114
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,428
Please.

115
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,932
You've lost your parents.

116
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,768
I'm sorry,

117
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,147
but I'm not interested in
your childhood memories.

118
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,696
I'm sorry,

119
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,991
but you don't want the world
to know about you, do you?

120
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,249
If everything goes as planned,
you'll be on air next Wednesday night.

121
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,586
I'll air that pretty face of yours
without blurring it out.

122
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,672
You still have that darned flash drive
even after you fell down.

123
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,591
What are you playing at?

124
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,511
I can't force you to help me.

125
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,930
And it looks like
the law doesn't apply to you.

126
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,726
But I'm desperate.

127
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,942
I think

128
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,486
it's cliche.

129
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,928
Threats are supposed to be made
by those with power.

130
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,387
Like this.

131
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,432
You're wrong.

132
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,437
This isn't a threat. It's a gamble.

133
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,367
Foxes always return kindness, right?

134
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,618
Damn it.

135
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,538
I don't care if you're a man or a fox.

136
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,665
I'll forget everything I saw and heard.

137
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,669
However, only after I find my parents.

138
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,392
I'm so sorry for your loss.

139
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,818
This way, please.

140
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,297
What are you doing here?

141
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,300
Who are you?

142
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,593
Moze Department Store.

143
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,262
Don't you remember?

144
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,098
Oh, right.

145
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,017
FOUNTAIN OF LUCK
MAKE A WISH

146
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,943
I'm sorry.

147
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,028
It's okay.

148
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,200
Thank you.

149
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,763
Thank you.

150
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,348
What's your wish?

151
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,433
What about you?

152
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,394
I have an older brother.

153
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:42,483
I wished he would spend
the rest of your life in a wreck.

154
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,652
He's a real jerk.

155
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,613
I thought things would be better
if I didn't see him.

156
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,323
But no. I can't sleep at night.

157
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,660
That's why I'm going to keep pestering him

158
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,704
until one of us is dead.

159
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,377
What did you wish for?

160
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,796
I wished that I could marry my girlfriend.

161
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,215
That's so modest.

162
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,051
My parents won't give us their permission.

163
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,052
Oh, my.

164
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,720
Do you want my help?

165
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,515
Who are you to offer to help?

166
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,810
A miracle, or something like that.

167
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,448
Congratulations on your wedding.

168
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,783
No one's against you now.

169
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,827
Was it you?

170
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,163
-Did you do this to my--
-No way.

171
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,165
You have a wild imagination.

172
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,584
What about that coin?

173
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,170
I'm sure it was pure luck,

174
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,716
for both me and you.

175
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,556
She had this on her.

176
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,018
Goodness, anesthetics?
This is attempted murder!

177
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,769
Sit down. Don't overreact.

178
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,438
There are people here.

179
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,775
I'll take good care
of my belongings from now on.

180
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,070
Anyway,

181
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,780
why couldn't you erase her memory?

182
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,284
It's rare,

183
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,245
but our skills don't work on some humans,

184
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,164
like the shamans of old.

185
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,541
So you just let her go?
And gave her eyes back?

186
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,501
Rules are rules.

187
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,879
We're like a favor-returning machine.

188
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,257
How long do we have to be bound
by such an ancient contract?

189
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,925
We pay back what we owe.

190
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,886
It's old-fashioned but romantic.

191
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,095
It's a fox's dignity.

192
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,805
And also a curse.

193
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,141
The bigger we are indebted,

194
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,810
the more it turns us into their puppets.

195
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,811
Gosh.

196
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,151
Does she bother you?

197
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,819
She looks like Lady A-eum.

198
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,364
I've met a number of lookalikes
over centuries.

199
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,492
And I watched them until their death.

200
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,368
And none of them had the Fox Marble.

201
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,120
The heavens can be so mean.

202
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,503
Sin-ju.

203
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,713
Don't make that face. You look ugly.

204
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,968
Feed her some gimbap.

205
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,722
Come on.

206
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,809
Daddy is getting bored.

207
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,145
I'm done.

208
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,565
Fifty-eight seconds. That was close.

209
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,777
All right, that's enough.
Let's have some fun with Dad.

210
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,861
I'll break his record.

211
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,615
Okay, then.
Will you be able to break my record?

212
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,534
Here. Ready, go!

213
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,370
Can you really make it happen?

214
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,539
Hey, can you?

215
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,498
Ta-da.

216
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,836
Mom, Dad cheated.

217
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,713
I'm so sorry.

218
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,841
This is my apology. Please accept it.

219
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,467
It's Dad's special gimbap.

220
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,594
Please accept it

221
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,432
Isn't it good?

222
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,143
Okay, one for Mommy.

223
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,687
Dad's special gimbap. Here.

224
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,813
Honey.

225
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,107
You're so self-conscious about the camera.

226
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,025
Ji-a, was it that obvious?

227
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,110
I'm so embarrassed.

228
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,448
One for me.

229
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,868
It's so good.

230
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,202
Give me a present too.

231
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,622
Okay, look here.

232
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,625
That's my Ji-a. You're so pretty.

233
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,687
Mom?

234
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,480
Now.

235
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,525
You died in a bus accident at Fox Hill.

236
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,947
The Grim Reapers already gave you
a briefing, so we'll leave it at that.

237
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,491
You'll meet the ten kings of the afterlife

238
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,536
and be judged on the weight of your sins.

239
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,915
Don't be scared.

240
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,251
You don't have to be scared
if you've been good.

241
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,794
Remember the King of the Underworld?

242
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:58,048
That's my wife,
the sister of the King of the Underworld.

243
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,801
She doesn't scare you, does she?

244
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,179
She scares me though.

245
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,478
That old man.

246
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,230
I ought to cut off his tongue.

247
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,692
-If you look here,
-I need to talk to you.

248
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,320
this is a pretty good reenactment
of the underworld.

249
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,405
And this is the point.

250
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,032
-Hello, Ms. Nam.
-Hello.

251
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,827
I'm on the first floor. Who wants coffee?

252
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,962
A-eum was reborn, wasn't she?

253
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,175
So it's true.

254
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,472
What will you do if you find her now?

255
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,059
I'll get my revenge.

256
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,021
Thanks to her,
I've been in service for 600 years.

257
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,189
You'll end up burning in hell if you lie.

258
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,941
Do you want to be barbecued?

259
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,860
No, a man is all about his hair.

260
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:00,777
My red-brown hair.

261
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,947
You used to be
one of the great mountain deities.

262
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,741
What happened to you?

263
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,035
That's enough nostalgia.

264
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,786
-Where is she?
-How should I know.

265
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,079
You have clairvoyance.

266
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,623
You can see everything
that happens in this world.

267
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,003
So by any chance,

268
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,255
could she be reborn with the same face?

269
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,216
Hey, reincarnation is a random event.

270
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,010
You should pray that she's not a boy.

271
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,274
She could be a man, a woman,
beautiful, or ugly.

272
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,070
I don't care.

273
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,490
As long as she's not over 60.

274
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,909
Even if she is,
she's a baby compared to you.

275
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,035
No.

276
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,664
I can't have her die so soon

277
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,125
when I've waited this long.

278
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,430
Why do you look so worn out?

279
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,307
I saw a dead body in my dream.

280
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,809
It's an occupational hazard.

281
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,228
Wait, I also had a dream
about a woman last night

282
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,398
who was in black hanbok,
crying and giving me the creeps.

283
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,817
-Was she a maiden ghost?
-No. It was you.

284
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,528
Cut it out. It's bad luck.

285
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,246
-Was it really me?
-Yes.

286
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,748
I dreamed that I lost my teeth.

287
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,333
Isn't that a bad dream?

288
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,626
Come on.

289
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:43,004
You don't even believe in ghosts,
but you're so superstitious.

290
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,090
Don't mind him.

291
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,051
I heard losing your teeth
could also mean luck with money.

292
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,553
I'm relieved.

293
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,097
Darn you.

294
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,265
Ms. Kim.

295
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,684
Could you sell me that dream?

296
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,601
What?

297
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,271
I want to buy a lottery ticket.

298
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:04,901
Yeon.

299
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,988
Don't look for her.

300
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,448
What?

301
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,033
If you do,
she'll change your destiny once again.

302
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,788
I don't care.

303
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,710
And stop nagging your husband.

304
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,337
And stop eating delivery food.
It's bad for your skin.

305
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,923
I found this on my way here.

306
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,551
I can't come for a while.

307
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,262
A lip rouge?

308
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,514
Oh, right.

309
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,058
Please take care of a civil complaint.

310
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:44,941
Yes.

311
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,653
My parents' birth dates?

312
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,615
Okay, I'll text it to you.

313
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,413
DAD: NAM JONG-SU, MOM: LEE YEONG-SEON

314
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,879
First off, this isn't good or bad news.

315
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,840
We need to meet.

316
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,969
See you at 1:00 p.m. at Snail Bride,
a Korean restaurant.

317
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,016
TRADITIONAL KOREAN CUISINE: SNAIL BRIDE

318
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,243
-Are you here for Mr. Lee Yeon?
-Yes.

319
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,579
-This way.
-Thank you.

320
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,209
You're very lucky.

321
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,669
Sorry?

322
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,339
It's his first time bringing a human.

323
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,349
You're here.

324
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,064
So my parents' birth dates--

325
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,024
They weren't in the book.

326
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,025
What do you mean?

327
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,152
It means your parents aren't dead.

328
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,698
They're alive? Where?

329
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,491
I wouldn't know that much.

330
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,372
Have some. You're buying.

331
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,518
I guess it's not an appetizing story.

332
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,690
No, thank you. I'm grateful.

333
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,368
Are you sure you're okay?

334
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,456
I'll find them.

335
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,418
I always said they might be alive,

336
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,046
but no one believed me.

337
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,714
No one.

338
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,930
I'm sorry about the anesthetics.
I really am.

339
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,438
So you can apologize.

340
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,106
I really am an asshole at times.

341
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,443
I'm not asking you to understand.

342
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,449
No, I understand.

343
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,159
I can do that.

344
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,085
You did?

345
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,879
Goodness. Why did you do that?

346
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,507
Right? She has enteritis, right?

347
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,760
-Did you have tteokbokki yesterday?
-Sorry?

348
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,305
-Oh, I did.
-She had some of the leftovers.

349
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,642
Gosh, it was very spicy.

350
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,268
Kong!

351
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,605
I'll give you laxatives. Don't feed her
other than water and medicine.

352
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,609
Don't get angry with me.

353
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,487
No snacks, of course.

354
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,907
Can you tell
what she ate just by looking at her?

355
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,327
I can understand their language.

356
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:31,960
It might be rude--

357
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,629
No rude questions,
especially regarding my privacy.

358
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,466
Let me change the question.

359
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,803
You're not the only fox in the world,
are you?

360
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,521
Don't tell me they all look like humans.

361
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,027
They're all over this city

362
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,196
just like all of you.

363
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,701
They worry about the real estate crisis
and the current economic crisis.

364
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,955
-And the payment--
-Here you go.

365
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,418
If you pay cash, I'll give a discount.

366
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,129
Then what about Shin Don?

367
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,089
Is it true that Monk Shin Don was a fox?

368
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:22,886
Anything else?

369
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,512
Pay the bill.

370
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,430
Right.

371
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,393
Are there other beings that aren't foxes?

372
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,103
Of course.

373
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,689
And generally in places
where you would never suspect.

374
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,776
How was your meal today?

375
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,319
It was all right.

376
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,371
Let's eat!

377
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,041
Let's go to Snail Bride,
the Korean restaurant. Okay?

378
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,001
Gosh, I'm sick of samgyetang.

379
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,419
Could we eat something else?

380
00:29:56,503 --> 00:30:00,965
A glass of ginseng liquor with samgyetang
is great for your health in this heatwave.

381
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,550
Try to be a little more honest.

382
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,261
-You like the owner there.
-Hey!

383
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,138
What kind of nonsense is this?

384
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,724
They use domestic chicken.
Have you seen it?

385
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,184
Just come.

386
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,102
Let's go.

387
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,732
Hello?

388
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,112
What is it?

389
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,699
My mom…

390
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,578
passed away.

391
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,621
What?

392
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,040
I dreamed that I lost my teeth.

393
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,125
I also had a dream
about a woman last night

394
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,087
who was in black hanbok,
crying and giving me the creeps.

395
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,089
It was you.

396
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,639
Okay, this is where we part ways.

397
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,559
I hope we never meet again.

398
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,727
Why not?
All you said was my parents are alive.

399
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:55,770
That's it?

400
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,565
First of all,
I don't have that much free time.

401
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,150
Secondly, we may live on the same grounds,

402
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,987
but your world and my world are
completely different.

403
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,196
I know. I know that--

404
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,575
There were others who peeped
into the secrets of the world before.

405
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,618
They either went crazy or died early.

406
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,245
I don't care.

407
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,414
I won't get in your way.

408
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,791
Just don't disappear before me.

409
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,763
Answer your phone first.

410
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,938
Jae-hwan, I can't talk on the phone--

411
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,401
Yes.

412
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,489
My colleague is in bereavement.

413
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,909
She had a dream that she lost her teeth.

414
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,620
A dream?

415
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,997
My colleagues and I all had nightmares.

416
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,586
A contagious nightmare.

417
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,634
Do you really want to see it?

418
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,677
The world I live in?

419
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,725
Was it Studio Three?

420
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:19,020
Yes, I'm sure I left my equipment there,
but I can't find it.

421
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,730
Ms. Nam.

422
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,608
Is this it?

423
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,197
What is that thing?

424
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:24,854
Lee Yeon.

425
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,790
You. When did you get released?

426
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,918
You said you were going to stop, right?

427
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,295
I didn't do anything.

428
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,588
Is that so?

429
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,673
So am I the bad guy?

430
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,844
Please spare me.

431
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,054
Give me one good reason why.

432
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,641
-Well--
-Nothing, right?

433
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:44,767
-What?
-Then die.

434
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,561
Wait! Hold on.

435
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,444
Your brother told me
I could eat as much as I want here.

436
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,738
Did he now?

437
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,658
What is that thing?

438
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,494
The Unkillable.

439
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,371
The Unkillable?

440
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,957
The legendary animal
that feeds on nightmares?

441
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,667
Yes.

442
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,003
He likes crowded places like a TV station.

443
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,464
Once you feed him metal,
he'll show his true nature.

444
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,096
Damn it.

445
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,126
Now, here's the question.

446
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,294
Stay away.

447
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,629
Stay away!

448
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,088
I'm not talking to you.

449
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,008
Hey, Ms. Hostage. Answer me.

450
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,888
What can you possibly do at this moment

451
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,640
besides getting in my way?

452
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,435
I--

453
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,521
You can't do anything.

454
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,372
Go back to your world.

455
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,084
Humans who get used to the darkness

456
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,378
end up becoming something
that isn't a human.

457
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,385
Hey, wake up.

458
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,511
I know you're not dead.

459
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:50,309
CAPE JANGSAN, COAST OFF THE YELLOW SEA

460
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,728
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

461
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,898
That's a good batch.

462
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,234
You're an awful fisherman,

463
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,528
but you still get hungry right on time.

464
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,657
It's way past lunchtime.
I get seasick when I'm hungry.

465
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,201
You little fool. When will you become
a real fisherman?

466
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,370
He's as useful as your weiner.

467
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,414
-You jerk.
-My gosh, seriously.

468
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,084
What is that?

469
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,962
Seaweed-- But there's a person.

470
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,423
Hey, that's a dead body!

471
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,217
Watch your mouth.
You can't say that word on a boat.

472
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,218
Captain!

473
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,762
A stranger. We have a stranger on board.

474
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,764
-Treat them with respect.
-Yes, Captain.

475
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,683
We're taking this back?

476
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,768
Let's just throw it away!

477
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,187
It's a rule that we escort
them back to land.

478
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,398
Otherwise, he'll be a ship-haunting ghost.

479
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,358
But that's superstition.

480
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,568
Superstition?

481
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:44,613
The boys at Bawi Island did just that
and had their fishing ground dried out.

482
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,495
You must have suffered in the high seas.

483
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,418
Look over here.

484
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,211
He has a golden tooth.

485
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:00,713
Isn't this Seo?

486
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,345
Over here.

487
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,639
Whose skull was it? Did you identify him?

488
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,684
Let me eat first.
This is my first meal today.

489
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,021
Do you look into every case in Korea?

490
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,647
This time, it's personal.

491
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,691
Hey, don't tell me

492
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,194
you're still looking for your parents.

493
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,196
Wake up, Ji-a.

494
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,740
Cut to the chase.
Take a rain check on nagging.

495
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:29,950
You'll have to do legwork.

496
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,786
We know who it is,

497
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,913
but the Coast Guard took the case.

498
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,916
-And the cause of death?
-Not yet.

499
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,126
They've identified the victim.

500
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,045
Who is it?

501
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,224
Please let me see my dad.

502
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,267
Let me see my dad.

503
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,020
Dad!

504
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,279
Let go of me!

505
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,828
Dad…

506
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,100
Are you still waiting

507
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,768
for your dead girlfriend?

508
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,605
I heard an interesting rumor.

509
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,066
Should I tell you or not?

510
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,444
Find her before the end of next month,

511
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,028
or your girl will die.

512
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,493
Are you still thinking?

513
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,580
Please spare me.

514
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,458
I said I will.

515
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,294
So just tell me where Rang is.

516
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,880
I don't know.

517
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,132
Gosh. You're so stubborn.

518
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,384
How will you survive
the 21st century like this?

519
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,889
Either way, I'll end up dead.

520
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,350
Is that what Rang said?

521
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,312
I'm a much better fighter.

522
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,231
Call him.

523
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,323
-Let me know later, then.
-Hey, wait.

524
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,574
Hold on.

525
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,369
I'll do it.

526
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,829
I'll do it.

527
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,837
Yes, it's me.

528
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,465
Things didn't really work out. Yes.

529
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,071
Were you having a drink?

530
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,157
Pour me one too.

531
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,243
Was that you just now?

532
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,620
I knew he sounded kind of weird.

533
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,664
You've grown a lot.

534
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,624
You couldn't eat seafood before.

535
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,334
Don't act like you're so chill.

536
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,920
You rushed over
in the middle of the night.

537
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,338
You must be in a hurry.

538
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,465
Wasn't I right?

539
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,759
She was reborn, wasn't she?

540
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,265
What do you say? Dead or alive?

541
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,271
She's alive.

542
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,732
If you wanted to kill her,
you would've brought her body.

543
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,653
Besides, you're obsessed with bets.
You wouldn't pass on this.

544
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,823
But what if there's a scratch
on this precious prize?

545
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,953
Don't you dare touch her.

546
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,454
What if I do?

547
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,373
Tell me. I'm so excited.

548
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,502
You are emotionally deprived.

549
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,547
Why don't you know?
You have a brother complex.

550
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,549
-Shut up. It's all your fault.
-Why?

551
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,926
You abandoned your divinity
and left the mountain

552
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,553
all because of a human woman, and--

553
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,765
Yes, and I abandoned you.

554
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,320
Is that what you wanted to hear?

555
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,488
Get lost. Get out of my sight.

556
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,532
Are you mad?

557
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,454
Playtime's over. And I've got the girl.

558
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,791
You're such a brat.

559
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,210
Don't be out so late.

560
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,880
Your belly will go boo-boo,
so don't drink too much.

561
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,007
Crazy bastard.

562
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,051
Do you even know where she is?

563
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,846
Do you want me to tell you or not?

564
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,431
I don't need you to.

565
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,641
You're right here,

566
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,352
and there was only one incident
in this neighborhood today.

567
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,363
No, it's okay. I can go by myself.

568
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,698
I'm only checking it out.

569
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,241
Do you have the equipment?

570
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,534
Yes.

571
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,620
Take good care of Ms. Kim.

572
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,872
Call me
as soon as she finds a funeral hall.

573
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,749
Bye.

574
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,008
Did you see the news flash?

575
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,343
The hair.

576
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,887
My colleagues and I all had nightmares.

577
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,390
It can't be a coincidence.

578
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,784
I didn't notice it earlier.

579
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,620
Is this a motion sickness patch?

580
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,251
So who are you looking for?

581
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,253
A person or a fox?

582
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,880
To each their own, okay?

583
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:20,217
Tell me.
Because of what I do for a living,

584
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,927
I have a knack for finding people.

585
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:22,928
I completely refuse.

586
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,306
Why are you here?
What about finding your family?

587
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,892
That being said,

588
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,895
is the dream shown to us
by that legendary Unkillable or whatever

589
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:32,855
all true?

590
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,359
It's a subtle mixture of truth and lies,

591
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,153
waiting for it to bewitch you.

592
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,239
So it's partially true.

593
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,952
If that's the reason, head back.

594
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,747
You can't listen to him blindly.

595
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,332
It's too bad. I'm already here.

596
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,464
The same boat.

597
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,507
The same island.

598
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,928
A woman who looks exactly like her.

599
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,599
My instinct keeps telling me

600
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,519
that something is wrong here.

601
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,648
What the hell is waiting for us
on that island?

602
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:34,541
Why did you only get streusel buns?
I told you to buy red beans!

603
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,252
Just fill up on whatever you get.

604
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,378
You wench.

605
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,173
I won't buy it for you next time.

606
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:44,092
No, get me another one. It's delicious.

607
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,223
I've been waiting for you.

608
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,141
Are you Mr. Seo's daughter?

609
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,645
Gosh, excuse me.

610
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,313
I'm Nam Ji-a, the producer.

611
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,566
Is he with you?

612
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,278
-No, he's--
-Yes, I'm with her.

613
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,364
I'm a member of her production crew.

614
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,283
Let's go to my place.

615
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,326
Sure.

616
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:34,017
Come in. Would you like some barley tea?

617
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,646
You said we're on our own.

618
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:38,939
I'll do what I want.

619
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,816
What's wrong with you?

620
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,401
Gosh. How shabby.

621
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,237
Ms. Seo, should I take off my shoes?

622
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,830
I guess your dad lived alone.

623
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:59,376
Yes, I lived in Incheon,
working at a semiconductor factory.

624
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,794
He was a fisherman.

625
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,423
Don't be nervous. You can relax.

626
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,968
Did he go missing from an accident?

627
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,929
His boat was capsized in the high seas.

628
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,314
What did the police say?

629
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,190
No idea. His body is too decayed.

630
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,152
Sometimes people can be decapitated

631
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,654
if they're caught up
in the boat's propellers.

632
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:43,378
When was the last time
you heard from your father?

633
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:47,591
He called me the morning of the accident.

634
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,134
But I never picked it up.

635
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,892
Hey, Pyeong-hui. Are you eating well?

636
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,479
If you're not busy, drop by sometime.

637
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,608
I packed up
some flatfish and conch for you.

638
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:10,113
I've recently been having dreams
of your late mother.

639
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:14,368
She held your hand
and was in a hurry to get somewhere.

640
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,244
I guess she misses you.

641
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,830
What happened to your mother?

642
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,333
She died of cancer.

643
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,545
Why did he have such a dream?

644
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,588
She came for him.

645
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,593
If he saw someone
who lived her time and passed,

646
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,553
it means she was here to pick him up.

647
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,264
You were probably the one
who was supposed to die that day.

648
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,391
Stop.

649
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,392
What?

650
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,268
He saved your life.

651
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:46,775
This is just my hypothesis though.

652
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,528
You don't have Americano, do you?

653
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,947
Don't drink too much.

654
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,704
What is that woman
from the TV station doing here?

655
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,289
I bet that brat,
Pyeong-hui, is ratting us out.

656
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:04,710
Should we just throw her overboard

657
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,086
and feed her to the fish?

658
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,629
Lower your voice, you idiot.

659
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,142
The more I think about it,
the more eerie it feels.

660
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:23,603
Why did his head end up
in one of our nets?

661
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,774
But that punk, Jin-sik--

662
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,068
We haven't seen him
since we found that head.

663
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:41,872
I didn't do it.

664
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,206
It wasn't me.

665
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,253
I didn't have a choice.
Yes, I had no choice.

666
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,300
Don't stay at the bed and breakfast.
Stay at my place.

667
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,301
Thank you.

668
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:57,637
This is the room.

669
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,182
I have to be somewhere.

670
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:03,560
Sure. If you insist.

671
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,067
It's shabby.

672
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,234
I'm fine by me.

673
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,862
I got used to it
after a number of business trips.

674
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:15,197
But I'm not okay.

675
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:19,785
Sorry, but there's only one room,
and I have to stay close to her.

676
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:20,911
What about me?

677
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,622
There's a mountain over there.

678
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:25,665
A documentary said you're good at digging.

679
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,877
I'm sorry, I'm a kind of a modern guy.

680
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,170
I need central heating.

681
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,674
I'm not leaving.

682
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:35,759
Digging is my thing.

683
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,104
Excuse me.

684
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,732
-Who are you?
-A customer.

685
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,484
There's no mint chocolate ice cream.

686
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,986
Just take what you get.

687
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,822
You have lousy customer service.

688
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:58,740
Hello.

689
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:02,452
I'm sorry to barge in, but are you the men
who recently discovered the skull?

690
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,913
Did someone make a report
to the TV station?

691
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,665
No, I saw it on the news.

692
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,000
Do you mind if I sit down?

693
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,877
Go ahead.

694
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:19,261
Were you close to the late Mr. Seo?

695
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,348
What's there to be close or be distant
in the same village?

696
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,599
We'd see each other.

697
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,602
We're no more than just neighbors.

698
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:32,315
From what I've heard,
you've even been on the same boat.

699
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,737
I can't do it for free.

700
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,949
Let's have you pour me a drink.

701
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,243
I haven't smelled makeup
in such a long time.

702
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:53,962
Damn it.

703
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,172
What are you doing?

704
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,841
Gosh, I'm that generous.

705
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:00,760
How dare an outsider like you--

706
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,220
If you want to hit me,

707
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,557
could you turn your body
a little bit this way?

708
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,225
I'm filming this.

709
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,023
-You little--
-Let's go.

710
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,700
You're awfully bold.

711
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,494
That's nothing new.

712
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,878
Why are you following me?

713
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,713
I'm not following you.

714
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,506
I'm trying to cover a story here.

715
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,551
I'm in the middle
of something like that too.

716
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,679
Then go ahead.

717
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,058
I'm going to freeload as much as possible.

718
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,602
You go.

719
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,817
Excuse me, ma'am.

720
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,418
Ma'am, may I ask you something?

721
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:19,297
May I ask you a question?
It'll only take a minute.

722
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,507
One second.

723
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,967
Just spare a moment--

724
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:23,927
Ma'am!

725
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,721
Ma'am!

726
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,974
Please, one second.

727
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,351
Why do you make this so hard?

728
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,647
It's not easy to let the elderly open up.

729
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,732
They tell me everything when I ask.

730
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:38,650
Care to share?

731
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:41,152
I keep breaking their fingers,
until they answer me.

732
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:45,156
You don't seem too useful.

733
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,117
You aren't that good at doing interviews.

734
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,702
I'm leaving.

735
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,620
Where to?

736
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,081
People aren't the only ones
who can see and hear.

737
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,718
How is he walking so fast?

738
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,358
Do you hear something?

739
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,455
It's a dead forest.

740
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,206
What?

741
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,918
That means
all the spirits in the forest have left.

742
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,587
Why?

743
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,965
People have forgotten and abandoned them.

744
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:52,682
Who's there?

745
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,492
Greetings, Lord of the Forest.

746
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,376
Do you know me?

747
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,252
I've seen you once, from afar.

748
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,590
A spirit of the guardian tree.

749
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,676
What happened on this island?

750
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:30,678
I don't know.

751
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:32,597
You don't know?

752
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,350
This island has changed.

753
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,894
The guardian spirits
of each family and houses

754
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,521
have all left the island.

755
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,898
So there's no one here
who can tell me anything.

756
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:44,526
Since when?

757
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,112
Right after the Korean War ended.

758
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:50,407
Something unclean came into the island
during a typhoon.

759
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,952
But I couldn't see or stop it.

760
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,746
You must have been lonely on your own.

761
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,081
I wanted to leave,

762
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,459
but I'm stuck with this tree,
so I can't move an inch.

763
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,303
Is it because of this?

764
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,764
Yes. Can you untie those?

765
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:30,738
It's a soul, it's a soul

766
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:35,577
It's a spirit, it's a spirit

767
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:40,915
Yes, the dead who passed today

768
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:44,210
You have become a soul and a spirit

769
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:47,589
Thank you.

770
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,216
I've been freed thanks to you.

771
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,218
I don't know what it is, but I'm proud.

772
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,055
But you should wear shoes if you can.

773
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,891
Your beautiful feet are full of scars.

774
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:02,103
You have been to my forest, haven't you?

775
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,399
It's my first time here.

776
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,318
Head to the north of the island.

777
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,403
That's where you'll find the first answer.

778
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,836
She's gone.

779
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:28,713
Good job.

780
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,801
People tied those with profound wishes,

781
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,803
so only a human being could undo those.

782
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,234
Dragon King of the West Sea!

783
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,152
Queen of the Underwater!

784
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,322
-Please return my dad's body.
-Queen of the Underwater!

785
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,158
I want to bury him in peace.

786
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:00,370
Have mercy on this young woman

787
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:04,916
and bring her father's body back.

788
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,168
I pray and beg you

789
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:11,756
I pray and beg you

790
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,886
-What's wrong?
-It's not here.

791
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,013
He's not in the sea.

792
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:26,271
The body got here before the head.

793
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,189
Your father!

794
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,331
"Jangsan Snake Cave"?

795
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,209
I've never heard of this.

796
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,714
DO NOT ENTER AT HIGH TIDE

797
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,469
-I'm going to go eat.
-Don't move!

798
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:01,764
One second.

799
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,141
Stand right there.

800
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:05,143
What is it?

801
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,732
I think I've seen this moment before.

802
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,334
This is it.

803
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,669
This photo was taken

804
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:33,171
right here.

805
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,131
So there was a connection.

806
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,095
She said she had
just gotten pregnant with me.

807
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,725
I was right here,

808
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:50,313
in my mom's womb.

809
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,330
Why did Mom and Dad

810
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,040
come to this island?

811
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:19,008
This blanket smells bad.

812
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:19,926
It wasn't washed.

813
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:24,430
Yes, so why didn't you head over
to that luxurious bed and breakfast?

814
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:27,684
It's none of your business.

815
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,235
You know what?

816
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:40,655
I have a fatty liver.

817
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,995
-It's chronic.
-And why should I care?

818
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,747
You're a Nine-tailed Fox.

819
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:52,250
You might crave some liver, so--

820
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,961
-I don't eat those things.
-Really?

821
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,754
Haven't you heard of hepatic distoma?

822
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,609
Don't laugh with that face.

823
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,363
What about my face?

824
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,284
It's because you're ugly.

825
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:28,911
My goodness.

826
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,998
He went all the way to that island
to find the lady who's reborn?

827
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,291
Yes.

828
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,835
He doesn't look that way,
but he's very faithful.

829
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:39,464
I heard foxes spend their whole lives
with the first partner they meet.

830
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,549
-That's so romantic.
-How is that romantic?

831
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,718
You already know how he paid for that!

832
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,179
You meet someone in your life

833
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,055
that you want to risk everything for.

834
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:51,976
I would never risk my life for love.

835
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,144
I'll protect Mr. Lee.

836
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,522
Well, that's love, in a way.

837
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,777
What was I expecting?

838
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,347
She was reborn, wasn't she?

839
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,474
What do you say? Dead or alive?

840
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,560
Could she be reborn with the same face?

841
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:16,811
Don't look for her.

842
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,772
Find her before the end of next month,

843
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:20,898
or your girl will die.

844
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:23,985
If you do,
she will change your destiny once again.

845
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:57,810
Goodness.

846
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,645
So? Don't you want it?

847
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,607
My goodness.
This wild ginseng is so precious.

848
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:05,818
-Gosh.
-How much is all this?

849
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,194
-Oh, dear.
-No.

850
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,655
-Wait.
-You need to talk to her first.

851
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:12,366
Don't talk down to them.

852
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,619
She's 74. She's like a baby to me.

853
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:17,622
-What do you want to know so much?
-Tell us.

854
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,626
Well--

855
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:24,921
Why does everyone
keep so quiet about that skull?

856
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:27,924
Oh, that's--

857
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:31,761
-My goodness, why don't you tell her?
-What?

858
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:37,808
Don't tell anyone that we told you.

859
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,477
I promise.

860
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:43,481
Okay, so

861
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:45,149
this wasn't the first time.

862
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,446
You know, finding just someone's head.

863
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:55,826
Hey, Jae-hwan.

864
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,620
Ms. Nam, don't be alarmed.

865
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:00,790
Were there really more cases like that?

866
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:01,791
And the victims?

867
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,793
All four of them were unidentified women.

868
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:05,252
When is it?

869
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:08,005
It first happened in 1954.

870
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:10,424
The year 1954.

871
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:16,347
What on earth happened on this island?

872
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:18,766
That man.

873
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:21,268
Excuse me.

874
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:24,855
You were on the same boat
as Pyeong-hui's dad, right?

875
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,024
Hey!

876
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:28,943
Please hear me out.

877
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:31,153
Wait!

878
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,534
Why are you running away?

879
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,080
Begone, ghost!

880
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:56,679
Don't kill him!

881
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:02,935
Yu-ri.

882
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:05,563
There's something that I want.

883
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,232
Here?

884
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,277
It just opened.

885
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:13,237
The haunted house.

886
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:38,095
It's nothing serious.

887
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:51,442
What's this?

888
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:52,777
Traditional remedy.

889
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:55,571
It's hot.

890
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:57,740
Don't be a baby.

891
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,409
Your hand is too hot.

892
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,119
It's burning hot.

893
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:03,621
Wait, I--

894
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:14,381
What is this?

895
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:26,143
Long time no see, Lee Yeon.

896
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:27,645
Who are you?

897
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:31,482
It's me.
The thing you've been waiting for.

898
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,484
What?

899
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:37,780
But you know what?

900
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,533
Why…

901
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:43,786
did you kill me?

902
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:29,039
Something's coming.

903
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,834
Are you sure it's hidden here?

904
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:34,211
A dragon without feet.
What do you reckon that is?

905
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:35,921
You're blinded by a woman.

906
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,549
You also ruined your life
because you were blinded by a woman.

907
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:41,051
-What did you say?
-I have a bad feeling.

908
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,679
I need to know why my parents were here.

909
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:46,182
She will be sacrificed.

910
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:49,143
You won't be able to leave anyway.

911
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:51,562
Kill me.

912
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,273
Only then will she live.

913
01:09:56,901 --> 01:10:01,906
