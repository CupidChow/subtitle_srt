1
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,818
Where did you go?
I looked everywhere for you.

2
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,932
Who was the woman you just kissed?

3
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,309
Was it me?

4
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,771
Or was it your dead first love?

5
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,403
So it wasn't me.

6
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,618
-I am--
-I am not a shadow of your past.

7
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:27,957
So make your decision right here and now.

8
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,794
You can carry on living in the past, orâ€¦

9
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,256
"Or"?

10
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,513
Look at me for who I am.

11
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,275
I'm not that bad looking
if I say so myself.

12
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,213
NAM JI-A

13
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,464
How did you meet him?

14
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,092
What does he do? How old is he?

15
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,094
Where are you?
Aren't you going to tell me?

16
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,971
So who is that guy?

17
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,682
She's totally ignoring me.

18
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,351
He's probably just an interviewee.

19
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,186
No, it's not possible.

20
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,439
It's the way that guy looked at Ji-a.

21
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,404
It almost made my heart race to death.

22
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,949
Ms. Kim,
please relay a word to your heart.

23
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,075
"Stop acting out."

24
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,956
But this is unexpected.

25
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:50,999
What is?

26
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,542
Ji-a, I mean.

27
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,876
She's never dated anyone.

28
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,926
It's hot, isn't it?

29
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,012
I like summer.

30
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,098
Don't Nine-tailed Foxes get hot?

31
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,476
It's the season
when the forest is filled with life.

32
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,146
I don't have to check in with everyone.

33
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:18,109
Every single flower and tree gets
fair amounts of sunlight, rain, and wind,

34
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,069
to live simply and steadily.

35
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,700
It's impossible to get
a fair share of sunlight in the city.

36
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,538
The amount of sunlight you get differs
depending on your housing situation.

37
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,166
For both people and plants,

38
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,585
those who get more sunlight will
always grow taller.

39
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,465
I didn't realize
you heeded to so many things.

40
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,221
But why do you keep avoiding eye contact?

41
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,140
Did I?

42
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,185
Even now,
you're looking past my right shoulder.

43
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,480
Look at that carp.

44
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,530
It's really cute.

45
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,823
It is, isn't it?

46
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,077
-It's cute.
-Yes.

47
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,797
-What are you looking at?
-You.

48
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,053
I'm looking at you for who you are.

49
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,097
Don't look. Stop staring.

50
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,599
My face will wear out.

51
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,189
Darn it. I shouldn't have said that.

52
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,526
Wait for me.

53
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,443
Anyway, Ms. Kim.

54
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,988
Didn't he look familiar?

55
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,989
He did.

56
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,617
Right? Where have I seen him?

57
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,327
On the list of my ideal men.

58
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,539
If you combine them, you'll get him.

59
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,998
I mean one of our episodes--

60
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,001
No way. I couldn't have missed him.

61
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,796
He definitely looked familiar.

62
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,925
Are you two still talking about him?

63
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,802
If you don't feel like working,

64
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,847
at least pretend like you are.

65
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,931
This is embarrassing.

66
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,475
Ms. Kim said we need to investigate

67
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,727
everything that seems suspicious
as journalists.

68
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,063
-I can't believe you told on me.
-Darn you.

69
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,025
Oh, hey. So who is that guy?

70
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,153
Did she reply?

71
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,738
Not yet. This is driving us crazy too.

72
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:32,618
He had this look on his face,
looking like a gold digger.

73
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,746
-You want to believe that.
-What?

74
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,498
That the world

75
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,001
couldn't be this unfair.

76
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,295
-Hey!
-My goodness.

77
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,921
Get back to work!

78
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,549
Don't just pretend, but work!

79
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,765
Who have you been looking for?

80
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,977
-The district magistrate.
-"Magistrate?"

81
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,980
He knows the guy who took your parents.

82
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,732
Really?

83
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,484
So who is this district magistrate?

84
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,488
He's disguised as a human, but he isn't.

85
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,074
One of the four mountain deities
that once ruled over Korea.

86
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,286
Mountain deity?

87
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,830
Don't forget that
one of them is in front of you.

88
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,416
You're right. A former mountain deity.

89
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,001
Did you say you were fired?

90
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,252
I quit myself!

91
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,715
Not to boast or anything,

92
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,509
but the rest were lightweights,

93
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,136
while I was the heavyweight
of Baekdudaegan.

94
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,017
But why is a mountain deity
at a folk village?

95
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,685
It's not just him.

96
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,230
All kinds of legendary figures
gather here.

97
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,690
There's no better place to hide.

98
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,567
Call it a sort of retro fad.

99
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,070
It's nostalgic.

100
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,490
Then,
are there any legendary figures here?

101
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,077
It's possible.

102
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,162
Really?

103
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,959
They mingled with tourists so much,
they lost their scent.

104
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,752
Then how do we find them?

105
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,003
We don't.

106
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,173
We just enjoy our time
and they'll come looking for us.

107
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,094
There's a fortune-teller. Let's go.

108
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:33,656
All right.

109
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,619
Goodness.

110
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,292
-Goodness, you're here!
-Hello.

111
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,002
You're finally here.

112
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,880
All right, then.

113
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,967
I can read your destiny, physiognomy,
compatibility, and past life.

114
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,093
So which one is it?

115
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,555
If you could do all that,
why would you part-time here?

116
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,889
It's for fun.

117
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,976
Here you are.

118
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,854
Read me my past life.

119
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,398
Your past life it is.

120
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,194
Past life.

121
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:17,199
Yes. Young people these days
tend to ignore their past lives.

122
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,077
But your past life is very important.

123
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,245
Don't move.

124
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,373
-Let's see.
-Are you using an app?

125
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,170
I have the results.

126
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,465
I knew you two looked extraordinary
as you walked in.

127
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,424
What was I?

128
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,677
You were part of the royal family.

129
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,678
You were a princess.

130
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,559
What? You can catch that?

131
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,894
What about me?

132
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,521
You were--

133
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,987
So you were-- Goodness.

134
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,907
You were a diligent worker
of our country's industry.

135
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,617
You died building the Hangang Bridge.

136
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,497
If you're going to say anything,
why don't you stick to good fortunes?

137
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,873
You should get a talisman.

138
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,583
Talisman, my ass.

139
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,629
You two shouldn't stick around one another

140
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,757
unless you want either one of you dead.

141
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:19,553
What?

142
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,433
You two should've never met.

143
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,065
-Oh, hello. Hello.
-You're pretty.

144
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,901
-You're very pretty.
-I know I am.

145
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,111
Come and take a look.

146
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,905
Come out with me
to the pond for a bath sometime.

147
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,783
-Greetings.
-You haven't found the woodsman yet?

148
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,577
-Hello.
-Why, hello. Hey.

149
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,497
-Welcome.
-Come and take a look.

150
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,293
-Where's the fortune-teller?
-The fortune-teller?

151
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,629
You have to walk that way for a while.

152
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,799
A while? In this heat?

153
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,803
Are there no taxis here?

154
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,764
There's no taxi. We do have that.

155
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,268
TAXI

156
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,702
What a waste of money.

157
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,539
That creep doesn't know what
he's talking about.

158
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,794
A colleague of mine went to see
his compatibility with his wife-to-be.

159
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,172
The fortune-teller said
they should've met sooner,

160
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,965
saying they're perfect together.

161
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:39,550
And?

162
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,261
He said they'll be happy forever,
but in less than a year.

163
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,054
-Did they divorce?
-Yes.

164
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,975
I never believed
in these compatibility readings.

165
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,311
If it's true, how does it explain
the divorce rate--

166
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,068
Who shot that?

167
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,198
Who else would ask me out
in such an old-fashioned way?

168
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,117
-Meet me at the office.
-The magistrate?

169
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,994
Let's go.

170
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,594
One, two.

171
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,229
Shoot.

172
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,815
Yes, good.

173
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,108
Yes. That's it!

174
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,113
Who are you?

175
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,081
-Are you here for a reading?
-No, something else.

176
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,541
Do you need a talisman?

177
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,168
That's enough.

178
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,546
I already know who you are.

179
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,231
Is there a get-together for foxes today?

180
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,943
-What?
-If not, forget it.

181
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,408
Yeon must be here.

182
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,994
Cut to the chase.
I have to take my clients.

183
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,038
You have the thing
that can look into our past lives.

184
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,092
Let's see.

185
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,262
Tiger's Brows.

186
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,017
This is obviously not it.

187
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,477
Where is it?

188
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,899
Gosh, the Goblin Hat.

189
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,110
Come out, gold

190
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,237
Let's see. Where is it?

191
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,784
Ta-da.

192
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,497
Everything that disappeared
from this world is in here.

193
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,292
Give it to me.

194
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,251
I can't for free.

195
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,802
So? What do you think?

196
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,186
Goodness, you fool.

197
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,648
-What?
-If you could buy this with money,

198
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,817
why do you they went missing
in the first place?

199
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,654
It's gone again.

200
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,790
This place hasn't changed.

201
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,797
SEONDEOKDANG

202
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,634
Come out, magistrate!

203
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:29,989
It's been a while.

204
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,782
Yeon.

205
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,451
You don't look as well as you did
since we last met.

206
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,869
Why are you here?

207
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,497
I'm looking for someone.

208
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,666
Fox Hill is your turf, right?

209
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,171
Do you do things like that for humans?

210
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,383
I plan on doing
much more than this for a human.

211
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,802
I heard Fox Sister was killed,

212
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,848
and it was a former mountain deity
who killed her right before her wedding.

213
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,308
I heard it was also
a former mountain deity

214
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,770
who helped her hide
after she ate her brothers' liver.

215
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,064
The human world is
already as tough as it can be.

216
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,026
How dare you do that
to these poor ancient beings--

217
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,902
Those who disturb the world

218
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,280
and cannot live harmoniously with people

219
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,782
are the only ones I hunt.

220
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,583
You and I are just on different paths.

221
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,794
In that case, I have nothing to tell you.

222
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,212
I still want to hear it.

223
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,068
You should be more concerned
with your survival.

224
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,046
You can't put a price on my things.

225
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,506
What if I take it by force?

226
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,805
Then you'll be sucked into this sack.

227
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,017
Try it if you're curious.

228
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,192
Then what?

229
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,195
Barter.

230
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,991
I'll trade it with something
most precious of yours.

231
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,912
Something that is

232
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,998
most precious to me?

233
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,019
You can wait here for a bit.

234
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,563
Give me about five minutes.

235
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,483
Don't get hurt.

236
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,729
It's hard fighting in PG-15.

237
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,480
Let's make it rated R.

238
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,775
I won't let you kill.

239
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,736
I won't let anyone be that rude to me.

240
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,029
Agreed.

241
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,908
Don't turn this into a dirty fight.

242
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,496
This way, ma'am.

243
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,795
-Why?
-I'm not weak enough to need a hostage.

244
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,049
It's fine. He's the type
who always has to look cool.

245
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,843
-You can relax.
-I take pride in what I do, that's all.

246
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,975
Did you give your heart to that fox?

247
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,396
Or did he simply bewitch you?

248
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,277
I--

249
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,366
What does Yeon mean to me?

250
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,084
I'm using him.

251
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,547
I made a deal with him to find my family.

252
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,676
And I put him in danger
to get information from you.

253
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,720
I like your honesty.

254
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,515
But I don't need all that now.

255
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,561
I hope he'd just beat everyone up
so that we can go home.

256
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,900
He always ends up getting hurt

257
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,320
because of me.

258
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,239
It looks like your future
won't be roses and sunshine.

259
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,618
I don't care.

260
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,997
If it's rough,
I can always sow rose seeds as I go.

261
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,835
You really are an interesting girl
as the rumors say.

262
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,254
"Rumors?"

263
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:23,467
But you'll regret that you came to see me.

264
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,337
Who dared to do that?

265
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,422
Which idiot let someone bring a phone

266
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,548
into the Hell of Darkness?

267
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,384
HELL OF ETERNAL DARKNESS
WITHOUT DAY OR NIGHT

268
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,761
Here's your tteokbokki.

269
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,554
Damn it, you idiot!

270
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,391
You're a grim reaper!

271
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,059
Shut up and go screw their legs!

272
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,561
Darn it.

273
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,606
There's zero discipline around here.

274
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,282
What is this? It's not spicy at all.

275
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,785
Honey!

276
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,204
Honey!

277
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,291
Where did he go at this busy hour?

278
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,339
That's the Moon Mirror.

279
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:30,135
Did you just try to use
one of the four divine artifacts

280
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,470
to kill someone?

281
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,307
Then did you use
your Fox Marble to protect the world

282
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,184
or to protect a single person?

283
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,524
Let's lose our gear and powers
to fight one-on-one.

284
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,193
Sounds great.

285
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,084
It looks like her heart breaks
to see you get hurt.

286
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,503
What does she mean to you?

287
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,590
You should only ask that
after at least two bottles of soju.

288
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,091
It's common sense.

289
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,435
You must be serious to be this agitated.

290
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,563
-Shut up.
-How naive, Yeon.

291
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,190
You're in love with a human again.

292
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,693
Stop talking
like you're in a period piece.

293
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,465
You always take things so far.

294
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,011
-It's who I am.
-You're so stubborn.

295
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:56,888
Let me see you.

296
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,348
I told you not to get hurt.

297
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,059
It's fine. It's just a scratch.

298
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,894
One second.

299
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,731
Get up.
Let's grab a cup of iced Americano.

300
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,946
-I don't drink iced beverages.
-Gosh.

301
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,658
-What's with you two?
-Let me introduce him.

302
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,786
As I said, he's a mountain deity
and my old bestie.

303
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,372
He's originally a Black Bear.

304
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,588
MY OLD WOMAN

305
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,969
Just pick up, will you?

306
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,555
-I can't live like this anymore.
-That again?

307
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,226
I've been getting startled
and waking up in my sleep.

308
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,645
My heart pounds when I think of her

309
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,314
and it makes me want to pee.

310
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,817
Goodness, that's enough information
on your prostate condition.

311
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,278
It's natural to face ennui
after a couple is

312
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,697
-married for thousands of years.
-Ennui?

313
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,159
Gyeon-u and Jik-nyeo were
once inseparable,

314
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,536
but they've been talking about separating.

315
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,663
I knew it.

316
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,917
That's why it hasn't rained
on the seventh of July for so long.

317
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,963
You should be honest with her.

318
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,007
No way. I'm scared.

319
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:17,093
What was I thinking

320
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,805
when I married the sister
of the King of the Underworld?

321
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,813
Why should I eat this?

322
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,650
It's samgyetang.
It's good for you and delicious.

323
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,902
So why are you treating me?

324
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,156
Because I think
I had a misconception about you.

325
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,620
What if it wasn't a misconception?

326
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,582
From my experience, no one who
pities weak animals are ever villains.

327
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,709
I hate you.

328
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,713
Didn't you hear me? I hate you.

329
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,882
You might hate me, but not samgyetang.

330
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,425
Try some.

331
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,137
Don't smile like an idiot
after what I said.

332
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,394
I heard I can be cruel to anyone

333
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,437
who won't scream in pain when I bite them.

334
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,733
You're like those stray dogs I've met.

335
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,529
-What?
-Those who got abused and abandoned

336
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,948
bite the hands that feed them.

337
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,036
They never learned how to be loved.

338
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,708
Shut up.

339
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,637
"Something that's precious to me."

340
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,849
What the heck is that?

341
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,079
LEE RANG

342
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,752
Your call cannot be connected.

343
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,504
-Is he ignoring me?
-Leave a message after the tone.

344
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,305
He eats macarons?

345
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,185
This western snack is both crunchy
like gangjeong and soft like yakgwa.

346
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,021
Sure. How are you doing these days?

347
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,939
You got many mouths to feed.

348
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,192
The minimum wage went up.

349
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,444
Oh, I bought a house on mortgage.

350
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,573
A few lead characters of folktales
have panic disorders, but other than that,

351
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:44,991
I'm doing fine.

352
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,578
It must've been pretty tough.

353
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,290
I must head over to perform at
the magistrate's birthday party.

354
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:00,924
Excuse me,

355
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,842
have you seen these people?

356
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,014
They went missing 21 years ago.

357
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,353
Anything trivial you remember is fine.

358
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,481
-So whatever you know--
-I think it was the third of March.

359
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,860
You're right. The car accident broke out
on March 3rd, 1999.

360
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:24,280
On the first of that year,
a man in a navy suit came to see me.

361
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,242
He said there would be an accident
on March 3rd.

362
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,370
-at Fox Hill.
-A navy suit?

363
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,664
Are you saying he planned the accident?

364
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,586
So?

365
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,964
I do not take part in hurting people.

366
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,216
So I didn't let him take my subordinates.

367
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,510
Who was that man?

368
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,137
At first, I figured
he was disguised as a human.

369
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,557
-But no.
-Then?

370
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,558
He was a human.

371
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,062
-Are you sure?
-He definitely smelled human.

372
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,774
Tell me more details.
Everything you remember about him.

373
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:03,695
He didn't seem very memorable.
I don't think I'd recognize him.

374
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,989
He was just an ordinary middle-aged man.

375
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,408
But his forehead.

376
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,662
-Forehead?
-It was very faint,

377
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,123
but there was a trace of a mukhyeong
on his forehead.

378
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,709
"Mukhyeong"?

379
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,420
The tattoo that marks criminals?

380
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,757
-What did it say?
-Seo as in west,

381
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,884
and gyeong as in capital.

382
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,927
"Seogyeong."

383
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,889
If he was forced a facial tattoo,

384
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,683
that means he's been alive
since the Joseon era.

385
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,853
Where could he be right now?

386
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:37,770
I'm sure

387
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,565
he isn't too far away.

388
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,485
What do you mean?

389
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,572
Your parents weren't the target
to begin with.

390
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,451
-What?
-He was after the daughter from the start.

391
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,381
If you don't want to do anything,
then what's your plan?

392
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,596
MY OLD WOMAN

393
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,395
Honey! I'm busy to death.
You need to run over right now!

394
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:23,524
Yes, honey. I'm on my way.
Give me just a moment. Okay.

395
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,487
-I want a divorce.
-What?

396
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,447
Okay.

397
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,992
I'm going to get divorced!

398
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:34,869
Hey, over there.

399
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,497
Over there?

400
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,919
-Me?
-You look like you can die any moment.

401
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,338
I don't care
if you get divorced or remarried,

402
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,965
so will you please shut up?

403
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,176
That little--

404
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,636
Have some manners.

405
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,224
I can end that thing's life
right here and now.

406
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,142
Calm down. She's from abroad.

407
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,104
What has the world come to?

408
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,315
Where did he bring
such an impudent young lady?

409
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,407
Don't bow to me, you punk.

410
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,742
My lord.

411
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,997
-Do you know who that is?
-I don't give a damn.

412
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,332
He's brother-in-law
to the King of the Underworld,

413
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,375
and Samdocheon's keeper.

414
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:26,170
Is he allowed to be loud in a public place
if he knows the King of the Underworld?

415
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,841
Eat up.

416
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,472
That's hot.

417
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,725
Give me your hand.

418
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:40,977
Let go.

419
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,542
The shelter and the food for the dog--

420
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,752
I can't take it.

421
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,462
Then?

422
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,213
You raise it.

423
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,884
If you euthanize that dog,

424
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,385
you'll die a painful death.

425
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,804
Does your family hate dogs?

426
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,432
He's not family. He saved me from the zoo.

427
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,935
-So he's your savior.
-Precisely.

428
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,479
He tore the zookeeper in half.

429
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,898
Did he kill a human?

430
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,442
Who is this savior?

431
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,526
He's some guy.

432
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,029
You'll meet him soon enough.

433
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,631
Don't keep her by your side.

434
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,384
-Why not?
-The man who came to see me said,

435
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:57,637
"The girl has

436
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,098
the king's scales.

437
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,684
The king's energy is in her."

438
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,665
Long time no see, Lee Yeon.

439
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,544
It's me.
The thing you've been waiting for.

440
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,421
Our cursed relationship should've ended.

441
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,508
Only if you didn't hold back that boat

442
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,510
crossing the Samdocheon River.

443
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,346
Was that A-eum?

444
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,350
Orâ€¦

445
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,581
Who do you think that man is?

446
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,792
If he's close by,

447
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,711
he might be someone I know.

448
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,800
Someone with a scar on his forehead.

449
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,303
I don't know anyone like that.

450
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,766
I'll look into it. So--

451
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,726
I don't get it.

452
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,478
Why did that man come for my life,

453
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,688
and why did my family suffer
because of me?

454
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,106
I'm nobody special.

455
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:22,156
Yeon, why do you always protect me,

456
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,409
but never tell me anything?

457
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,961
I don't want youâ€¦

458
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,382
to get hurt.

459
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:44,428
I don't want you to do anything
for my sake.

460
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:52,061
I want your life to end happily.

461
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:52,979
Andâ€¦

462
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,984
I want you to trust me.

463
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,952
Let's catch that man first.

464
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,289
How?

465
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,165
We have

466
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,502
a pretty obvious connection to him.

467
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,048
Why do you keep calling me?

468
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,012
Did you see your 22 missed calls?

469
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,596
I'm not your boyfriend.

470
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,807
If I can't pick up,
you should take a hint--

471
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,975
Let's meet right now.

472
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,894
What are you scheming now?

473
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,856
I just want to see you.

474
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,359
This is 99.9 percent a scheme.
I'm busy. Bye.

475
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,902
Why are you so busy?

476
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,489
Where are you?

477
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,786
Do you think your brother will tell us?

478
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,455
-No way.
-Then?

479
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:53,873
We will

480
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,375
make Rang go find him.

481
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,753
How?

482
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,217
Hey, calligrapher.

483
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,720
Let me borrow this.

484
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,856
BANG

485
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,108
Bang means to find.

486
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:25,196
Find the one who has the mark
of the criminal on his forehead.

487
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:30,534
BANG

488
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,287
What did you just do?

489
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,206
It's a sort of talisman.

490
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,917
These shoes will take Rang to that man.

491
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,048
We only have one chance.

492
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,593
Do not lose him today,
no matter what happens.

493
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,805
Okay. I won't lose him.

494
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:07,738
Go inside.

495
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,631
You're here.

496
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,719
Why do you ignore me?

497
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,264
Did you forget
what happened at the funeral?

498
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,808
Yeon came back a mess because of you.

499
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,645
Brothers bicker and fight as they grow up.

500
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,523
You look great in hanbok.

501
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,485
That suit doesn't fit you at all.

502
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,823
You're overly sensitive today.
I'm getting excited.

503
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,701
You look high whenever I see you.

504
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,785
It's unsettling.

505
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,497
What are you doing here?

506
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,000
It doesn't look like
I'm on a field trip, does it?

507
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,294
-If you were, you'd get zero points.
-Old man!

508
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,672
I had to check something.

509
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,509
What? You're back.

510
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,678
What are you up to?

511
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,098
I wonder if you actually knew
that he's a real fortune-teller.

512
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:21,312
This fraud is even wearing
a fake mustache--

513
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,439
It's real.

514
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,358
But he kept saying nonsense.

515
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,985
That's his act, you idiot.

516
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,362
Appraise him.

517
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,407
This thing can't be
the most precious to me.

518
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,561
So it is.
He's the most precious thing to you.

519
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,105
Your brother.

520
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:08,859
Damn it.

521
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,366
Here.

522
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,286
I'm off.

523
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,455
What is this?

524
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,751
How do I put it,
it's a sort of human trafficking.

525
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,795
Unbelievable.

526
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:31,131
He'll explain.
You have all the time in this world.

527
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,259
See you around.

528
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,072
Where are my shoes?

529
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,657
I don't know!

530
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,327
What is up with him?
He's like a little kid sometimes.

531
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,809
You can't go.

532
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:27,813
Go ahead.

533
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,773
Okay.

534
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,987
-Let go.
-You're mine.

535
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,822
-Who says so?
-A deal is a deal.

536
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,282
It's a dirty deal.

537
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:45,998
Yeon, hurry.

538
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,960
If you wanted to trick me,
at least explain--

539
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,896
Run along. I'm closed now.

540
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,230
Where's Yeon?

541
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,900
He's now a part of my collection.

542
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,824
Will you be here tomorrow?

543
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,994
I only show up whenever I want,

544
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,579
wherever I want.

545
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,500
We only have one chance.

546
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,252
Do not lose him today,
no matter what happens.

547
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:45,057
On the first of that year,
a man in a navy suit came to see me.

548
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,351
These shoes will take Rang to that man.

549
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,398
Did you give your heart to that fox?

550
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,693
I want your life to end happily.

551
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,569
I want you to trust me.

552
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:02,950
Let him go.

553
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,118
I can't.

554
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,119
There are rules.

555
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,578
Please, sir.

556
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,496
What's that?

557
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,292
-Wait.
-It's no use.

558
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,879
Tell me how I can get him back.

559
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,298
The same rule applies to everyone.

560
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,592
Give me whatever is
the most valuable to you.

561
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:21,927
I'll buy him.

562
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,434
I'll buy Lee Yeon.

563
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,188
What will you give up?

564
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,774
If you do not return until nine o'clock,

565
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,778
I will call off this deal.

566
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,823
I have an hour and 40 minutes
until 9:00 p.m.

567
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:31,830
What's the most precious to me?

568
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:55,854
Think.

569
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,981
Let's think of something.

570
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:11,036
People get off work when the sun sets

571
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:14,873
But why am I still working?

572
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:28,637
DAEGWANMUN
KOREAN FOLK VILLAGE

573
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,265
Excuse me! Open the gates, please.

574
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,474
Excuse me!

575
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,689
Excuse me!

576
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:48,031
Open the gates, please!

577
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,910
Is anybody there?

578
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:55,163
Over here! Mister!

579
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,601
-Magistrate?
-I heard a familiar voice.

580
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,686
It must be an emergency.

581
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:23,817
Thank you.

582
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,861
Thank you!

583
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:39,666
Wait!

584
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:43,670
All right.

585
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,465
So what's the most precious to you?

586
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,345
This.

587
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,681
A broken music box?

588
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,475
It still works.

589
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:10,572
It was the last birthday present
I got from my parents.

590
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,164
That's all?

591
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,422
It has been exactly 21 years

592
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,675
since they went missing.

593
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:34,680
To be frank,
my memory gets faint by the year.

594
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:40,102
I'm not sure if what happened to me
was real life or a dream.

595
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,315
There's blood on it.

596
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,025
That's what kept me going.

597
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:51,029
It's the proof that shows
what I saw that day wasn't a dream.

598
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,781
So that's why

599
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,534
they might be alive.

600
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:59,162
This is the last bit of connection
you have with your parents.

601
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,209
Let me appraise this.

602
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,288
What brings you here at this hour?

603
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:46,877
I'm not sure.

604
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,880
Why did I come here?

605
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,758
What do you mean?

606
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,678
No, it's nothing. Sorry about that.

607
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,775
Wait, did that asshole--

608
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,655
BANG

609
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,171
The trade isâ€¦

610
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,591
not possible.

611
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,552
-What?
-This isn't enough.

612
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,846
Why not? Why can't I trade this?

613
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,973
I'm not the one who puts a price

614
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,725
on these things.

615
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,312
Then please tell me, sir.

616
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,773
What do I have to do, and whatâ€¦

617
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,818
can I do?

618
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,737
You are one nuisance of a customer.

619
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,448
I'll do everything I can
to pay you back for your kindness.

620
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,784
Please?

621
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,494
Okay, fine!

622
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,205
You were a princess before, not now.

623
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,916
You think throwing a fit will
always get your way.

624
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:18,093
Hand.

625
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,220
Give me your hand.

626
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,515
-Your left hand.
-Left hand.

627
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,402
You were born with a special destiny.

628
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,739
Water and fire fight against one another.

629
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,660
Everything is covered with earth,
but metal rules over them.

630
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,662
Even when surrounded by darkness,

631
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,080
the moon will always rise.

632
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,541
What do you mean?

633
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,002
You have the Fox Marble.

634
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,340
That's your moon.

635
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:58,884
Sorry?

636
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:00,468
Give me the marble.

637
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,514
Your destiny already holds greatness
without the moon.

638
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,433
-So--
-I'll give it to you.

639
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,477
I don't believe in destinies.

640
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,398
The trade

641
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:15,734
has been made.

642
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,528
What? Already?

643
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,030
Your palm lines.

644
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,325
Your palm lines have changed.

645
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:55,440
The Fox Marble is gone.

646
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,615
How can you beat him up that badly?

647
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,867
He deserved it.
How dare he treat me like that?

648
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,203
He's a total brat.
I'm much older than him.

649
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:11,998
How did you get me free?

650
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,792
How else?

651
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,961
I bought you back.

652
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,462
What did you give him?

653
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:24,219
Wait, did you give him
ten years of your life or something?

654
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,681
No. It was cheaper than I thought.

655
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,186
So you're mine now.

656
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,900
I'm pretty materialistic,

657
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:42,320
so I won't give you freedom too easily
like Aladdin did.

658
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,827
You're a crueler villain than Jafar.

659
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:04,050
Why didn't you run after Rang?

660
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,511
It was a good chance
for you to find your parents.

661
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,559
To be honest, I hesitated,

662
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:16,688
thinking it might be my final chance.

663
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,815
I wondered
if I wouldn't regret my decision.

664
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,525
Why did you choose me?

665
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,152
I was confident

666
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:25,280
that you were a guy I could trust,

667
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:28,658
who could give me a happy ending.

668
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:47,427
What's on your mind?

669
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,429
In life,

670
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,640
there are many moments
when a kid needs his parents,

671
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,267
more often than I realized.

672
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,355
For example,
when you take your first steps.

673
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,982
There's no one other than your parents
who'd be thrilled

674
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,860
to see you get up and walk a few steps.

675
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,905
When was it for you?

676
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,450
Let's see.

677
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,830
When I was the only one
who didn't bring gimbap to a picnic.

678
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,166
After a fight, when my friend said,

679
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,502
"I'm going to tell on you to my mom!"

680
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:24,214
I could never win against
anyone who had a mom.

681
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,176
What a shame. I could've beaten them up.

682
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,806
I blamed them a lot too.

683
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,058
"Why did you leave me all alone?"

684
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,103
"Why won't you come for me?"

685
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,981
Then I heard that it's my fault.

686
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,901
That accident broke out because of me,

687
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,821
and my mom and dad's lives
are ruined because of me.

688
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,662
If you want to cry, you can.

689
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:56,871
No.

690
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:58,706
I'll eat chicken feet.

691
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:05,922
Are you okay?

692
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,591
I'm not.

693
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,094
So I'll eat this spicy food and bawl.

694
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,014
I want to confuse myself into thinking
that I'm crying

695
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,600
over spicy food,
and not over my weary life.

696
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,271
You're cool.

697
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:23,898
What?

698
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,194
I was worried
you might pretend like you were fine.

699
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,488
I'm glad.

700
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,950
I wanted to look cool, so I got worried

701
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,618
I might come off as cute.

702
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,624
-Try some.
-Is it any good?

703
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,585
It's not as spicy as I thought.

704
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,176
Is it spicy?

705
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:52,760
No.

706
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:57,724
Something just got in my eyes.

707
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,269
You can't eat spicy food.

708
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,356
No way.

709
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,026
I'm not a spicy food rookie.

710
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,575
Stay out of it.

711
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,745
This is between the chicken feet and me.

712
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,192
Where are you going this late?

713
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:51,986
It's nothing.

714
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,448
I have to stop by somewhere.

715
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,499
Goodnight, then.

716
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:09,462
Hey, Yeon.

717
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,635
Don't be so nice to me.

718
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,180
I'm really scared.

719
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,560
If you treat me nicely,
I'll want to depend on you.

720
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,854
Once I begin to do that,

721
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,525
I think I'll end up becoming too weak.

722
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,696
So that's how you lived your life.

723
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,588
I promise.

724
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,758
Just find your family

725
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,760
and live an ordinary life.

726
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:01,055
When that day comes,

727
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,267
you can forget ever meeting me

728
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,728
and what you've seen of this world.

729
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,067
Live an ordinary life

730
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:16,195
like an ordinary human.

731
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:29,292
You startled me. Make your presence known.

732
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:38,259
Granny, you know everything, don't you?

733
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:42,680
What do you mean?

734
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,308
The serpent.

735
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,605
It's not dead.

736
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,516
There's always a cause
when something happens.

737
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:13,438
I don't want that nonsense.

738
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:18,609
That girl is the one
who woke it up from its long sleep.

739
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:23,197
And you were the one who found her,
when I clearly told you not to.

740
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,615
You're saying it's alive.

741
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,493
It is.

742
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:31,456
Thenâ€¦

743
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,918
what did I fight for back in those days?

744
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:42,175
And why did A-eum risk her life?

745
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,677
That is the path you and the child chose.

746
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,140
Where is it?

747
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,934
I warned you time and time again.

748
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,646
A human and a fox cannot be together.

749
01:02:58,900 --> 01:02:59,817
Tell me.

750
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,944
Your obsession will bring disaster!

751
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,279
Tell me now!

752
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,091
Hello.

753
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,610
The one from the well

754
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:45,238
disappeared as soon as he came out.

755
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,867
I found a piece of him

756
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,410
just now.

757
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,331
What?

758
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:46,382
I made her a promise.
I'll protect her with my life.

759
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:48,551
Love is something

760
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,303
that can devour you.

761
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:54,348
Yeon has also become very dear to me.

762
01:04:57,476 --> 01:05:00,104
There must be a connection
between the serpent and Rang.

763
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:04,108
If you lay a finger on her,
I'll really kill you this time.

764
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:07,111
Don't get too caught up.
Do you wish to relive that tragedy?

765
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:09,405
She'll get hurt if I don't go.

766
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:12,408
It's either you or her.
One of you will die.

767
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:18,539
