1
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,920
When a fox turns 100 years old,

2
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,465
it can become a beautiful woman,

3
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,801
or it can turn into a man
to copulate with another woman.

4
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,012
A fox that lives 1,000 years

5
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:57,057
becomes one with the heavens
and turns into a Heavenly Fox.

6
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,226
Its divine power is
like a supernaturally charged shaman,

7
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,729
and it can see 1,000 ri ahead.

8
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,489
I was going to give it to you at home.

9
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,034
Ta-da. Here's your birthday present.

10
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,422
Do you like it?

11
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,257
Yes, I love it.

12
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:43,895
YEAR 1999, FOX HILL

13
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,275
Ji-a.

14
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,745
Help me.

15
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,627
Help!

16
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,033
My princess, you're up.

17
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,869
I'm so relieved.

18
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,162
It was all a dream.

19
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,332
Here.

20
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,583
Let's have some fruit.

21
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,878
Mom, I love you. I love you so much.

22
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,423
What happened to you in your sleep?

23
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,968
I love you, Dad. I love you so much.

24
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,219
Gosh.

25
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,846
I really love you too, Ji-a.

26
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,766
So did you have a bad dream or something?

27
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,976
Don't make me remember.

28
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,756
A fire broke out at Samho 2-dong,
in Seongjin Market this evening,

29
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,675
causing massive casualties.

30
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,303
The fire broke out around 7:00 p.m.,

31
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,014
extinguished only after
burning down three buildings.

32
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:12,937
The current number of casualties reported
are at a total of 22 people.

33
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:19,610
The flames were fanned by stocks
piled up in a dead space…

34
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,570
Mom.

35
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,364
I'm hungry.

36
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,034
Have some fruit.

37
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,494
No, I want to have

38
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,330
walnut cakes.

39
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,461
Where did we keep the walnut cakes?

40
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,554
I think we're out of walnut cakes.

41
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,890
Could we just buy it tomorrow?

42
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,558
We don't have any walnut cakes.

43
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:55,146
I once had to go to the hospital
for a nut allergy.

44
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,483
That's right. I forgot.

45
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,859
You would never.

46
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,153
My mom is a doctor.

47
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,574
I was too tired, so I made a mistake.

48
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,535
You aren't my mom!

49
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:11,829
Ji-a.

50
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,164
Where's my mom?

51
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,750
I'm your mother!

52
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,920
Honey!

53
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,403
Ji-a, open the door.

54
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,946
I need to talk to you.

55
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,240
Good girl.

56
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,408
Ji-a.

57
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,294
Look at this brat.

58
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,665
A-eum.

59
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,126
Are you A-eum?

60
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,154
You're not.

61
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,907
You're not A-eum.

62
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,250
Forget everything you saw today.

63
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,963
If you don't…

64
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,102
Route 144, Fox Hill.

65
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,854
A car is overturned.

66
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,858
I see blood from the driver
and the passenger's side.

67
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,485
They lost a lot of blood.

68
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,822
But I don't see any bodies.

69
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,000
Mom.

70
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,794
Dad.

71
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,796
Yes, only one girl survived.

72
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,924
Mom! Dad!

73
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,592
Little girl, are you okay?

74
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,096
My mom and dad are missing.

75
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,349
Please help me find my parents.

76
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,768
I'll find your parents. Don't worry.

77
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,145
Do you remember what happened
during the accident?

78
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,730
Were you alone the whole time?

79
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:38,369
21 YEARS LATER

80
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,039
WEDDING
2020, AUGUST 29, SATURDAY

81
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,994
Eat your breakfast first
before you eat your ice cream.

82
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,357
There wasn't any rain forecast.

83
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,525
Tell me about it. I got my hair done too.

84
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,070
-I'm all wet. My goodness.
-Your hair is all wet.

85
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,905
-Oh no.
-Goodness.

86
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,032
A fox is getting married today.

87
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,826
What was that?

88
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,132
-Take our picture.
-Sure.

89
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,300
I'll do it.

90
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,760
One, two, three.

91
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,720
-Let me see.
-Let's see.

92
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,014
-Do I look okay?
-You look wonderful.

93
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,557
I never got an invitation.

94
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,021
Can you give us a minute?

95
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,523
Who is it? Your ex-boyfriend?

96
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,691
Let us meet him too.

97
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,192
Get out.

98
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,164
Why are you here, Yeon?

99
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,291
I'm not here for the bouquet.

100
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:50,918
How did you find me?

101
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,795
How did you go completely off the grid?

102
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,756
Did you think
your bloody past would change

103
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,383
along with your face and identity?

104
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,469
But getting a new life

105
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,097
isn't as simple as subway transfers.

106
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:05,850
Let me go.

107
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:06,767
It's too late.

108
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,728
I've changed. I don't hurt people.

109
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,021
Goodness, Fox Sister.

110
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,567
You ate the livers of countless
stepparents and brothers.

111
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,610
How could you dream of a happy ending?

112
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,993
I'm in love.

113
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,120
I want to live as a human, please.

114
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,079
How romantic.

115
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,790
But you're still going to die today.

116
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,375
You've been in love with a human.

117
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,043
You understand, right?

118
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,671
There's something you don't know.

119
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,048
First of all, I hate it the most

120
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,050
when people bring up my scandal.

121
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,845
Second, don't you dare

122
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,931
show your claws before me.

123
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,604
-Farewell.
-Just this once.

124
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,648
Let me see him one last time.

125
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,318
Let me advise you from experience.

126
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,028
It's better not to.

127
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,071
Please. It's my final request.

128
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,702
It's your time to go.

129
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,995
I see.

130
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,210
You have to go in now.

131
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,878
Let's go.

132
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,674
Only until the ceremony is over.

133
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:26,180
"This world may be full of creatures
that we are oblivious to,

134
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,475
and these creatures
may be living among us."

135
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,353
"The countless urban legends we hear of

136
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,480
may be another name for these creatures."

137
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,564
What do you think?

138
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,943
Did you fix up the script again?
Ms. Kim will get furious.

139
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,694
-Will this ruin her mood?
-Of course.

140
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,571
Even so, my version is better, right?

141
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,114
Of course.

142
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,282
Then go with this.

143
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,828
Producers need to be fearless
or utterly fearless.

144
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,162
You know what's mysterious?

145
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,915
I don't believe in myths or ghosts at all.

146
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,250
But I still get scared.

147
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,293
I'm not scared at all,

148
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:57,878
but I believe it.

149
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,505
You do?

150
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,715
Why? Have you ever seen
anything like this?

151
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,177
Mom.

152
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,762
Dad.

153
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,807
-Yes.
-Really?

154
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,892
You're just trying to scare me, right?

155
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,020
Let's just say that's the case.

156
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,732
What's with this awful weather?

157
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,652
It's supposed to be good luck
to rain on your wedding day.

158
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,293
-Your meal voucher.
-We're fine.

159
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,752
No, I'll take those.

160
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,255
Let's at least eat
since we gave them so much money.

161
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,008
For some reason,
I can never digest food at a wedding.

162
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,301
But why?

163
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,762
The coercive happiness I can smell
in the air is almost suffocating.

164
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,682
Try getting an injection of happiness
from time to time.

165
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,560
Who knows?
You might run into your Mr. Right here.

166
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,477
Whatever.

167
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,523
WE NEED A NEW STORY ASAP

168
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,859
I need to find the right story first.

169
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,278
Our interviewee canceled.

170
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,279
Damn it.

171
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,620
The Pyebaek Room is this way.

172
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,664
Yes, come this way. Okay, follow me. Yes.

173
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,401
The ancient lord over Baekdu Mountain.

174
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,904
You have no right to punish us.

175
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,199
What are you on about?

176
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,535
Without you, I'd be sitting at home
watching TV while eating ice cream.

177
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,164
You're a Nine-tailed Fox who stepped down
as a deity for breaking a taboo.

178
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,959
And that's why I'm here doing fieldwork.

179
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,304
Help!

180
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,640
Help!

181
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,563
Who are you?

182
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,066
You can't hide anywhere looking like that.

183
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,651
Who are you?

184
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:26,860
Who are you?

185
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,725
You really won't listen.

186
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,784
No, you can't.

187
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,094
-No.
-Don't look, please.

188
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,314
Silly girl.

189
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,734
You should've run
while you had the chance.

190
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,153
I wanted to be a bride.

191
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,533
Don't ever fall in love again
in your next life.

192
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,160
I have one last favor to ask.

193
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,287
Please…

194
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,417
get rid of only the good memories
he has of me.

195
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,212
Sure thing.

196
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,295
Listen to me.

197
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,673
As for your bride…

198
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,179
She's not the girl you dated before.

199
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,639
Hey, be quiet.

200
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,266
You're going to make huge trouble.

201
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,725
You look sharp.

202
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,561
Do I look good?

203
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,730
What the heck is going on?

204
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,651
One second.

205
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,655
Ji-a, listen. This is huge.

206
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,490
-Why?
-Their wedding is canceled.

207
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:19,950
Is that so?

208
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,720
Who was this man?

209
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,734
Do you know him?

210
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,822
-No, it's nothing.
-Should I go and check?

211
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,575
-What?
-Why did this peaceful wedding hall

212
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,119
suddenly turn into a Pandora's Box?

213
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,622
Who knows? We might find
the right story in there.

214
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,391
The bride ran away.

215
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,518
So she ran.

216
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,604
Sure, that can happen.

217
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,273
But what was this epiphany she had?

218
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,651
It costs a fortune to back out of this.

219
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,277
True love.

220
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,988
-She had a man on the side?
-Yes.

221
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,824
He came and said, "She's my woman."

222
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,953
Then the bride grabbed his hand
as if she had been waiting,

223
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,789
then said,
"I'm leaving with my true love."

224
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,500
The witnesses all said the same thing.

225
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,836
There are signs of her struggle.

226
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,048
-Bloodstains?
-They must have got physical.

227
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,758
I didn't hear anything about that.

228
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:03,262
And most importantly,
what is this dress doing here?

229
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,972
Well, because she took it off--

230
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,390
You're right.

231
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,766
What was she wearing, then?

232
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,811
The witness statements
and the crime scene are

233
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,312
telling different stories.

234
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,690
Were they all hypnotized or something?

235
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,069
I need to see
these romantics of the century.

236
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,071
Okay, I'll go find some videos.

237
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,301
It's fox hair.

238
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,260
Fox?

239
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,138
It's a red fox. Native to Korea.

240
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,307
Aren't native foxes extinct?

241
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,684
My gosh.

242
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,936
There's something you don't know.

243
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,397
Since 2012,

244
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,733
the fox restoration project began.

245
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,526
Look.

246
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,282
If these foxes were from Sobaek Mountain,

247
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,616
why was it found here?

248
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,036
One was seen at an apartment in Yeongju,

249
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,538
and one even went north,
all the way to Kaesong.

250
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,458
So it's not a big deal to see it
at a wedding in Gangnam?

251
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,544
Even wild boars rob convenience stores
when they're hungry.

252
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,801
The foxes in Sobaek Mountain are
all equipped with trackers.

253
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,929
And none of them
came down into downtown Seoul.

254
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,599
I spent two years working on
an animal show.

255
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:35,062
So, where did this come from?

256
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,781
Will you please pick up the phone?

257
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,832
I'm in love.

258
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,667
I want to live as a human, please.

259
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,586
Let's take a selfie.

260
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,382
Are you scared? Are you?

261
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,593
You've been in love with a human.

262
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,095
You understand, right?

263
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,550
Here.

264
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,011
Thank you.

265
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:51,930
So-yun.

266
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,856
Mister, are you an alien?

267
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,942
-No.
-Then what are you?

268
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,861
-A Nine-tailed Fox.
-Are you over 100?

269
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,280
Over 1,000 years old.

270
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,781
What are you doing here?

271
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,703
I'm just waiting

272
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,662
for someone.

273
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,580
Who?

274
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,831
My first love.

275
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:18,748
Why?

276
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:25,255
Because foxes never forsake their partners

277
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,673
until death do us part.

278
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:30,010
My mom also waits
for the delivery man every day.

279
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,386
He comes in two nights.

280
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,014
But my love won't,

281
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,558
even after 100 or 1,000 nights.

282
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,310
-Are you okay?
-I'm not okay.

283
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,479
-Do you want me to be your friend?
-No.

284
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,938
Why not?

285
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,607
Your nose.

286
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,817
I don't like guys with runny noses.

287
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,530
And the human lifespan is
too short to be friends with me.

288
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,914
I'm saying life is short.

289
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,917
So do your best in your life,

290
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,294
but don't endure things
that are too hard to bear.

291
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,756
People you can't take or love,

292
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,050
and so on and so forth.

293
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,824
AFTERLIFE BORDER CONTROL

294
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:39,204
CRACKDOWN PERIOD AGAINST ILLEGAL SPIRITS

295
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,957
AFTERLIFE BORDER CONTROL

296
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,235
What's up, Granny?

297
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,660
WANTED: MURDERER

298
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,502
You haven't been here in awhile.

299
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,838
I've been busy, thanks to you.

300
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,510
I never expected to see
the great Taluipa wrestle with a computer.

301
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,887
What else can I do?
I have to go with the times.

302
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,767
We need to introduce a five-day workweek
in the afterlife.

303
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,978
Did you get my text?

304
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,731
-Yes, the Fox Sister?
-Why did you ignore it?

305
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:51,526
Do you think I have time to listen
to sinners telling their stories?

306
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,529
When you're told to arrest them,
you just have to arrest them.

307
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,410
How long do I have to keep doing this?

308
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,038
Are you crazy?

309
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,790
Was the food poisoned at the wedding?

310
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,168
I've been on mandatory service
for over 600 years.

311
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,753
Of course, I've gone crazy.

312
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,088
Mandatory service?

313
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,551
Hey, no one made you give up your life
as a mountain deity to live like this.

314
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,221
You chose this in exchange
for that girl's reincarnation!

315
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,686
"Lee Yeon,
the former deity of Baekdu Mountain,

316
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,355
shall punish those who disturb

317
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:31,066
the border of the two worlds
in return for A-eum's rebirth

318
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,984
and repay this kindness."

319
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,196
Didn't you say
foxes repay kindness no matter what?

320
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,322
Damn it.

321
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,539
Do you want to get discharged?

322
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,515
-You're going to hell.
-What did you say?

323
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,100
I'll pray with fresh water.

324
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,518
You disrespectful punk.

325
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,560
You little--

326
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,689
Go easy on the glucosamine.

327
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,274
Your joints would do better
if you were nice.

328
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,985
HYEONUIONG
THE GUARDIAN OF SAMDOCHEON RIVER

329
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,071
-Hey, Yeon. You're here. Hi.
-You're back.

330
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,323
What?

331
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,617
You're leaving already?

332
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,247
Honey!

333
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,502
Have some tteokbokki.

334
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,629
I lost my appetite because of that punk.

335
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,299
Gosh, don't be so cruel.

336
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,928
Think about how brokenhearted he is
waiting for that dead woman.

337
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,180
Not again.

338
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,224
You're talking like a softy again.

339
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,768
You know nothing about love.

340
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,021
I'll have all the tteokbokki myself.

341
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,108
Mr. Lee, why won't you pick up?

342
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,192
What is it?

343
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,319
It's code red!

344
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,488
-So what is it?
-Where are you?

345
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,711
NATIVE KOREAN RED FOX

346
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,341
Someone tampered with my script again.

347
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,719
Are you picking a fight?

348
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,220
I'm really sorry, Sae-rom.

349
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,848
That's no way for someone
who's sorry to be acting.

350
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,267
-They're at it again.
-Should we fight?

351
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,186
-Yes, let's fight.
-Hey, no fighting.

352
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,937
You stay out of this, Chief.

353
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,773
I'm back.

354
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,567
-Any luck?
-Well, that's a bit of a gray area.

355
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,860
What? The elopers?

356
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,987
Hey, bring it here. Let me see them.

357
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,866
A red umbrella, and embroidered at that.

358
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,493
Look at that wicked taste.

359
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,453
I picked out only the best ones.

360
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,789
This is when he comes in,
then when he leaves.

361
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:54,626
Gosh, his face is
completely covered by the umbrella.

362
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:55,960
Wait a minute.

363
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:59,506
-It didn't rain after the wedding.
-He planned this ahead, didn't he?

364
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,385
I understand how he came in alone,

365
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,471
-but why is he leaving alone?
-She's gone.

366
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,766
-What?
-I looked through all the videos,

367
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,602
but there's no footage
of the bride leaving the wedding.

368
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,837
Were you listening?

369
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,380
-To what?
-That--

370
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,550
That director brought fox hair.

371
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,051
-Did you get caught?
-No way.

372
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,178
I've been in this world for years.

373
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,264
Sometimes I wonder
if I'm a person or a fox.

374
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,974
It's an existential crisis.

375
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,727
-Way to go.
-I have a bad feeling about this.

376
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,614
Did you enjoy your food?

377
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,783
-It wasn't bad.
-Installment?

378
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,826
Make it a lump sum.

379
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,415
Mr. Lee.

380
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,250
Look. Look at that!

381
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,459
Why?

382
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,087
INFORMATION WANTED

383
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,673
Right? What do we do now?

384
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,636
You should ditch that umbrella
for the time being.

385
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,471
This? No way.

386
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,599
Go tell her this.

387
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,434
Catch me if you can.

388
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,521
Are you serious? What?

389
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:43,276
TRADITIONAL KOREAN CUISINE
SNAIL BRIDE

390
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,653
I said something didn't feel right.

391
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,323
She's infamous in the TV industry.

392
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,838
-You're the interviewee, right?
-Yes.

393
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,132
I'm the producer
of Searching for Urban Legends.

394
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,967
Could you give me an autograph later?

395
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,219
I watch this
at least 20 times per episode.

396
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,304
Have a seat.

397
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,518
So, you saw him?

398
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,732
-I did.
-Who is this?

399
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,111
A monster.

400
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,990
-A monster?
-He never ages or dies.

401
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,369
You know,
like goblins and aliens in dramas.

402
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,918
-You don't believe me, do you?
-To be honest, no.

403
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,545
Don't take me as a joke.

404
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,922
I never lie.

405
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,674
If I may ask, what do you do?

406
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,843
Studying for the ninth-grade
civil servant exam.

407
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,096
Where are you from?

408
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,597
Yeongam, South Jeolla Province.

409
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,558
My mom,
who lived her whole life as a farmer,

410
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,644
wants to see me work an office job.

411
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,146
Take care, then.

412
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,940
I'm not done yet.

413
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:07,235
Your background doesn't match your shoes.

414
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,989
No student would wear custom-made shoes
that cost four million won.

415
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,700
And I don't detect
Jeolla dialect in your accent.

416
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,285
So I shouldn't waste my time, right?

417
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,663
-Goodbye.
-The Fox Hill.

418
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,043
Fox Hill?

419
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,089
That's where I saw him.

420
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,804
Why should I believe something

421
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,514
from someone who's unidentifiable?

422
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,767
Why don't you check for yourself?

423
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,128
You're back.

424
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,341
I picked out the wrong shoes.

425
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,552
And of course, she didn't miss them.

426
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:15,928
Then why are you smiling?

427
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,346
I like her.

428
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,099
Gosh. What about her?

429
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,393
From her head to toe.

430
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,147
Then let's eat her.

431
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,066
From her head to toe.

432
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,400
Not yet.

433
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,414
-Which flavor would you like?
-Mint chocolate chip.

434
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,500
You always have that flavor.

435
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,962
I gave you a lot today.
You're a regular here.

436
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,761
Just give me the exact amount from now on.

437
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:57,970
I'm sorry?

438
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,307
I can't help but repay people's kindness
for a reason.

439
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,610
Damn it.

440
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,452
The number you have dialed doesn't exist.

441
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,329
-Long time no see.
-What do you want?

442
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:25,706
What do you mean?
I called because I missed you.

443
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,751
-What are you doing?
-I'm busy. Bye.

444
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,878
I don't think you are.

445
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,050
We need to meet.

446
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,802
I refuse.

447
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,512
I'll set your house on fire.

448
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,641
Acting like a grade school kid
at over 600 isn't cute.

449
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,184
-You'll regret it.
-I won't.

450
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,644
Are you still waiting

451
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,980
for your dead girlfriend?

452
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,236
I heard an interesting rumor.

453
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,197
Should I tell you or not?

454
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,870
Don't screw around.

455
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,038
Come out if you're curious.

456
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,189
Tonight, get on the bus
at the bus stop I mentioned.

457
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,232
But there's one condition.

458
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,609
A condition?

459
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,860
You have to come alone.

460
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,656
SEONGHAN-DONG COMMUNITY SERVICE CENTER

461
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,758
SEARCHING FOR URBAN LEGENDS

462
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,678
Excuse me. Are you a producer?

463
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,724
-Yes.
-I want to be a producer too.

464
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,976
You should try to do something else.

465
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,687
I've been on duty for 22 hours.

466
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,871
Goodness! Oh, my legs.

467
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,791
-I'm going to die!
-Sir, are you okay?

468
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,422
Are you getting on or not?

469
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,675
I am. One second.

470
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,468
Get up. I'll take you to a doctor.

471
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,428
Let go!

472
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,138
Sir, I have to take this bus.

473
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,432
Hey, driver. Cut it out and let's go.

474
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,060
-You won't get in?
-I'm getting on. Hold on.

475
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,520
Don't go, you brat.

476
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,397
-Sir!
-Don't go, you brat!

477
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,615
It's him.

478
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,076
Wait!

479
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,613
Where do you live again?

480
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,907
Just get me to the guardian tree up ahead.

481
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,704
But sir,

482
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,123
you are

483
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,417
much heavier than you look.

484
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,338
This is weird.

485
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,299
He's unusually heavy.

486
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,344
And I can't hear him breathing.

487
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,763
Excuse me, sir.

488
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,069
That hurts.

489
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,899
Please.

490
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,402
Your hand--

491
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,825
We're here.

492
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:16,372
You should cut down on the drinks
from now on.

493
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,541
Don't try to take the credit over this.

494
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,668
I've already repaid you.

495
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,254
What?

496
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,765
Excuse me, sir.

497
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,520
-Where are you headed?
-Let's follow the bus 1002.

498
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:52,241
Sir, do you remember
the old man who was behind me?

499
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:55,161
Who? I only saw you standing here.

500
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:39,580
Hello?
There's been an accident. Route 144.

501
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:41,040
Yes, it's Fox Hill.

502
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,752
Fox Hill?

503
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,226
Route 144, Fox Hill.

504
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,771
My mom and dad are missing.

505
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:09,860
No.

506
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,744
Excuse me.

507
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:32,216
Hey, please wake up.

508
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,158
Hey, kid.

509
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,910
Kid.

510
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,025
I said no photos!

511
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,526
Hey, don't let him take photos.

512
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,861
Come on.

513
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,279
Hey, Ji-a.

514
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,615
What are you doing here?

515
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:42,036
Detective Baek,
you almost found my corpse today.

516
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,287
What are you saying?

517
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,665
-I almost got on that bus.
-What?

518
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:50,586
I was going to get on that bus.

519
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,464
-Really?
-Five dead, one survivor.

520
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,923
Really?

521
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,717
-We're one person short.
-What?

522
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,927
There were seven people on this bus.

523
00:43:59,011 --> 00:43:59,845
Are you sure?

524
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,972
I know what I saw.

525
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,521
He's the only one missing.

526
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,107
No bodies, no nothing.

527
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,567
I'm sure he got off.

528
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,528
No, this bus didn't make a stop.

529
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,907
There are no bus stops before the tunnel.

530
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,788
I need to check something. Come out!

531
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,748
Come on!

532
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,089
"Only one survives
among the six passengers."

533
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:39,927
Let's go.

534
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,637
Too many people have died.

535
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,472
-So?
-Just leave it.

536
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,224
I have to resolve this myself.

537
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,281
Su-yeong, do you recognize me?

538
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,034
We met at the bus stop.

539
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,581
Do you remember
how the accident broke out?

540
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,761
It must be scary to think
you're the only one who survived.

541
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,725
I was in a similar accident
a long time ago.

542
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,810
That's why I'm alone.

543
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,272
If you wanted,

544
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:36,692
a tragedy can
turn into a very convenient shield.

545
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,028
Everyone will be
dying to sympathize with you.

546
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,866
But I want you to be strong.

547
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:49,079
It's much more fun to be a producer
than to live as a victim.

548
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,771
Call me if you need anything.

549
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,777
On the bus,

550
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,113
did you see a young man
sitting by the window to the right?

551
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,075
He had an umbrella like this.

552
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,752
You saw him.

553
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,297
What did you see?
What was it that you're so--

554
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,466
He'll be here.

555
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,301
What?

556
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,053
He'll come to kill me.

557
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:49,306
He'll be here to kill me too.

558
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,229
Jae-hwan, tell Detective Baek

559
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,606
to send security to the hospital.

560
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,108
Yes. What about the CCTV from the bus?

561
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,151
It was down.

562
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:05,030
It's the same as the wedding hall.

563
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,825
-Traffic cameras?
-No, nothing at the entrance or the exit.

564
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:20,671
I'm looking for a high school girl
who came after a bus accident yesterday.

565
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,715
Are you here with her?

566
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:24,800
What?

567
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,312
I found him.

568
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,696
UJIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

569
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,534
A TV producer? So what is it?

570
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:52,828
That voice--

571
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:54,663
Could he be--

572
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,332
What do you think?

573
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,251
Are you casting a new talent?

574
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,670
But I'm sorry.

575
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,714
I can't dance or sing.

576
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,718
The only talent I have is my looks.

577
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,889
I am casting you for something,
but that's not what I'm after.

578
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,974
-Then what?
-Fox Hill.

579
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,269
Is this for a horror movie?

580
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,730
Well, it's a kind of urban legend.

581
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,443
For example,
a passenger on bus 1002 has gone missing,

582
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,611
as if he vanished.

583
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:29,114
It doesn't sound like a great movie.

584
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,116
Besides,
I'm a romantic comedy kind of guy.

585
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,581
How about this?

586
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,545
Bright colors do look good on camera.

587
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:50,385
I don't know if it's a coincidence,
but I've met you three times already.

588
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:53,722
At first, the wedding hall
where the bride suddenly disappeared.

589
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,682
The second time, on bus 1002.

590
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:59,394
The third, right here, where the victim
of the accident is hospitalized.

591
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,610
Let's just call it fate.

592
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:07,694
Unfortunately, though,

593
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,071
I'm seeing someone.

594
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,906
Unlike my looks, I'm a faithful guy.

595
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,409
Did you kill her?

596
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,918
Or are you here to kill her?

597
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,049
I found someone I want to kill

598
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,301
just now.

599
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,816
He said he'll be here in ten. Where is he?

600
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,821
Normally, when someone asks
such a rude question,

601
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,572
don't they usually come prepared?

602
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,534
You know, with evidence or witnesses.

603
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,704
Or at least a police ID.

604
00:49:58,787 --> 00:49:59,997
That's right.

605
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,707
I was awfully rude.

606
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,917
-I'm sorry.
-Forget the halfhearted apology.

607
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,880
You haven't even touched your coffee.

608
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,466
Have some.

609
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,302
I don't eat anything from strangers.

610
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,846
It's a dangerous world out here.

611
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:19,141
One more thing.

612
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,059
What now?

613
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,060
What's your name?

614
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:23,729
Well,

615
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,188
find out if you can.

616
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:27,691
Hey.

617
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,112
At least take my business card.

618
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,363
It's in there.

619
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,660
It's not a blind date or anything.

620
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,871
I refuse to see you again.

621
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,217
Jae-hwan, it's me.

622
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,762
Ask Mr. Baek to take a fingerprint.

623
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,306
Yes.

624
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,435
From a leather bag.

625
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,314
You two are meant to be in a way.

626
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:11,151
The little girl you saved 20 years ago
suddenly showed up.

627
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,445
She probably doesn't even remember.

628
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:14,613
I don't like her.

629
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,198
She does look like her.

630
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,450
She surprises me every time I see her.

631
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,494
You need to stop giving advice
to that show.

632
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:24,039
No! My livelihood is at stake.

633
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,707
It's only a third-rate show.

634
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,668
And the only show you like.
Searching for Urban Legends.

635
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,379
You even posted something
on their web page,

636
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,381
that the Grim Reaper's costume is wrong.

637
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,801
I know a thing or two about Grim Reapers.

638
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,302
Just drive.

639
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:21,847
Su-yeong, are you okay?

640
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,433
I told you not to leave her alone!

641
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,978
I was only gone for five minutes.

642
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:30,522
-You didn't catch him?
-My boys didn't see anyone.

643
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,691
Are you sure it wasn't a dream?

644
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,734
It wasn't!

645
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,028
Ji-a, I don't want to stay here.

646
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,238
I have to get out.

647
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,116
Su-yeong.

648
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,579
If I stay here,

649
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:47,914
I'll die.

650
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,091
LOOKING FOR MISSING PARENTS

651
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,562
MYSTERIOUS DEATH AT FOX HILL

652
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,153
It's mine. See if it fits you.

653
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,322
I'm sorry to trouble you.

654
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,449
It's just for one night.

655
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,659
Where's your family?

656
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,162
I live alone, so make yourself at home.

657
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,925
So you're alone.

658
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,728
When was she discharged?

659
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:52,896
Just now.

660
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:55,732
She asked me to give this to you.

661
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,236
-Who did?
-The woman who took the patient.

662
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:29,474
Su-yeong.

663
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,686
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

664
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,396
I remembered

665
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:37,607
what happened in the tunnel that day.

666
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:49,703
The bus

667
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,539
went into the tunnel.

668
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,626
I took my earphones off,

669
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,714
and noticed it was dead quiet.

670
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,456
Hey, kid. Come with us--

671
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,045
They all died.

672
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,382
Then in the darkness,

673
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,219
that man came toward me.

674
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:52,182
-That man?
-The man with the umbrella.

675
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:56,102
What did he do?

676
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,691
He tried to kill me.

677
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,738
I was so scared.

678
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:17,415
It's okay. It's going to be okay.

679
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,628
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

680
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,755
-Lift up your feet.
-I'm okay.

681
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,425
Anyway, Su-yeong.

682
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,844
Where were you going at that hour?

683
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,181
What? I was heading home--

684
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,308
I checked your address.

685
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:39,437
Aren't you supposed to take the bus
from the bus stop across the street?

686
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,815
That day, I was--

687
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,442
Stop making stuff up.

688
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:48,822
Ji-a.

689
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,458
When did you figure it out?

690
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:07,590
In a car accident, humans end up

691
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,009
protecting themselves on instinct.

692
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:16,474
But there were no defense marks
on the sole survivor's body.

693
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,901
I don't believe in miracles.

694
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:29,487
Who are you?

695
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,368
I might be someone you know,

696
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:38,705
but then I'm not.

697
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:42,792
How--

698
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,881
-Where's the real Su-yeong?
-I ate her.

699
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,727
Did you think you could hurt me with this?

700
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:03,521
No way.

701
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,940
I just

702
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,775
used myself as the bait.

703
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,569
Bait?

704
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,450
You! Didn't I tell you
that I refuse to see you again?

705
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:18,077
I'm taking what you want back to my house.

706
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,788
I don't think this is the right time.

707
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,542
Damn it.

708
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,677
-Missed me?
-Do you want to die, little brother?

709
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:35,929
Little brother?

710
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,932
It's a long story,
but we're sort of a broken family.

711
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,863
This is why it's important
to be raised properly.

712
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,225
How many people have you killed?

713
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:25,144
-Are you worried that I'll go to hell?
-Damn it.

714
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,396
No, you're embarrassing.

715
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,357
I just didn't want to live
a pathetic life like you.

716
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,652
What's more pathetic is you
whining at that age.

717
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,703
Wait, time out.

718
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,496
Let's make a bet instead of fighting.

719
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,832
Are you still into that?

720
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,376
Find her before the end of next month,

721
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:49,711
or your girl will die.

722
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,633
-What?
-As you know, I'm not kidding.

723
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:00,346
I'll see you later.

724
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,699
Hey, who are you guys--

725
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,246
Forget everything.

726
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,706
Everything about me.

727
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,802
DETECTIVE BAEK

728
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,808
It's the fingerprint you wanted.

729
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,352
I just had it checked.

730
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:54,901
Did you think you could hurt me with this?

731
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,447
I just used myself as the bait.

732
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:01,866
Bait?

733
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:02,867
Sin-ju?

734
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,746
Why are the doors all opened?

735
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,706
-Missed me?
-Do you want to die, little brother?

736
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:09,874
Little brother?

737
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:12,251
It's a long story,
but we're sort of a broken family.

738
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,586
What's this sound?

739
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,590
This is why it's important
to be raised properly.

740
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,183
How many people have you killed?

741
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,268
Are you worried that I'll go to hell?

742
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,229
Damn it. No, you're embarrassing.

743
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,940
I just didn't want to live
a pathetic life like you.

744
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,818
What's more pathetic is you
whining at that age.

745
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:51,499
Do you like it?

746
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,669
How did you find me?

747
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,589
Name, Lee Yeon. 36 years old.

748
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,551
I'm sure it's a fake identity.

749
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:04,220
At this point,
it's not a coincidence, but fate.

750
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:06,764
You still remember everything?

751
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,684
Whatever it is that you do,
it must not work on me.

752
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:12,895
What do you want?

753
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,482
The original is here.
Come and get it if you want.

754
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,874
I knew you weren't human.

755
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,253
Were you testing me?

756
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,057
Forget what you saw today. Everything.

757
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,391
If you don't…

758
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:37,855
I'll kill you.

759
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:41,400
I've been

760
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,653
waiting for you.

761
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,633
A price?

762
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:51,095
I'll take away those eyes that saw things
they shouldn't have seen.

763
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:54,682
I'm going to keep pestering him
until one of us is dead.

764
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,685
Go back to your world.

765
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,396
I'm desperate.

766
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:03,274
Is this a motion sickness patch?

767
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:05,610
Are you sure it's hidden here?

768
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:08,779
Don't look for her.
She'll change your destiny once again.

769
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,948
A-eum was reborn, wasn't she?

770
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:12,617
Just don't disappear before me.

771
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,702
Do you really want to see it?

772
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,454
The world I live in?

773
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:21,542
