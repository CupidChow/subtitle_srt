1
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,303
They're gone.

2
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,139
-What?
-Everyone is gone.

3
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:57,932
What are you saying?

4
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,269
It's as if the entire village
vanished into thin air,

5
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,229
and there isn't a soul around.

6
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,150
EOHWA SUPERMARKET

7
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,236
-What about the restroom?
-Gone.

8
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,155
-What?
-That dead body is gone now.

9
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,535
It became deserted overnight.

10
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,204
They weren't dragged against their will.

11
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,165
There are no traces of a fight
or anyone's reluctance.

12
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,626
They must be on a group tour or something.

13
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,169
Along with the dead body?

14
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,840
No one took their wallets or bags,
or any other belongings.

15
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,091
Only the people are gone.

16
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,011
Where did they all go?

17
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,805
They're gone?

18
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:19,973
Okay.

19
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,893
A total of 22 families, all 41 people?

20
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,938
Okay, I'll send backup.

21
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,065
-Call me if anyone is dead or hurt.
-Okay.

22
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,907
What is it?

23
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,075
Those.

24
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,452
When were those put up?

25
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:02,724
There's a common superstition
that says bamboo trees call for ghosts.

26
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,268
-Is it true?
-It's hollow inside.

27
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,271
The wandering dead won't find
a better guesthouse than this.

28
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,860
Doesn't it look like a path was made?

29
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,778
-The Dragon King's Road.
-Right.

30
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,156
I've seen it on Jeju Island
during a folk festival.

31
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,991
It welcomes the Dragon King, right?

32
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,744
It does, but it's in the wrong direction.

33
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,539
Come to think about it,

34
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,917
this is the southwest.

35
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,377
The Gate of Demons.

36
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,048
It's where unclean spirits come and go.

37
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,302
That means what they wanted to call in

38
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,554
definitely wasn't the Dragon King.

39
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,480
Hello, I'm Hyeonuiong
of the Afterlife Border Control.

40
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,025
Yes. Is the King of the Underworld
doing all right?

41
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,654
I'm calling today
for more shrouds for the dead.

42
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,782
Could you have it delivered
by early tomorrow morning?

43
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,201
All right. Okay. Of course.

44
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,161
Keep it up, then. Goodbye.

45
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,880
-What happened?
-This is a huge problem.

46
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,590
Is it really the same serpent?

47
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,759
And even you can't spot its whereabouts?

48
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,761
Did it use a talisman?

49
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,346
It went completely off the grid.

50
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,932
Shouldn't we let Yeon know?

51
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,769
Don't make a fuss.
We can't let Yeon hear of this.

52
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,229
-But still-- okay.
-Silence.

53
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,863
Was this it?

54
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,535
Is this why I couldn't see anything
in Yeon's future?

55
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,958
Hey.

56
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,671
I heard a weird sound late last night.

57
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,131
What sound?

58
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,966
It sounded like a baby.

59
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,430
Elaborate.

60
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,183
It was a little over two o'clock.

61
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,186
I woke up from thirst.

62
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,025
At first, I thought it was a stray cat.

63
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,235
But it wasn't.

64
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,362
It was definitely a baby.

65
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,158
But no one on this island was pregnant.

66
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,328
All the ladies are well over 70.

67
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,372
-What time was it?
-It was 2:40 a.m.

68
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,541
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

69
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,294
The clock had stopped.

70
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,422
Both my wall clock and the table clock.

71
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,802
My watch stopped too.
And it's also at 2:40.

72
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,389
The hour of the ox.

73
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,682
BETWEEN 1:00 A.M. TO 3:00 A.M.

74
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,726
It's when the door to the other side
opens up.

75
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,103
What on earth was born last night?

76
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:22,340
Happy birthday, dear Yu-ri

77
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,510
Happy birthday to you

78
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,889
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations, Yu-ri.

79
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,974
-This is from me.
-And from me.

80
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,486
-Thanks, Mom, Dad.
-Do you like it?

81
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,031
Of course, I'm so happy that I could cry.

82
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,746
Yu-ri, when will you get married?

83
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,040
She's still young.

84
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,085
-She's 24. She's not that young.
-She's 25.

85
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,758
No, she was 24 years old.

86
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,177
Dad, do you have dementia?

87
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:14,725
That accident broke out when she was 24,
her senior year in college.

88
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,727
What accident?

89
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,064
Yu-ri went trekking in Nepal,

90
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,984
then fell to her death.

91
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,403
Don't say such terrible things.

92
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:31,075
No, I clearly remember
checking her dead body--

93
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,955
Dad, I told you to forget
such useless memories, didn't I?

94
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,876
Who are you?

95
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,093
Why would you buy me a phone?

96
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,637
Since my brother is the one
who stole your phone.

97
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,848
It's not out of kindness,
but taking responsibility.

98
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,516
So maintain the 48-month contract.

99
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,268
Pay up if you want to cancel it.

100
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,314
I installed an app, so don't pick up calls
from strangers and my brother.

101
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,400
You're unexpectedly tech-savvy.

102
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,987
It's not easy living an analog lifestyle.

103
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,823
What?

104
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,910
This time last year, I got a call
from the Seoul Prosecutors' Office

105
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,079
telling me someone dare stole my identity!

106
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,873
A phishing scam?

107
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,374
I lost 20 million won,

108
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,543
then ripped out the con man's ears.

109
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,879
It wasn't enough. I couldn't sleep.

110
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,175
Punch it in.

111
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,847
Your number. You just told me
not to pick up unknown numbers.

112
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,393
Don't you already have
enough information on me?

113
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,687
I couldn't finish
our interview last night,

114
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,106
and I want more on you
now that I got started.

115
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,110
Sounds great.

116
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,071
You're pretty consistent.

117
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,198
People criticize me over that.

118
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,742
Okay, then. See you around.

119
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,472
It's me.
The one you love the most in this world.

120
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,163
What did you wish for?

121
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,585
For my daughter, Yu-ri,
to come back to life.

122
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,296
And I made it come true.

123
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,217
So who is she again?

124
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,886
My daughter, Ki Yu-ri.

125
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,972
She's 25,

126
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,225
and she'll inherit my department store.

127
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,520
Okay. You two may go.

128
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,569
Mr. Lee, I missed you.

129
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,238
Did you meet that vet?

130
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,574
-Yes.
-How did it go?

131
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,410
He was cuter than I thought.

132
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,912
He got scared stiff
when I showed him my gun.

133
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,750
You can keep that.
He'll come back for it in time.

134
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,461
And when he does, may I kill him?

135
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,670
Yu-ri.

136
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,299
Do you know
when baby clams are the most delicious?

137
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,426
-I'm not sure.
-When peach blossoms bloom.

138
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,513
That's when the shell hardens
and the flesh begins to glisten.

139
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,351
You need to learn to wait
to find good ingredients.

140
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,894
I see.

141
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,857
Make sure you have a lot of fun with him.

142
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,610
He's also something that Yeon cherishes.

143
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,527
Okay.

144
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,447
Are you leaving?

145
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,408
Yeon is probably
dying to see me right now.

146
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,577
I should go meet him now.

147
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,418
So why here?

148
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,713
I got curious.
You're always hanging out in this place.

149
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,509
-I want a bite of the mint chocolate chip.
-Don't touch it.

150
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,055
It tastes like I'm eating chocolate
with pain relief patches.

151
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,556
Why do you eat this thing?

152
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,687
-That's enough playing. Tell me.
-Tell you what?

153
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,897
Where did everyone on that island go?

154
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,440
Why would I care?

155
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,776
It's not like you care about their lives.

156
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,574
Something that isn't human
got mixed in with them.

157
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,079
Well, I did hear some rumor

158
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,581
that something interesting
was in the mountain well.

159
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,878
-What is it?
-Why?

160
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,464
Do you think it might be that thing?

161
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,300
The snake that came between you
and that woman.

162
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,059
It already died by my hands.

163
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,603
Life doesn't always go the way you like.

164
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,149
-What do you mean?
-Who knows?

165
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,986
But I can tell you this for sure.

166
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,573
Your girl,

167
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,034
will fail to die
a natural death in this life too.

168
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,546
Have you ever heard
of the vanishing effect?

169
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,631
Vanishing, as in disappearing?

170
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,926
It's when people disappear
as if they've all evaporated.

171
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:46,182
There was a similar case on an island

172
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,558
in North Carolina, US.

173
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:51,854
Everyone on this island disappeared
in the year 1590.

174
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,774
All of their household items
and valuables remained.

175
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,983
Just the people went missing.

176
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,867
How did you end up this twisted?

177
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,495
You left the forest
for your damned romance.

178
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,205
And 600 years have passed.

179
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,832
And I lived all those years cursing you.

180
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,631
What do you want me to do?

181
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,054
There's only one way you can stop me.

182
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,475
Kill me now.

183
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,853
With your own hands.

184
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,860
Kill me.

185
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,696
Just like the time you came for me.

186
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,429
Please spare my life. Please.

187
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,056
Please spare me.

188
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,017
Rang.

189
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:29,952
Yeon.

190
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,372
Is that really you?

191
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,390
It has been so long. You were alive?

192
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,352
I couldn't reach you after you got
to the Samdocheon. I thought you died.

193
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,231
I missed you.

194
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,692
I missed you to death, Yeon.

195
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,903
Why didn't you come and get me?

196
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,741
I did.

197
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,993
I went there,

198
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,745
but I couldn't find you.

199
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,790
I lost you.

200
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:23,088
After you left,
people set the mountain on fire.

201
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,342
I was going to wait for you there,

202
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,386
but it was burning hot and scary.

203
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,181
Is that why you killed all these people?

204
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,141
Yes.

205
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,226
Even those who were innocent?

206
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,983
Their existence itself was sinful.

207
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,028
I just killed off an entire village.

208
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,657
They all knelt before me
and begged me to spare them.

209
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,034
I see.

210
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,332
My little brother, who could
never harm a wounded dog,

211
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,129
has changed so much.

212
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,965
Let's do this together.

213
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,509
Let's show these humans who we are.

214
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:15,975
Rang.

215
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,726
Yes?

216
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,238
Your sword.

217
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,538
Draw your sword.

218
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,376
What are you talking about, Yeon?

219
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,837
This is an order
from the ten kings of the afterlife.

220
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,186
Lee Rang, you have slaughtered
many innocent lives.

221
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,316
You shall

222
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,278
pay for your sins with your life.

223
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,643
You're a real asshole.

224
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,104
You left me over a woman,

225
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,315
then you betrayed me for your duties.

226
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,693
All you want is to do good deeds
to have that woman be reborn, right?

227
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,571
You barely missed a vital spot,

228
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,697
but if I died then,

229
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,492
I'd be rolling around
the Hell of Fire by now.

230
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,913
Why?
Can't you bring yourself to do it again?

231
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,502
Kill me.

232
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,712
Only then will she live.

233
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,305
Sure. It's not a bad idea
ending your life now

234
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,015
instead of living so recklessly.

235
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,311
Do it.

236
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,505
Why?

237
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,924
Why can't you do it?

238
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,845
Don't act like an abandoned kid.

239
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,847
You aren't a kid anymore.

240
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,479
I can do this.

241
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,149
But do you know why I won't?

242
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:14,027
Because I want to see
the kind of face you'll make

243
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,821
when she dies before you again.

244
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,739
No matter how wicked you want to be,

245
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,701
I know this isn't the real you.

246
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,662
What?

247
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,123
Bye.

248
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,598
Don't let it leak to the media
for the time being.

249
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,641
I can keep my mouth shut fine.

250
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,810
But what about
the families of those missing?

251
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:47,895
There aren't any.

252
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,563
What?

253
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,356
They have no family or relatives.

254
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,484
-All 41 residents?
-None.

255
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,654
What's eerier is that
they all weren't from the island.

256
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,158
-Then?
-In the 1950s, they all moved in at once

257
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,826
on the same day, on the same boat.

258
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,132
Do you know how it feels
living with your boss?

259
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,800
Sin-ju.

260
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,886
Don't ever get married.

261
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,222
I'm not even dating.

262
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,308
Marriage for a man is
like making an own goal. Remember that.

263
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:30,312
Your in-law is King of the Underworld.
It's a winning goal during injury time.

264
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,481
Are you the referee?

265
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,608
Are you the judge of my life?

266
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:38,278
Come on. Stop taking it out on Sin-ju.

267
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,573
Snail Bride, don't ever get remarried.

268
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,742
Continue to live as a widow.

269
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,411
Don't curse her.

270
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,749
I would've punched you first
if it hadn't been for your brother-in-law.

271
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,502
How did you two meet?

272
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,965
It was a sort of a crime.

273
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,427
Long ago, I was taking a bath in a stream.

274
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,596
and my wife was peeping at me.

275
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,557
It must have been love at first sight.

276
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,978
Precisely. I have a killer body
once I get stripped down.

277
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:15,607
Wait a minute.
Your wife asked you out first?

278
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,776
I got kidnapped that night.

279
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,737
She put a sack over my head,
then carried me out.

280
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,615
-What?
-Then she asked me two questions.

281
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,285
"Do you want to live with me
or go to hell?"

282
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,538
"Do you want to sleep with me
or go to hell?"

283
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,208
So I spent the night.

284
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,464
You fool!

285
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,634
How dare you forget your place
and harm a human?

286
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,386
That shaman?

287
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,805
She may have looked fine,
but she was way overdue.

288
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,891
I don't care if she was overdue.
She wasn't in the book!

289
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,019
It was a clear-cut emergency.

290
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,645
Your punishment has been settled.

291
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,147
What were you thinking?

292
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,857
I'll gladly accept any punishment.

293
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,360
So stop making it obvious
you worry about me.

294
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,113
Is it because of that girl?

295
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:06,992
Did you find her?

296
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,338
But she didn't have
the Fox Marble I gave her.

297
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,841
You got the wrong girl.

298
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,179
But she looks way too similar.

299
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,513
Her face.

300
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,058
-I'll protect you.
-Her voice.

301
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,934
It's burning hot.

302
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,812
And those scales that covered A-eum
before her death.

303
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,356
You need to stop here.

304
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,110
-What do you mean?
-A human can't be with a fox.

305
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,072
Your obsession will bring disaster

306
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,492
upon you and that girl who was reborn.

307
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,374
I don't want anything that profound.

308
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,417
Then what?

309
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,045
We've lived for hundreds
and thousands of years,

310
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,589
but we all have our favorite age.

311
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,218
Those radiant years
which we especially loved.

312
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,349
You loved the 1980s.

313
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,602
You found a hobby.

314
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,978
TEENAGE DREAMERS
A BETTER TOMORROW

315
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,317
When Leslie Cheung died,

316
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,695
you had makgeolli three days straight.

317
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,490
So?

318
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,537
That was the only time for me.

319
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,424
Those few years when she lived.

320
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,926
Even if she was reborn,

321
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,679
she isn't the same girl as before.

322
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,805
I don't care.

323
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,642
I just want to see her

324
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,729
experience all kinds of emotions in life

325
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,316
as she grows old in peace.

326
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,156
And there are things I must do
to make that happen.

327
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,707
Hello?

328
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,958
What are you up to?

329
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,919
I'm just, you know, about to eat.

330
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,130
-Did you get your food?
-I did. Why?

331
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,339
Return it.

332
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,218
-What is this?
-I'm asking you to eat with me.

333
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,434
-Granny, let me grab a quick meal.
-Hey!

334
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,978
Do you think our law is a joke?

335
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,147
I hadn't even had a drop of water today.

336
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,524
This is all I can do
to extenuate your case.

337
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,902
Be back by midnight.

338
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,032
Did you catch anyone suspicious
leaving that island?

339
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,952
My clairvoyance isn't your dashcam!

340
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,413
I knew you'd say that.
You never tell me anything.

341
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,733
You're here.

342
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,109
Hey.

343
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,028
Come in.

344
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,363
Sure.

345
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,992
-The gates-- I'll close them.
-Close them.

346
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,959
Did you really--

347
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,710
I really did make everything.

348
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,921
I'm pretty much good at everything.

349
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,297
But not what's important.

350
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,633
Modesty won't put food in my mouth. I do.

351
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,137
Anyway, what have you got there?
Looks like flowers.

352
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,180
No.

353
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,599
You may turn it in with confidence.

354
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,151
You didn't bring flowers,
but a bouquet of mugwort.

355
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,531
If I eat your food without a present,
I have to pay you back,

356
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,116
but that's too much work.

357
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:19,119
So? Do you like it? I'll sit here.

358
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,373
What a monotonous, mechanical reaction.

359
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,459
It's an unexpected gift
for a housewarming party.

360
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,461
Should I put it in a vase or eat it?

361
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,381
Mugwort was the first thing that grew

362
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,759
when the ground was barren
after an atomic bomb went off.

363
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,052
Isn't that totally you?

364
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,638
It's totally what I like.

365
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,060
-What are you doing?
-You know,

366
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,812
animals love to be petted.

367
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,698
My dog loves it when I pet him like this.

368
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,085
Ta-da.

369
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,721
It's good.

370
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,307
You can have two bowls.

371
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,232
Why did you suddenly do this?

372
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,652
People usually feed another

373
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,613
when they want to thank someone.

374
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,868
You saved my life twice,
but this ordinary meal was the only way

375
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,787
I could think of showing my gratitude.

376
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,293
It's very special.

377
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,548
At the least, it is for me today.

378
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,202
I just realized. You didn't move.

379
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,415
Most people
whose family go missing are like me.

380
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,166
It's tough for us to move.

381
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,628
It's our way of saying,
"Don't forget your way home.

382
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,255
I'm still waiting here."

383
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,634
You must've been lonely
in this huge house.

384
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,139
Why are you laughing?

385
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,224
Because it'd be odd to cry.

386
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,852
You said I must've been lonely,

387
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,812
so I wondered if I was.

388
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:54,566
Then I realized I was.

389
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,655
They look kind.

390
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,408
You're right.

391
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,287
Why couldn't my parents be meaner?

392
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,623
Then could I have forgotten everything

393
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,127
and lived an ordinary life
like everyone else?

394
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,612
Doing this helps me stop crying.

395
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,074
I figured it out when I was nine,
after I lost my parents.

396
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,377
You'll find your parents.

397
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,424
I'll make it happen.

398
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,346
Go live an ordinary life.

399
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,474
A boring and heartwarming life,

400
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,893
just like everyone else.

401
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,490
By any chance,

402
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,035
-that first love you mentioned--
-Wake up.

403
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,955
My first love was like a lotus flower.

404
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,208
Fine, I'm more like weeds,

405
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,710
or mugwort that grew through radiation.
Happy?

406
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,339
You grew pretty well for weeds.

407
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,104
Thank you for your help on Eohwa Island.

408
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,438
Don't mention it.

409
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:01,234
The man who saved my life
after Yeon slew me was--

410
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,405
you, remember?

411
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,837
All of it was fate.

412
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,549
How's the kid doing?

413
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,802
He's asleep.

414
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,639
You're something too.

415
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,685
How did you spend 600 years serving it?

416
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,897
I am only human.

417
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,732
We barely live 100 years,

418
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,860
I'm just an ordinary human
doing my best not to die.

419
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,409
I haven't met anyone
using this world's power to live longer

420
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,453
have it end well for them.

421
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,499
What's your plan now?

422
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,961
I'll feed him, put him to sleep,
and wait for him to grow up.

423
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,756
I'll look forward to it.

424
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,969
The moment the main character
finds his lover and falls in love,

425
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,096
the tragedy of the past will be recreated.

426
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,606
A funeral? Do you have to go?

427
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,690
Why not?

428
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,902
It's not a good time
to be at a place like that.

429
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:27,987
What do you mean?

430
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,823
Why do you think your ancestors washed up

431
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,825
and sprinkled salt after funerals?

432
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,036
All kinds of unclean things swarm around.

433
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,165
Thanks for your concern, but I have to go.

434
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,670
You're already involved with this world.

435
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,922
So are you afraid
I might catch an evil spirit?

436
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:50,051
No matter what it is, if you can
see something, it can see you too.

437
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,971
And I won't be in Seoul for a few days.

438
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,723
Are you going on a trip?

439
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:59,686
Well, sure. Something like that.

440
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:02,397
-So--
-I'm not going to avoid this.

441
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,400
Especially so if this is the world
I'll have to face from now on.

442
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,781
Wait here.

443
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,873
Take this.

444
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,919
I put in as many red beans as your age.

445
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,796
Don't lose it and keep it with you.

446
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,881
Is it some sort of charm?

447
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,010
It's a classic.
Since I made it, it'll last a day or two.

448
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,471
Thanks.

449
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,724
Bye, then. Enjoy your trip.

450
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,725
Sure.

451
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,946
Why can't I seem to turn back?

452
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,994
Is it all right
for me to be away from her right now?

453
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,135
What's your favorite movie?

454
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,721
Toy Story 3.

455
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,139
Why?

456
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,769
I want to know more about you, Yeon.

457
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,910
The red bean bag!

458
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:41,704
Right here.

459
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,310
You jerk.

460
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,854
I thought you weren't coming.

461
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,107
I heard you haven't cried once.

462
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,650
You stubborn brat.

463
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,744
I'm sorry I'm late.

464
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,541
My mom said

465
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,627
she'll live long
if she makes her shroud on a leap month.

466
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,631
So she kept pestering me
to go to a hanbok store,

467
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,801
but I kept putting it off,
and never did it.

468
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,846
When she called,

469
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,599
I always hung up first saying I was busy.

470
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,061
And last week,

471
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,439
she made dongchimi, my favorite.

472
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,609
But I just slept in.

473
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,989
You are a horrible daughter.

474
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,408
Right?

475
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:02,952
Right.

476
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,668
My mom makes awesome dongchimi,

477
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,378
but I can't eat it anymore.

478
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,549
Cry as much as you want.

479
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,304
If you hold it back,
it'll stay with you for life.

480
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,562
So where am I headed?

481
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,398
Please send me somewhere warm.

482
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,317
I get cold easily because of my age.

483
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,027
I said I get cold easily.

484
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,364
A word from the ten kings.

485
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,370
"The former deity of Baekdu Mountain,
Lee Yeon.

486
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:50,708
You must be punished
in the First Hell for killing a human

487
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,377
according to Article 24
of the Criminal Code.

488
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,255
However, we extenuate your case
for saving many lives.

489
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,925
You're hereby put on probation
for seven days."

490
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,928
Wait, a week? That's way too long.

491
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,513
"However, you will spend that period

492
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,517
in a human body, not as a deity.

493
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:12,438
You shall experience
all the pain of human life."

494
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,880
3RD GENERATION CHAEBOL, KI YU-RI
TAKING OVER MOZE GROUP

495
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,966
Ki Yu-ri.

496
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,151
The necklace thief.

497
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,153
How did you find me here?

498
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,949
I thought you'd come back for it,
but you didn't.

499
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,618
-It's because you had a gun--
-Relax.

500
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,289
I'm not armed today.

501
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:12,790
What do you want?

502
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,250
Play with me.

503
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,349
How's Ms. Kim?

504
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,643
I made her cry a lot, so she's dizzy now.

505
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,565
-Go make sure she eats.
-Okay.

506
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,361
I like the yukgaejang here.

507
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,159
Why are you here?

508
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,077
Stop overreacting and sit down.

509
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,080
By the way, I gave her more
condolence money than you.

510
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,750
Sit down

511
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,627
unless you want that girl's funeral
to be held with her mom's.

512
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:14,852
What do you want?

513
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,021
How's it going with Yeon?

514
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,940
We've made huge progress.

515
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,778
His only brother has been
coming to see me in and out of season.

516
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,364
Aren't you scared of me?

517
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:27,823
I am.

518
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,952
I've been told that males with
many complexes are like ticking bombs.

519
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,373
You're not wrong.

520
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,458
Why do you hate your brother so much?

521
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,087
Well, my life is pretty boring.

522
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,005
Liar.

523
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,553
You actually loved him a lot.

524
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,473
That's why you're doing this.

525
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,990
What you said
about the Russian smuggler was true.

526
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,242
What are you doing?

527
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,161
I'm a vet.

528
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,788
I've seen similar scars

529
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,416
on animals in a zoo.

530
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,961
You were abused by people, right?

531
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,588
Don't look at me like that. It's annoying.

532
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,675
-Sorry.
-And don't apologize either.

533
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,804
I'm never returning your necklace.

534
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:32,930
It's very dear to me.

535
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,933
That's why I took it.

536
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,978
Who is it? Who's making you do this?

537
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,063
If you manage to take this necklace back,

538
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,190
I'll tell you.

539
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,119
There once lived a deity
who abandoned his mountain.

540
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,291
Then the humans who came to pray to us
with their wishes

541
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,545
set the mountain on fire
to wipe out all the foxes.

542
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,132
Every living thing burnt down.

543
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,677
All the dogs I raised like family

544
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,138
turned into ashes.

545
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,932
And is that

546
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,727
because of his first love?

547
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,399
Yeon thinks you are
the reincarnation of that woman.

548
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,528
That's why he killed that shaman,
knowing the consequences

549
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,821
he'll have to pay.

550
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,074
"The consequences?"

551
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,660
Where is he right now?

552
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,247
Where he can't get any phone signals.

553
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:49,298
PRISON OF SNOWY MOUNTAIN

554
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,996
Where is he?

555
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,259
That's none of your business.

556
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,930
If you wish to live,
you better not fall asleep tonight.

557
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,237
Why is hall six

558
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:57,032
filled with people at this hour?

559
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,286
And they all look like little kids.

560
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,913
You sure pay a lot of concern
to other people's matters.

561
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:42,911
Time in hell flows
at a different speed than the world.

562
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,666
Seven days in the world is
seven years in hell.

563
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,753
You cannot eat.

564
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,881
You cannot sleep.

565
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,385
And you cannot die.

566
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,897
A BETTER TOMORROW

567
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,025
That was the only time for me.

568
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,487
Those few years when she lived.

569
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,489
I'll gladly accept any punishment.

570
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,074
I just want to see her

571
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,993
experience all kinds of emotions in life

572
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,287
as she grows old in peace.

573
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,418
Naive fool.

574
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,982
The device you reached is off.
You will be redirected to voicemail.

575
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,110
You will be charged after the beep.

576
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,890
A power outage?

577
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,522
Hello.

578
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,277
You two must be sisters.

579
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,405
How old are you?

580
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,118
And what are you doing here?

581
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,912
-Hey.
-Hey.

582
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,039
-Have you seen our dad?
-Have you seen our dad?

583
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,791
Did you lose your dad?

584
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,918
Which hall is he in?

585
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,638
Do you want me to find him?

586
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,728
Hey.

587
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:00,192
Why are you wearing
the wrong pair of shoes?

588
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,111
Ms. Nam!

589
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,782
Hey.

590
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,704
-She finished the rice cake.
-Great job.

591
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,499
She told us to go home.
She's going to rest too.

592
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,460
Really? One second.

593
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:23,966
Where did the kids go?

594
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,425
Kids?

595
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,053
Yes, they were here just now.

596
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:30,180
They probably went to their parents.
Let's go.

597
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:32,474
Okay.

598
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,566
Are you taking a cab? I'll drop you off.

599
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,068
It's fine. I'm tired to death,

600
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,821
but my mom told me
to stop by the supermarket to buy gum,

601
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,281
to lose any odd spirits.

602
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,117
It must be some exorcism.

603
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,911
She's very superstitious
for a church lady.

604
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,958
-See you tomorrow.
-Great work today.

605
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,807
When did this--

606
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:58,018
Ms. Nam!

607
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:06,109
She lost the charm I gave her.

608
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:09,196
Was it Rang? Or--

609
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:16,161
Granny. Hey, Granny.
I have something to say.

610
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,499
I know you can hear me.

611
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,126
You need to let me go.

612
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,420
Granny, come on.

613
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,422
Will you let me go?

614
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,592
Damn it, you need to let me go now.

615
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,012
Let me go right now!

616
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,016
Damn it!

617
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,857
Why are you making a fuss?

618
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:51,321
Granny, I need to leave.
So let me go right now.

619
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,280
How dare you!

620
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,366
Where do you think you are?

621
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,702
The Mountain of Knives. I'll go there.

622
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,122
I was going to be sent there
without the remission anyway.

623
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,791
Then I can leave here by today.

624
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:05,252
Or you may never get to leave

625
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,546
in that condition.

626
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,846
I don't care.

627
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,541
Are you okay?

628
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,334
Yes.

629
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,756
What happened to me?

630
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,466
You collapsed.

631
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,762
-It's chilly.
-Are you cold?

632
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,856
Did something happen back there?

633
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,238
I saw these little girls. Twice.

634
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:16,907
What were they like?

635
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:18,909
Two sisters.

636
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,703
They were wearing cute dresses

637
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,331
with mismatching shoes.

638
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,665
Aren't they ghosts?

639
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,795
-What?
-Ghosts do certain things the other way

640
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,922
when they try to mimic humans.

641
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,425
-You don't even believe in ghosts.
-One second.

642
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,639
A RESEARCH OF GHOST TALES

643
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,104
I did a bit of research,

644
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,065
and that funeral used to be an aejangteo.

645
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,234
Aejangteo?

646
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,153
A place where dead children were buried?

647
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:58,740
Yes, that burial was demolished,
and the funeral hall was built.

648
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,744
-Hey, Jae-hwan.
-Yes?

649
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,830
Why are you

650
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,291
holding that book upside down?

651
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,184
-She found us.
-She found us.

652
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:57,299
HELL OF THE MOUNTAIN OF KNIVES

653
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:21,656
Cross the bridge.

654
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:26,119
Once you take a step,
you will not be allowed to return.

655
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,374
Could I really do this

656
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,793
in this body?

657
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:53,521
No matter what it is, if you can
see something, it can see you too.

658
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:56,775
I put in as many red beans as your age.

659
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,568
Don't lose it and keep it with you.

660
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,331
Yeon.

661
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,509
Granny, I'll be back.

662
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,686
The sinner is crossing
the Hell of the Mountain of Knives.

663
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,420
My phone.

664
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:39,729
Who's there?

665
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:53,993
Two.

666
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:56,996
Three.

667
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,125
Four.

668
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:03,586
Five.

669
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,968
What do you want from me?

670
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,194
Give me your body. I want this body.

671
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,780
Give me your body. I want this body.

672
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,992
Give me your body. I want this body.

673
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:37,078
Give me your body. I want this body.

674
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,414
Give me your body. I want this body.

675
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:42,333
Give me your body. I want this body.

676
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:04,554
-Give me your body.
-Give me your body.

677
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:07,598
-Give me your body.
-Give me your body.

678
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,101
-Give me your body.
-Give me your body.

679
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,243
Thank you, Yeon.

680
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:31,247
The 9-year-old me and the 30-year-old me

681
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,874
both survived thanks to you.

682
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,711
You know,

683
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,380
I'm not much of a fighter.

684
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,382
and can't control the weather,

685
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,179
but one day, I'll protect you.

686
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,681
I promised that

687
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,475
I will

688
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,935
protect you.

689
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:56,564
Your girl will fail to die
a natural death in this life too.

690
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:05,448
I don't care who she is
or if she's the one I'm looking for.

691
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:09,285
That doesn't matter anymore.

692
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:12,830
There's only one thing I know.

693
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:17,710
That these knives that dig into my skin

694
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,756
can't hurt me as much

695
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:26,511
as the death of that woman
who has her face.

696
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:31,307
I want to know more about you, Yeon.

697
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,018
Then don't die.

698
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,647
Please stay alive

699
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:41,442
until I get there. Please.

700
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,278
I often had nightmares.

701
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:48,241
But I never had anyone there for me.

702
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,992
I was used to it.

703
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,620
But now…

704
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:55,832
Go live an ordinary life.

705
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,333
I'll make it happen.

706
01:03:57,416 --> 01:04:00,294
Why am I looking for you?

707
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,713
Yeon. Yeon!

708
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,306
-Give me your body.
-Give me your body.

709
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:55,474
-Give me your body.
-Give me your body.

710
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,512
Please don't die.

711
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:38,851
Please don't die

712
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,270
because of me.

713
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,093
I found you.

714
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,015
Be reborn.

715
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:23,938
I will come and find you.

716
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,663
I also--

717
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,713
I also have been waiting for you.

718
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:36,195
I'm his loyal right-hand man
since his Baekdu Mountain days,

719
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:37,696
and his housekeeper.

720
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:41,033
What was your first love like?

721
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:45,621
Sometimes, knowing too much can hurt you.

722
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,707
I'm looking for someone.

723
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:53,170
The way you look at me. And those wounds.

724
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,755
I just can't forget it.

725
01:08:57,424 --> 01:09:02,429
