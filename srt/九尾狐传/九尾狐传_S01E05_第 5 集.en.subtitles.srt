1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,879
-Give me your body.
-Give me your body.

2
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:49,549
-Give me your body.
-Give me your body.

3
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,343
-Give me your body.
-Give me your body.

4
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,429
-Give me your body.
-Give me your body.

5
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,342
Please don't die.

6
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,597
Please don't die

7
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,974
because of me.

8
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,756
I found you.

9
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,187
I also--

10
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,154
I also have been waiting for you.

11
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,911
I'm sorry I caused you to get hurt

12
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,954
but I couldn't take you to a hospital.

13
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,250
My mom was a doctor,
so I know how to give first aid.

14
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,887
Open up.

15
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,641
-Open up.
-Open?

16
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,522
It's candy.

17
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,485
My mom always gave me a strawberry candy

18
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,238
when I went to get a shot.

19
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,407
I wasn't scared of hospitals after that.

20
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:06,204
It felt like the word "hospital"
smelled of strawberry candy.

21
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,256
Go on.

22
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,635
Right. When I was nine,

23
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,429
I was sent
to a children's psychiatric ward.

24
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,724
After my parents went missing,

25
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:30,228
I testified that the culprit wasn't human.

26
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,942
I had to leave,
but the doctor in charge wouldn't let me.

27
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,236
I would've done the same.

28
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,571
So I kept spying on him.

29
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,408
Then I caught him abusing propofol.

30
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:44,951
And?

31
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,953
I made a deal with him.

32
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,622
"Should I call for someone,

33
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,873
or may I go home now?"

34
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,879
I can't forget the day I came home

35
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,090
in my uncle's car.

36
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,843
Mom.

37
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,723
Dad.

38
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,157
I came home after three months,

39
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,535
but I hated how my parents weren't there.

40
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,537
So I sat in front of the gates.

41
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,833
Those two fireflies

42
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,045
seemed like my mom and dad.

43
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,904
I also--

44
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,909
I also have been waiting for you.

45
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,081
MICROECONOMICS,
INTRODUCTION TO ABSTRACT ALGEBRA

46
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,630
Mr. Lee!

47
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:11,884
Mr. Lee!

48
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,515
Goodness, you're a total wreck.

49
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,892
I was worried sick.

50
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,894
Be quiet.

51
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,020
Quiet? Why?

52
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,606
Why?

53
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,858
The animal clinic--

54
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,028
Doctor Gu Sin-ju?

55
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,866
-Ms. Nam?
-You two know each other?

56
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,953
No way.

57
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,163
If you two are here together, it means--

58
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,130
Goodness, Mr. Lee. You finally did it.

59
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,132
You waited 600 years like a big pushover.

60
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,758
-Finally--
-My neck.

61
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,180
I'm so touched I keep saying nonsense.

62
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,601
I won't have any regrets now when I die.

63
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,521
-Are you crying?
-Why am I crying like a fool?

64
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,897
Excuse me.

65
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,072
Let me present myself formally.

66
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,454
I'm his loyal right-hand man
since his Baekdu Mountain days,

67
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,748
his personal doctor, bodyguard,

68
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,291
and housekeeper.

69
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,669
Mr. Lee is a man
who can't even wash his own underpants,

70
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,589
but he gets to live like a decent guy
all thanks to me.

71
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,007
Shut up.

72
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,052
No wonder.

73
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,137
You seemed to know
everything about animals.

74
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,222
You were a fox in disguise?

75
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,184
You don't have to stare like that.

76
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,519
There's no one to trust in this world.

77
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,522
-We've done so many interviews!
-He thinks he's a celebrity now.

78
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,483
He practices autographs and selfies.

79
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,235
All of that was fated to be.

80
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,162
I'll take this one.

81
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,041
The bezel for this is red gold,
so it's a bit expensive. 35 million won.

82
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,417
Will you give me a discount?

83
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,754
-Sorry?
-I was joking. Wasn't it funny?

84
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,256
You've never told a joke.

85
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,511
How do you see me?

86
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,098
You're the paragon of all men,

87
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,599
from head to toe.

88
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,976
But why do I look like I'm in ruins?

89
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,479
I'm sick and tired of waking up every day.

90
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,274
No matter what I buy or eat,
nothing is fun or impressive.

91
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,443
I've lived for too long.

92
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,575
How much was that watch?

93
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,120
This is a cheap one.

94
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:45,996
Why do you wear that?

95
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,832
It's my late father's.

96
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,712
Then it must be dear to you.

97
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,673
Yes. It's the most precious thing
in the world to me.

98
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,383
Let me see it.

99
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,601
Isn't his handwriting cute?

100
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,312
He never learned to write,
so I taught him.

101
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:12,982
Let me have this.

102
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,818
-Sorry?
-You can have mine instead.

103
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,156
You must be joking.

104
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,075
No. I want to see which one you'll choose.

105
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,828
Will it be your family?

106
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,955
Orâ€¦

107
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,770
-Shall we?
-Let's go.

108
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,485
Okay. All right.

109
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,111
It's chicken porridge.

110
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,448
I'll cool it down for you.

111
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,078
Hey, I'm not a kid. Go away.

112
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,212
You dressed his wounds very well.

113
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,215
Right. Does he need any other treatment?

114
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,467
He recovers
much faster than regular people.

115
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,719
But he still needs a month's rest.

116
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,180
Please do look after him.

117
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,224
It'd be better if you stayed--

118
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,183
No way.

119
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,978
There's no better treatment than that.

120
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,064
-What?
-Mr. Lee here

121
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,691
is quirky, awkward, and stingy,

122
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,444
but he's a man who could
go down in history as a romantic.

123
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,405
He owns 30 billion won
in real estate assets.

124
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,908
He has good looks, no illnesses,

125
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,160
and a disgustingly long lifespan.

126
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,414
You can leave now. Go.

127
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,208
I'm leaving now. Bye.

128
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,966
Don't give him ice cream
until he finishes his porridge,

129
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,759
even if he throws a fit.

130
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,430
He gets thrilled if you throw in
three rubber ducks in his bath.

131
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,890
Hey, I told you to go!

132
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,101
I'm going!

133
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,244
What's that?

134
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,832
It's something that was most precious
to a young man until moments ago.

135
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,127
And it's gone from him now,

136
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,254
just like me.

137
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,359
Why? What?

138
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,363
Give me a bite.

139
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,321
What's on your mind?

140
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,034
Nothing much.

141
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,747
That life can become this sweet
over a pint of ice cream.

142
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,338
So,

143
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:08,342
what was your first love like?

144
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,637
And don't tell me she was like a lotus.

145
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,684
A-eum, meaning lofty sound.

146
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,769
That's her name.

147
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,147
It doesn't sound like a common name.

148
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,150
With such a name,
she must be from a rich family.

149
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,195
How did you meet her?

150
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,992
I'll never forget it.

151
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,537
I was treated like a dog.

152
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,586
Do you wish to die?

153
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:45,963
That's strange.

154
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,590
My dog loves it when I pet him like this.

155
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,343
Goodness, this kid. Do you know who--

156
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,179
A fox, right? I'm A-eum.

157
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,727
-Don't ever come back here.
-Why not?

158
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,104
-This is the domain of the deities.
-Why?

159
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,107
Are you stupid?

160
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,108
Why?

161
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,597
I heard the Nine-tailed Fox
can control the heavens.

162
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,390
You must be really strong.

163
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,393
If you understand,
get lost before you get eaten by a tiger.

164
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,729
Hey.

165
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:44,813
Be my underling.

166
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,774
What?

167
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,984
I'll let you eat rice every day.

168
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,321
And I'll give you silk clothes.
You know, a good life. Okay?

169
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,200
-She's so cute.
-She was way too cute

170
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,952
that I smacked her on the head
and sent her away.

171
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,371
-And?
-She went back down crying,

172
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,123
then came after me with a bow.

173
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,292
What a feisty little girl.

174
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,418
So who won?

175
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,129
I let her win.

176
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,674
Back then, I was absolutely tolerant.

177
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,594
Of course, I'm still very tolerant.

178
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,267
If you fail to hit me this time,
I'll eat you alive.

179
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,611
Why can't you do something so easy?

180
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,614
I already told you
the arrow rides the wind.

181
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,742
And I said that I rule over the winds.

182
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,787
-Do it again.
-You have zero talent for this.

183
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,040
Human, go home and learn to embroider,

184
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,667
fly a kite, or whatever.

185
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,795
Don't you dare tell me what to do.

186
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,631
I can only let you off for so long.

187
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,718
Listen to this kid.
Who do you think you are to let me off?

188
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,636
Throw it up.

189
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,982
It's not that I couldn't,

190
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,024
I didn't.

191
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,068
You might get hurt.

192
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,321
Why would you worry about me?

193
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,284
I like you.

194
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,414
Tiny human, you'll be smitten.

195
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,765
It's time you told me.

196
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,143
Why did I pick up archery?

197
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,605
And I don't want, "Because it's cool."

198
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,985
I will kill my father.

199
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,363
What? Your father?

200
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,032
Why? Who's your father?

201
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,869
The king of this land.

202
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,182
Shoot.

203
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,393
As long as I'm here,
the wind will be on your side.

204
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,234
Your first love was a big shot.

205
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:40,072
I found out later that
she was the seventh daughter of the king.

206
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,241
Well, an abandoned princess.

207
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,203
But why did she want to kill
her own father?

208
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,915
He was the king, but not the king.

209
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,964
People were
tortured in the palace every day,

210
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,716
and the Korean peninsula
suffered from drought and ordeals.

211
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:05,347
Something wicked came into the palace
and pretended to be the king.

212
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,266
Something wicked?

213
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,269
People used to call it the earth dragon.

214
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,436
The earth dragon?

215
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,898
A dragon in the dirt.

216
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,901
A serpent?

217
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:23,448
You're much better looking in person.
What a handsome man.

218
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:24,783
Thank you.

219
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,243
No, I should thank you.

220
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,663
You paid me so much in advance,
all in cash.

221
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,916
-Did you tell anyone--
-I kept it a secret.

222
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,003
So, whose family is this boy from

223
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,754
to keep such a low profile?

224
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,759
Well, who cares about his family?

225
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,095
Kids are all little angels.

226
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,223
It's the last room on the second floor.

227
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,767
I see.

228
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,395
So what should I do first?

229
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,980
Nothing in particular.

230
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,899
Just make sure he eats well.

231
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,485
Okay, sure. All right, then.

232
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,724
Hey, little one.

233
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,105
Come out and eat, child.

234
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,742
Do you have bad hearing?

235
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,127
Hey, your face.

236
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,631
Your hand too.

237
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,550
This isn't contagious, is it?

238
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,844
Well.

239
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,639
Do you want to find out?

240
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,807
Why did you stop your story?

241
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,309
My flashback ends there more or less.

242
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,019
How did she die?

243
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,314
Your obsession will bring disaster

244
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,443
upon you and that girl who was reborn.

245
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,488
It's none of your concern.

246
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,536
It does concern me. I know it does.

247
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,414
Sometimes,

248
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,585
knowing too much can hurt you.

249
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,920
Just

250
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,174
continue to live without ever finding out.

251
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:31,261
I don't plan on living
as some stranger's past.

252
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,187
Don't take it off.

253
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,401
I've had enough rest.

254
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,862
Let's go out somewhere.

255
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,918
Doesn't it look awful?

256
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,924
I like it. It suits you.

257
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,301
I hate it.

258
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,387
It feels like I'm going around
telling everyone I lived in a zoo.

259
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:15,972
Who said that?

260
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,933
That vet.

261
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,311
He didn't jump on me like other males,

262
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,438
but looked at me with pity and sorrow.

263
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,191
Then don't let him.

264
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,234
How?

265
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,695
He can't look if he doesn't have eyes.

266
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,704
Stop the car.

267
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,916
-Damn it.
-Let's up the ante to 10,000 won.

268
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,334
-Alright.
-Let's do this.

269
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,419
Here I go.

270
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,884
-Did you see that?
-Okay!

271
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,469
I'm the ace.

272
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,930
-It isn't dead yet.
-Get behind the line.

273
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,224
-Get behind.
-I'm not stepping over it.

274
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,106
Having fun?

275
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,732
Who are you?

276
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,277
Have some manners
when talking to an adult.

277
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,194
Having fun?

278
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,071
He calls himself an adult.

279
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,907
Who cares whether it's for fun or a hobby?
Let go--

280
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,118
Let go of--

281
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:23,039
How did such weaklings end up
as the fittest of this ecosystem?

282
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,791
Don't just stand there.

283
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,505
-Hi.
-Who's this hag?

284
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,926
Did you just insult me?

285
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,846
Just die. Die!

286
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,432
Hey, whoa. You're bleeding.

287
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,518
Damn you.

288
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,115
It stings, right?

289
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,338
It's too early to cry.

290
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,591
I'm unemployed, so all I have is time.

291
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,679
YEONGJU SKY FUNERAL HALL

292
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,896
A morgue.

293
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,148
There's no better place for a walk.

294
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,525
It's not crowded
and has plenty of coffins.

295
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:37,906
I can never let it go
when something bothers me.

296
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,083
Come out.

297
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,836
Come on out!

298
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,056
-Hey, it's a fox.
-It's a fox.

299
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,642
Yes, right. I'm a fox.

300
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,602
You two sisters. Come here.

301
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,022
It's okay. Come closer.

302
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,150
That's it. Closer.

303
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,194
Yes, that's good.

304
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,988
First off, you both need to be smacked.

305
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,991
You ghosts can't play
naughty tricks on humans, okay?

306
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,370
Especially her.

307
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,708
You can ask them now.

308
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,882
What are your names?

309
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,009
-I'm Min-seo.
-I'm Yeon-seo.

310
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:43,430
Min-seo and Yeon-seo,
do you have anything to say to me?

311
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,693
You two died in this accident, right?

312
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,198
TRAGEDY FOR NEGLECTED SISTERS

313
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,748
Hey.

314
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,835
Did you see this?

315
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,339
Are these reporters
trying to add fuel to the fire?

316
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,426
Damn it!

317
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,392
TRAGEDY FOR NEGLECTED SISTERS

318
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,937
THEY FELL FROM THE VERANDA WHILE
THE FATHER WAS AWAY FOR THREE DAYS

319
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:57,003
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe

320
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,715
Which one should I choose?

321
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,177
One, two.

322
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,222
I won't count.

323
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,681
Why are you doing this?

324
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,226
It's what I do "for fun or as a hobby."

325
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,519
Please let us go.

326
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,895
Okay, then. You choose.

327
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,733
I made these cards.
There are punishments and rewards.

328
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,568
It's a fifty-fifty chance.

329
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,028
What is it?

330
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,198
Just pick one.

331
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,549
Hey, you picked an interesting card.

332
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,925
TALENT DONATION

333
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:44,843
Talent donation.

334
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,970
Congratulations!

335
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,225
What talents do you have?

336
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,728
We're good at baseball.

337
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,605
-Yes.
-We're ballplayers.

338
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,190
I like baseball too.

339
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,484
We'll volunteer our time if you let us go.

340
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,652
-Yes.
-Yes.

341
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:08,616
But this donation is
a bit different from what you imagine.

342
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,536
You'll never get to play baseball again.

343
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,873
Hence, it's talent donation.

344
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,837
Are you all righties?

345
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,548
Is this guy a lefty?

346
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,886
Whatever. Yu-ri, just crush both hands.

347
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,264
-Let's do it!
-I'm sorry.

348
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,057
-Let us go.
-We'll be good.

349
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,893
-We won't do that.
-Please!

350
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,645
-Please let us go!
-We won't do that again.

351
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,772
-Please.
-I'll do anything you say.

352
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,905
Who are you?

353
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,991
I'm an acquaintance
of Min-seo and Yeon-seo.

354
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,869
I see. Hello.

355
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:58,207
I'm a truck driver,

356
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,918
so I'm barely home.

357
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:01,920
I know.

358
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,840
I also know their unemployed uncle
usually looked after them.

359
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,552
My brother had a job interview that day.

360
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,808
Don't you have cherries in that bag?

361
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,356
You must've been very close to my girls.

362
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,447
I paid a lot for these,

363
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,117
but they didn't want anything from me.

364
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,327
They never had any.

365
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,932
Sir, could you come out for a second?

366
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,642
Help me!

367
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,771
How would it feel to be burnt alive?

368
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,733
This furnace is about 1,000â„ƒ.

369
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,152
Man, that's hot.
You're getting me hot too.

370
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,655
Please stop. Why are you doing this to me?

371
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,241
You molested your nieces.

372
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,369
No. Who in the world said that?

373
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,039
-Get in there.
-No, wait! Wait!

374
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,208
Wait, one second. I did.

375
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,794
I did it. Please spare my life.

376
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,129
You molested them, right?

377
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,675
Yes, but it was a mistake.

378
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,052
I got completely wasted.

379
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,638
I wasn't trying to kill them.

380
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:38,933
They happened to run
towards the veranda, and--

381
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,268
We're done now.

382
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,027
You are worse than a beast!

383
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,361
The police are coming.

384
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,367
I had no idea, and left them in his hands.

385
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,536
I was an idiot!

386
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,751
Mr. Choi.

387
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,253
Min-seo and Yeon-seo
didn't eat those cherries

388
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,840
not because they hated you.

389
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,139
It was too precious to eat.

390
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,100
Your gift was

391
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,103
too dear to them.

392
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,114
Dad's so sorry.

393
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,277
The dog must like you.

394
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:18,741
You still wag your tail at humans
even after what they did.

395
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,077
It's foolish and pathetic.

396
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:22,662
Poor thing.

397
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,997
Can we take it?

398
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,128
Oh, no.

399
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,507
Why did you come back?

400
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,510
I told you to run far away.

401
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,596
Does it hurt?

402
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,725
Oh no.

403
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,562
There was only one thing I could do.

404
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,066
Ending its pain with my own hands.

405
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,652
No.

406
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,904
I can't do this.

407
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,031
I don't want to.

408
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,745
Yeon, help me.

409
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:06,706
Yeon!

410
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,010
Geomdoong, no.

411
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,470
Here.

412
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,098
I'm so excited!

413
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,602
Give it lots of love and keep it safe.

414
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,853
Okay, Yeon.

415
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,398
This is so exciting. Isn't it?

416
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,777
Good boy. That's it. Faster!

417
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,781
I shouldn't have loved it.

418
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,743
I shouldn't have named it

419
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,204
or let it sleep in my arms.

420
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,415
The day Yeon left the forest,

421
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,753
I lost everything that was dear to me.

422
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,465
Let's take it with us. Please?

423
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,136
-No.
-Why not?

424
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,223
Dogs don't live long.

425
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,067
Come with me.

426
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,737
Goodbye.

427
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,698
Bye.

428
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,813
Hey, children.

429
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,481
Go play over there.

430
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,068
Run along, now.

431
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,781
Run along.

432
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,586
Who were they?

433
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:22,008
This was where
children were buried in secret.

434
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,218
They have to resolve their grief to leave,

435
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,053
but it's too late.

436
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,306
So they died ages ago.

437
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,893
Long ago when kids were buried,
it wasn't even marked.

438
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,771
It was to prevent the parents
from coming back.

439
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,649
That's sad.

440
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,110
It's a heartbreaking sort of tradition

441
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:44,030
to help them move on
from their dead children.

442
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,741
Whether back then or now,

443
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,243
all parents feel the same
when their kids die first.

444
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,677
You keep staring at me. Why?

445
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,262
Nothing.

446
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,599
You seem different
from the Yeon I knew until now.

447
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,770
You're the one who helped those girls.

448
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,272
Thanks.

449
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,943
-For what?
-You know, for everything.

450
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,540
Damn it.

451
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,421
A meal or a drink.

452
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,759
You said people feed each other
when they're grateful.

453
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,144
I choose drinks over meals.

454
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,816
I thought you brought an umbrella.

455
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,401
I lost it.

456
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,821
-Are you stupid?
-Yes, I am.

457
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,531
I knew it.

458
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,450
You aren't that good at interviews.

459
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,282
Why is there a tree here?

460
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,493
Let's go.

461
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,296
You always take this umbrella with you.

462
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,840
I hate getting wet. It ruins my fur.

463
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,093
Oh, it's like how dogs hate taking baths.

464
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,762
-Yes, right-- Hey!
-Right.

465
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:00,100
I caught you because of this umbrella.

466
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,770
-I let you catch me.
-No way.

467
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,939
Losing you is a piece of cake.

468
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:11,695
Even if it pours like this,
I still eat fried chicken.

469
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,531
Sin-ju loves chicken!

470
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,282
-You're home.
-Whoa!

471
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,993
Why are you out and about
during business hours?

472
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,495
I was bored to death.

473
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,705
What brings you here today?

474
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,709
Treat it.

475
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,689
So?

476
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,191
Its bones are crushed.

477
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:52,069
It's suffering from malnutrition
and a skin condition.

478
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,029
And the leash dug into its neck.

479
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,239
Where's my necklace?

480
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,494
I need to talk to the dog.

481
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,622
Come on.

482
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,051
What happened?

483
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,345
It must have hurt a lot.

484
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,307
She isn't the one who did this to you?

485
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,309
Okay.

486
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,603
It's not homeless.

487
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,731
I stole it. I figured
it'd be better off being homeless.

488
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,734
-Ms. Ki.
-What?

489
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,068
Great job.

490
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,530
I didn't like you as a necklace thief,

491
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,532
-but good job as a dog thief.
-Dog thief?

492
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,826
A guy like me
couldn't bring myself to do it.

493
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,244
I can't cross the line.

494
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,662
Oh, right.

495
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,457
Well, I don't have any such lines.

496
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,876
If it's okay, please wait there.

497
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,562
It's all right. You'll be fine.

498
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,037
I can't believe
you didn't watch Toy Story 3.

499
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:30,542
"If Andy wants me,
I'll be there for him no matter where.

500
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,003
So long, partner."
You don't know this quote?

501
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,130
Isn't that film for kids?

502
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,009
It made grown-ups everywhere cry.

503
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,512
I hate movies that make you bawl.

504
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,015
Then what's your favorite movie?

505
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,266
I like

506
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,561
Mad Max, The Avengers,

507
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,690
and all the existing zombie movies
in this world.

508
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:54,858
I see.

509
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,195
-Favorite music?
-K-pop, of course.

510
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,198
-Classical?
-I can't tell the singers apart.

511
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,075
Not singers, but composers.

512
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,577
-Hiking?
-I don't like it even on piggyback.

513
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,789
Single malt whiskey?

514
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,916
I'd rather drink disinfectant.

515
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,544
-Western or Korean cuisine?
-Korean, always.

516
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:14,878
Me too!

517
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,303
You have no friends.

518
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,639
Me neither!

519
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,894
We're a good match.

520
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,771
You Quiz or Amazing Saturday?
One, two, three!

521
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,773
-Amazing Saturday!
-Amazing Saturday!

522
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,506
Yeon, what's your dream?

523
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,844
My career aspirations? At this age?

524
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,264
You know, something like
retiring and starting a cafe.

525
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,808
Coffee is better
when someone else brews it.

526
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,186
Or traveling the world.

527
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,647
I'm a stay-at-home type, so I like
watching American dramas at home.

528
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,400
-Making a billion won.
-A billion won?

529
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,528
What's your bank account? I'll send it.

530
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,657
Put it away.

531
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,160
-Why? I can do mobile banking.
-That's okay.

532
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,259
If I can
call something impossible a dream,

533
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:46,845
Iâ€¦

534
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,765
want to be human.

535
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,773
This Nine-tailed Fox
doesn't know how good he's got it.

536
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,151
If you want to know
what an ordinary life is like,

537
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,237
try riding the subway at rush hour.

538
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,365
Hell isn't far away from us.

539
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,285
That's not all.
We work overtime, stay up all night,

540
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,871
my team leader always just nags
instead of working,

541
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,790
and the viewer ratings are stressful.

542
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,876
-Should I destroy it?
-What?

543
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,419
That bothersome TV station.

544
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:27,052
That's a tempting offer,

545
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,680
but let's drink up as we consider.

546
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,487
What about you? What's your dream?

547
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:50,659
For meâ€¦

548
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:57,541
I wouldn't even mind living in a hut

549
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,294
if only

550
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:04,548
my parents were there with me
in the future.

551
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,731
Do you have a picture of them?

552
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,983
Send it to me.

553
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,624
Are you okay?

554
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,294
It's awfully dark.

555
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,713
The street lights are all out.

556
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,591
Can't you fix those?

557
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:48,884
What?

558
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:52,471
It would be amazing
if you could fix those with your powers.

559
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,432
Go ask for road management at city hall.

560
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,935
What an awful Nine-tailed Fox.

561
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,271
Sin-ju shuts his hospital and rushes over
when my lights go out.

562
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:04,066
Mr. Gu gave you bad habits.

563
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,193
Nine-tailed Foxes
are scared of electricity.

564
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,700
-We're here.
-Yes.

565
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:19,081
I'll go now.

566
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,249
Okay. Goodbye.

567
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:23,543
Hey.

568
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:28,674
Goodnight.

569
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,343
You too.

570
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,595
It was Yeon, even then.

571
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:04,811
"I can't reach my mother
who works as a babysitter."

572
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,899
Ms. Kim, have you seen this report?

573
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,234
I'm on a roll right now. Don't talk to me.

574
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,904
-Please take one look.
-Please go away.

575
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,990
You always copy and paste the narrations.

576
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,700
Say that again?

577
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,870
I heard him too.
He precisely said copy and paste.

578
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:22,788
Ms. Nam!

579
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,457
The pen is mightier than the sword, right?

580
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,085
Jae-hwan, I'll kill you, then myself.
Come here.

581
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,132
I'm so sick of them.

582
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,514
All right, kids.

583
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,850
You will be building a stone tower
in the Hell for Children.

584
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:48,313
Once you build it,
a goblin will appear and topple it,

585
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:52,400
but you must keep building this tower.

586
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,654
That is the only way to be reborn.

587
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,239
I don't like hell.

588
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,617
My sister brushes her teeth
and listens to Dad well.

589
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,369
It may be called hell,

590
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,330
but it's nothing more
than stacking blocks.

591
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:09,918
It'll be so much fun
if you two play there together.

592
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,254
I don't like stacking blocks.

593
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,381
She doesn't want to do it.

594
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:17,884
You have to do it anyway.

595
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,388
Are there cartoons in hell?

596
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,348
There aren't.

597
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:30,397
Then may I take this slime toy?

598
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:46,121
You can't take anything
from your former life.

599
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,499
I'm sorry.

600
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,670
You're being awfully strict.

601
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,884
She's not flexible even a tiny bit.

602
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,261
Why not ban the dead
from carrying their toll?

603
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,637
That's what I'm saying.

604
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,264
Stay out of this.

605
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,975
Send the girls in.

606
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,603
Yes, ma'am. All right, come this way.

607
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,232
All right, this way.

608
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,699
Kid, take good care of your sister.

609
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,081
How sentimental.

610
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,750
Come this way.

611
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,047
Hell for Children is still operating?

612
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,132
For breaking parents' hearts.

613
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:44,262
It's unfair they died early,
and you even call them awful children.

614
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,350
That law was made to let them be reborn
as quickly as possible.

615
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,603
The afterlife needs
a shift in generations too,

616
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,522
starting with the King of the Underworld.

617
00:53:56,024 --> 00:54:00,320
Would you like to visit
the Hell of Tongue Ripping?

618
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:03,573
It's always torture.
This isn't the Middle Ages.

619
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,284
Afterlife briefings are in PowerPoint,

620
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,786
and you want to rip out tongues?

621
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,083
Did you come early
just to get on my nerves?

622
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,584
No.

623
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,588
Here. Iced Americano.

624
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:26,638
What do I need to do to find a person?

625
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,394
Are you a detective now?

626
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,315
These two.

627
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,611
They're the ones I looked up in the book.

628
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:44,698
They aren't dead,
yet went out of touch for 20 years.

629
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,617
-So what?
-Let's use your clairvoyance.

630
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,370
Put it away.

631
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,871
Did you see? Where are they?

632
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,373
I don't know.

633
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,543
Come on, stop making a big deal
out of your clairvoyance.

634
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,717
I mean I'm not seeing them.

635
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:09,222
-What?
-And if I can't see them--

636
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,516
They aren't in this world
or the afterlife.

637
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,481
I'd ask the one who took them away.

638
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,691
"Took them away?"

639
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,027
Who's that?

640
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,655
Why do I keep getting more missions?

641
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,827
Yes, I do this to make a living,

642
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,746
but don't fret over it every night.

643
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,706
Everyone, stop!

644
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,458
The president is here.

645
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,586
Hello, Urban Legends team.

646
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,672
Hello, sir.

647
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,011
Having fun at work?

648
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,847
We don't work for fun.
We do it to make a living.

649
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,599
You're the same as always.

650
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,309
You had great ratings last month.

651
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,686
Yes. Buy us a meal!

652
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,522
Mr. Choi,
let's all have dinner together soon.

653
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:02,942
Thank you.

654
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,655
Take care, sir.

655
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,377
You must be Jangseung.

656
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,796
That's right.

657
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,426
Don't turn your back on me.

658
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,974
I heard you're in charge of Fox Hill.

659
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,768
I'm looking for someone.

660
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,898
Have you seen them or not?

661
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,861
-Yes or no?
-I don't know.

662
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,365
I don't like wasting my breath.

663
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:51,825
I really don't know!

664
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,457
Why didn't you just say so?

665
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,459
You're too young to be stubborn.

666
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,295
So? There's someone else who knows?

667
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,298
Who is it?

668
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:13,972
Speak louder!

669
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,557
The district magistrate.

670
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,267
"The magistrate?"

671
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,235
Hey, the president only talks to you.

672
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:28,903
I guess so.

673
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,115
What's your secret?

674
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,743
First off, don't get scared.

675
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,330
My, what a simple answer.

676
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,250
Hey, you'll know
when you become a senior director.

677
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,002
He's scary once you get a title.

678
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:47,005
You'll be exactly the same.

679
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,340
You never have honey-garlic flavor.

680
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,761
A mix of sweet and salty is
the best for a hectic life.

681
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:54,804
Do you want some?

682
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,559
What's yours?

683
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,603
Blueberry. But you can't have mine.

684
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,855
If you quit vaping, I'll reconsider.

685
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,940
You cheapskate.

686
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,238
Is he even human or computer graphics?

687
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,493
He has great proportions, great looks,

688
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,453
and a great car.

689
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,962
He's a disaster
waiting to happen before my eyes.

690
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,047
That's harassment.

691
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,800
Let's go.

692
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,011
Why did you come here?

693
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,014
Hey, wait.

694
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,353
What was that?

695
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,730
-Where are we going?
-Hop in. Now.

696
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,565
Now.

697
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,659
What is this situation?

698
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,369
No idea.

699
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,376
Where are we going?

700
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,461
To find your dream.

701
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:13,299
-No way.
-I even made a playlist for you.

702
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,622
I'm looking for something, Jangseung.

703
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:46,958
What?

704
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:48,626
Tiger's Brows.

705
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,920
That's merely a legend!

706
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,841
So am I, but I'm alive and well
holding you by the neck.

707
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,511
I will ask you one last time.
Have you seen it or not?

708
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:00,263
I really haven't!

709
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:02,473
Really? Then you can go.

710
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,184
No, wait!

711
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,604
Wait! One second!

712
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,189
Wait! Please! Wait!

713
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,613
Those damn foxes.

714
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,496
Come gather here, everyone!

715
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,665
What brings you here today?

716
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:38,301
Welcome. Come with me.

717
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,511
Who wants to come with me?

718
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,348
Two, three! Did you get my picture?

719
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,100
Do it again. One, twoâ€¦

720
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,436
Three! Did you get it?

721
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,986
Wait here. I'll take a quick look.

722
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,030
Don't go anywhere.

723
01:00:59,113 --> 01:00:59,947
Okay.

724
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:10,083
HANBOK RENTAL

725
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:50,952
Be reborn.

726
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,120
I willâ€¦

727
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:57,875
come and find you.

728
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,925
Where did you go?
I looked everywhere for you.

729
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,377
Who have you been looking for?

730
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,962
Fox Hill is your turf, right?

731
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,298
You should be more concerned
with your survival.

732
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:29,967
You always end up getting hurt
because of me.

733
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:33,638
Just go find your family,
then continue to live a normal life.

734
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:36,265
You have the thing
that can look into our past lives.

735
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,893
-What are you doing here?
-To check on something.

736
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,563
It's gone.

737
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:44,607
Something has awoken in her body.

738
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,776
The serpent isn't dead.

01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:52,573
