1
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,039
Let me ask you a question.

2
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,000
Why did you decide

3
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,543
to work with me?

4
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,881
It's probably the same reason as you.

5
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,059
What are you doing here?

6
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,520
You have to die for me to survive.

7
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,480
I'm going to end everything myself.

8
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:46,981
Don't do this.

9
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,234
-If you do this, you'll--
-Goodbye.

10
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,247
This is exactly why Ji-a warned you.

11
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,791
You shouldn't have done this.

12
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,796
You're not Ji-a.

13
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,091
Do you not even recognize your master?

14
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,759
What a scumbag.

15
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,012
-I let you go, then you dare to do this?
-A scumbag?

16
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,931
I had no reason

17
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,268
to stick around
other than the bladder cherries.

18
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,062
To be honest, you really disgust me.

19
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:30,024
You're the definition of inferiority
who isn't a deity nor a human.

20
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,781
You talk too much.

21
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,033
You've lived too long.

22
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,618
Go to hell.

23
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,871
Your family must be waiting.

24
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,917
Dad! Dad!

25
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,210
When was that?

26
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,714
I used to have something
I wanted to protect with my life.

27
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,425
Dad, where have you been?

28
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,093
What did you get? Dad?

29
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,888
My children, my wife, and my mother.

30
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,014
Dad.

31
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,725
I don't even remember their faces anymore.

32
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,439
Damn it.

33
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:22,952
Did you see that?

34
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,794
This is strange.

35
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,714
Those who filled my cup

36
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,800
were always those who begged me
for more time

37
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:39,928
to live longer.

38
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,598
"Just one more day. Just one more year."

39
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,268
Don't brag so much
about having no friends.

40
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,812
I don't trust anyone.

41
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,523
It sounds more like
you couldn't be trusted by anyone.

42
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,317
It means I have nothing to protect.

43
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,819
That's what made me stronger than you.

44
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,868
I'm stronger than you

45
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,080
because I have something to protect.

46
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,040
Really?

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,877
Something must have happened with Ji-a.

48
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,963
My other half woke up again.

49
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,547
What?

50
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,466
Sit down.

51
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,177
If you leave before I finish this,

52
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,471
you can forget about our alliance.

53
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,517
This is my only chance
to drag him down to Samdocheon.

54
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,563
Am I going to give up this chance
to go help Ji-a? Or--

55
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,565
Don't worry.

56
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,193
That thing only comes out
when it feels threatened,

57
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,862
like when it sees blood.

58
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,573
It's highly prone to protect itself.

59
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,450
Nothing bad will happen,

60
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,452
at least to Ji-a.

61
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,922
This is the difference between us.

62
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,383
I'm not sure. You also have something

63
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,093
you'd die to protect.

64
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,889
What about that thing inside Ji-a?

65
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,934
Rumor has it that if it dies,
you'll be pretty worthless.

66
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,021
You put some thought into it,

67
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,148
but why did you hide

68
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,359
something so important in my lover
and cause this trouble?

69
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,780
You took one of its scales.

70
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,449
-And you want it back?
-Will you?

71
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,701
-If you return Ji-a.
-We attack Taluipa first.

72
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,010
Don't--

73
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,345
don't come any closer!

74
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:49,891
Don't come.

75
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,144
I came closer.

76
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,604
What will you do?

77
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,314
Will you kill me?

78
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,275
If I die, Ji-a dies too.

79
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,780
Do you want to try?

80
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,697
Do you think

81
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:06,866
I won't?

82
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,659
As you've seen, you get one chance.

83
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,080
If you miss, it'll be my turn.

84
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,417
Now, I'm going to count to three.

85
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,086
Make your decision.

86
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,089
One.

87
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,466
Do you think it's a coincidence
that the three of us met?

88
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,801
I think it's fate.

89
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,260
Two.

90
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,971
A guy who's after my life is
much closer than I expect.

91
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,225
Just as you two kept me safe
in my past life,

92
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,144
I want to keep you safe too.

93
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,521
Three.

94
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,982
Man, I knew it.

95
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,903
Nam Ji-a!

96
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,033
Wake up, you brat.

97
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,831
Why are your hands so bloody?

98
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,582
Your cute outfit is all ruined.

99
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,422
Ms. Kim?

100
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:04,966
Yes, it's me.

101
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,427
Do you recognize us now?

102
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,853
Jae-hwan.

103
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,605
I'm fine.

104
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,940
I'm not hurt.

105
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,826
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,245
I'm so sorry.

107
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,624
It's okay.

108
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,835
We're all safe. That's all that matters.

109
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,128
It's okay. It's all right.

110
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,629
Oh, no.

111
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,300
No.

112
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,384
It's okay.

113
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,928
How are we going to catch that old woman?

114
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,307
What do you know about her?

115
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,100
That she can simply blink

116
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,895
and turn any mountain deity to stone.

117
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,731
And she can see 1,000 ri ahead
with those eyes.

118
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,317
About her clairvoyance…

119
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,820
how much can she see?

120
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,406
For example, can she see my face?

121
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,367
She isn't a CCTV.

122
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,995
She can just read
the general flow of this world.

123
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,291
For example, she may not know
what exactly we're talking about,

124
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,169
but she'd know we're together right now.

125
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,296
So she could miss out on the details.

126
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,426
We'll have a chance
if we could cover her eyes.

127
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,678
How?

128
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,979
Didn't you send this to put me to sleep?

129
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,150
Rang took just a sip,
but it still worked like a charm.

130
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,027
Would that old woman drink this?

131
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,321
She might.

132
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,659
If I can take advantage
of the only one she trusts.

133
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,952
Who?

134
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:58,788
Hyeonuiong.

135
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,796
Hyeonuiong is a man who would
even feign death at his wife's word.

136
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,464
He's not anymore.

137
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,426
Saving Ji-a against her will is
proof of that.

138
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,354
So he'll put the old lady to sleep
before we get there?

139
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,734
Once she falls asleep, you finish the job.

140
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,986
When do we do it?

141
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:30,987
Tomorrow.

142
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,281
Be there by noon.

143
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,452
When we're done, take over
the Samdocheon River as promised,

144
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,247
then Ji-a and my ill-fated relationship
with you ends there.

145
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,376
Fine.

146
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,425
Am I worrying too much?

147
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,428
This is going a lot easier than I thought.

148
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,059
No, he took the bait.

149
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,896
I just need to bring him to Samdocheon.

150
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,401
Didn't they have a son together?

151
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,408
How do you know that?

152
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,328
I know. I just do.

153
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,838
How will this story end?

154
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,053
A happy ending, for sure.

155
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,610
The president was here.

156
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,406
He had the same condition as Ms. Kim.

157
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,244
He said he could live if he killed me.

158
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,788
Where is he?

159
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,790
He's dead.

160
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,376
I shot him.

161
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,879
I turned into the serpent, and I--

162
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,639
He defied his natural time
and lived for centuries.

163
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,394
Even if it weren't for you,
he wouldn't have lived to see tomorrow.

164
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,521
I almost killed Jae-hwan, too.

165
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,526
I barely managed to come back to myself.

166
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,120
You held out well.

167
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,580
I'm so scared.

168
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,415
It won't be long.

169
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,170
It'll all end tomorrow.

170
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,677
Don't you have to pee?

171
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,472
I don't do that kind of stuff.

172
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,473
Gosh.

173
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,809
You're already lying here
in the middle of my restaurant.

174
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,269
Don't be so embarrassed.

175
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,692
But why are you so nice to me?

176
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,779
You even closed because of me.

177
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,948
What goes around comes around, doesn't it?

178
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,534
Did you say you lost your husband
a long time ago?

179
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,914
What was he like?

180
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,793
When we'd grill fish,

181
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:19,715
he'd remove the spines
and put the meat on my rice first.

182
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,842
One time, in the middle of winter,

183
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,346
I suddenly said
I wanted some honey rice cake,

184
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,141
and he climbed over a hill in the snow
to get me some.

185
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,688
He could've called a delivery service.
Why did he go that far in the snow?

186
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,233
What about you?

187
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,736
Why do you keep lurking around me?

188
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,656
Whenever I eat your food,

189
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,744
it gives me butterflies in my stomach.

190
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,788
It feels very

191
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,917
familiar and nostalgic.

192
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,882
How many people died last night
because of the serpent?

193
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,593
Nine hundred and three?

194
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,931
Get all reserve personnel on it.

195
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,933
Tell everyone to hold out
for one more day.

196
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,570
Honey!

197
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,132
When your eyes get blurry.

198
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,217
When you have to calm yourself down.

199
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,303
A great cure for your stomachache!

200
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,018
Is something bothering you?

201
00:14:55,936 --> 00:15:00,190
It's about time my old woman
ran out of her arthritis medicine.

202
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,153
Whatever. I don't care.

203
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,991
Go back home. You've already done enough.

204
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,034
Forget it.

205
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,410
You'll regret it.

206
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,413
I do regret it.

207
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,458
Why did I think I could change her?

208
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,461
Why didn't I leave when we lost our son?

209
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,754
Because you loved her--

210
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,880
I did.

211
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,590
I thought it was love.

212
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:29,345
We had nothing in common
from our personalities to tastes.

213
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,056
We couldn't even share
a bowl of tteokbokki together.

214
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,724
I always get the mild one.

215
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,643
She gets the spiciest one.

216
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,519
You should have shared the medium one.

217
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,773
That's what married couples do.

218
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,691
We were just too different.

219
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,197
So are you just going to sit around
and watch?

220
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,075
Mr. Lee might die

221
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,744
instead of that young lady.

222
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,413
Otherwise, my old woman
wouldn't have let her live.

223
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,581
Stop her!

224
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,249
If I could stop her,

225
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,418
things wouldn't have come to this!

226
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,836
Even so, we can't lose

227
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,965
Mr. Lee like this.

228
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,009
Goodness.

229
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,101
LEE YEON

230
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,316
Hey, it's me.

231
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,901
I need to see you.

232
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,737
You can tell me over the phone.
I'm ready to take this.

233
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,905
It's a long story.

234
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,074
I just went to see the serpent.

235
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,245
Is that so?

236
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,080
Okay.

237
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,960
What does this mean?

238
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,964
Is she dead or alive?

239
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,855
What do you mean?

240
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,857
Why would you eat the serpent's scale?

241
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,277
If I eat it,

242
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,364
the serpent inside Ji-a
will be transferred into me.

243
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:15,993
And then what?

244
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,119
I'll take that thing

245
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,621
and jump into the Samdocheon.

246
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,293
No. Never.

247
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,883
Forget that plan.
There has to be another way.

248
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,886
What's at stake

249
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,722
isn't just Ji-a.

250
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:40,309
Countless people are
dying from this plague.

251
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,937
I've thought about everything I could,

252
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,986
but this is the only way
to catch that thing.

253
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,364
I'll do it, then.

254
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,035
I'll eat that scale
and jump into the Samdocheon.

255
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,746
You can't handle the serpent.

256
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:03,916
Don't do this.

257
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,919
Please don't do this.

258
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,796
we won't be able to save your soul.

259
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,715
You can't even be reincarnated!

260
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,343
I know.

261
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,929
Then will you stop saying
that you'll kill yourself?

262
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,397
Sin-ju.

263
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,615
You…

264
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,203
have to understand me.

265
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,042
I'm telling you everything
because it's you.

266
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,259
You're so mean.

267
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,220
Mr. Lee, you're so mean.

268
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,235
What brings you here?

269
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,820
Thanks for the gift.

270
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,615
-"Gift"?
-You sent the president to me.

271
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,452
If you knew, why didn't you tell Yeon?

272
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,413
I would've done the same.

273
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,915
If I were you,
I would have told him already.

274
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,877
I didn't, and I'm not going to.

275
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,587
Why not?

276
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,922
Because Yeon cares about you.

277
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,260
He'll be devastated if he loses you.

278
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,143
Do you know what it means
for him to join hands

279
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,187
with the serpent?

280
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,107
-What does it mean?
-He'll save you and kill himself.

281
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,151
He'll die…

282
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,112
because of you.

283
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,783
He came up with the idea
to kill himself to save me?

284
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,951
Isn't it obvious?

285
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,496
That being said,

286
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,627
give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you

287
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,128
right now.

288
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,052
I won't stop you if you want to do that.

289
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,304
But I wouldn't recommend it.

290
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,514
You'll either die or get hurt.

291
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,226
Someone just tested it out.

292
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,815
I'll get straight to the point.

293
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,484
I have no intention of dying.

294
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,236
Not yet, at least.

295
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,695
Not yet?

296
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,788
If I ever hurt Lee Yeon,

297
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,998
I'm going to kill myself.

298
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,710
However, if I fail,

299
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,087
you kill me.

300
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,800
Yeon won't be able to.

301
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,010
Are you serious?

302
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,058
As luck would have it,
we share the same goal.

303
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,935
We want to protect Yeon.

304
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,232
If you want to save your brother,
call a truce with me for now.

305
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,124
Fine.

306
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,962
What do you want me to do?

307
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,051
Don't get involved in this fight.

308
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,929
Make sure you survive…

309
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,099
and keep Ji-a safe.

310
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,397
Keep an eye on her for me.

311
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,982
I'll protect her.

312
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,613
And Rang.

313
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,701
If I break his heart
and make him go astray again…

314
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,624
nag at him to do better.

315
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,544
I'll nag him as much as I can.

316
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,301
And start a family
with the necklace thief.

317
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,889
This is my early wedding gift.

318
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,267
It's a brand-new apartment.

319
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,313
You've done a great job
putting up with my short temper.

320
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,067
Mr. Lee.

321
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,865
I'm not going to thank you or apologize.

322
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,328
I've fed, clothed,
and accommodated you plenty.

323
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,245
Mr. Lee.

324
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,167
May I ask you a question?

325
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,838
A long time ago, when the deity
of my mountain came after me,

326
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,799
why did you save my life?

327
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,676
I wanted revenge.

328
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:08,804
Revenge?

329
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,307
I had spicy noodles with him one time.

330
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,768
But that jerk snatched the only egg I had

331
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,311
and ate the whole thing.

332
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,313
Is that all?

333
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,607
What do you mean?

334
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,693
I always save the egg for my last bite.

335
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,570
What's this for?

336
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,157
Do I need a reason
to buy a bowl of naengmyeon?

337
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,492
Why are you suddenly buying me this?

338
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,578
It's on you. I missed lunch.

339
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,788
That's ridiculous.

340
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,290
I know what you're thinking.

341
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,792
Don't be so annoying. Let's just eat.

342
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,554
You really do add only mustard,
and not vinegar.

343
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,473
What?

344
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,933
Ki Yu-ri? She told me that.

345
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,728
She said you only add mustard
in naengmyeon.

346
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:41,855
Did she?

347
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,442
That's something people only notice
when they really care.

348
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,404
I saved her life.

349
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,614
If it weren't for me,

350
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,824
she would've been
beaten or starved to death.

351
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,163
Who's that little boy at home?

352
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,124
He's Geomdoong,
that black dog I kept in the past.

353
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,088
Even if he was your dog in the past life,

354
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,133
you can't just bring him home.
What about his parents?

355
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,303
He has this stepdad,
but he beat him and pissed me off.

356
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,849
Why are you laughing?

357
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:18,808
It's ridiculous.

358
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,228
You went around wreaking havoc
like the Joker,

359
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,814
-but you've done lots of volunteer work.
-Shut up.

360
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,442
You've grown into a good man, bed wetter.

361
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,361
I'll kill you.

362
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,204
Give me your egg if you don't want it.

363
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,310
Why do you look so obviously unhappy?

364
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,645
I hate being around you.

365
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,563
I want to go home.

366
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,648
Home?

367
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,401
Do you have a home to go back to?

368
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,279
You've torn Lee Rang's body
with your hands,

369
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,864
and you were abandoned by Sin-ju
yesterday.

370
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,575
No one will miss you anymore.

371
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,868
No, Mr. Lee will wait for me.

372
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,413
And Sin-ju too.

373
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,456
No, you fit in much better here.

374
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,543
Didn't people abuse you?

375
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:30,380
For quite a while,
until your soul turned into tatters.

376
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,924
I can see the darkness in you.

377
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,762
Stop reading my mind.

378
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,639
That's why you're so creepy.

379
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,559
Things like you

380
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,688
only bring others misfortune
even if you stayed by Rang or Sin-ju,

381
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,023
just like me.

382
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,651
So don't get your hopes up.

383
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,696
No one will save you.

384
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,659
I know from experience.

385
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,751
You must love naengmyeon.

386
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,629
At least this tastes good.
What do you see in that woman?

387
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,673
What about her
makes you want to risk your own life?

388
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,096
She saved me in the past.

389
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,432
She even risked her own life.

390
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,018
If I don't stop her,

391
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,687
she'll try to protect me again

392
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,564
instead of herself.

393
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,569
She's a woman who keeps her promises.

394
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,989
Just ask her to protect you.
She's doing it because she wants to.

395
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:38,990
No.

396
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,077
It'll be embarrassing
to have her save me twice.

397
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,495
You fool.

398
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,748
So you're going to die instead of her?

399
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,753
Come with me tomorrow.

400
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:53,797
Where?

401
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,424
Samdocheon. Let's catch that serpent.

402
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:01,763
I need you to prevent
anything unexpected from happening.

403
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,390
What's your plan?

404
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,016
You don't need the details.

405
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,603
I need your help
in case of any accidents..

406
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,981
Let me give it a thought.

407
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:16,111
Hey, I saved your life twice.

408
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,362
Come on, it's us.

409
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,697
I'm glad you brought it up.

410
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,782
Is this the best you can do between us?

411
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,743
You won't even shed a tear
even though I just said I might die.

412
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:24,786
You won't die.

413
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,621
You're not human.

414
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,001
A Nine-tailed Fox can't die easily.

415
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,340
Gosh, the sky looks so nice.

416
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,635
It won't be so bad
to end the world on a day like this.

417
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,679
What are you planning to do with Lee Yeon?

418
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:44,764
Didn't you hear us?

419
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,099
You heard us talk.

420
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,061
So will you really become a deity?

421
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,147
Then what?

422
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,857
I'll take the world

423
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:55,942
and Ji-a for myself.

424
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,778
That's not what you said.

425
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,864
That was a promise I couldn't keep anyway.

426
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,907
It's the same for him.

427
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,034
That being said,

428
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,120
come with me to Samdocheon.

429
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,621
Why should I?

430
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,165
If Lee Yeon doesn't come alone,

431
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,459
you'll have to hold them back again.

432
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,376
What if I refuse?

433
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,378
I wasn't asking for your opinion.

434
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,176
Should I call Rang and Sin-ju now?

435
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,179
They'll die if I say, "I want to die."

436
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:25,972
You've experienced it.

437
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,183
Just kill me instead!

438
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,854
That's not how you do it.

439
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,063
If I kill you,

440
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,650
there's no way for me to see you despair.

441
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,008
What brings you here?

442
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,681
I'm just a cook.

443
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,062
But I couldn't just sit by
and watch Mr. Lee die.

444
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,317
Sit by and watch. Just sit there.

445
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,028
There's nothing you can do.

446
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,321
I couldn't do that.

447
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,241
What did you say?

448
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,124
Snail Bride.

449
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,545
Where are we?

450
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,923
the place where souls cross over
to the afterlife.

451
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,384
And who am I?

452
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:47,262
You are lord of the Samdocheon.

453
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,055
Then,

454
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:53,017
you must know how blasphemous
everything you just said is.

455
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,394
Yes, I know.

456
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,524
However, before you are
the lord of Samdocheon,

457
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:04,571
you're also someone's wife,
mother, and friend.

458
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,615
You were never a mom for Bok-gil
or a wife for me.

459
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,868
Just the gatekeeper of Samdocheon.

460
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,828
You're wrong.

461
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,373
I was never

462
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,919
someone's wife, mother, or friend.

463
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:27,886
Will you be all right

464
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,804
after losing Yeon?

465
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,349
-What?
-I don't mean his fate or whatnot.

466
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,602
I mean your heart.

467
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,815
He has given you his trust
and relied on you for many years.

468
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:45,320
That's also probably because
you adored him so much,

469
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:51,326
since he reminded you of the son you lost.

470
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,953
Did that old man say that to you?

471
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,122
Then

472
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:59,792
I'm sure you've also heard
what I did to my only child.

473
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,254
My son

474
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,342
also begged me right there,
just like Yeon did.

475
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,802
He begged me to save his wife.

476
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,223
Yes, I'm someone
who even refused my son's request.

477
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,475
That's why

478
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,019
you still can't forgive yourself.

479
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,570
How dare you?

480
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,698
I'm sorry
if I stepped over the line. But--

481
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,200
If you say another word,

482
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,079
I'll crush those hands you cook with.

483
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,418
GLUCOSAMINE

484
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,172
He asked me to give you this.

485
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,716
Please,

486
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,679
do not abandon Mr. Lee Yeon
or Lord Hyeonuiong.

487
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,741
Where are we going now?

488
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,868
I don't need you.

489
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,162
I'll give you a task when I return.

490
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,542
What?

491
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,293
How could you say that to Yu-ri?

492
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,753
She used you?

493
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,296
It was a mistake.

494
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,924
Yu-ri said she didn't care
if those petty humans died.

495
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,093
That woman's parents are
just petty humans.

496
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:33,928
You crazy jerk.

497
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,513
How dare you say that to her?

498
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,515
And she's in danger all because of me.

499
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,312
I regret it too.

500
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,441
But I can't reach her to apologize.

501
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,608
You're finished.

502
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,029
Yu-ri can be very harsh
once she holds a grudge.

503
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,115
Mr. Lee, then please talk to her--

504
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,575
I'm just like her.

505
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,702
I'll never let you date her.

506
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,459
Will she come back safe and sound?

507
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,546
This won't do. Let's go.

508
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,340
Where?

509
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,109
Yu-ri, it's me.

510
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,408
Your car is here, so you must be inside.

511
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,952
I don't care if you're with him,
so listen.

512
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,664
Once you come back,
I'll hit you a few times.

513
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,167
Who said you could switch owners?

514
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,050
You've caused me so much trouble.

515
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,177
I have no one to get me naengmyeon,

516
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,805
and that boy is putting stickers on me.

517
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,265
-It's driving me nuts.
-You came here to say that?

518
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,643
Maybe she's not listening.

519
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,894
Should we just barge in?

520
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,771
No, Mr. Lee Yeon will be furious.

521
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,941
Then let me say something too.

522
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,276
Yu-ri, don't forgive this jerk.

523
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,277
Come on.

524
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,739
Yu-ri.

525
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,659
I'll apologize later.

526
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,036
Just come back safely.

527
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,289
And don't take anything
that jerk says to your heart.

528
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,999
Just focus on your safety.

529
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:31,629
I was going to propose to you
when you come back.

530
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,089
-Okay, I get it.
-Wait.

531
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,176
Yu-ri.

532
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,470
I'll save you.

533
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,014
Stay strong until tomorrow.

534
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,103
Yu-ri, I'll also--

535
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,938
-Let's go.
-Hold on.

536
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:32,815
Guess who?

537
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,320
I can tell just by your hands.

538
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,239
What if someone disguises as me?

539
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,285
Then my heart
wouldn't be beating this fast.

540
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,875
That's some pickup line.

541
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,711
Were you really single for 600 years?

542
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,421
Yes, I'm sure.

543
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,881
My eyes are for you alone.

544
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,716
You're the only one in frame.

545
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,930
So what are we doing today?

546
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:08,184
Today, we're going to be
an ordinary couple. Look forward to it.

547
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,773
Here's a normal thing. Come to this side.

548
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,449
Why is it a claw machine?

549
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,868
This was one of my dreams!

550
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,874
With my fortune,
I could just buy you the whole arcade.

551
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,542
But how can I put this?

552
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,419
I want to give you a token of my efforts.

553
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:37,964
Now, look.

554
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:42,301
Don't fight the machine.
Make it work for you.

555
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,053
Like this.

556
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,815
It's so cute.

557
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,483
-Do it again.
-Try it again.

558
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,526
Help me.

559
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,404
Look. Like this.

560
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,738
-Press it.
-Now?

561
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,825
We got it.

562
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,748
Ta-da!

563
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,292
Look.

564
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,142
It won't go in.

565
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,352
No, wait. One second.

566
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,770
No, hold your hand like this.

567
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,771
Let go.

568
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,606
This is my fight against this jerk.

569
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,951
Move!

570
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,009
How's the mint chocolate?

571
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,136
It's refreshing.

572
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,722
It's like a forest in my mouth.

573
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,849
How's the vanilla?

574
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:15,936
It's sweet.

575
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,564
It tastes like honey too.

576
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,485
Do you want to trade?

577
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,404
How about mixing it up?

578
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,670
I must be

579
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,257
deeply in love with you.

580
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,718
I've lived so many years,

581
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,723
and I've easily forgotten
other names and faces I've met,

582
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,019
but I remember every single moment
I spent with you.

583
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,567
Don't ever forget me.

584
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,742
How could I forget this face?

585
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,915
I love you, Yeon.

586
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,612
Is that so?

587
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,491
Is it not that you left me,

588
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,495
but that I have forsaken you?

589
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,876
Is that why I ended up like this?

590
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,756
I've told myself endlessly
that I'd never forgive you even if I die.

591
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:10,968
It turns out…

592
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:16,765
I just couldn't forgive myself.

593
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,021
To you,

594
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,858
what kind of mother was I?

595
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,644
What did you wish for?

596
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,150
I wished for your safety.

597
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,279
That you won't get injured or hurt

598
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,823
or cry.

599
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:18,786
You're so greedy.

600
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:23,374
If anything happens out of our control,

601
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,337
I wished that you'd forget everything.

602
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,466
No, I'm going to wait for you.

603
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,929
Just as you waited for me.

604
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,437
No.

605
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,482
Human life is too short for that.

606
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,444
What did you wish for, Ji-a?

607
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:55,155
I made a wish

608
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,242
to a very kind deity somewhere out there,

609
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,371
to bring us a sort of miracle.

610
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,083
"Please…

611
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,545
save us."

612
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:31,900
Hey, Granny.

613
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,281
What? Now?

614
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,581
What did you mean by that?

615
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,504
I've smoked for a long time.

616
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,343
There were only two of you in this world

617
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,969
who nagged me to quit smoking.

618
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:03,390
-One of them is you.
-And the other was your son.

619
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,770
He was the sweetest boy.

620
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:09,730
But

621
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:14,610
he never said a word again
after his wife passed away.

622
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,782
It would've been better
if he blamed me outright.

623
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,077
Then he jumped into the Samdocheon River.

624
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,622
He even left the shoes I made for him.

625
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,624
That jerk.

626
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,168
He was trying to show me

627
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,962
that he'll never forgive me.

628
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:36,632
You're wrong.

629
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,886
Even as he took his own life
after the devastating death of his wife,

630
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,557
he didn't want the shoes
his mom made for him to get wet.

631
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:49,353
I'm quite savvy about these things.

632
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,234
I'm going to quit smoking.

633
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,611
Do you really mean it?

634
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,574
I've lived long enough,
so I want to do something I've never done.

635
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:05,994
What do you mean?

636
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,497
I mean that there is a way to end this

637
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,583
without letting you or her die.

638
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,170
What's that?

639
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,219
Great work, everyone.

640
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,471
-Great work.
-Great job today.

641
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,432
Be careful on your way home.

642
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,475
Great work today.

643
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,185
-Goodbye.
-Great job today.

644
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,382
When the serpent gets here tomorrow,

645
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,968
use this sword to slay Ji-a.

646
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,810
Slash her not gently,
but almost enough to kill her.

647
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,979
-What?
-On the verge of death,

648
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:18,859
that thing in her body
will try to escape from her.

649
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:19,902
What about the scale?

650
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,695
Don't make use of it.

651
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,572
Let it go into the serpent.

652
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,825
When the two half-serpents become one,

653
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,328
I'll turn him to stone.

654
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:35,000
But what if Ji-a really dies?

655
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,754
I'll bring her back.

656
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,010
I will have to pay the price
for breaking the taboo.

657
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:47,846
Granny.

658
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,350
Put the soppy stuff aside.

659
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,310
Just bring them here on time,

660
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,479
both Ji-a and the serpent.

661
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:02,069
You know, I always knew
that you weren't such a bad person

662
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,195
for a long time.

663
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:07,491
Let go of me, kid.

664
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,728
I enjoyed your performance.

665
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,814
Thank you.

666
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,191
You're also not human.

667
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,152
You're very sharp.

668
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,700
It doesn't matter. We're already closed.

669
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,953
I was looking for something.

670
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:57,040
If you've lost something,
please visit the lost and found center.

671
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,001
It's okay.

672
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:02,880
I just found it.

673
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,593
And what is that?

674
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,639
The Moon Mirror.

675
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,155
Ever since my mom passed away,

676
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:32,034
I felt like an orphan.

677
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,537
But thanks to you and Jae-hwan,

678
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,082
I wasn't lonely at all.

679
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,336
Thank you.

680
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,339
Hang in there.

681
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,176
Please.

682
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:50,928
Ms. Nam.

683
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,680
Yes?

684
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,058
I think you should take it.

685
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:05,901
Is anyone dying?

686
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,153
Where are you?

687
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,369
I'm nearby.

688
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,318
You finally came.

689
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,403
Where's the cure?

690
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,614
Do you have time to worry about others?
You're about to die soon.

691
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,074
Where's the cure?

692
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,534
It doesn't exist.

693
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,621
I was born as the plague.
So I know how to kill people,

694
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,999
but I've never learned how to save lives.

695
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,292
You asshole.

696
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,712
You're going to die soon.

697
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,339
I wish you fall to the bottom of hell.

698
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,302
This is why I love you.

699
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,890
You're in such danger that
you can't keep your body under control,

700
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,518
but you still never give up.

701
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,438
I'm going to have you.

702
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:28,483
That's absurd.
I'd rather die before I become yours.

703
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:32,112
From now on, you'll wish you were dead.

704
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:35,907
Come out.

705
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,466
Don't work with Lee Yeon.

706
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,720
They're up to something.

707
00:50:59,014 --> 00:50:59,848
I don't care.

708
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,560
You have a job to do now.

709
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:30,879
What are you doing?

710
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,132
The magistrate was attacked.

711
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,176
What?

712
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,346
What do you mean?

713
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,223
Who attacked him?

714
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,058
The serpent.

715
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:48,063
He's not dead, but something important was
taken away from him or something.

716
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:56,655
You're him.

717
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,033
It's time for a quiz.

718
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,536
What was taken from the magistrate?

719
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,501
The Moon Mirror.

720
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,212
You--

721
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:17,634
How did you take up his form?

722
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,767
Didn't you miss this face a lot?

723
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:30,814
The poor boy who was killed by his mother,
her only son.

724
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,191
Bok-gil.

725
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,110
My Bok-gil.

726
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:38,405
I chose this face just for you.

727
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,908
I knew it'd be useful one day.

728
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,786
How did you know about my son?

729
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,664
Here's my second question.

730
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:51,459
Why did my other half
go after the Moon Mirror?

731
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,255
No.

732
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,049
-Granny.
-Honey, stay with me.

733
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,013
Sin-ju!

734
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,098
Why are you--

735
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,892
I've been called by him.

736
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,689
One day, when the serpent in her calls,

737
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,985
you will become my soldier.

738
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,955
Bok-gil was such a nice boy.

739
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,458
He was the first to talk to me

740
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,710
when everyone else in the world
despised me.

741
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:37,088
It felt like I finally made a friend.

742
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,174
But did you know?

743
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,426
I was the one

744
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,180
who seeded his wife's body
with the plague.

745
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,435
Why--

746
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,520
Why did you do it?

747
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:59,194
He looked way too happy.

748
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,293
You scumbag!

749
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,241
Let's go. We need Granny for our plan.

750
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:47,909
It's too late.

751
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:49,327
Wake up, Ji-a!

752
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:53,790
We can both live.
For the first time, there's hope.

753
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:58,920
Gosh, what a headache.

754
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,925
-Mr. Lee.
-Sin-ju, you stay put.

755
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:04,884
Rang, come with me.

756
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,929
-I'm sorry. We are--
-Not now!

757
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,932
You were just hypnotized, that's all.

758
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,517
Take Ji-a with you.

759
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:14,602
Wait a minute.

760
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,567
Let go.

761
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,901
I'll go on my own.

762
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,626
What about Granny?

763
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,506
Where is she?

764
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,217
Did you get her?

765
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:52,140
No wonder this is one of
the four treasures of the deities.

766
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,143
That old woman lost her sanity

767
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,396
when I showed up with her son's face.

768
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,440
She might be the deity of all deities,

769
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:45,443
but she'll always have a weakness

770
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,696
as long as she has a human heart.

771
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,501
This was your plan all along.

772
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,836
It's all your fault.

773
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,380
You wouldn't give up,

774
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:08,842
so innocent people died,
that old woman died,

775
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,344
and our dear Ji-a is dying.

776
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:07,901
Ji-a.

777
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:10,445
Please.

778
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,669
You still can't lay a finger on this body.

779
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,465
So just donate your body and die.

780
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,009
You have no other choice.

781
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,762
It's the only way she'll live.

782
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:11,881
Stop this.

783
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:15,969
Let her go.

784
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:18,429
I will.

785
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:27,647
Take my body.

786
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,422
What are you doing here?

787
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,885
Mr. Lee, you can't go in.

788
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,262
Never.

789
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,433
Yu-ri.

790
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,853
I came here to save you and Yeon.

791
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:11,024
But if anything happens to Yeon,

792
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:15,236
I'll kill you.

793
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:24,871
Don't!

794
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,586
-Ji-a.
-Don't move!

795
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,634
You're still holding out?

796
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:41,137
No, don't do that.

797
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,556
Put that down, please.

798
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,229
I'll protect you, Yeon.

799
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,606
I'll do it.

800
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,493
Goodbye.

801
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,349
No.

802
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:27,767
No!

803
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,145
Get out of that body.

804
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,492
Forgive me.

805
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,536
It's all to protect you.

806
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,507
Yeon!

807
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,092
Don't come near me.

808
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:03,177
-Yeon.
-Stay away!

809
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,227
No!

810
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,358
The Lee Yeon you know is now dead.

811
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:21,154
I win.

812
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,417
What is this?

813
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,129
Don't I look awful?

814
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:25,259
At the end,

815
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,846
I wanted to look especially pretty.

816
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,184
But still…

817
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,146
we won.

818
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:53,746
This is my present.

819
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,333
When one half gets weak,

820
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,293
you become weak too.

821
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:22,066
It's evening primrose from a graveyard.

822
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:56,475
Yeon!

823
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:22,793
Damn.

824
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:54,408
Rang.

825
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:58,996
Rang!

826
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:14,637
You and I are one now.

827
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,056
If you kill me, you'll die too.

828
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:18,766
That's what I wanted.

829
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:44,125
Rang.

830
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,711
No, I can't do this.

831
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,132
Soon,

832
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,135
I'll turn into the serpent.

833
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,806
Let me die as myself.

834
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,145
Please, Rang.

835
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:05,730
No.

836
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,342
Save me.

837
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,221
I will be reborn.

838
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:22,765
I'll come back

839
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,768
and find her again.

840
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:29,230
Don't make me laugh.

841
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:34,693
No one can come back once they've fallen
into the Samdocheon River.

842
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:50,167
No.

843
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:14,400
No.

844
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:25,494
I love you.

845
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:28,581
No!

846
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:31,834
No!

847
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,250
He smiled

848
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:19,423
as if he was glad to have saved my life,

849
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:23,886
as if this was his happy ending.

850
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,225
In the very end,

851
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:34,313
I think I may have heard him say…

852
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:35,773
Yeon!

853
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:37,399
…the word "love".

854
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:20,359
I can really do anything you ask.

855
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:24,947
-Please.
-Something like that won't happen.

856
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:28,742
Get a grip!
Mr. Lee wanted me to tell you that.

857
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,035
You'll get used to it.

858
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,162
You'll have to take the path

859
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,873
we took together alone now,

860
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,501
but it's time to let me go.

861
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,420
I love you, Ji-a.

862
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:43,590
I heard a rumor,
so I came to see that old man.

863
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:51,056
