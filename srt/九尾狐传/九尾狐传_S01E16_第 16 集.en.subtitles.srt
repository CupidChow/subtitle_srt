1
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,213
No one can come back once they've fallen

2
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,382
into the Samdocheon River.

3
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,304
No.

4
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,393
I love you.

5
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,604
No!

6
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,190
No!

7
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,645
Yeon.

8
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,411
Don't leave me.

9
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,914
Yeon!

10
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,835
I can hear her crying.

11
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,254
Yeon!

12
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,714
I have to tell her…

13
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,385
that she doesn't have to be so sad.

14
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,223
That a love story
between a human and a Nine-tailed Fox is

15
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,727
bound to end like this.

16
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:16,195
We belonged to different worlds
from the beginning.

17
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,783
I wanted to use the word "love"
as a stepping stone

18
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,662
to cross over to the world she lived in.

19
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,334
I wanted to walk with her a little longer.

20
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,093
I wanted to become a human.

21
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,513
My dream

22
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,850
never came true in the end.

23
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,520
But my death is

24
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,235
the most passionate love letter

25
00:03:56,694 --> 00:04:00,615
I've ever written to a human,
my first and last love.

26
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:07,747
I hope she doesn't wait for me.

27
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,627
I hope she won't cry too much
because of me.

28
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,632
I want to see her just one more time.

29
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,516
But I can no longer see her face.

30
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,236
Jae-hwan.

31
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,363
Ms. Kim.

32
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:05,990
Ms. Kim!

33
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,785
-Goodness.
-Are you okay?

34
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,161
Yes, Hye-ja.

35
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,041
Do miracles really exist?

36
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,337
The mysterious disease
that terrorized our people

37
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,048
suddenly disappeared overnight.

38
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,094
The patients and their families
who suffered helplessly

39
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,430
from the disease with no apparent cause

40
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,391
are hugging each other with tears of joy.

41
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:08,219
Everything is finally back to normal.

42
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,887
I couldn't…

43
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,683
protect Yeon.

44
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,479
I lost my dear child once again.

45
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,190
No, you've done

46
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,944
the best you could for his sake.

47
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:29,365
That's why I came back to be with you.

48
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,751
Do you think he passed away in peace?

49
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,128
I would think so.

50
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,841
He protected that girl just as he wanted.

51
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,858
Lord Hyeonuiong.

52
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,736
Lord Hyeonuiong!

53
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,072
It's me, Ji-a.

54
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,782
Please open the door.

55
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:13,951
What now?

56
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,286
Don't let her in.

57
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:16,829
But still.

58
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,414
She needs to move on

59
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,584
and live with ordinary people.

60
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,256
Please tell me.

61
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,801
What do I have to do to save Yeon?

62
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,261
What can I do?

63
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:36,891
Please.

64
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,436
Could you just tell me a way?

65
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,948
Lord Hyeonuiong.

66
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,825
Open the door, please.

67
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,370
Please.

68
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,101
Rang!

69
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,378
Mr. Lee, would you like some naengmyeon?

70
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,296
Get out.

71
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,966
You haven't had anything
but alcohol for the past three days.

72
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,217
I said get out.

73
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,638
It wasn't your fault.

74
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,556
Lee Yeon made you do it.

75
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,560
If you say one more word, I'll kill you.

76
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,941
Do you want a sticker?

77
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,111
I have a really cool car too.

78
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,989
Get lost, both of you!
Or get out of my house.

79
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,028
Thank you for letting me in.

80
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,614
I don't have time
to console your broken heart.

81
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,033
I'll cut to the chase. Yeon is dead.

82
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,452
There's no way for him to return.

83
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,664
I can't do it, but you can.

84
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,749
You're in charge of life and death,
so you--

85
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,835
There are rules in this world too.

86
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,754
What's impossible is impossible.

87
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,298
Then at least let him be reincarnated.

88
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,009
It's okay if he doesn't recognize me

89
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,053
or forget all about me, so--

90
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,305
He's the one who jumped into Samdocheon.

91
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,268
He chose to do this
knowing that he wouldn't be reborn.

92
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,021
So you need to stop
your one-man protest at my office.

93
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,274
This cannot be undone
by you throwing a fit.

94
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,191
No.

95
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,694
There must be a way,

96
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,612
a way for him to return.

97
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,989
Something like that

98
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,700
won't happen.

99
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:25,953
I let you in to tell you that.

100
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,707
Ma'am.

101
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,209
Ma'am. Ma'am!

102
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,758
It's awfully dark.

103
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,053
The street lights are all out.

104
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:47,183
It would be amazing
if you could fix those with your powers.

105
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,477
Go ask for road management at city hall.

106
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:28,891
Are you all right?

107
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,561
The lights are back on.

108
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,397
I called city hall.

109
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,235
Why would you do that?

110
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,946
I'll get in huge trouble with Mr. Lee

111
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:42,863
if you get hurt.

112
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,160
Are you doing all right?

113
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,415
I have to be okay, even if I'm not.

114
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,251
I have a lot to do.

115
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,631
I went to see the lady of Samdocheon.

116
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,217
She said there's no way to save him.

117
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,345
He knew everything all along.

118
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,100
Even so, he hoped that
the one he loves would live.

119
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,021
What should I do?

120
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,944
Live as if nothing happened.

121
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,155
Forget that you've met him.

122
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,659
Forget that you peeked into our world,
and live like a human.

123
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,081
That's what Mr. Lee wanted.

124
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,303
Sin-ju.

125
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,805
Is he still…

126
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,765
He won't budge.

127
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,768
I'm worried to death he might collapse.

128
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:56,645
I'll see him.

129
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,494
Why are you like this?

130
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,996
Don't ask the obvious.

131
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,499
Doing this won't bring him back.

132
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,669
Listen to this jerk talk.

133
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,299
You seem to be doing just fine.

134
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,010
Weren't you willing
to live and die for him?

135
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,845
You ungrateful scumbag.

136
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,222
You can call me whatever you want,

137
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,891
but I must say this.

138
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,768
Stop lecturing me and give me the wine.

139
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,186
Get a grip!

140
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,605
Have you gone insane?

141
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,315
Don't be so immature
and come to your senses!

142
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,984
-Do you wish to die?
-That is

143
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,111
what Mr. Lee wanted me to tell you.

144
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,291
Do you want to hear the rest
in his own words?

145
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,399
This is… Okay. Right.

146
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,443
It's me.

147
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,406
We just had naengmyeon together.

148
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,493
And you ate my egg.

149
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,497
If you're watching this message,

150
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,875
it means I'm probably gone.

151
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,587
Darn it.

152
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,132
This is so cheesy.

153
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,967
It was cool in the movies.

154
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,599
But it'll seem cool later in retrospect.

155
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,517
Just say it is.

156
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,770
How ridiculous.

157
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,772
My dear Rang,

158
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,275
are you chugging on booze, by any chance?

159
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,361
And you're drinking wine.

160
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,406
Is he psychic?

161
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,743
Soju suits you better than wine.

162
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,414
And you're better suited
to be a volunteer than a villain.

163
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,126
My brother,

164
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,129
who could never pass on a wounded dog,

165
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,381
I wondered where he went.

166
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,470
But you haven't changed.

167
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,267
You haven't changed at all.

168
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:46,106
So I'm sure you'll do fine without me.

169
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,901
You jerk. How could I do just fine?

170
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:49,943
Live a good life.

171
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,030
Protect everyone.

172
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,199
You have a family now.

173
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,077
I don't need any of them.

174
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,246
Your brother is talking.
Don't argue with me.

175
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,540
I can still hear you.

176
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,253
I said this in the Forest of Agwi.

177
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,047
That I…

178
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:15,719
I…

179
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,390
I have never abandoned you.

180
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,941
So don't

181
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,653
abandon yourself recklessly.

182
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,739
Be good for my sake.

183
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,079
This is my last request.

184
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,670
Bye.

185
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,099
This message will blow up in ten seconds.

186
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,104
I'm kidding.

187
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,398
I've always wanted to do that.

188
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,022
Yeon.

189
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,692
You told me to forget everything.

190
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,070
But I'll wait for you.

191
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,657
If I long to see you again and again,

192
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,201
I might be able to see you again someday.

193
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,164
Maybe in our next life…

194
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,459
No, even the one after that is fine.

195
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,881
That's why

196
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,135
I've decided to remember you
and leave records of you.

197
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,389
It's what I do for a living.

198
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,814
You haven't come for a while,
but you're here often lately.

199
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:17,609
I read on the internet that haircuts are
the best way to get over a farewell.

200
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,278
Was it a breakup?

201
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,406
You should try listening to sad music.

202
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,700
I've tried everything.

203
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,578
I listened to ballad music,
binge-watched dramas, and had spicy food.

204
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,998
Should I dye my hair?

205
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,457
Long time no see.

206
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,507
I don't want to know how you are.

207
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,842
Get to the point.

208
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,969
What are you making?

209
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,304
Tale of the Nine-tailed.

210
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,806
"Tale of the Nine-tailed"?

211
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:49,975
That title sucks.

212
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,602
How about
Tale of the Nine-tailed Brothers?

213
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,854
No, thanks.

214
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,606
Are you going to air this?

215
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,066
It's for me.

216
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,986
I'm going to start meeting
all of Yeon's acquaintances.

217
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,070
You're the first.

218
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,907
Well, no one knows him more than I do.

219
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,996
Then starting now,
tell me everything you know about him.

220
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,750
Did you know he was a narcissist?

221
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,667
What?

222
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,711
All kinds of random beings

223
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:21,006
flocked to our forest
just to get a look at his face.

224
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,176
He was already proud of his looks.

225
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,635
How bad do you think it got?

226
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,931
He'd always stare at his reflection
in the stream and say…

227
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,896
If you could give form
to the word "beauty,"

228
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,939
it would be this face.

229
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,319
I can't imagine him saying that.

230
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,197
It's as shocking as the time
he fell for voice phishing.

231
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,365
Was he scammed?

232
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,533
Twenty million won.

233
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,870
I can't believe
a Nine-tailed Fox fell for that.

234
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,750
Did you know he's scared of spiders?
The leg hairs creep him out.

235
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,797
He loved playing Go with me,

236
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,131
although he always lost.

237
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,053
I won!

238
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,763
I won again.

239
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,141
You two used to be very close back then.

240
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,434
Of course.

241
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,145
He has spent more time with me than you.

242
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,234
Has he ever cooked for you?

243
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:24,903
He doesn't know how.

244
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,615
He's not a good cook,
but he makes good rice. Just the rice.

245
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,166
He gave me a video message.

246
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,502
He got me these shoes.

247
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,087
He even carried me on his back.

248
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,713
He always waited for me.

249
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:50,887
I hate you.

250
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,728
Come to think about it,
you and I both received so much from him.

251
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,899
Do you know what his wish was?

252
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,194
A human.

253
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,030
He wanted to become a human.

254
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,135
My brother, aren't there
always some exceptions to the rules?

255
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,432
No, he didn't commit suicide.

256
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:38,727
He saved tens of millions of lives
and sacrificed himself.

257
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,690
There are ten kings down there!
Can't you do this one thing?

258
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,817
Is the King of the Underworld a puppet?

259
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,195
Hello? Brother?

260
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,779
Hey!

261
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,698
You!

262
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,034
Damn it.

263
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,329
You've done enough.

264
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,039
You did everything you could.

265
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,209
Damn it. I'd rather talk to a brick wall.

266
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,127
He keeps parroting the same thing

267
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,963
about the interpretation of the rules
or whatever.

268
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,381
You might get punished.

269
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,592
How can he be so inflexible?

270
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,306
What was that?

271
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,517
I mean, you just used the word flexible.

272
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,518
It's a bit strange.

273
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,273
Don't joke with me.
I've been lenient lately.

274
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,025
Let's eat some tteokbokki first!

275
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,569
It's a combination
of spicy and mild flavors.

276
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,820
Here.

277
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:34,324
Goodness, they threw in
some dumplings on the house!

278
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:02,185
When I look at you like this

279
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,147
I want to kiss you

280
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:11,361
When I'm alone with you

281
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,906
I want to hold you in my arms

282
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:20,120
I love you, I love you

283
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:23,915
I love you so much

284
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,961
I love you, I love you

285
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:33,049
I love you more than I love myself

286
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:38,847
Are you crying?

287
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,349
It's embarrassing.
Don't act like you know me.

288
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,602
Yu-ri.

289
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,689
Will you marry me?

290
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,697
A fox loves one mate for life.

291
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,536
Will you be my love until the day I die?

292
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,707
Do you think a measly ring is enough?

293
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,793
I have an apartment.

294
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:09,711
It's brand-new.

295
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,505
Let's share the title…

296
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,382
No, you can have it under your name.

297
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,720
Forget the title.

298
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,431
I might come with someone else.

299
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,932
Well, if you're okay with that…

300
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,643
Is that a yes?

301
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,688
I was going to propose if you didn't.

302
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,154
Congratulations!

303
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:43,078
As you know, the day you make her cry is
your funeral day.

304
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,665
Mr. Lee.

305
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,087
Go. You've lived
a luxurious life with me to this day,

306
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,005
so try living a tough life with him.

307
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,258
I've sorted out your parents.
They won't wait.

308
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,843
I'll be happy.

309
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,262
Congratulations, Dr. Gu.

310
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,181
What's this?

311
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,265
It's my treat today.

312
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,267
Thank you, everyone.

313
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,063
Thank you, Yu-ri.

314
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,732
And although he's not here,

315
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,692
our dear Mr. Lee Yeon.

316
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:17,821
Thank you, and I miss you.

317
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,866
He should have officiated our wedding.

318
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,911
It would've been wonderful
to have him here.

319
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,092
Mr. Lee…

320
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,274
Sir.

321
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,568
Please say something to Yeon.

322
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:58,987
Hey, Yeon.

323
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,406
My old woman finally quit smoking.

324
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,824
It's mostly thanks to you.

325
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,243
I wish she'd stop nagging me too,

326
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,661
but that doesn't seem likely.

327
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,371
Gosh, you're telling on her?

328
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,331
Ma'am, you too.

329
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,375
Goodness, Mr. Lee.

330
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,379
When I fell in love with a human farmer,

331
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,924
you were the only one in this world
who cheered for me.

332
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,886
You said you had the same love story.

333
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,054
And that young lady is

334
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,640
staying strong
and waiting for you like this.

335
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,895
I hope the two of you can meet again,

336
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,813
just like me and my husband.

337
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,778
You're here.

338
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,862
-Yes.
-Come this way.

339
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,197
-Wait, Hye-ja.
-What?

340
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,907
Please have this.

341
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,824
What is it?

342
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,745
It's honey rice cake!

343
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,747
I mean, you said you liked it.

344
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,375
-Isn't he handsome?
-Sure.

345
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,669
Have a seat.

346
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,046
-Okay.
-Have you eaten?

347
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,297
It's delicious.

348
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:00,924
Sir, try this one.

349
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,175
Thank you.

350
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,927
Thank you!

351
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,221
Even on days
that my heart broke at his absence,

352
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,098
I didn't cry anymore.

353
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,936
If I cried, this story might

354
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,313
really turn into a tragedy.

355
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,318
6 MONTHS LATER

356
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,615
And on the day when I finally finished
Tale of the Nine-tailed…

357
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,950
TALE OF THE NINE-TAILED

358
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,870
…like a miracle, I heard from Yeon.

359
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:31,788
The end.

360
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,041
-Yes?
-Ji-a, come downstairs.

361
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,251
Why?

362
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,627
Hurry. It's urgent.

363
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,550
-Ta-da.
-Ta-da.

364
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,885
Happy birthday, my daughter!

365
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,345
Is it my birthday today?

366
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,180
I completely forgot.

367
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,227
Happy birthday.

368
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,983
And this is from me. I made it myself.

369
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,317
It's so pretty.

370
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,653
-It's pretty.
-It's pretty.

371
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,113
Mine is from a factory.

372
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,739
Thank you.

373
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:13,454
-How did you know my watch strap broke?
-I saw it.

374
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,831
You're so considerate.

375
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:15,957
Thank you.

376
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,668
Who's that from?

377
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:20,962
Open it.

378
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,021
And on my birthday…

379
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:39,981
What do you want?

380
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,736
Buy me something I've never had before.

381
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,405
Like a proposal gift.

382
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,243
Okay, I'll buy it for you.

383
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,996
It's Yeon, right?

384
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:57,916
Was he here?

385
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,334
It was delivered.

386
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,836
He also sent you a letter.

387
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,684
When I had a tough time, they'd come by,

388
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:21,230
and tell me that we should talk it out
to relieve the stress together.

389
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,025
You know, they'd suggest
we should all go out together.

390
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,736
They'll try to make me laugh too.

391
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,280
So it's a blessing that I've met them…

392
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,240
I told you not to eat snacks on the sofa.

393
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,325
Give me food.

394
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,454
The least you can do is use a tray.

395
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,206
Move. I can't see.

396
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:45,421
Honey. Didn't I ask you
to put the socks in the hamper?

397
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,464
I forgot.

398
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,676
Here's the other pair.

399
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,596
I can't believe Su-o is

400
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,807
the only one here
who cleans up after himself!

401
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,361
The soup is a bit salty today.

402
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,366
Mr. Lee.

403
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,035
How long are you going to crash here?

404
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:17,870
How can you say that?

405
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,747
We're a package deal.

406
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:21,958
It's all fine,

407
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:26,212
but why do I have to feel like
I live with my in-laws in my house?

408
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,006
I ordered a kimchi refrigerator.

409
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,676
Really?

410
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,302
The one from the department store?

411
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,306
He bought it for us.
It'll come this afternoon.

412
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,142
I love you, Rang!

413
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,184
"Rang"?

414
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,437
I'll call you by your name
from now on, Rang!

415
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,105
I'm so happy.

416
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,898
I feel like we're a real family now.

417
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,400
Don't you?

418
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,769
DEAR MY BELOVED JI-A

419
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,856
Do you like your present?

420
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,027
I hope you like it.

421
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:39,368
I'm sure you look stunning in a dress.

422
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,581
Who would be there

423
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,792
standing beside you?

424
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,172
"Whoever he may be,

425
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,550
I hope he's a good person."

426
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,262
is what I would like to say,

427
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,389
but I can't.

428
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:05,436
I don't even know the guy,
and I already hate him.

429
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,650
I liked you.

430
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,696
I loved the way you faced the world.

431
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,991
I loved how you never fell into despair

432
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,537
even with that dreadful destiny
on your shoulders.

433
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,456
I loved having coffee with you.

434
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,085
I loved watching you sleep.

435
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,756
I loved every single road
I walked with you,

436
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,301
and even the time I waited for you.

437
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,680
I loved it to death.

438
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,850
Ji-a.

439
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:49,272
Whenever I said your name,

440
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,233
only made up of the softest syllables,

441
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,111
it always made my heart flutter.

442
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,826
Although you'll have to take the path
we took together alone now,

443
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,453
you'll get used to it.

444
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,248
You're going to do well.

445
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:14,380
So it's time to let me go.

446
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,799
You have to.

447
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,510
No.

448
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,763
I can't let you go.

449
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,693
Come back, please.

450
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,532
I miss you so much.

451
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:02,845
Mr. Lee.

452
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,806
Are you looking
for the Nine-tailed Fox again?

453
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,309
Hey, I told you to stop saying
"Nine-tailed Fox."

454
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,852
Is there any news?

455
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,606
I just find the ones who aren't human
and beat them up.

456
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,483
Someone may know how to bring him back.

457
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,651
I'll give you a ride.

458
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,486
No, it's snowy and cold.

459
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,698
Come early, then.

460
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,408
Let's all have pork belly.

461
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,203
Drive safely.

462
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,640
What?

463
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,100
My doll.

464
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,662
Why are you here?

465
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,462
What about you?

466
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,717
I heard a rumor,
so I came to see that old man.

467
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,142
FATE, PHYSIOGNOMY,
NAMING, COMPATIBILITY

468
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:36,397
COME IN AND HAVE YOUR FORTUNE READ

469
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:43,946
Is it true?

470
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,532
Are you
one of the ten kings of the afterlife?

471
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,827
The King of Five Rotating Worlds.

472
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,830
The tenth king
who reigns over the Hell of Darkness.

473
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,541
and the final judge.

474
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,047
That's me.

475
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,303
I decide what happens in your next life.

476
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,556
You better fix your posture.

477
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:19,523
By deciding what happens
in our next life, do you mean--

478
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,817
Correct. I'm in charge of reincarnation.

479
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,902
Reincarnation?

480
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,238
Then are you here because of Yeon?

481
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,241
It depends on how we interpret the rules.

482
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,035
But I do have

483
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,454
something that belongs to him.

484
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,250
You have the Fox Marble.
Give me the marble.

485
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:39,835
The Fox Marble.

486
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,589
Can we save him with this?

487
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,882
Don't get too excited.

488
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,635
The sister of the King of the Underworld

489
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,346
kept pestering the ten kings
over the phone, so I came.

490
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,516
But we don't do charity work.

491
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,853
You both know the rules.

492
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,025
I have to exchange it
with the most valuable thing to me, right?

493
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,195
I'll do it. I can do it

494
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,697
if this can bring Yeon back.

495
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:12,451
What if you may not see him
even if he comes back?

496
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,622
-What?
-Reincarnation is a random event.

497
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,791
You might miss each other.

498
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,502
He might be born after you both die,

499
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,088
and he may not look the way you remember.

500
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,635
I don't care.

501
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,058
Let's get to business.

502
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,312
Now.

503
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,944
Bring me something I'll absolutely love

504
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:50,865
before this hourglass runs out.

505
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,133
What's wrong?

506
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,302
It's the King of Five Rotating Worlds.

507
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,181
I was wondering why it snowed in April.
He's finally here.

508
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,820
Is that a crow?

509
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,786
Three times.

510
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,123
The guest will be in mourning clothes.

511
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,168
We're about to see another death.

512
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,384
I'll do it.

513
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,638
Tell me.

514
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,017
Yeon is the most precious one in my life,

515
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:04,063
but he's gone now,
and all I'm left with is our memories,

516
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,314
my memories of him.

517
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,485
I'll sell you that memory.

518
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,819
I don't buy memories.

519
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,072
What else do you have?

520
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:17,493
Don't you have anything valuable
that he gave you?

521
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,495
I'll give you anything. Just tell me.

522
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,913
For example,

523
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,166
the rest of your life.

524
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,635
If I give you my life,

525
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,180
can he be reincarnated?

526
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,181
Hey.

527
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,561
A life for a life.

528
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,729
There's no question about that.

529
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,284
You can have it.

530
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:00,869
Hey.

531
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,789
Do you think he saved your life
only to have you throw it away?

532
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,125
Did he die a meaningless death?

533
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,543
You pathetic fool.

534
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:08,961
Then…

535
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,589
will you give up your life?

536
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,265
Fine.

537
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,227
I already stole it from someone else.
I'm not losing anything.

538
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,021
-Hey.
-Stay out of this.

539
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,522
But…

540
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:32,026
I thought you never had
anything to live for.

541
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,778
Is your life really worth it?

542
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,740
Let's do an appraisal.

543
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,340
What?

544
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:56,800
You have

545
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,011
a family now.

546
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,890
Life began to matter to you.

547
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,020
Approved.

548
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,314
Your offer stands.

549
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,483
Deal.

550
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,985
-No!
-Wait a minute.

551
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,657
There's still time.

552
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,954
Can you tell them to come?

553
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,877
At least let me say goodbye.

554
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,227
This way.

555
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,006
Mr. Lee!

556
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,300
Mr. Lee!

557
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,262
Mr. Lee!

558
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,180
Oh, no. No.

559
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,711
HERE LIES LEE RANG

560
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:40,274
HERE LIES LEE RANG

561
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:33,762
Ms. Nam.

562
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,597
-Yes?
-Take this.

563
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:44,523
Where did you get this?

564
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,025
I don't know.
Someone left it with our team.

565
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,652
-He said it's for you.
-When?

566
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,654
It was before my shift,

567
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,655
so five minutes ago.

568
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,333
Wait, I…

569
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,611
Yeon.

570
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:35,866
I'm sorry.

571
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,132
I told you not to walk in the rain.

572
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,343
Yeon.

573
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,222
Is it really you?

574
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:44,684
So no one is disguised as you,
and this isn't a dream.

575
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,229
Is it really you?

576
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,818
Why are you just standing there?

577
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,821
Why don't you come to me?

578
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,074
I'm not who I used to be.

579
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,827
What do you mean?

580
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,453
I can't fly.

581
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:09,000
I can't catch you
even if you fall from a great height.

582
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:13,588
No matter how dark your path is,
I can't even light a firefly.

583
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,174
It hurts when I get hit.

584
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,719
I get hurt when I'm stabbed.

585
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,768
There's nothing I can do for you.

586
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:48,999
It doesn't matter. None of that matters.

587
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,168
I've become human.

588
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,759
Human?

589
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,726
You're in big trouble now.

590
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,520
I won't let you go until the day I die.

591
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,697
I missed you so much.

592
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,533
I missed you to death.

593
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,163
I was so scared I'd never see you again.

594
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,355
How did you do it?

595
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,482
What?

596
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:00,111
I spent the last six months
like it was six years.

597
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,781
How did you wait for 600 years?

598
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,951
If you wait long enough,

599
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:08,453
do you find new ways of waiting
and get used to it?

600
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,915
It's not that I got used to waiting.

601
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,877
It's just that I couldn't get used
to staying away from you.

602
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:24,427
I wanted to wait patiently like you.

603
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,305
But little things got in the way
and knocked me down.

604
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:30,684
What? What made you suffer so much?

605
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,768
For example…

606
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,315
The night air I smelled one day
when you walked me home.

607
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,653
The alarm from my rice cooker.

608
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:46,032
When I remember how warm your hands were
when we went for a walk.

609
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,785
Little things like that.

610
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:54,916
That's why you came for me this time.

611
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,003
You came for me.

612
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,260
These are real human hands now.

613
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,469
Yes.

614
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,679
And a human body.

615
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,058
And human lips.

616
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,794
Don't tell me he's going to sing there.

617
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,548
-He…
-When I look at you like this

618
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,010
I want to kiss you

619
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,473
When I'm alone with you

620
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,977
Sir. Please say something to Yeon.

621
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,023
My old woman finally quit smoking.

622
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,067
It's mostly thanks to you.

623
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,735
Ma'am, you too.

624
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:06,905
When I fell in love with a human farmer,

625
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:09,616
you were the only one in this world
who cheered for me.

626
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,118
You said you had the same love story.

627
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:16,873
And that young lady is staying strong
and waiting for you like this.

628
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,250
I hope the two of you can meet again.

629
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:20,710
Sir, try this one.

630
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,797
No, I want some fish!

631
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,006
I'll get you one more.

632
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,424
-Give it to me.
-This one is…

633
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,661
Let's eat some chicken soup
after we take a walk.

634
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:57,831
Are you excited?

635
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,255
SIN-JU'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

636
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,343
Mr. Lee!

637
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,137
Mr. Lee!

638
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,429
Mr. Lee!

639
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:15,765
Mr. Lee!

640
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,572
How's the apartment? Is it nice?

641
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,949
It's wonderful.
There's everything in the complex.

642
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:36,411
There's a sauna, a gym…
It's been completely undervalued.

643
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:37,954
There are even two subway lines.

644
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,331
What kind of fox are you?

645
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,168
I'm the general manager
of the resident council.

646
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,380
I see. So Mr. General Manager,

647
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,258
did you realize my significance
while I was gone?

648
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:52,510
I was so happily married
that I never noticed.

649
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:54,929
I shouldn't have come.

650
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,265
I'm kidding.

651
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,894
I've been very emotional
ever since I became human.

652
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,103
Can you be more careful?

653
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,481
I'm feeling inferior
for the first time in my life.

654
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,191
Don't say that with your looks.

655
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,692
People will throw rocks at you.

656
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,197
Welcome back.

657
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,825
We all coped in our own ways

658
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,536
to deal with your death
as we waited for you.

659
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,916
At times, we whined,
then we'd lean on each other too.

660
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:32,717
What about Rang?

661
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,224
He was a mess after you passed away.

662
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,937
Sometimes he'd cry all night.
He got better since he moved in with us.

663
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,564
He kept looking for you.

664
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:52,070
Did you see his last moment?

665
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,374
He must've been scared all alone.

666
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,838
He's a scaredy-cat despite how he looks.

667
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,930
This is his phone.

668
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:20,765
Take a look.

669
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:01,639
It's me.

670
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,142
I'm about to die.

671
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:10,773
If you were here,
you would come and save me.

672
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,651
But no one would help me now.
I'm finished.

673
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:19,073
So you get to see how it feels
to watch someone

674
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,950
state their will in real-time.

675
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,997
I thought I'd feel quite profound
right before my death,

676
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,460
but just as you said,
maybe it's because I give up easily.

677
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,129
It's just bittersweet.

678
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:35,965
So…

679
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:40,053
don't you weep or cry like a fool.

680
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,265
I didn't cry once after you were gone.

681
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,393
I just had a few drinks.

682
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,436
You liar.

683
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,108
I tormented you for a long time,

684
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,154
but I'm not going to apologize,
because you're worse.

685
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:04,619
When we'd share a piece of fruit,
you always gave me the big piece.

686
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:10,708
I know you're obsessed with eggs,
but you always let me have it.

687
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,715
Then you chose your love
after taming me like that.

688
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,008
Why wouldn't I go astray?

689
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,848
I will be reborn as a Dokdo shrimp.

690
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,351
You never know, so don't eat shrimp.

691
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:40,613
I hope…

692
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,992
you'll be reborn too.

693
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:59,424
I hope you have a very ugly face.

694
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:06,556
But…

695
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,059
But…

696
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:12,645
if we can,

697
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,191
let's meet again.

698
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,287
My brother.

699
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,489
Hey, Su-o.

700
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,199
You don't have any parents, do you?

701
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,909
I heard your mom ran away.

702
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,327
No, she didn't.

703
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,162
He also lives like a homeless person.

704
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:14,081
I saw it
back when we were in the same class.

705
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:17,502
-You're homeless
-You're homeless

706
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,420
-You're homeless
-You're homeless

707
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:20,338
Su-o.

708
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,135
Let's go home.

709
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,347
We're not homeless.

710
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:32,600
Let's go.

711
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:35,770
How was my timing?

712
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:44,111
Rang's unintentional charity

713
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:48,157
unintentionally became a tradition.

714
01:03:56,541 --> 01:04:00,211
It continues in its slightly twisted way,

715
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:02,964
as love is passed on.

716
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:05,967
HERE LIES LEE RANG

717
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,456
My hands are on a roll today.

718
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,669
Hey, Yeon!

719
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:55,349
I missed you, Granny.

720
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,894
Don't be so emotional. It's tacky.

721
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,563
You used your connections to save me.

722
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:01,480
Me?

723
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:05,526
She probably made at least 200 calls.

724
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,862
Her brother even blocked her number.

725
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:13,951
You couldn't live without me, right?

726
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:14,952
Get lost.

727
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:18,289
I'll get lost soon enough.

728
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:21,292
This is the last time you'll see me.

729
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,211
Why?

730
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:25,755
I can't come here anymore.

731
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:29,550
I'm a human. I should live with them.

732
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:33,346
Then you'll only see him again
after he dies.

733
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,723
Goodness! Don't bring up his death.

734
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:37,433
He just managed to come back.

735
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:42,188
Thank you for adoring a rascal like me
for such a long time.

736
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,525
You made me work so hard
until Ji-a came back

737
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,444
that I had no time to go crazy.

738
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:53,407
It's thanks to you and Lord Hyeonuiong.

739
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:56,786
That's how I got this far.

740
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,204
Live a happy life.

741
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:02,667
Your life as a human
won't be as easy as you think,

742
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,418
but you'll do well, Yeon.

743
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:06,504
Yes.

744
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,341
I wish the two of you
a long and healthy life.

745
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:14,512
Bye.

746
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:20,017
Hey!

747
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:23,854
Since you're here,

748
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,524
have some tteokbokki.

749
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:30,152
And do I have to go get it?

750
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,113
-Isn't that obvious?
-Yes.

751
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,245
Gosh, it's so spicy.

752
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:43,958
This isn't spicy at all.
You're such a big baby.

753
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:46,085
It's medium, but it's still spicy.

754
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:47,962
I like the sundae here.

755
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:49,380
I heard Granny

756
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,257
still lives her life as a workaholic.

757
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,341
I want fish cake.

758
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,759
But if one thing has changed…

759
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,219
This fish cake is delicious.

760
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:59,015
sometimes the couple stays up all night…

761
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:00,599
talking about their late son.

762
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:07,606
Right, and they say they enjoy
their medium-spicy tteokbokki.

763
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,029
It's so spicy.

764
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:44,727
Well…

765
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:46,854
I don't know much

766
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,106
about eternal love or whatnot,

767
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:53,861
but you like drumsticks,
and I like chicken breasts.

768
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:57,865
You like egg yolks, I like egg whites.

769
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:01,744
That means we're perfect for each other.

770
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:04,622
You're probably the first woman
to confess her love

771
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:05,998
with fried chicken and eggs.

772
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:13,923
I can't believe we're getting married.

773
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,761
And you've finally become human.

774
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:23,641
"Human," written in Korean,

775
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:24,934
is an interesting word.

776
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:30,147
If you change just one letter,

777
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:31,857
it becomes "love."

778
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,111
I…

779
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,697
have a pretty awful personality,

780
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:41,450
and I'm not sure how good I'll be…

781
01:08:43,702 --> 01:08:44,662
as a human.

782
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,250
But I'm confident in love.

783
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,092
I love you.

784
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:00,219
I love you, too.

785
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,910
Why is it raining flowers in autumn?

786
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:27,997
They're celebrating.

787
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:33,627
It's the flowers, trees, and wind
who love the old lord of their forest,

788
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:36,088
bidding him farewell

789
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,467
and thanking him for his great work.

790
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,364
The very handsome Nine-tailed Fox

791
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:46,116
lived happily ever after.

792
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,119
Hey, don't throw in weird narration.

793
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:52,498
As the husband of a journalist,
I only speak the truth.

794
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:54,583
Rewind it.

795
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:55,542
Okay.

796
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:10,015
Should we have a baby?

797
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:19,149
I'm all for it,

798
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:21,735
but I have one concern.

799
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,320
What is it?

800
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:27,533
What if our daughter gets embarrassed
that I never went to college?

801
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:34,415
Then let's tell her you did something
much better than going to college.

802
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:38,711
What's that?

803
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:41,255
"Your dad saved your mom,

804
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:45,134
and even though no one knows,
he also saved the world."

805
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,261
Well, that's true.

806
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:52,057
But why did you decide
that we'll have a daughter?

807
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:55,477
-Did I just say that?
-Yes.

808
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:57,855
What? There's no way.

809
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,649
SIN-JU'S ANIMAL HOSPITAL

810
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:08,907
Be honest. What's it like to be human?
Is it better than a Nine-tailed Fox?

811
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:12,619
I thought it'd all be wonderful,
but it's not.

812
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:16,874
How do I put it?
There are just so many variables.

813
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:18,042
Variables?

814
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:24,757
I'm astigmatic.

815
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:26,675
And only on one side.

816
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,219
Look.

817
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:32,556
You'll see me

818
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,684
looking magically less handsome
in a flash.

819
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,650
If we took a photo now,

820
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,153
I think I'd look better.

821
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,238
-That's not true.
-You're right.

822
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:53,994
That's not the only problem.

823
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:01,418
How could you deceive me?
You said we were going for ice cream!

824
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:02,628
I didn't deceive you.

825
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,838
I said we had to go somewhere
before we eat.

826
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:08,425
I'd rather be stabbed

827
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:09,927
than get another shot.

828
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:11,637
Good boy.

829
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,721
Let go of me!

830
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,723
How can your love change?

831
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:17,601
What are you talking about?

832
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:21,772
The root canal treatment was
literally a living hell.

833
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:26,985
Living as a human was
a struggle against unexpected pain.

834
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:28,779
Ta-da!

835
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,202
How is it? Is it good?

836
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:37,704
Your ramyeon has to be
the best in the world.

837
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,124
Honey, soju.

838
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:42,126
Of course, I got it.

839
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:43,961
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

840
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:51,301
Great work today.

841
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:52,970
You too.

842
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:56,223
Ramyeon and soju. This is the life.

843
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:55,073
Next time you fall,
try to stand up on your own, okay?

844
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:00,662
All right.

845
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:02,748
Thank you.

846
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,230
Seung-beom, did you fall?

847
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:28,065
-Yes.
-Are you okay?

848
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:29,233
Yes, I'm fine.

849
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:30,859
Be careful.

850
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:34,863
-Did it hurt?
-No, some man helped me.

851
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,701
You never became a Dokdo shrimp.

852
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:01,181
How was your day?

853
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:03,016
It was the same as usual.

854
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:08,313
I saw a strange man
at the police station today.

855
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:09,690
Who?

856
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:12,192
He's an old man in a hahoe mask.

857
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:13,986
But he couldn't take the mask off,

858
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,779
as if it was glued to his face.

859
01:16:15,862 --> 01:16:17,072
A hahoe mask?

860
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:21,201
Did you step on bird poop
or something today?

861
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,329
No, it wasn't bird poop.

862
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:26,832
I did step on some gum.

863
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:29,042
-Darn it.
-Why?

864
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:31,253
That's Samjae.

865
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:32,671
Samjae?

866
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:35,382
SAMJAE: BAD LUCK THAT COMES AROUND
ONCE EVERY 9 YEARS

867
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:40,887
This world may be

868
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:42,973
full of creatures that we are oblivious to

869
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:45,183
and these creatures
may be living among us.

870
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:48,979
The countless urban legends we hear of

871
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:51,523
may be another name for these creatures.

872
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:56,570
I've peeped into the secrets of the world.

873
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:12,711
Living as a human means

874
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:18,800
life will be full of things
that are the first and the last.

875
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:22,763
First snow, first step,

876
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:24,848
first picnic,

877
01:17:26,516 --> 01:17:27,809
and first root canal.

878
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:34,358
And…

879
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,445
my eternal first love.

880
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:49,266
Hey.

881
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:00,986
Are you Samjae?

882
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,850
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
TALE OF THE NINE-TAILED

883
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:19,523
