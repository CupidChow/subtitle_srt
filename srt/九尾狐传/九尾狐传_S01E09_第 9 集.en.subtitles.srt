1
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:54,137
I knew he'd only be concerned
about that woman.

2
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,224
Hey, kid!

3
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,774
Yeon?

4
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,154
I heard you talking bad about me.

5
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,074
Get your hands off.

6
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,077
This isn't the time to play hard to get.

7
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,747
You can't be him.

8
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,707
Why would Yeon come to save me?

9
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,292
You aren't wrong.

10
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,294
Give me proof that you're him.

11
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,588
Proof?
Do you want my social security number?

12
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,801
On January 15th, we did jwibulnori.

13
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,012
After playing with fire,

14
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,056
you ended up wetting yourself that night.

15
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,183
So I called you this for three years.

16
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,477
-Shut up.
-Bed wetter!

17
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,706
-I'm going to kill you.
-Kill them first.

18
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,928
Run!

19
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,540
Mom?

20
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,339
Dad?

21
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,467
Ji-a underwent

22
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,804
hypnotherapy today.

23
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,891
What did Dr. Kang say?

24
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,726
She has never seen a case like this.

25
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,355
I shouldn't feel like this,

26
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,817
but I keep getting scared.

27
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,946
Can I keep my daughter safe?

28
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,701
Can I really do a good job?

29
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,047
Mom.

30
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,717
Mom?

31
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,848
Ji-a, you're up.

32
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,191
I was going to give it to you at home.

33
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,028
Ta-da. Here's your birthday present.

34
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,872
My birthday?

35
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,256
It's the music box.

36
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,841
Wait, is this…

37
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,983
Fox Hill.

38
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,573
We can't go there.

39
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,242
Do you like it?

40
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,786
We'll get into an accident. Stop the car!

41
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,996
Once you get better,

42
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,040
let's all go ride
the merry-go-round again.

43
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,167
Dad, can't you hear me?

44
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,961
You have to stop the car!

45
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,921
Dad.

46
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,174
Mom!

47
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,524
They keep coming back.
Have they always been this strong?

48
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,322
-I think we've grown weaker.
-What are you saying?

49
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,627
Forget the storm.
I can't even control the wind.

50
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,504
Your powers won't work at all?

51
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,096
Where are we right now?

52
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,474
Don't you know? It's the Forest of Agwi.

53
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,143
I doubt that.

54
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,372
Dad, stop the car.

55
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,957
Dad! Stop the car!

56
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,669
Stop the car. Dad!

57
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,703
This is unexpected.

58
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,790
I was sure he'd go to the girl,

59
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,834
but he chose his brother?

60
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,169
I thought they were mortal enemies.

61
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,005
You shouldn't take a deity so lightly.

62
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,257
Sorry?

63
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,760
Even now,
he is in a battle of wits with me.

64
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,556
Wait, did he go there on purpose?

65
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,476
He probably figured it out.

66
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,479
It seems like a test for those two,

67
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,399
but it's also a test for Lee Yeon.

68
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,408
Man, this is driving me insane.

69
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,746
How did that juice lady know
I can't get on planes?

70
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,249
-You really can't?
-What happens if you do?

71
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,085
I can't breathe,
then I break out in a cold sweat,

72
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,754
and I pass out
as soon as I fasten the seat belt.

73
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,673
What were her exact words?

74
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,844
She asked me what I'm most afraid of.

75
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,929
"What you're most afraid of?"

76
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,474
Could it be--

77
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,393
What is it?

78
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,729
There was a similar urban legend

79
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,731
that recently went viral on the internet.

80
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,068
-The veggie juice lady story?
-It's a similar pattern.

81
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,572
She gives you a free sample
and asks you your biggest fear.

82
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,200
We think this is a similar urban legend

83
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,035
to the Hong Kong Granny story.

84
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,747
But what's uncanny is
if this woman bewitches you,

85
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,749
you begin to hear a song.

86
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,626
-A song?
-Did you hear anything?

87
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,086
-No.
-It's this song.

88
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,801
It's "Gate Play,"
a movement from "Ganggangsullae."

89
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,513
If you take a good listen,
the lyrics are very creepy.

90
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,389
One side says, "Open the gates."

91
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,266
The other says, "I don't have a key."

92
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,810
These two sentences repeat
over and over again.

93
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:44,398
Sounds like a great story.
Is there anyone who actually heard this?

94
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,651
We couldn't find one,
so we couldn't cover this.

95
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,027
Why couldn't you?

96
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,240
People say you can never wake up
once you begin to hear this song.

97
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,200
-Forever?
-Forever.

98
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,786
Come on. That makes no sense.

99
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,457
-My goodness.
-Is this the Urban Legends team?

100
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,836
-Hey, Ji-a! What's wrong?
-Ms. Nam!

101
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,630
-What's with her?
-Wake up, Ji-a.

102
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,465
Ji-a, what's wrong?

103
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,426
-Can you get her up?
-Call for help.

104
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,776
Mr. Lee. Wake up, Mr. Lee.

105
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:29,694
Mr. Lee Yeon.

106
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,037
Mr. Lee Rang? Mr. Lee?

107
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,000
Mr. Lee!

108
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,712
Mr. Lee Rang!

109
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,169
She's probably over Fox Hill by now.

110
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,963
Can I really save both of them

111
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,591
from this hell?

112
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,679
Please don't let my choice be
the wrong one.

113
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,193
Is this how you thank me

114
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,071
for saving your life?

115
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,119
What are you scheming?

116
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,163
Can't you tell?

117
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,210
Why are you here?
There's no way you really came to save me.

118
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,046
You know, I had lots of time on my hands.

119
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,841
I wanted to stop by
and watch my only brother

120
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,426
head over to the afterlife.

121
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,807
Don't be ridiculous. Why did you
choose me instead of that girl?

122
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,517
Good question.

123
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,435
I opened the wrong door.

124
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,521
Liar.

125
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:33,150
I was on my way to find Ji-a for sure,

126
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,861
but instead I found this bed wetter
on the verge of death.

127
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,216
What happened?

128
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:01,011
I was bitten.
It turns out I taste pretty delicious.

129
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,810
Forget the bleeding. You're burning up.

130
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,398
I guess the poison began to spread.

131
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,782
It'll spread throughout his body
in less than an hour.

132
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,118
I have to get him out before that.

133
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,754
I told you not to play with the serpent.

134
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,215
Stop trying to be a brother
at this point in time. It's annoying.

135
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,509
You asshole.

136
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,346
Run as fast as you can.

137
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,399
How do we wake him up?

138
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,694
There's nothing we can do from outside.

139
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,822
I've tried just about everything,

140
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,160
but I couldn't wake my husband up.

141
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,579
-Are you sure it's the same one?
-Yes.

142
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,125
She used to be a peddler.

143
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,420
She'd bring shiny things,

144
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,964
then asked people for their biggest fear

145
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,009
to bewitch them.

146
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,264
And to my husband, it was a tiger.

147
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,726
So what she shows isn't a hallucination?

148
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,229
I thought it was,
and that he was hearing things.

149
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,858
But you know, Sin-ju.

150
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,944
I saw it.

151
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,446
I saw him bitten by a tiger

152
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,949
and his flesh and bones were crushed.

153
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,328
What do I do?

154
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,247
Mr. Lee.

155
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,457
Please wake up, Mr. Lee.

156
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,167
Mr. Lee.

157
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,253
Mr. Lee!

158
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,004
Oh, no.

159
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,855
Her name.

160
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,982
What's she called?

161
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,942
The Darkness.

162
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,444
The Darkness.

163
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,948
She feeds on the darkness

164
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,618
hidden deep inside of people's hearts.

165
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,580
Ji-a.

166
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,418
Ji-a?

167
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,838
Ji-a.

168
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,722
Mom?

169
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,641
Wake up and eat your breakfast.

170
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,691
Why are you here?

171
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,152
What do you mean? It's Sunday.

172
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,196
Did you work overtime yesterday?

173
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,784
Why does your work always make you
go on business trips and do overtime?

174
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,371
My work?

175
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,668
What do I do, Mom?

176
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,713
-Are you still sleepy?
-Answer me.

177
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,424
You're a TV show producer.

178
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,594
You always end up
at the Press Arbitration Committee.

179
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,014
Why do you think I became a producer?

180
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,643
-Because--
-To find you and Dad.

181
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,730
In 1999 at Fox Hill, my life--

182
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,734
No, our family

183
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,527
was ravaged.

184
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,156
-What are you saying?
-You aren't my mom.

185
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,285
I won't be fooled twice.

186
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,130
Stop talking nonsense and come out to eat.

187
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,466
You have too much fun messing with me.

188
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,512
-What?
-You can joke about anything

189
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,805
except for that accident.

190
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,891
Do you know how heartbroken we were

191
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,434
when you were in a coma?

192
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,853
I was…

193
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,399
in a coma?

194
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,183
When I went to the hospital for a shot,
what did you give me?

195
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,810
Strawberry candy.

196
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,940
Stop it and come out.

197
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,986
Wait.

198
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,954
What is it now?

199
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,081
I want

200
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,126
walnut cakes.

201
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,212
Walnut cakes?

202
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,469
Mom.

203
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,056
I want to have walnut cakes.

204
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,017
We don't have any walnut cakes.

205
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,146
I once had to go to the hospital
for a nut allergy.

206
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,483
That's right. I forgot.

207
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,735
You aren't my mom!

208
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:50,944
Where's my mom?

209
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,989
I'm your mother!

210
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,721
What walnut cakes?

211
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,683
You're allergic to nuts.

212
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,872
A family reunion.

213
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,166
How touching.

214
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,547
But this time, they aren't
the fake parents she met before.

215
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,007
I guess what she's really afraid of

216
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,218
isn't that.

217
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,679
Her family always holds her back,

218
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,806
back then and even now.

219
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,605
Is it getting colder?

220
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,359
This is a place
created by her subconsciousness.

221
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,944
Strangers like us

222
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,280
aren't welcome here.

223
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,073
Let us leave.

224
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,964
It's cheesecake!

225
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,303
Did you see him?

226
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,972
It didn't go as planned.

227
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,600
-Lee Yeon didn't come.
-Then why are you back?

228
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,770
No matter what he does,
he'll never get out of there alive.

229
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,981
People's minds are

230
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,526
much weaker than they think
once you open it up.

231
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,946
It's a world created by the wounds
they stored up over their entire life.

232
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,200
If you die in over there,
do you die here too?

233
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,331
Do you want to try?

234
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,042
Let me go!

235
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,544
-Darkness.
-Yes?

236
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,796
Don't touch my things.

237
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,800
I was just joking.

238
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,469
Please forgive me.

239
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,974
You had a lot more to say after,
"Please forgive me."

240
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,730
"I don't care if you're a serpent.
You were asleep for 600 years.

241
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,815
There's no way he still has his skills.

242
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,984
In that case, give it…

243
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,489
a shot."

244
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,785
I'm getting curious too.

245
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,001
How dare I think that!

246
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:59,424
Forgive me. Please forgive me.

247
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,473
Can you give me a hug?

248
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,525
Mom.

249
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,820
My dear mom.

250
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,906
I don't care if this is a dream.

251
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,200
Please don't go.

252
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,498
Please don't leave me alone.

253
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,084
You must have had a nightmare again.

254
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,213
Right.

255
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,551
It'd be great if it was all just a dream.

256
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,391
What was it about?

257
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,477
I had a dream

258
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,980
that I lost both you and Dad.

259
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,861
It's a dream. Why are you crying?

260
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:06,992
I'm sorry…

261
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,246
I survived alone.

262
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,173
I held out like a brave girl,

263
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,511
but to be honest,
I was very afraid and lonely.

264
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,474
I didn't want to come home,

265
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,184
so there were days

266
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,811
when I'd sit at the bus stop for hours.

267
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,441
I'm sorry, Mom.

268
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,904
To be honest,

269
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:49,117
I hated you and Dad a little.

270
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,995
You left me all alone,

271
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,415
then never came
no matter how long I waited.

272
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,171
You haven't forgotten about me, have you?

273
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,969
How could I ever forget

274
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,681
such an adorable daughter like you?

275
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,938
I missed you, Mom.

276
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,839
We've been circling around the same place.

277
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,174
We don't have time for this.

278
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,969
Is Ji-a all right?

279
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,347
A little bit. Hold out just a bit longer.

280
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,853
No, let me go.

281
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,898
You can't spare to be so proud right now.

282
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm as good as dead without my pride.

283
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,195
You already look like the dead.

284
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,872
Have you heard of phantom limb syndrome?

285
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,624
You mean the phenomenon
when a soldier loses a leg

286
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,544
and keeps complaining of the pain
in the leg, right?

287
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,130
The moment he feels pain
without a leg to feel with

288
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,090
is when the real pain begins.

289
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,219
Once the pain begins,
the door is already gone.

290
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,015
That's the world this woman shows people.

291
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:40,979
Gatekeeper, O, gatekeeper, open the gates

292
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:44,733
I can't, for I don't have the key

293
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,406
-What is it?
-I can't walk anymore.

294
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,910
The poison has spread, my eyes are dimmed,

295
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,621
and I'm tired of dragging these legs.

296
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,830
So?

297
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,875
You'll sit here
and let those agwis eat you?

298
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,588
Go save your girl. I'm finished anyway.

299
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,847
You're still the same.

300
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,810
The same as when we first met.

301
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,524
You still give up easily and whine a lot.

302
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,484
How is your life that simple?

303
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,194
I have nothing to live for.

304
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,323
I don't have a first love
to protect with my life

305
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,910
or any family to desperately wait for

306
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,871
like your girl.

307
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,092
I shouldn't have come.

308
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,136
On that day and today.

309
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,224
I heard you shared our father's blood,

310
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,308
but you aren't much

311
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,935
You haven't the will to live.

312
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,229
What a waste of time.

313
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,315
I'm leaving.

314
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,194
Once I die,

315
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,157
bury me in our old forest
on Baekdu Mountain.

316
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,785
I don't carry out wills.

317
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,341
I want to go back to those days.

318
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,555
The field was filled with azalea flowers.

319
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,394
That's odd.

320
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,481
I can't seem to remember the taste

321
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,776
of those azaleas.

322
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,746
If you don't remember,

323
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,748
then survive and try some again, idiot!

324
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,251
At least struggle to survive!

325
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,466
Be honest. Why did you come here?

326
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,304
To save both Ji-a and you.

327
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,348
-Am I to believe that?
-Whatever, then!

328
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,391
I nearly died after you cut me down.

329
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,314
You massacred an entire village.

330
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,191
-You deserved it.
-Exactly.

331
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,694
You tried to kill me,
so why are you saving me now?

332
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,996
Listen up.

333
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:50,543
My blade has never missed a target.

334
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,628
I have

335
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,298
never missed a target.

336
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,640
Why do you think you're still alive?

337
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,684
Think over it
with that slow head of yours.

338
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,773
I'm leaving. I won't be coming back.

339
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,285
Boat Four just left
the Samdocheon River, right?

340
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,203
Tell the captain to turn back.

341
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,330
Yes.

342
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:13,251
An old man who was on a respirator
just passed.

343
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,258
Now, where were we?

344
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,052
-The Darkness.
-The Darkness.

345
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,890
That thing was still in the human world?

346
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,434
After that thing showed up,
Mr. Lee and Lady A-eum--

347
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,978
I mean, Ms. Nam both collapsed.

348
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,355
Please tell me, madam.

349
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,149
How can I save them?

350
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,235
It's nothing you can do.

351
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,698
The girl is with her family,

352
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,785
and Yeon went to the Forest of Agwi.

353
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,831
-The Forest of Agwi?
-To save his brother, probably.

354
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,501
-Then is Mr. Lee Rang also--
-Were they

355
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,920
always on such good terms?

356
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,673
That's not the problem now.

357
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,426
-It's a problem for me.
-Honey.

358
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,804
He keeps taking up more burdens,

359
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,223
the kind who brings upon his own demise.

360
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,310
That's why he was a mountain deity.

361
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,771
The lord of the mountain is

362
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,940
even concerned
over the cycle of a petty plant.

363
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,733
And this is his brother.

364
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,902
That brother is a wreck.

365
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,487
Rang has committed too much sin.

366
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,988
How can you be so--

367
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,576
Please save them, madam.

368
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,498
You can take my life instead,
but please save them.

369
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,626
I can't believe this.

370
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,921
Why do you risk your life over his choice?

371
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,298
If you tell me a way I can save them,

372
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,177
I swear I'll do everything you tell me.

373
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,061
Everything?

374
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,910
Do you only live for today?

375
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,079
You've exchanged your life for a ribbon?

376
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,960
I'm sure it's what Mr. Lee wants.

377
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:24,340
Both you and Yeon are impossible.
It must be a fox thing.

378
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,509
But I don't understand.

379
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,304
Why did he go to Mr. Lee Rang
instead of Ms. Nam?

380
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,475
Both worlds are created
by the knots in their hearts,

381
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,019
and both involve their families.

382
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:41,065
If that girl met her parents
she had been desperately looking for,

383
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:45,820
how could anyone intervene?

384
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:50,950
Even if he went,
he'd have no way of entering.

385
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,995
Then you mean…

386
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,377
Yeon already had an idea

387
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,672
of what he was up against.

388
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,886
Does an exit even exist?

389
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,139
If there was an entrance,
there has to be an exit.

390
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,266
I got in through my closet.

391
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,811
Once I opened up the closet,
I found myself at my old house.

392
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,233
Not the Forest of Agwi?

393
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:25,985
No.

394
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,821
Tell me everything you saw.

395
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,117
At first, the townspeople
came after me with clubs,

396
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,746
and my mom was watching me get beaten.

397
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,999
-Then--
-You came to this forest.

398
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,918
Yes.

399
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,005
No wonder.

400
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,840
That's why I couldn't find the exit.

401
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,842
What do you mean?

402
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:53,930
-Don't you know who that woman is?
-Do you know her?

403
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,391
This is a party of your painful memories.

404
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,393
Wait.

405
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,356
-What was that thing called?
-The Darkness.

406
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,150
The Darkness.

407
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,473
I'M LOOKING FOR MY MISSING MOM

408
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,896
This place

409
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,899
may look like my room, but it isn't.

410
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,158
Where am I

411
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,410
right now?

412
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,996
What was that sound?

413
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,363
Hey, Kim.

414
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,034
What did the doctor say?

415
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:41,788
They ran all kinds of exams,
but haven't found the cause.

416
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,209
What's going on right now?

417
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,796
Ji-a, please open your eyes.
Will you please wake up?

418
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,684
I was in my office

419
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,229
just moments ago.

420
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,782
OFFICE LOUNGE

421
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,285
The veggie juice lady.

422
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,831
Young lady, what are you most afraid of?

423
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,041
Is it most likely Fox Hill?

424
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:28,793
Yes.

425
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,381
I was suddenly in the Fox Hill
after I met that lady.

426
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,806
OFFICE LOUNGE, VEGGIE JUICE LADY,
FOX HILL, WHERE AM I NOW…

427
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,687
That means this is…

428
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,693
Hey. Are you going to starve us to death?

429
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,154
Dad?

430
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,947
I'm starving.

431
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,657
Dad.

432
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,331
My sweetheart. Let's eat.

433
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,458
-Okay.
-Let's go.

434
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:16,549
OFFICE LOUNGE, VEGGIE JUICE LADY,
FOX HILL, WHERE AM I NOW…

435
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,773
The road is cut off.

436
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,734
Jump over.

437
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,777
I can't with this leg.

438
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,155
You'll find the exit
when you overcome your fear.

439
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,285
-I don't see any exit.
-Don't get scared!

440
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,040
Just think. What's your biggest fear?

441
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,877
Me?

442
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,379
My biggest fear is…

443
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,674
getting abandoned.

444
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,970
My mom abandoned me…

445
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,558
and so did you.

446
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,144
This is driving me insane.

447
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,813
I have…

448
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,984
never abandoned you.

449
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,216
I see it.

450
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:46,931
Let's go.

451
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,411
Make sure you survive.

452
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,548
Get up there!

453
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,275
Don't look.

454
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,361
That's not your mom! Don't look!

455
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,827
Mom?

456
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,705
Damn it.

457
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,918
Damn it!

458
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,436
No!

459
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,715
Mr. Lee!

460
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:47,802
I have to go.

461
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,096
Where are you going?

462
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,098
Where?

463
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,015
To Yeon.

464
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,310
I have to go to Yeon.

465
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,187
I have to--

466
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,981
Where are you trying to go?

467
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,693
I have to go see Yeon.
I have to get to him.

468
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,280
Gimbap.

469
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,866
It's my dad's gimbap.

470
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,868
Yes, he made gimbap again.

471
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,954
Goodness.

472
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,747
The ends are the best part, right?

473
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,666
-Let's eat the ends first.
-Sesame seeds?

474
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,501
Sure. Let's eat.

475
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,169
It tastes good.

476
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,300
-Is it all right?
-It's good.

477
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,094
Ji-a.

478
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,806
Thanks for the meal.

479
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,898
This is good.

480
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,787
Spinach, carrot, cucumber, ham,
and pickled radish.

481
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,914
What's wrong? You don't like it?

482
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,541
I do.

483
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:05,212
You didn't put in anything special,
but it's odd.

484
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,257
No other gimbap in the world
tastes like this.

485
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,386
Was that a compliment?
That was a compliment, right?

486
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,097
My daughter just complimented me.
All right!

487
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,932
This is great. All right!

488
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,978
-Eat up.
-Okay.

489
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,482
-It's especially good today.
-Is it? Thanks.

490
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,278
I suddenly had the thought

491
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:34,033
that the life I lived till now
may have been a long nightmare,

492
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,160
and this might be the real world.

493
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,334
If this is a dream,

494
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,170
please don't let me wake up.

495
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:54,678
OFFICE LOUNGE, VEGGIE JUICE LADY,
FOX HILL, WHERE AM I NOW…

496
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,938
-What's going on?
-Ji-a.

497
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,024
-Has something gone wrong?
-Ji-a.

498
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,817
-Ji-a, wake up.
-Hey, one second.

499
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,945
Excuse me, Doctor. Doctor!

500
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,822
-Over here!
-Doctor, please.

501
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,617
Please come over here!

502
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,702
It's so good.

503
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,621
I got some on my chin.

504
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,916
-Hand me a tissue.
-Look at your dad.

505
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,043
-Here.
-Thanks a lot.

506
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,461
It's good.

507
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:33,801
Who was that just now?

508
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,638
Who was he?

509
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,182
Is it better than the one I made
before we got married?

510
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,850
I don't even remember that.

511
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,479
Why can't you remember?
I made you so much.

512
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,523
You did make me a lot.

513
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,073
Don't be late.

514
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,535
If you miss your chance,
she'll get eaten up by that world.

515
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,788
Nothing happened.
We kept our eyes on her--

516
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,625
Where did she go?

517
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,377
-No way.
-What?

518
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,980
This is all I can do for you two.

519
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,734
Please make sure you return.

520
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:46,332
This was when you made us
our first carnation at kindergarten.

521
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,250
You ended up putting the pin

522
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,793
right through my shirt,

523
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,379
and I bled so much from my chest.

524
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,965
-I did that?
-Yes, I said, "What a wonderful daughter."

525
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,469
Don't we have this flower somewhere?

526
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:02,765
I kept it very dearly with me.

527
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:03,932
Ta-da.

528
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,060
"I love you, Mom and Dad."

529
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,897
-You still kept this?
-Of course. It's our family treasure.

530
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,440
Goodness, give it to me.

531
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,319
You kept it very well.

532
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,363
Of course, it's very precious.

533
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,326
-All right.
-She has your fingers.

534
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,786
-So cute.
-The phone's ringing.

535
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,579
-She's so cute.
-Look at her hands.

536
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,831
-Exactly. I remember those days.
-Goodness.

537
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,125
-Don't you hear the phone?
-She's so adorable.

538
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,251
Look at her soft hair.

539
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,628
Exactly.

540
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,798
-Look at her soft hair right here.
-I know.

541
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,967
-She's so cute.
-This was way back.

542
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,761
Hello?

543
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,889
It's me.

544
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,307
Who?

545
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,601
Lee Yeon.

546
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,812
Lee Yeon?

547
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,483
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you.

548
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,737
Who are you?

549
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,283
You sound like someone I know,
but I don't remember.

550
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,410
You have to figure it out.

551
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:51,165
You have to realize where you are
and why you're there.

552
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,836
You have to figure it out yourself
to come back to reality.

553
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,505
What do you mean?

554
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,174
Come back, Ji-a.

555
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:04,720
I'll always be waiting for you.

556
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,221
Don't hang up.

557
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:25,032
CONNECTION

558
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,585
You have to come back.

559
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,015
Who was that?

560
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:51,350
I don't know who he is,

561
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,228
but it feels like
I left behind something important.

562
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,578
A bouquet of mugwort.

563
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,002
It's very special.
At the least, it is for me today.

564
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,174
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you.

565
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,718
If I've been bewitched by something…

566
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,227
You're here.

567
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,188
You have to figure it out.

568
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,692
You have to realize where you are
and why you're there.

569
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,528
Come back, Ji-a.

570
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,530
Did you sleep well?

571
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,659
I'll always be waiting for you.

572
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,327
You'll find your parents.

573
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,496
I'll make it happen.

574
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,582
Thank you, Yeon.

575
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,502
Yeon.

576
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,222
It's agwi poison.

577
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,601
Do something.

578
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,562
Mr. Lee Yeon hasn't returned.

579
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:24,192
No. You can't go anywhere.

580
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,403
If he dies, I'll die with him.

581
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,281
I'll do anything to repay you for this.

582
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,578
Please. So please.

583
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,788
Please.

584
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,420
Please help him.

585
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,403
Look at this hat.

586
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,031
-It's so cute.
-Isn't this hat pretty?

587
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,741
-Did you knit this?
-Yes.

588
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,911
Look at how tiny her clothes are.

589
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,205
My gosh. She used to be this small.

590
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,414
Exactly.

591
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,627
Hey, Ji-a. Look.

592
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,838
This is the first day you babbled.

593
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,758
You threw up on her chest
after you took this photo.

594
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,760
I changed her formula on that day.

595
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,639
How do you remember all that?

596
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,474
Because we love you.

597
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,519
We love every move you make,
the way you babbled,

598
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,937
and even your loud wailing.

599
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,897
We love every little thing about you.

600
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,775
I see.

601
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,528
I was deeply loved, wasn't I?

602
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,407
-Look.
-She's so cute. Look at her.

603
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,325
She's so adorable.

604
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,078
Look at this.

605
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,539
Hey.

606
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:05,585
How would you feel if you lost me?

607
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,255
Why would we lose you?

608
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:12,926
You know, things can happen in life.

609
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,511
Don't even worry.

610
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,763
We'll chase you down
to the ends of the earth.

611
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,599
Of course, we will. You're our baby.

612
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,105
I'll do that too.

613
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:29,151
I'll make sure I find you two.

614
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,319
What do you mean?

615
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,531
Someone asked me this,

616
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,743
"What are you most afraid of?"

617
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,204
My biggest fear is

618
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,208
saying goodbye to you two.

619
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,920
What's wrong?

620
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,339
Mom, I'm sorry.

621
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,134
Dad, I'm sorry.

622
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,346
I have to go.

623
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,724
Where is she going?

624
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,143
-Honey, you have to stop her.
-Ji-a!

625
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,898
Once you go through that door,

626
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,777
you might never see us again!

627
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,236
Ji-a.

628
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,156
Why do you want to abandon us?

629
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,950
That's not what it is.

630
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:23,622
Ji-a.

631
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:29,044
The three of us can live here. Okay?

632
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,797
This isn't the real world.

633
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,757
Who cares?

634
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,718
The three of us are happy here.

635
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:37,886
That's what matters.

636
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,222
Why do you want to go live alone?

637
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,557
Your mom and dad are here.

638
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,312
I'm not alone.

639
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,190
Yeon is by my side.

640
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,360
Ji-a, please.

641
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,153
Please, Ji-a.

642
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,533
I trust Yeon.

643
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,371
-Ji-a!
-Ji-a!

644
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,683
That girl woke up too!

645
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,311
Isn't this cheating?

646
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,397
It looked fair enough.

647
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,482
What should I do now?

648
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,026
That's enough.

649
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,528
What?

650
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:40,282
All I wanted to do was
look into the deepest part of her heart.

651
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,200
And I got Lee Yeon too.

652
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:47,956
Yeon.

653
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,002
You woke me up.

654
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,672
You said you'll always wait for me.

655
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,767
Where are you?

656
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,022
Where did you go?

657
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,945
So this is my hell.

658
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,115
Dying in eternal loneliness

659
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,201
in a world

660
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,704
where she doesn't exist.

661
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,367
How's Mr. Lee?

662
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,453
It'll take a few days for him to detoxify,

663
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,122
but he'll be fine soon.

664
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,833
Why won't you ask me anything?

665
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:00,297
You see the reason why I approached you.

666
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:06,886
You already knew.

667
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,474
I saw you two by coincidence.

668
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,312
Then I was beaten up badly at a junkyard.

669
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,273
-By him?
-Yes.

670
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,068
Why did you treat him then?

671
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:28,325
I didn't want you to cry.

672
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,800
Sin-ju.

673
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,260
Mr. Lee.

674
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,018
Where's Yeon?

675
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,395
Is he back?

676
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,357
Mr. Lee.

677
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,985
Please wake up.

678
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,447
Please.

679
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,710
What will happen to him now?

680
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,031
I wonder if Ji-a returned home safely.

681
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,435
I wanted to tell her

682
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:04,355
how pretty she was
when we had chicken feet.

683
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,943
I wanted to tell her

684
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:13,573
a very ordinary "Goodnight."

685
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,161
I wanted to walk with you

686
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,457
in the same era as you do.

687
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,837
I wanted to keep you safe

688
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:31,132
through all your days and nights.

689
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:07,961
But I cannot seem to return.

690
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,121
I miss you,

691
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,456
Yeon.

692
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,848
Even a Nine-tailed Fox that was a deity

693
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,225
isn't much after all.

694
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,272
Hey, don't die.

695
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,024
It's not any fun if you die.

696
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:23,036
I guess you aren't dead.

697
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,706
Your beautiful body

698
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,042
will be used by the serpent

699
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:33,338
to make the world fall into chaos.

700
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,271
Darkness.

701
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,065
You startled me!

702
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:53,983
You're up.

703
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,986
Did Ji-a return home safely?

704
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,822
You're about to die. Who cares about her?

705
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,700
Please.

706
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,287
Please tell me.

707
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,044
I don't want to.

708
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,932
Please, I beg you.

709
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,184
Please tell me.

710
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,978
Come on, don't be such an eyesore!

711
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,527
Fine, she got out.

712
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,864
But it might've been better if she stayed.

713
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,659
She lost both you and her parents,

714
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:47,328
so it looks like
she has no reason to live.

715
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,874
So she escaped?

716
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:53,876
You're smiling?

717
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,923
Then what? Should I cry?

718
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:10,184
I went through so much trouble
to get you in here.

719
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,477
What?

720
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:26,033
Do you really think

721
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:29,078
I fell from that cliff
because of some agwi?

722
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,373
-Did you fall on purpose?
-Darkness.

723
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,168
Let me return your signature question.

724
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,171
"What are you most afraid of?"

725
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:44,218
I'm the darkness itself and your fear.

726
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,887
There's nothing I'm afraid of.

727
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,555
You're dying, aren't you?

728
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,683
You're now forgotten and abandoned
by people.

729
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,977
There are no folk tales for you.

730
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:57,315
That's why you've been
giving out veggie juice to troll people

731
01:02:57,398 --> 01:03:00,318
and venting your anger
on famous characters like the Snail Bride.

732
01:03:01,402 --> 01:03:03,571
How dare you?

733
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:05,907
Hey, my brother even forgot your name.

734
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,408
Shut up!

735
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:13,080
You will stay forever
in this hell you created,

736
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:16,334
and never be able to die.

737
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,101
Where do you think you're going?

738
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,277
It looks like you forgot
something very important.

739
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:46,280
This isn't the Forest of Agwi.

740
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,950
It's the subconsciousness of a deity.

741
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,661
In other words, it's my turf.

742
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,624
I can't see anything.

743
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:08,803
What do you want?

744
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,306
It's not you.

745
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,066
I found you.

746
01:04:28,155 --> 01:04:31,742
I'll come and get you very soon.

747
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,119
Just you wait.

748
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:02,356
The Nine-tailed Fox in love with a human,

749
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,192
you will end up

750
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:08,112
taking that woman's life
with your own hands.

751
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:10,865
That is

752
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:12,950
your fate.

753
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:16,287
Lady, worry about your own fate.

754
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:49,714
Don't come.

755
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,843
Stand right there.

756
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,053
This time,

757
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,597
I'll go to you.

758
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:26,083
I have been

759
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,211
waiting for you.

760
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:44,787
Repay my kindness, Yeon.

761
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:45,746
No.

762
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,207
It was mine to begin with.

763
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,918
His role as a deity
and his place by that woman's side.

764
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,503
You slept in.

765
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:54,547
I wish to break the contract.

766
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,965
It's not impossible.

767
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:58,300
Murdering your own brother.

768
01:08:58,884 --> 01:08:59,718
I'll do it.

769
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:01,887
Give me the deity.

770
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,931
Then I'll return your parents.

771
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:06,475
Lee Yeon, give me your body

772
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,894
I'll spare everyone.

773
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:15,401
