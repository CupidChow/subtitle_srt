1
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,390
It's hot.

2
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,601
Don't be a baby.

3
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,811
Your hand is too hot.

4
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,188
It's burning hot.

5
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,865
Long time no see, Lee Yeon.

6
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,333
I'm thirsty.

7
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,130
12 HOURS AGO

8
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,644
Water.

9
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,193
Water.

10
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,319
I'm thirsty.

11
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,369
Water.

12
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,372
Water.

13
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:41,411
DEATH

14
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,603
Man, he drowned himself to death

15
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,271
like the fisherman he is.

16
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,523
He drowned to death?

17
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,525
In that toilet?

18
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,319
I fished him out myself.

19
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,238
Look at how his stomach is about to pop.

20
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,159
Man, I knew something was weird
when he drank water all day long.

21
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,538
Captain, please call the police
and shut this restroom down.

22
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,875
Life feels so futile.

23
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,878
He lived such a hard life to this day.

24
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,339
What do you mean?

25
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:38,009
When that fishing boat called
the Eunha capsized,

26
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,220
he was onboard as well.

27
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,598
Then he was there
with Pyeong-hui's father?

28
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,392
Yes, there were four of them,
including Mr. Seo.

29
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,145
Hello? Is this the police?

30
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,817
It must've been one special night.

31
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,073
-What's wrong?
-He smells fishy.

32
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,203
-What's fishy?
-This guy smells like rotten fish.

33
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,789
His body hasn't even decayed yet.

34
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,416
Damn it.

35
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,053
Hair?

36
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,305
But he has gray hair.

37
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,518
Smells like the sea, and…

38
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,564
there's a hint of that blanket
from that house.

39
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:37,694
That house? You mean Pyeong-hui's house?

40
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,231
DEATH

41
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,363
SAILORS OF THE EUNHA RETURN

42
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,073
-Look at this.
-What?

43
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,076
That guy is this guy right here.

44
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,246
There were a total of four fishermen
on the capsized Eunha.

45
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,416
Three came back alive, and the last one--

46
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,876
Only the head.

47
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,297
Please let me see my dad.

48
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,758
Dad!

49
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,763
Looks like he won't be the only one
who'll end up dead.

50
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,264
Do you mean more might die?

51
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,184
Then we can't just stand here.

52
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,312
-Why not?
-We have to stop this.

53
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,938
-No, thanks.
-What?

54
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,815
Too much work. And it's not my job.

55
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,442
And I don't like their looks.

56
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,568
Come on!

57
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,154
I only deal with good-looking people.

58
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,375
THE SECOND SURVIVOR OF THE EUNHA

59
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,757
Who's there?

60
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,471
Jin-sik, it's me.

61
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,183
Mr. Seo?

62
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,061
Is that you, Mr. Seo?

63
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,354
Jin-sik.

64
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,065
Jin-sik!

65
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,019
I'm hungry. I'm so hungry.

66
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,521
THE THIRD SURVIVOR OF THE EUNHA

67
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,439
I'm hungry.

68
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,279
I'm hungry. So hungry.

69
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,262
Who's there?

70
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,774
-Who are you?
-This isn't our first time.

71
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,984
Your house is a mess.

72
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,445
You were with that head that day.

73
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,615
Get out of my house. Get lost!

74
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,658
I only leave when I want to.

75
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,410
You asshole.

76
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,163
Who do you think you are
pulling that crap?

77
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,002
Answer my questions politely.

78
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,546
If you don't,
I'll break your fingers one by one.

79
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,799
What did you do on the boat?

80
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,220
A huge wave hit the side of the boat.

81
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,971
The weather forecast was way off.

82
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,515
Then why did only three return?

83
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,183
Seo got washed away in the waves.

84
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,811
-And we floated around the sea.
-Then?

85
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,189
I don't remember anything after that.

86
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,357
It's the truth!

87
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,652
I was back on the land when I woke up!

88
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,778
Okay, your pinkie it is.

89
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,030
Wait.

90
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,244
You must've been afraid.

91
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,788
You spent 28 days out on the sea

92
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,831
on that tiny lifeboat
without food or water.

93
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,833
It was enough to wear anyone out.

94
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,462
The scorching August sun hit you hard,

95
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,005
leaving mild burns on the skin.

96
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,218
The boat rolled around,
making you nauseous on an empty stomach.

97
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,595
One can only wait for so long
to be rescued.

98
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,222
The waiting was maddening.

99
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,933
-"Why me? Why?"
-Shut up!

100
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,060
The fifth day was the toughest.

101
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,229
It hadn't rained over those five days.

102
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,066
I'm sure dehydration hit you first.

103
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,277
No. No.

104
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,738
Help us.

105
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,755
Get a grip!
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

106
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,050
We're all going to die anyway.

107
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,177
I don't want to die.

108
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,306
I don't want to die.

109
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,560
I'm thirsty.

110
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,690
Pyeong-hui must be worried sick.

111
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,736
Pyeong-hui…

112
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,198
I'm thirsty.

113
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,284
I'm hungry.

114
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,750
I'm hungry.

115
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,501
I'm hungry.

116
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,714
Doesn't it seem odd?

117
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,217
You didn't lose much weight
for someone who starved for 28 days.

118
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,430
And you couldn't get delivery
without WiFi on the open sea.

119
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,685
-What did you eat?
-I didn't.

120
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:50,232
I didn't. I didn't do it.

121
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,614
I am not

122
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,451
going to die out here.

123
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:01,994
What are you doing?

124
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,746
What are you doing?

125
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,747
Don't do this.

126
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,833
I will not die here!

127
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,008
It wasn't me.

128
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,598
I'm hungry.

129
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,643
I'm starving to death.

130
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,061
Meat.

131
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,900
It's meat. Meat.

132
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,069
Meat.

133
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,704
Give me my meat.

134
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,458
Meat. My meat. Give me my meat!

135
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,346
Sir, get up.

136
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,516
Mister!

137
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,772
Hair.

138
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,116
He's dead.

139
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,542
EUNHA VICTIM SEO GI-CHANG'S
DAUGHTER, SEO PYEONG-HUI

140
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:32,710
Dad…

141
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,847
Dad…

142
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,059
Stop crying.

143
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,811
Your wish came true.

144
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,692
There's one more to go.

145
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,861
So

146
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,739
what will you give me in return?

147
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,419
Who's messing with the book of the dead?

148
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,047
Honey! Hey, honey.

149
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,675
Honey, what's wrong?

150
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,219
It happened again.

151
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,765
WARNING

152
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,391
Goodness, there's an error.

153
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,561
Someone who isn't in the book died again!

154
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,981
Don't get so hysterical, honey.

155
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,441
Hysterical?

156
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,194
No, I mean, stressed out.

157
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,906
I mispronounced it.

158
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,246
You're obviously stressed out
because of your work.

159
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,957
What have you been up to?

160
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,876
Watching dramas, right?

161
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,713
No. I was watering the Uiryeongsu Tree.

162
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,799
For three hours? For that one tree?

163
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,177
Honey, my laziness isn't the issue.

164
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,595
The book is a mess!

165
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,974
I'll rush over and get
the region's death statistics again.

166
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,976
Give me just one second.

167
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,103
Oh, right.

168
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,278
It looks like
a disaster is about to break out.

169
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,560
Running these stories,
I've seen my share of folk paintings

170
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:59,315
but never as creepy as this one.

171
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,400
Why?

172
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,658
Something is missing in this painting.

173
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,581
PORTRAIT OF THE DRAGON KING

174
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,337
You startled me.

175
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,008
How can you eat chips in this situation?

176
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,885
Why not? This is my favorite.

177
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,512
Two people died.

178
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,639
So what?

179
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,849
Got a more reasonable reaction than that?

180
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,561
How many do you think died over 50 years

181
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,356
through 1592's Japanese Invasion
and 1636's Manchu Invasion?

182
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,691
Over 3.5 million.

183
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,445
I've seen more funerals
than all the funeral homes combined.

184
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,155
You've seen 3.5 million deaths.

185
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,075
At the least one of those deaths
had to be profound to you.

186
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,268
Look at this.

187
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,148
We saw the same painting
in that house too.

188
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,068
It's a portrait of the Dragon King, right?

189
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,861
It is but looks nothing like him.

190
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,365
-You've seen him?
-Back when I was a deity.

191
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,742
We took the same
leadership seminar of a sort.

192
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,453
That's too glamorized.
He's not that handsome.

193
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:44,211
But this is different from other portraits
of the Dragon King I've seen.

194
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:46,880
Look. This is the normal painting
of the Dragon King.

195
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,467
Do you see the difference?

196
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,469
Is this a spot-the-difference or what?

197
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,855
There are no feet.

198
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,690
No feet?

199
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,693
Now that you mention it…

200
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,114
A dragon without feet.
What do you reckon that is?

201
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,575
This is a snake, not a dragon.

202
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,911
A serpent.

203
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,160
You must be Master Lee Rang.

204
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,747
I've been expecting you.

205
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,833
Are you sure it's hidden here?

206
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,711
Yes. The fallen deity,

207
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,505
the king of all sinners,

208
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,882
Lord Lee Ryong.

209
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:16,053
No way. That just made me cringe.

210
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,722
Throwing all kinds of titles
before his name

211
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,599
won't turn him into a dragon.

212
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,438
He died a tragic death
in a fight with Yeon

213
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,107
with that human girl, right?

214
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,319
Before he went into that girl's body,

215
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:36,323
he entrusted a piece of his body
with our family of shamans.

216
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,492
He's not the type to go all-in.

217
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,536
He's my exact opposite.

218
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,081
Anyway, are you all ready?

219
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,543
A woman born in the Year of the Sheep,
a living sacrifice, and--

220
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,086
Leave Yeon to me.

221
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,214
Go get evening primroses
grown from the blood and flesh

222
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,882
of the dead from a graveyard.

223
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,887
Allow me to ask one question.

224
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,520
Aren't you and Lee Yeon brothers by blood?

225
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,773
We are.

226
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,860
To be exact, brothers from another mother.

227
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,029
Once he's awakened,

228
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,490
Lee Yeon will not survive.

229
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,827
So?

230
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,454
How come you are helping
your brother's enemy?

231
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,421
Just come.

232
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,550
-What is it?
-Pack up and leave

233
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,677
as soon as possible
from this shitty island.

234
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,679
-What?
-I have a bad feeling.

235
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,891
-What do you mean?
-It's the perfect place

236
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,058
to end up dead.

237
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:52,065
You said you aren't here to save people.
So why am I an exception?

238
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,612
That's none of your business.

239
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,698
I'm not going home
over reasons I'm oblivious to.

240
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,367
So you can go look for someone
you came here to find.

241
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,662
I need to know why my parents were here.

242
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,796
Why do I help the enemy of my blood kin?

243
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,050
Yes, it's wise
to not trust your partner completely.

244
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,219
No, that's not what I meant.

245
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,014
Have you seen him as a mountain deity?

246
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,974
I've only heard of him.

247
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,643
Tell me what you heard.

248
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,063
The most ruthless one
among the four mountain deities

249
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,314
who ruled the land.

250
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,360
No one dared to plunder his forest,

251
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,655
so Baekdu Mountain was bountiful.

252
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,993
He may be called a deity,
but my brother is a guy

253
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,704
who has zero consideration for others.

254
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,374
But you know,

255
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:55,462
he always gave me the bigger piece
even when we shared an apple.

256
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,259
I still remember
the sweetness of that green apple.

257
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,427
Then why?

258
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,931
He used the same loving hands
that split his apple with me

259
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,433
to split my stomach open.

260
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:14,022
I was hurt even more deeply in my heart
than this gigantic scar.

261
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,067
-So that's why you--
-After all, I'm a fox.

262
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,070
I need to pay his kindness back.

263
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,033
I'll surely end up in hell

264
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,703
with Yeon.

265
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:49,558
Ms. Nam,
I came to the library as you said.

266
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,435
So what am I looking for?

267
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,395
A dead body?

268
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:58,108
So dead bodies that were mutilated?

269
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,320
Set the keyword to Eohwa Island,
and look up all related cases.

270
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,030
Call me if you find anything.

271
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,448
What are you looking for?

272
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,742
What the old ladies here said
keeps troubling me.

273
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,994
Don't tell anyone that we told you.

274
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,662
This wasn't the first time.

275
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,706
You know, finding just someone's head.

276
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,795
Granny.

277
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,799
Have you heard anything about that guy?

278
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,134
Who's that guy?

279
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,511
The serpent.

280
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,642
Didn't you put an end to that thing
with your own hands?

281
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,103
I did.

282
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,772
-So why do you ask?
-Nothing.

283
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,607
I was just worried.

284
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,737
I can't let that thing lurk around
this world again

285
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,155
where A-eum is reborn.

286
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,076
What a loving boyfriend.

287
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,620
-There's no way I wouldn't know if--
-Okay, bye.

288
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,248
What a cheeky little brat.

289
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,308
Pyeong-hui.

290
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,102
You're back.

291
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,312
What are you reading?

292
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,239
What's wrong?

293
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,699
You're not Pyeong-hui.

294
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,668
Why are you here?

295
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,796
It's a great place to read.

296
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,049
Anyway,

297
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,759
you're all alone.

298
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,346
He's nearby.

299
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,475
No, he's not.
I can smell him from miles away.

300
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,946
It's you who killed those fishermen.

301
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,574
Don't blame the innocent.
Got any evidence?

302
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,451
That book.

303
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,080
This one? I love the classics.

304
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,416
Moby Dick was inspired by a true story

305
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,252
of a whaling boat that capsized
in the 19th century.

306
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,795
What happened on that boat?

307
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,506
They ate and got eaten,

308
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,593
just like what happened
to Pyeong-hui's father.

309
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,014
You surprised me. I almost died just now.

310
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,183
Look at these guys.

311
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,268
There's one here too.

312
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,812
What are you doing?

313
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,027
Only I get to ask questions.

314
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,778
What the heck are you doing?

315
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,366
I said only I get to ask questions.

316
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,748
If you don't give me a good answer,
you'll never fish again.

317
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,877
What's this painting?

318
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,672
But if I'm the culprit,
I have to have a motive.

319
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,716
What could it be? Bringing justice?

320
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:13,553
I wasn't completely sure just before,
but I think I know now.

321
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,225
The deaths of those fishermen are
a sort of fireworks.

322
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,228
Fireworks, you say.

323
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,022
You want to cover our eyes and ears

324
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,233
by distracting us
with a high-profile case.

325
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,109
-Why should I?
-Probably

326
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,154
to hide the real reason why
you came to this island.

327
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,829
Magnificent.
You're pretty smart for a human woman.

328
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,290
Since you guessed correctly,

329
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,292
here's a reward.

330
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,379
You want information on your parents.

331
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,507
-Give it back.
-Come on. You saw it in a dream.

332
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,178
How did you know?

333
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,429
Just ask me.

334
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,182
Who knows?

335
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,851
I might have the answer.

336
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,438
You can

337
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,316
really find them for me?

338
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,151
Yes.

339
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,945
Do you want me to grant you

340
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,905
that wish?

341
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,416
I asked you. What's this painting?

342
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,127
It's obviously the Dragon King.

343
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,338
We gave him our respect
since he calms the storm

344
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,340
and brings fish to fishermen.

345
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,176
So we'd hold
a big ritual to pray for a big catch too.

346
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,554
-You liar.
-People say

347
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,931
fishing isn't something
people can control.

348
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,977
-I'll just cut it off.
-No, I'm serious!

349
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,438
Where did you get this painting?

350
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,441
This lady in town
bought it from a mainland market

351
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,609
and gave it to us.

352
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,362
Feel free to ask anyone in town.

353
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,665
You'll forget everything you just saw.

354
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:14,174
-Ring me up.
-When did you come in?

355
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,508
That'll be 1,000 won.

356
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:20,472
How many people came here
from the TV station?

357
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,392
This pretty young man
from out-of-town came asking

358
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,810
for Pyeong-hui's place.

359
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,606
A young man?

360
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,862
Just give me one word.

361
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,240
Say yes.

362
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,712
I decline.

363
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,465
Why?

364
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,635
I heard a fox always repays
someone's kindness.

365
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:02,722
In other words, a favor won't be for free.

366
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,474
Gosh, you're way too intense.

367
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,309
Don't be so uptight between us.

368
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,229
Then, between us,
I'll give you a word of advice.

369
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:13,108
Stop trying to make a move
by exploiting others' misfortune.

370
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,736
People call jerks like you

371
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,823
a rat bastard.

372
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:25,078
You. I hate it when people are so crass.

373
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,748
If you ever call me that again,
I'll kill you.

374
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,251
Why me? Why do you lurk around me--

375
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,585
I'm not talking to you.

376
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,551
But I'll give you a piece of advice too.

377
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,636
Don't trust Yeon too much.

378
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,431
What do you mean?

379
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:49,519
Once he finds what he wants,
all hell will break loose.

380
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,377
He's gone.

381
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,881
And you're fine?

382
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,299
What did Rang say?

383
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,219
He offered to find my parents.

384
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,305
And?

385
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,643
I'm the type who never orders
two half-flavors of fried chicken.

386
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,604
I only stick to one.

387
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,148
What?

388
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,900
I turned him down.

389
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,820
I made my bet on this fox.

390
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,201
I knew you were well-educated.

391
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,411
That's all?

392
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,456
Don't trust Yeon too much.

393
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,500
That's all.

394
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,210
I'm hungry.

395
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,254
Why don't you pack up and leave?

396
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,925
-What?
-Your brother.

397
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,928
He's preparing some special event.

398
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,679
That's what I'm waiting for.

399
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,453
Gosh, come on.

400
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,956
Isn't she a new face here?

401
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,791
She's not native to Korea.

402
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,710
-Then?
-She's probably from abroad.

403
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,758
Is it because she's from abroad?
She's very stylish.

404
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,469
How much are those things?

405
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,680
Who made the reservation?

406
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:54,519
Ki Yu-ri. She's the director
of Moze Department Store. My gosh.

407
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,647
She's obviously not a self-made woman.

408
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,482
She must have won the lottery.

409
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:03,152
There are only two types of foxes
who reek of wealth and affluence.

410
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,405
She's either from a rich family
like Mr. Lee,

411
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,992
or she broke the taboo
and took a human's life.

412
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,178
Sitting here like this,

413
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,639
everything from this morning
seems like a dream.

414
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:37,353
It'd be wonderful to live
this boring and simple life.

415
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,272
Then move here.

416
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,234
Don't you miss nature?

417
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,321
Not really.
There are no department stores,

418
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,365
and I can't give up on Americanos
and mint chocolate ice cream.

419
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,035
What's with this fox?

420
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,496
Life is the same for everyone.

421
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,707
Old ladies here
wearing comfy flowery pants

422
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,084
doesn't mean
their lives are all comfy and flowery.

423
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,047
Once you take a look, you'll see
all kinds of adversities and tough times.

424
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,885
Is that the case for you?

425
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:15,475
I'm just curious what kind of pattern
you've lived for all this time.

426
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,980
What about you?

427
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,317
What made you wait
for your parents so long?

428
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,196
It's simple for me.

429
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,659
I just miss them. My mom and dad.

430
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,373
Me too.

431
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,542
I'm waiting for someone I miss.

432
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,172
Your first love?

433
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,675
A human? Or a fox?

434
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,347
Why did you leave her
if you had so many regrets?

435
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,648
You won't tell me, will you?

436
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:07,193
My darned first love
happened to be a human girl, and she died.

437
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:10,154
So regrettably, I still haven't
brushed away my regrets. Happy?

438
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,533
You said you're still waiting.

439
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:17,495
Are you waiting for someone who's dead?

440
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,751
She promised

441
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,004
to be reborn.

442
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,466
Clean up mine too.

443
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,246
That room is for staff only.

444
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,291
Goodness, my mistake.

445
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,087
I don't think it was a mistake.

446
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,174
I don't look like a petty thief, do I?

447
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,054
We should get acquainted
since we're the same kind.

448
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,889
I'm Yu-ri.

449
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,601
We aren't exactly the same kind.

450
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,603
Are you what, from Russia?

451
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,773
You have good eyes.

452
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,024
How did you get here?

453
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,861
-Were you--
-Yes, smuggled.

454
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:35,948
Have you ever flown nine hours
stuck between Makarov pistols?

455
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:40,453
I wanted to shoot the smuggler's face
as soon as the plane landed.

456
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,538
You've been through a lot.

457
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,456
That's why

458
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:47,293
hearing you judge me
whether I'm the self-made type or not

459
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,880
breaks my heart, doesn't it?

460
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,801
Well, what I'm trying to say is

461
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,470
I had to confirm your identity.

462
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,682
You wanted to know
the secret behind my success?

463
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,976
-Yes.
-It's nothing special.

464
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,110
I treat people sweetly…

465
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,280
and brutally.

466
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,168
Thank you.

467
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,136
I can't believe you let her take that.

468
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,303
I'm done for.

469
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:43,141
I can't understand what animals say
without that necklace.

470
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,477
You always showed off as a master vet
or whatever. Serves you right.

471
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,022
What? That thief was fatally charming?

472
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,484
You're pathetic, you know?

473
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,528
You're blinded by a woman.

474
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,445
But Mr. Lee,

475
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,448
you also ruined your life
because you were blinded by a woman.

476
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,741
What did you say?

477
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,661
So what should I do?

478
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,372
What else? You have her identity.
Go get it back.

479
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,208
I can't. She has a gun.

480
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,961
Where's your pride as a fox?
Who cares about a gun?

481
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,588
You know I was traumatized

482
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,215
after losing my tail
when a hunter shot me.

483
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,135
So please come back already.

484
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,678
Stop whining and go get it.

485
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,772
Why did he break that branch?

486
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,358
It must have hurt.

487
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,841
Eat well and grow big.

488
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,931
The wind is blowing northwest.

489
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,685
Something is coming.

490
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,896
Hey, Jae-hwan.

491
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,650
There really were other similar cases?
Who were the victims?

492
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,986
All four were unidentifiable women.

493
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,487
When was it?

494
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,449
The first case is
from the year 1954, August 13th.

495
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,785
"The year 1954?"

496
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,912
It's right after the Korean War ended.

497
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,832
Something unclean came to the island
during a typhoon.

498
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,459
Keep going.

499
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,628
August 25th, 1961.

500
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,922
September 6th, 1979.

501
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,008
And September 7th, 1987.

502
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,677
The cycle is pretty far apart,

503
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,304
but isn't this serial murder?

504
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,472
-The day of the week.
-From the top,

505
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,141
Friday, Friday,

506
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,934
Thursday, and Monday.

507
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,352
It's not the day of the week.

508
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,022
A date between August and September.

509
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,065
Wait.

510
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,026
One second.

511
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,988
LUNAR CALENDAR: JULY 15, 1961

512
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,448
And 1979.

513
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,325
LUNAR CALENDAR: JULY 15, 1979

514
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,534
And 1987.

515
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,202
LUNAR CALENDAR: JULY 15, 1987

516
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,787
The lunar calendar.

517
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,958
These are all July 15th
on the lunar calendar.

518
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,669
If I'm correct, these dates are the same.

519
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,795
What?

520
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,173
And that's today on the lunar calendar.

521
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,967
Ms. Nam, you have to leave
that nasty island now.

522
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,639
What the heck happened on this island?

523
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,854
Excuse me.

524
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,899
You were on the boat
with Pyeong-hui's dad.

525
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,986
Two of the survivors passed away.

526
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,239
Your life is in danger!

527
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:28,991
Hey!

528
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,495
Please hear me out!

529
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,163
Just a moment!

530
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,501
Why are you running away?

531
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,672
Get lost, you ghost!

532
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,483
Don't kill him!

533
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,379
I'm not hurt that badly.

534
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,643
-What's this?
-Traditional remedy.

535
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,108
It's hot.

536
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,318
Don't be a baby.

537
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,571
Your hand is too hot.

538
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,281
It's burning hot.

539
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,991
Wait, I--

540
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,293
What is this?

541
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,265
Long time no see, Lee Yeon.

542
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:17,933
Who are you?

543
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,352
It's me.

544
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,979
The thing you've been waiting for.

545
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,190
What?

546
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,652
But you know what?

547
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,322
Why…

548
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,700
did you kill me?

549
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,463
Who are you?

550
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,050
That's why you should've let me go.

551
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,968
I said who are you?

552
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,057
Our cursed relationship should've ended.

553
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,893
Only if you didn't hold back that boat

554
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,063
crossing the Samdocheon River.

555
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,656
No.

556
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,910
She will be born with a mark
only I can discern.

557
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,254
You don't have that.

558
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:36,595
You really are
completely clueless, Lee Yeon.

559
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,193
It's hot.

560
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,993
What did you do to me?
That was burning hot.

561
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,913
The scar is gone.

562
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:06,709
Who are you?

563
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,003
What do you think?

564
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:09,920
Answer me.

565
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,465
-What's with you?
-Who are you?

566
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:20,347
It's me, Ji-a. I'm Ji-a.

567
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,185
You don't remember?

568
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,272
You just--

569
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,239
Aren't we a bit too old to play catch?

570
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,450
There's too much drama for us to do that.

571
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,410
That was supposed to be a hit by pitch.

572
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,335
Wait, the picture.

573
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,270
Get away from here.

574
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,189
Wait, are you two dating?

575
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,106
Damn you.

576
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,025
Now.

577
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,169
Get moving!

578
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,149
Move.

579
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,859
I don't want to. Play with me.

580
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,153
This is domestic violence, you know.

581
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,155
Delinquents need to be spanked,

582
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,866
but I didn't and raised this fox
into a mutt.

583
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,410
And who kicked that mutt out?

584
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,078
Stop treating me like a stray dog.

585
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:10,165
My brother, I'll give you a muzzle
for this year's Christmas.

586
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,642
Where's my phone?

587
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,131
Who are you?

588
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,053
I've never seen you.

589
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,765
I'm from a TV station in Seoul.

590
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,142
Do you live here?

591
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:11,769
I do.

592
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,981
How do I get back to the village?

593
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,194
Climb over that hill. That's the shortcut.

594
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,403
Thank you.

595
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,822
By any chance,

596
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,658
how long have you been living here?

597
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,746
Very long.

598
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,665
Much longer than anything you can imagine.

599
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,000
In that case,

600
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,462
have you ever seen them before?

601
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,756
They took this photo here long ago.

602
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,097
Wasn't this woman pregnant?

603
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:53,310
You're right. Do you remember them?

604
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,690
Have you ever talked with them?

605
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,152
Why were they here?

606
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,072
Drink before it turns cold.

607
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:10,786
Sure.

608
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:24,299
She said her baby was
in the breech position

609
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,134
or had the umbilical around its neck.

610
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,721
Anyway, she came to the snake cave

611
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,474
and prayed to the Dragon King
for safe delivery.

612
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:33,725
The Dragon King?

613
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,602
He's amazingly powerful.

614
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,439
Our island was the only one unaffected
through Typhoon Sarah.

615
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,819
We used to have huge rituals for him.

616
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,697
Like rituals for bountiful fishing?

617
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,325
You know your stuff for a young woman.

618
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,660
When is the ritual?

619
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,204
It's on Baekjung day.

620
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:56,665
Baekjung day?

621
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,584
FOUND DEAD ON AN ISLAND

622
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,002
AUGUST 25, SEPTEMBER 6, SEPTEMBER 7

623
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,254
That's July 15th on the lunar calendar.

624
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,842
And you must have overseen the rituals.

625
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,680
On this island, only this house had

626
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,932
the five-colored flag out in the yard.

627
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,518
FIVE COLORS REPRESENTS LIFE,
DEATH, DISEASE, WEALTH, AND ANCESTORS

628
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,229
It means there's a shaman here.

629
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,941
I make my living with these things.

630
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,818
And ma'am,

631
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,655
this pregnant lady is a doctor.

632
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,950
She would've seen a doctor
instead of going to a snake cave.

633
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,579
Take a seat.

634
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,664
I'll take my time and tell you.

635
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,584
You can talk to the police.

636
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,423
You won't be able to leave anyway.

637
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,384
That tea? I didn't have any.

638
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,477
I don't eat anything from a stranger.

639
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,194
What's wrong with me?

640
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,290
It wasn't the tea…

641
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:23,835
but the incense.

642
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,651
You're laughing?

643
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,864
I think I stalled you enough.

644
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,034
Don't you get it?

645
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,829
Why did that woman
come to this island of all places?

646
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,956
-What?
-She will be sacrificed.

647
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,292
You don't have much time.

648
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,963
By the way, she won't pick up her phone.

649
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,387
What's going on?

650
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,765
Her smell is completely gone.

651
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,630
The sun will set soon.

652
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,301
Just a while. Hold out just a bit longer.

653
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,150
Your mother came to this island

654
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,738
just like you did yourself.

655
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,034
Since getting pregnant with you,

656
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,871
she had the same dream every day.

657
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:30,337
You lured your mother here

658
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,299
from her womb.

659
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,654
I am a former mountain deity
and the lord over all nature.

660
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,740
Lift this darkness
and take me to that woman!

661
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,800
I haven't done it in so long.
It doesn't work at all.

662
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:26,953
Let's go.

663
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,945
It's no use.

664
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,200
It was you

665
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:08,286
who did that to the women
found dead on this island.

666
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:14,042
They were all precious sacrifices.

667
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,711
Screw that.

668
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,923
Hey, lady. That's just plain murder.

669
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:25,262
Become a sacrifice.

670
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,764
You're a very special girl.

671
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,651
I've been waiting a long time for you.

672
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,999
Die. You must die.

673
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,583
You have to die.

674
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,189
Die. You must die.

675
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,649
You have to die.

676
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,568
Halt!

677
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,282
Yeon.

678
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:30,535
Don't lay a finger on her.
Or I'll rip off your limbs.

679
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:33,413
This has nothing to do
with the old lord over the mountains.

680
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,040
Go about your way.

681
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,043
You're only a living corpse.

682
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,839
Who gave you such a long life
that you don't deserve?

683
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,885
I asked who your master is.

684
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,847
You can't stop me anyway.

685
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,433
I'm surrounded by evening primrose.

686
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,706
Die!

687
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:26,466
Die.

688
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,574
Damn it. You!

689
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,033
Return to dust.

690
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,388
This punk.

691
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,390
What's wrong, honey?

692
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,853
Yeon just killed a human.

693
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,524
Can you walk?

694
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,736
Yes. Just lend me an arm.

695
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,881
What was that woman?

696
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,716
A human.

697
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,469
Just a human being
who was desperate to live longer.

698
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:20,515
Man, I wanted to punch her in the face.

699
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:23,935
Big talk for someone
who almost died just now.

700
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,436
But I didn't.

701
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:59,387
Mr. Lee!

702
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:03,057
I get that it was an emergency,
but what about the consequences?

703
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,101
Shut up. Hang up if you'll nag.

704
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,352
I'll take the punishment.

705
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,814
This is why you shouldn't get involved
with human women.

706
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,738
She knows something
about A-eum's past life.

707
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,781
What? Ms. Nam does?

708
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,534
I don't know who she is,
but I'll keep an eye on her.

709
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:25,079
Your love story is
well-known in this field.

710
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,206
I'm sure your brother was scheming things.

711
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,250
Our closing sale for fruit begins now!

712
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,586
Only for today! It's on sale only today!

713
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:34,213
-Do not miss your chance!
-Where are you? At a market?

714
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,300
LIMITED QUANTITY: PEACHES FOR 2,152 WON

715
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,845
I was a bit depressed before,

716
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,473
and this is my little paradise.

717
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:44,974
Did you take my credit card?

718
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,101
Hello? Mr. Lee? I can't hear--

719
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,187
Hello? Mr. Lee?

720
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,775
Are these organic?

721
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,490
You're drinking?

722
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:03,743
I'm only human, so I can't sleep
without a drink on a day like this.

723
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:05,870
Have a drink, chap.

724
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:12,794
I didn't want to sound like a boomer
so I kept quiet until now,

725
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,547
but you keep talking down to me.
How old do you think I am?

726
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:19,342
Once you're over 60,
everyone just calls you grandpa.

727
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,305
Keep speaking casually.

728
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,064
Why do you keep saving me?

729
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:38,945
You didn't even blink
as you witnessed 3.5 million die.

730
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,029
So why?

731
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,914
Do I have something

732
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,667
you're looking for?

733
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:11,269
Heaps of things are bothering me,
but I'll skip those for today.

734
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,271
I'll just say this.

735
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,649
Thank you, Yeon.

736
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:21,779
The 9-year-old me and the 30-year-old me

737
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,741
both survived thanks to you.

738
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,161
You know,

739
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,747
I'm not much of a fighter.

740
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,915
and can't control the weather,

741
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:37,420
but one day, I'll protect you.

742
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,176
I'll protect you.

743
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:04,781
Hey.

744
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:08,910
Can you turn this one soju bottle
into a whole case or something?

745
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:14,207
-Like the five loaves and two fishes?
-Yes.

746
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,834
I'm no Jesus. Just drink what you have.

747
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:21,214
Cheers.

748
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:49,927
Leaving on the first boat?

749
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:52,930
You're limping.

750
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:58,686
Did you give up a leg
in order to avenge your dad?

751
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:00,980
How did you know?

752
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,940
You were lucky with your life intact,

753
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,526
but don't ever curse anyone again.

754
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,655
It'll come back to haunt you.

755
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:16,579
They're gone.

756
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,081
-What?
-Everyone is gone.

757
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,207
What are you saying?

758
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,126
It's as if the entire village

759
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,545
vanished into thin air,

760
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,547
and there isn't a soul around.

761
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:45,960
The Gate of Demons.
It's where unclean spirits come and go.

762
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,671
How dare you! What were you thinking?

763
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:51,841
Why do you hate your brother so much?

764
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,679
If you wish to live,
you better not fall asleep tonight.

765
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,143
What do you want from me?

766
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:05,521
Your girl will fail to die
a natural death in this life too.

767
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:09,316
Hell of the Mountain of Knives.
Then I can leave here by today.

768
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,694
Or you may never get to leave.

769
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:16,782
