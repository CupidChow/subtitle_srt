1
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,580
You. I told you to wait for me, didn't I?

2
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,957
We meet again. How long has it been?

3
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,502
That rebel told me everything
even before I beat him.

4
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,755
I told him I wanted to meet you
right here at this hour.

5
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,385
So my sword doesn't kill you.

6
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,517
Back then,
I was borrowing that woman's body.

7
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,185
But not now.

8
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,701
So you can do a few tricks.

9
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,537
I always wanted to fight you at ease.

10
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,080
That's just what I wanted.

11
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:16,970
You aren't so bad.

12
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,722
You don't know a thing about me, Lee Yeon.

13
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,891
I lived much longer than you think I did.

14
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,270
I existed way before you were born.

15
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,105
You keep living in the past.

16
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,815
And I'll live much longer than you.

17
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,234
And don't risk your life
for a future you won't see.

18
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,028
A man born
from a cave plagued with an epidemic

19
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,990
wanted to escape from the darkness
and waited for his time

20
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,367
under the dark water
for 1,000 years to be a deity?

21
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,369
I was supposed to be in your position,

22
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,372
if that human didn't spot me
just as I was becoming a dragon.

23
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,334
How tragic. It's just like that story.

24
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,836
Someone whose phone went off

25
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,630
and got kicked out
right before the college entrance exam.

26
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,134
But that's who you are
and that's your fate, serpent.

27
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,760
See? You don't even have a name.

28
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,263
You're still the same.
Still very arrogant.

29
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,223
Do you think you're above everyone else?

30
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,309
At the very least, you're under me.

31
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,686
I'd love to trample you.

32
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,189
Your brother, your woman,

33
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,901
and her parents' lives are
all in my hands.

34
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,528
What do you have?

35
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,114
Let me make a fair offer.

36
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:22,202
Lee Yeon, if you give me your body,
I'll let everyone live.

37
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,252
What do I look like to you?

38
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,929
The rebel of Seogyeong.

39
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,685
You took my mom and dad!

40
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,248
It's the carnation I made.

41
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,666
Flip it over.

42
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,968
Ji-a, why won't you come and save us?

43
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,386
They're alive?

44
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,682
-Where are they?
-Give me the deity.

45
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,850
Then you'll get your parents back.

46
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,269
Tell me. Where are they?

47
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,729
You saw them,
but just didn't recognize them.

48
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,565
What are you saying?

49
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,609
You'll find out soon enough.

50
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,112
I won't let you live.

51
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,072
Call the police or your boyfriend.

52
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,659
I don't care who you call, but if you do,
you'll never see your parents again.

53
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,203
Why? Why did you do that to my parents?

54
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,163
I knew a day like this would come.

55
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,250
My dear Ji-a is a girl
who'd do anything to save them,

56
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,669
just as you saved your father before.

57
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:57,213
I hope you'll make a wise choice again.

58
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,850
You'll let them go if I give you my body?

59
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,812
Ji-a, her parents, and Rang?

60
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,231
I'd like your entire body,

61
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,401
but if you can't do that,
just the heart will do.

62
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,195
Do you mean it?

63
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,197
I do mean it.

64
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,658
So?

65
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,535
Will it be yes or no?

66
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,704
I--

67
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,459
My answer isâ€¦

68
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:45,970
I don't want to.

69
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,723
-Why not?
-You look like

70
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,600
a con artist, that's why.

71
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,727
I don't make deals with guys like you.

72
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,855
I'll take everyone back on my own.

73
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,148
Feel free to see

74
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,610
what it's like to destroy
everything you love with your own hands.

75
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,154
It's odd for me to ask,

76
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,781
but why did you return?

77
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,284
No one wants to see
the symbol of chaos, epidemic, and war.

78
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,661
If you're looking for a story,
I don't have that.

79
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,455
All I want is one thing.

80
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,541
That woman.

81
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,171
The woman who was given to me
as a sacrifice from birth.

82
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,590
The woman who ended up
saving you and killing me.

83
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,552
I like her.

84
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,763
How dare you?

85
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,857
We're done now.
I just wanted to see how powerful you are.

86
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,692
But I'm just getting started.

87
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,875
I want to die right now.

88
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,087
You can feel him.

89
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,091
I knew you were linked to my master.

90
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,136
-What?
-You're his vessel.

91
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,847
Why are you doing this?

92
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,974
You're a human too.

93
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,561
That's why I don't want to die,
but still have so many things I want.

94
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,775
Was rebelling against the king not enough?

95
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,362
My only sin is being born as a lowly man

96
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,907
who dreamed of seeing a new world.

97
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,619
All I wanted was to see my children,
wife, and mother eat a decent meal,

98
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,621
but they said I'm a rebel who should die.

99
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,915
That's when I met him.

100
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,167
I doubt he saved you for free.

101
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,295
What did you give him in return?

102
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,592
My children. My wife. My mother.

103
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,095
I offered my beloved family as a sacrifice

104
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,138
and saved myself.

105
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,933
You're out of your mind.

106
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,852
You must give something
in order to take something.

107
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,438
So you're asking me to give Yeon up,

108
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,149
and become someone as low as you?

109
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,693
The choice is yours, Ji-a.

110
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,862
Will you let your parents die

111
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,281
after already losing half their lives
because of you?

112
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,658
Or--

113
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,540
A drop of this is enough

114
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,750
to make anyone fall deep asleep.

115
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,504
Put Lee Yeon to sleep.

116
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,049
Then you'll get your dream life back.

117
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,105
AFTERLIFE BORDER CONTROL OFFICE

118
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:27,567
This is why I said
we should get a massage chair.

119
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,528
We won't end up using it after a while.
Stop wasting money.

120
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,114
I'm an old man now,
so I'm not as strong as before.

121
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,116
Put your back into it!

122
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,661
Yes, ma'am.

123
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,624
Bok-gil gave great massages.

124
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,836
He'd make tea with rubber tree barks

125
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,423
and Siberian ginseng
to help with your joints

126
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,593
for his hard-working mother
who worked day and night.

127
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,178
Don't bring up
that impious kid's name before me.

128
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,064
Don't call my son an impious kid.

129
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,816
Get out.

130
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,036
Why do you act

131
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,622
as if you're the only one
who was heartbroken

132
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,123
after we lost our son?

133
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,001
Get out of here!

134
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,461
It was your fault.

135
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,339
If you hadn't killed his wife,

136
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,466
he wouldn't have taken his own life.

137
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,555
She was possessed by a plague spirit.

138
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,350
Should I have let her go
and let the land get plagued?

139
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,936
Of course. This is who you are.

140
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,566
You were never a mom for Bok-gil
or a wife for me.

141
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,985
Just the gatekeeper of Samdocheon.

142
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,197
I must've been out of my mind

143
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,909
for desperately trying to understand you
all these years.

144
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,288
I don't want to see you here. Get out.

145
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,588
EMERGENCY ALERT:
132 SUICIDES IN GEUMRAN-GU

146
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,799
ALL REAPERS MUST REPORT IMMEDIATELY

147
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,598
It's the serpent, isn't it?

148
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,245
Hand over Lee Yeon. You have two days.

149
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,205
We need his body.

150
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,709
Don't try to break off your contract.
Unwind the tangle first.

151
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,170
Serpent, you jerk.

152
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,798
What in the world are you up to?

153
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,553
UNPRECEDENTED MASS DEATHS
SHOCK PUBLIC

154
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,305
This doesn't make any sense.

155
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,682
It's like a horror movie.

156
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:08,185
How can 132 people kill themselves at once
in the same borough?

157
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,770
Maybe it was a suicide club.

158
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,022
None of them left a will behind.

159
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,567
People who commit suicide will
do whatever it takes

160
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,570
to let people know
why they're killing themselves.

161
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,113
Could it be a cult?

162
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,490
You know,
like the mass suicide of Jonestown

163
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,451
back in the '70s.

164
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:27,079
That involved poison.
In this case, everyone died differently.

165
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,372
Man, this is so weird.

166
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:29,915
I'm back.

167
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,625
Hey, Terry, you're back.

168
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,253
Wait, you were at Geumran-gu.

169
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,965
Hey, are you okay? Do you feel all right?

170
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,550
-Are you hurt?
-Sorry?

171
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,968
You haven't seen the news?

172
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,429
A heap of people died there
just an hour ago.

173
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,099
-Really?
-Where's Ji-a? She didn't come with you?

174
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,602
She left before me with urgent business.

175
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,936
Is she not here?

176
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,938
Really? When did she get back?

177
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,357
-Here's the footage we got today.
-Thanks.

178
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,860
So? How was it?

179
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,029
Did Ji-a abuse you in any way?

180
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,699
Not at all.
She seems much nicer than I expected.

181
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,205
CALLING NAM JI-A

182
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,606
Give me the deity.

183
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,733
Then you'll get your parents back.

184
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,954
LEE YEON

185
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,711
JI-A, WHY WON'T YOU COME AND SAVE US?

186
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,551
Come this way.

187
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,639
You got a nice place.

188
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,562
The living room is pretty spacious,
but there aren't many bedrooms.

189
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,776
I guess vets make quite a lot.

190
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,028
Come here.

191
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,414
Take a seat.

192
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,208
This is--

193
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,252
It's a Russian dish, borscht.

194
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,839
I don't think you grew up eating this,

195
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,549
but it might smell of home.

196
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,683
You don't like it?

197
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,521
I sometimes miss the forest
I was born and raised in so much.

198
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,106
It's an apartment complex now.

199
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,161
It's the smell I know.
And I like this smell.

200
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:01,919
And it's good.

201
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,048
Eat up.

202
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,018
I'm sorry.

203
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,651
-Geomdoong?
-Mister.

204
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,195
You brat. Come back here.

205
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,533
Don't make me angry. I'll kill you.

206
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,243
Who is this?

207
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,661
My stepdad.

208
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,205
Come here. Come, I said.

209
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,209
It's your choice.

210
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,836
If you ask me for help,

211
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,296
I'll make sure
you won't have to see him again.

212
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,716
If you say no, I'll go on my way.

213
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,885
Hey, do you know him?

214
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,304
Who are you
to meddle in our family affairs?

215
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,640
Silence. I'm waiting for him to answer.

216
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,726
Who are you? Are you with the police?

217
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,939
So

218
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,191
what I want is--

219
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,695
Su-o, you better tell him straight.

220
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,744
I have to go back home.

221
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,476
Yu-ri, you said
you don't have any family or friends.

222
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,730
-What?
-I can't live without fried chicken,

223
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,233
but if you only want to eat
Russian cuisine,

224
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,735
I'm thinking of changing my tastes.

225
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,197
What are you talking about?

226
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,075
I want to be there for you,

227
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,287
as your family and friend.

228
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,793
When it comes to family,

229
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,046
I already have something similar.

230
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,298
The fake mom and dad
Mr. Lee Rang gave you?

231
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,717
-The ones who own a department store?
-Yes.

232
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,805
I may be a stand-in
for their dead daughter,

233
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,515
but they need me.

234
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,225
People say

235
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,020
family is someone you want to abandon
if no one was watching you

236
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,940
because they torment each other.

237
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:32,528
But in the end, you also end up
always taking them back in too.

238
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,864
-Like Mr. Lee Yeon and Lee Rang?
-Yes.

239
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,575
So

240
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,163
why don't you return
your fake parents' life back to them?

241
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,500
Become my real family
and live through highs and lows--

242
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,127
What are you two doing here?

243
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,420
Mr. Lee!

244
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,798
Lee Yeon? Why are you here?

245
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,174
This is my place.

246
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,468
Hey, have you seen Ji-a?

247
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,845
She wasn't here. Why?

248
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,223
She's not picking up her phone.
Where did she go?

249
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,101
Anyway, continue on
with the necklace thief.

250
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,647
Darn it, this was Lee Yeon's place?

251
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,650
It's okay. His place is my place.

252
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,652
Are you laughing?

253
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,362
Right. Eat up.

254
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,660
Mr. Lee?

255
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,706
What?

256
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,868
What are you doing here?

257
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,748
I thought I'd run into you
if I waited here.

258
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,250
You were unreachable all day.

259
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,419
Did something happen?

260
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,297
Yes.

261
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,507
Me too.

262
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,718
What happened?

263
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,638
Before we get into that--

264
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,348
Ta-da!

265
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:28,852
Open it.

266
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,451
Something that makes you feel great.

267
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,371
You remembered.

268
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:51,375
Of course. The smell of fresh rice,
world literature collection,

269
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,877
Dad's gimbap, a new pair of sneakers,

270
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,171
and me, right?

271
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,756
It's a two for one deal.

272
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,847
People say your girlfriend will run away
if you gift her shoes.

273
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,309
Even if you do,
I hope you put on these new shoes

274
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,437
and take the best path you can find.

275
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,614
What's with that sad smile?

276
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,116
You don't like these?

277
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,618
It's not that.

278
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,956
I never realized how affectionate

279
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,042
the word "shoes" can be.

280
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,716
I love you.

281
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:46,596
So much so that I can give you my life.

282
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,523
Let's go for a walk,

283
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,275
on a good path

284
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,485
together.

285
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,413
What's this?

286
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,624
What do you think? A freshly caught human.

287
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,086
-Who is it?
-That's none of your business.

288
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,506
He won't cause any problems.
Snack on him as a bladder cherry.

289
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:23,592
Gladly.

290
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,353
He moved the bladder cherry plant
to another room.

291
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,730
Do you want to see it?

292
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,276
Are you allowed to show me that?

293
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,528
What's there to hide
at this point in time?

294
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,451
It looks like a normal seed, doesn't it?

295
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:53,163
It locks up people's body and soul,
so I call it the bars of flesh and spirit.

296
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,041
Only the serpent can make these.

297
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,669
What an awful man.

298
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,546
He was imprisoned time and time again.

299
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,841
Did you save a little boy?

300
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,970
I need to give a good excuse

301
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,514
when I end up in hell.

302
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,734
-Do you want more milk?
-Yes.

303
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:05,944
Eat up.

304
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,612
Don't eat too much.

305
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,072
That's my milk.

306
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,200
Why won't that lady go home?

307
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,618
You go home

308
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,204
before I eat your liver.

309
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,710
I don't have a home anymore.

310
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,629
Stop playing a victim.

311
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,716
There are millions out there in Seoul
who are homeless.

312
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,218
-You don't have a home either?
-Of course, I do.

313
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,220
Stop fighting.

314
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,100
You said your name is Su-o, right?
Where's your mom?

315
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,561
My mom got beaten up every single day,

316
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,521
then she ran away with this other guy.

317
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,066
That's why my stepdad got angry at me.

318
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,569
That means you have no place to go.

319
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,115
Mr. Lee, why do you do this to me?

320
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,325
Eat up.

321
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,588
What's on your mind?

322
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,678
Do you know the fairy tale,
The Little Mermaid?

323
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,057
-By Anderson?
-Yes.

324
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,978
I hated the ending so much
since when I was a kid.

325
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,482
She could've lived
if she killed the prince.

326
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,859
Why did she let herself turn into foam?

327
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,197
What about you? What would you have done?

328
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,823
Long ago,

329
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,536
I always thought
I'd kill him to save myself.

330
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,622
And? Did you change your mind?

331
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,749
Now that I've met him,

332
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,878
I've grown to love the prince
much more than I thought.

333
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,923
If I killed the prince,

334
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,842
my fairy tale could end
happily ever after.

335
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,354
If I was the Little Mermaid,

336
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,400
I'd kill the witch
who put the curse on her.

337
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,528
I don't want her
to take control of my life.

338
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,328
I was put under a curse.

339
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,916
He said he'll give my parents back
if I hand you over.

340
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,093
Forget what they want.

341
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,554
Tell me what you want.

342
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:41,725
I want my voice back,
and I want the prince too.

343
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,936
And of course,
I have no plan to turn into foam.

344
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,981
Will you hunt the witch down with me?

345
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,609
Do you have time to be doing this?

346
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,903
We have 24 hours
until our contract expires.

347
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,162
This might be the last day of my life.

348
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:05,206
It's up to me to make the most of it
or waste it as I like.

349
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,499
Why do you care?

350
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,460
Will you throw away your life

351
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,629
for your brother whom you loathe?

352
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,260
The serpent met with Lee Yeon today.

353
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,805
He told him that we have three hostages,

354
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,975
Ji-a, her parents, and you.

355
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,772
But where do you think Yeon is right now?

356
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,487
Did he call you
to check and see how you were?

357
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,282
Don't be ridiculous.

358
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,661
You've been abandoned again.

359
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,539
Yes, and I abandoned you.

360
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:50,627
Sorry. For saving you
after your human mother abandoned you.

361
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,297
Lee Yeon saidâ€¦

362
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:58,051
I have never abandoned you.

363
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,597
â€¦that he has never abandoned me.

364
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,354
You already know
that's far from the truth.

365
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,485
-Hey, kid!
-Yeon?

366
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,197
He came to save me from agwis.

367
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,366
It was an act he put on to save Ji-a.

368
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,576
You were just a prop.

369
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,869
Shut up!

370
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,414
Lee Yeon will do anything for Ji-a's sake,

371
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,042
even if he must hand you over to die.

372
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,131
If you lay a finger on her,

373
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,467
I'll really kill you this time.

374
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,139
Will you give up your life

375
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,225
for your brother
who only cares about his woman?

376
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,957
Yes, Mr. Lee.

377
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,211
What? Sin-ju?

378
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,798
He wants to talk to you.

379
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,135
This is Sin-ju.

380
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,637
You know, don't you? Where's Yeon?

381
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,264
He went out to see Ms. Nam.

382
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,640
So where is he?

383
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,018
I'll ask him, then call you back.

384
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,739
That's 132 people who died
that aren't in the book.

385
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,616
And we'll see that number rise.

386
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,161
-What?
-He is calamity itself.

387
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,704
It's just the beginning.

388
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,832
Let's bring him in right now.
Tell me how. I'll do it.

389
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,917
You can't do this.

390
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,253
In order to catch him,

391
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,632
I must do that thing you despise me for.

392
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,300
What's that?

393
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,263
Hey, Yeon. You're here.

394
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,526
Wait, you're--

395
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,196
Hello, sir and ma'am.

396
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,114
My name is Nam Ji-a.

397
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,467
Yeon told me all about you.

398
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,387
You!

399
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:51,516
How dare you bring the living here?

400
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,268
She is still alive,

401
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,729
but she's also involved in the issue
you two were fighting over.

402
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,572
This is not a place for a human child.
Return immediately.

403
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,658
I understand that rules and principles are
very important to you.

404
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,827
But I came despite--

405
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,954
Does it look like
the place to make a wish?

406
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,374
-Come on.
-Quiet.

407
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,585
Orâ€¦

408
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,296
do you want to know when you'll die?

409
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,673
No, ma'am. I don't see fortune-tellers.

410
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,925
-I don't like spoilers.
-Then what?

411
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,094
I lost my parents when I was nine.

412
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,263
It's not an audition.
I don't need your story.

413
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:33,182
And something of the serpent is
apparently in me.

414
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,101
That's also a part of your fate.

415
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:39,230
I plan on defying that darned fate
as much as I can.

416
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,820
That's why I came to visit you
to this place where I shouldn't be

417
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:46,863
while I'm alive.

418
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,115
You two are the same.

419
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,159
Yes, we're meant to be.

420
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,080
I'll give you credit
for not wetting your pants before me.

421
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:56,998
What do you want?

422
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,127
Help me with your clairvoyance.

423
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,087
I'd like to know where my parents are.

424
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,549
-What?
-Not for free, of course.

425
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,760
And how will you pay for it?

426
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:12,013
I'd love to pay for it
no matter how much you rip me off,

427
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,223
but I don't have anything right now.

428
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,393
Then how will you do business?

429
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,312
We'll catch the serpent.

430
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,566
Yeon and I'll do it together.

431
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,375
I did it!

432
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,253
Could you tell that I was shaking?

433
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,506
Not at all.

434
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,051
I thought the past life and the afterlife

435
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,304
only existed in comic books,
but it's all real.

436
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,307
People say the wicked live a better life,

437
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,267
but not once they die.

438
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,313
Do you send the deceased
across the Samdocheon?

439
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,483
I give them a summary of the afterlife,

440
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,860
catch the ones who put up a fight,

441
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,321
and humor my wife too.

442
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,700
But it's a relief to know

443
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,953
that the first one the deceased meet is

444
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,705
a warmhearted person like you, sir.

445
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:26,170
You may have lost your parents early,
but you still grew up very well.

446
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,047
Your parents would be happy to see you.

447
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,218
Do you think I can really see them?

448
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,348
Let's trust Yeon and wait.

449
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:45,857
This is unlike you.

450
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,026
What am I like?

451
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,193
With your personality,

452
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,571
you would've turned

453
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:54,323
the serpent into stone long ago.

454
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,785
I remember seeing
the northern deity turn into stone

455
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,079
when he went berserk.

456
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,456
So why?

457
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,834
Why is he an exception?

458
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,336
Because I don't want
to see you go berserk.

459
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,090
What do you mean?

460
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,844
A part of the serpent is inside her.

461
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,602
Is there a way to get rid of that thing

462
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,271
in Ji-a's body?

463
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,773
No.

464
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,525
She either has to die

465
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,153
or the serpent will need to remove itself.

466
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,947
I don't buy that. You must know something

467
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,450
about how that thing lives off her body.

468
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:42,580
No matter what you do,
the serpent has been awakened already,

469
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,416
that girl will be sacrificed,

470
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:50,797
and Yeon, once again,
you'll live your life in complete torture.

471
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,132
That is

472
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,468
your fate.

473
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,433
That's why you told me not to find her.

474
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:08,064
That's why you said
Ji-a and I should never meet.

475
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,483
You were afraid I'd be hurt

476
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,237
if I got caught up in that fate again.

477
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,662
Thanks, Granny.

478
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,416
But I still choose to be with her.

479
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,919
I lived to this day

480
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,672
to meet her.

481
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,342
Even if I ask you a hundred times,

482
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,761
you'll make the same choice every time.

483
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,642
The bladder cherry.

484
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,525
Her parents are in there.

485
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,327
Let's go.

486
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,496
-Sir, we'll get going.
-Okay.

487
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,416
If anything happens, come here,

488
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,293
and call out "Hyeonuiong" three times.

489
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,587
Whether you win or lose against fate,

490
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,380
my bet is on you two.

491
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,883
-Thank you.
-Sure.

492
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,343
Go on.

493
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,438
Did you find out?

494
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,232
-The bladder cherry.
-The bladder cherry?

495
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,028
I can't believe
I'm seeing a bladder cherry in Seoul.

496
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,362
This is a bladder cherry?

497
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,615
My parents were in there?

498
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:42,742
How?

499
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,494
That plant can hold
people's blood and flesh.

500
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,289
He helped his followers live longer
by using that.

501
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,958
Let's go. It was in his house,

502
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,543
in the middle of his living room.

503
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,379
It's probably elsewhere.
It was gone when I was there.

504
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,405
We have 24 hours
until our contract expires.

505
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,806
You came between the brothers.

506
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,892
-Will Lee Rang fall for this?
-He will.

507
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,479
His hatred for his brother is
more like a deep-rooted obsession.

508
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,147
It's more twisted than it looks.

509
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,401
So he can kill him
because he loves him too much?

510
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,152
You can leave this to me.

511
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,488
I'll bring Yeon's heart to you.

512
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,990
Don't take him too lightly.

513
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,659
He put me to sleep back then

514
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,661
because I underestimated him.

515
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:11,122
That's why I put out
three different traps.

516
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,207
I just need him to be caught in one.

517
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,044
Once we're done, I'm going into politics.

518
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,297
I'm sick of managing this TV station.

519
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,300
-I also need a reward for--
-Do as you like.

520
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,554
You monster.

521
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,352
Where do you think Yeon is right now?

522
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,688
Did he call you
to check and see how you were?

523
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,857
You've been abandoned again.

524
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,525
Will you give up your life

525
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,153
for your brother
who only cares about his woman?

526
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,831
-Yeon?
-Have you seen bladder cherries

527
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,207
at the serpent's place?

528
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,210
Ji-a's parents are in there.
Do you have any information?

529
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,297
Is that all you have to say

530
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,716
to me?

531
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,593
Have you or haven't you?

532
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:07,720
I have.

533
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,056
Where does he keep it now?

534
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,807
I don't know that much.

535
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,061
-Bye.
-I can find out.

536
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,480
The president thinks of it as his life.

537
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,399
-Really?
-Let's meet tomorrow.

538
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,817
I'll tell you in person.

539
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,173
Rang will find out. I'll see him tomorrow.

540
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,175
Where? What time? Should I go with you?

541
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:52,139
Leave him to me.
Please do something only you can do.

542
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,146
Why are you here?

543
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,817
I was too worried to sleep
ever since I heard her boyfriend is a fox.

544
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,943
Ji-a!

545
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,278
-What?
-How did you know where I live?

546
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,739
Ms. Nam once had
your fingerprints identified.

547
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,199
Why did you come here?

548
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,535
I came to check
on the safety of my princess.

549
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,579
You can't date a Nine-tailed Fox.
Not even over my dead body.

550
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,291
No, you can. How big is this living room?

551
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:26,257
We couldn't come empty-handed.

552
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,259
-What's this?
-Some snacks.

553
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,846
-Mealworms?
-I asked a colleague

554
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,306
who does animal shows,
and he said foxes love those.

555
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,601
I had to choose
between mealworms and crickets.

556
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,061
Go ahead and enjoy it.

557
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,774
Have you had dinner?

558
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,734
-No.
-I'll order something.

559
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:33,824
As long as you're alive,
foxes are bound to their contract.

560
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,918
GOPBUN'S GRILLED TRIPE

561
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,840
Oh, it's delivered in cloth.

562
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,634
Let's have dinner.

563
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,645
So our president is
an accomplice of the mummy case?

564
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:04,522
I went to ask him about the nail tips,

565
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,731
and he admitted to it.

566
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:08,275
-Let's tell the police.
-What are you going to say?

567
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,654
That the president of our TV station is
a man from the Goryeo era

568
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,823
who works for a legendary serpent
and kills people?

569
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,243
-As if they'll buy that.
-You're right.

570
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:21,539
Then what if we put Tiger's Brows
on Detective Baek?

571
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:25,209
See? People have past lives,
so a man from Goryeo could be alive.

572
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,712
Didn't he go to a prestigious college?

573
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,548
He's a nice kid.

574
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,175
Why aren't you eating?

575
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,261
You won't eat mealworms or tripe.

576
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,554
Do you eat people's liver?

577
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,599
I'd love to have some in this mood.

578
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,694
-It's better than I thought.
-Right?

579
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,779
If I may, do you have tails?

580
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,406
Why would you ask a rude question?

581
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,575
I can't believe
that you're a Nine-tailed Fox.

582
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,618
He does. I've seen them.

583
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,454
That's awesome.
Then can you use a leaf to get disguised?

584
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,831
That's a raccoon.

585
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,166
I can disguise myself,
but it's so undignified.

586
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,877
Show us!

587
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:09,795
You little punk.

588
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,133
-Eat up.
-Eat. Just eat your food.

589
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:31,734
I'll do it.

590
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,990
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

591
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,451
I want to live.

592
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,873
But are you sure
you can cut out his heart?

593
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,543
You can take his heart.

594
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,837
I'll lure him out.

595
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,798
You're too softhearted.

596
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,887
Take this.

597
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,434
And tell him to come to the place
I mentioned before.

598
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:08,020
Starting now,
you and I will move as a team.

599
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,315
You should spend the night here.

600
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,822
Guys like this belong in a TV station.

601
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:02,241
-Terry, you should stay for good.
-Goodness.

602
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,201
Did you get all these this morning?

603
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:05,994
-Gosh.
-Eat up.

604
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,663
-It looks great. Let's eat.
-Okay.

605
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,373
When did you three get so friendly?

606
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,875
Hey, he's one smart kid.

607
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,129
He's well-versed in everything
including history, arts, and religion.

608
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,505
He's a walking encyclopedia.

609
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,715
He's good on the field.

610
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,509
Do you remember the past life accounts
from overseas?

611
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:23,178
He spent all night
translating English, French,

612
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,346
and Chinese papers.

613
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,682
What's your secret?

614
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:29,768
I couldn't leave my house as a kid
due to health issues.

615
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,479
I was usually alone other than my sitter.

616
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,064
So I only read books.

617
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,233
I see.

618
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:48,162
Good morning. You were all here.

619
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,456
You're eating toast?

620
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,498
That's mine.

621
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,876
Let me have one. Don't be so cheap.

622
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,047
Urban Legends Team,
let's have dinner tonight.

623
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,799
-I'm out.
-I'm out too.

624
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,968
No way.
You can't use anything as an excuse

625
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,345
including interviews,
scripts, or editing. Why not?

626
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,264
It's Terry's welcome party.

627
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,242
You're here.

628
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,079
What are you doing here?

629
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:34,625
I'm making coffee.

630
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,170
And what are these flowers?
It doesn't suit you.

631
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,756
It's to remind you of your hometown.

632
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,675
You can take one if you'd like.
Girls love flowers.

633
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,137
You don't have to be so kind.

634
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,349
Where are the cherries? Do you know?

635
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:33,725
What's the hurry?

636
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:34,893
I have no time to play.

637
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,065
-What?
-I can't lose any time either.

638
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,569
But you have to hear me out to the end.

639
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,322
What is it?

640
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,744
What do I mean to you?

641
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,834
What ticked you off this time?

642
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,420
I think I've done my best.

643
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:02,921
What's the problem now?

644
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,756
Answer me.

645
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,885
What do I mean to you?

646
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,763
You're my family.

647
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,058
Just because we have the same father,

648
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:18,687
you think you have the right to throw
tantrums, but I've had enough.

649
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:23,317
You may have brought me
to a place filled with flowers,

650
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,069
but don't think
I have anything pretty to say.

651
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,531
I'm tired of your whining
even after all these years!

652
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,953
You're very cold to me,

653
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,457
whereas you are awfully generous
to that woman.

654
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,084
Yes, she's much stronger than you.

655
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,296
She has a tragic family history,

656
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:45,881
but she's not whiny like you.

657
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,467
Isn't it odd?

658
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,639
You were never nice to me.

659
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,726
But you looked dazzling in my eyes.

660
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,063
You seemed perfect.

661
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,148
I wantedâ€¦

662
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,485
to be like you.

663
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,160
Have some coffee.

664
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,163
Who knows what you put in here?

665
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,503
Don't get scared. I'm joking.

666
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:50,153
So? Where is the bladder cherry plant?

667
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,364
Give me some time. You'll find it.

668
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:55,993
Don't you dare try to pull anything on me.

669
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,328
You saved me at the Forest of Agwi,

670
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,414
and I had this thought,

671
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:07,713
"One day, I'll die for you too.

672
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,798
I'll save you, then die."

673
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,051
But you know,

674
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,846
when I actually had my chance, I couldn't.

675
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:17,848
I want to live.

676
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,893
Since we're on the topic,

677
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,063
will you die for me, big brother?

678
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,579
Do you want to fight me?

679
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,041
If I fight you head-to-head,
I would never win.

680
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,047
The coffee.

681
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:06,980
If you worried about me half as
much as her,

682
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,150
I wouldn't have done this.

683
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,736
I couldn't have.

684
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,201
You idiot.

685
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,591
I have Lee Yeon.

686
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,014
Wait until I get there.
And don't call this number.

687
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,441
Darn it. Does he think
I'm his minion or what?

688
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,205
We're over here. Come here.

689
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,125
Take a seat. That's it.

690
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,295
Okay, then. Fill up the glasses.

691
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,046
Terry, I'll pour you one.

692
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,591
Okay, take a drink.

693
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,885
-Thank you.
-I got myself.

694
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,763
-Welcome to the team!
-Welcome.

695
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,265
-Thank you.
-Bottoms up.

696
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,894
My goodness.

697
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,563
I would kill to have a son like him.

698
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,608
He's good looking, smart,

699
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:18,153
and he's in great shape.
He's built like a video game character.

700
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,616
Look at this guy.
You're a nice kid, though.

701
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,785
I'm almost starting
to have respect for Mr. Choi.

702
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,163
How can he be so consistent?
Don't you think so?

703
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,131
I need to get some air.

704
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,595
Terry, where are you going?

705
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,940
I have to go see someone.
I'll make it quick.

706
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,441
Where are your manners?

707
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,612
-Sorry?
-You can't leave without saying anything.

708
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,072
And you're the main occasion.

709
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,198
Right.

710
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,160
-I'm sorry.
-I have lots of questions for you too.

711
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,455
Such as?

712
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,001
What's your favorite book?

713
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,963
-A Lover's Discourse: Fragments.
-Barthes?

714
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:21,132
-You've read it?
-The title got me.

715
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,134
I thought it was about relationships,

716
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,637
but you'll need
a master's degree in humanities

717
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,973
before you can understand
his language of love.

718
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,142
There are many beautiful quotes.

719
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,729
"He praises the woman for being perfect,

720
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,066
then he glorifies himself
for having chosen

721
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,859
this perfect woman."

722
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,572
I glorify mixed shots.

723
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,366
Let's go back in.

724
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,466
I have five minutes left.
Terminate the contract.

725
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,802
To be exact,

726
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,179
it'll be terminated
after I take his heart.

727
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,433
I brought him here as promised.

728
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,768
Say it. Say that it's terminated.

729
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,604
I'm waiting
for the serpent right now, kid.

730
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,065
-Where are your manners?
-It must drive you insane.

731
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,153
You can't kill me since you owe me.

732
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:31,494
You said you were born as a slave.

733
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,830
I guess you can't do anything
without your master.

734
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,457
Watch what you say.

735
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,293
You'll do anything
if I tell you to repay my kindness.

736
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:41,421
You go around doing favors
for the serpent who killed your family.

737
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,340
Shut up.

738
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,758
How did it feel

739
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,594
when your parents, wife, and kids died?

740
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,388
-Did you cry?
-I told you to shut up.

741
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,765
Then say it.

742
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,725
Say that the contract is terminated.

743
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:56,478
Fine. I'll put an end
to this darned contract

744
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,022
in my way.

745
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,577
Have you lost your mind?

746
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,747
I don't think I can let you do this.

747
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:17,874
I may be a jerk,

748
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,628
but I can't give up my family
as a sacrifice

749
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:22,587
like you did.

750
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,716
What? Then you'll die.

751
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:28,802
I won't.

752
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,346
But foxes will surely die
if they break the contract.

753
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,890
Foxes can do this thing

754
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:36,643
called disguising.

755
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,854
Man, I hate how undignified this is.

756
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,738
You're way too concerned
about your dignity.

757
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,491
You said you'll only take a sip,
but you got knocked out.

758
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,453
Wait, since when?

759
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,333
Since last night at your place.

760
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,889
Why are you here?

761
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,231
I'm sorry.

762
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,484
I heard you were one of the hostages,

763
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,904
but I didn't know you could die.

764
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,124
Let's survive this together.

765
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:47,964
I can't seem to be freed

766
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,884
from my contract.

767
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,302
You can.

768
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:55,513
How?

769
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,808
Switch with me.

770
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,688
Then take me to him just as he wants.

771
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,357
I'll do it.

772
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:08,568
Take this.

773
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,030
You should spend the night here.

774
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,342
You two.

775
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,761
How dare you!

776
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:47,774
You need to kill Lee Yeon right now.

777
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,902
Stop tormenting my brother.

778
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,904
You might really lose your life.

779
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:57,492
Now, it's your choice.

780
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,453
Will you kill him, then die in my hands?

781
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,371
Or

782
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,165
will you revise the contract?

783
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,216
Save my life. Repay your kindness.

784
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:37,407
The bladder cherries.
Get me as many as you see there.

785
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,435
Alcohol is meant to get you drunk!

786
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,228
-You're completely wasted.
-Come on!

787
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:10,690
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Terry, put your trust in me, okay?

788
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,279
I'll drop you off.
I called the chauffeur service.

789
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:19,365
-It's all right.
-No, I'm not okay with it.

790
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,873
Sorry, sir. You can go now.

791
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:42,430
Ms. Nam.

792
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:45,975
-Yes?
-Do you have a boyfriend?

793
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,478
Yes, I do.

794
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,647
What's your boyfriend like?

795
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,275
He's like a fairy tale.

796
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,611
Break up with him.

797
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:00,740
-What?
-Fairy tales for adults

798
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,826
usually end very brutally.

799
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,632
Goodbye, then. Thanks a lot.

800
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,761
He spilled everything.

801
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,184
Look.

802
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,523
I'm freed.

803
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:42,365
That was some acting.
You should be an actor.

804
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:43,950
Should I?

805
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:00,675
LEE YEON

806
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,144
Terry.

807
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,606
Don't try to be a man in front of me.

808
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,776
To me, you areâ€¦

809
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,159
my parents' enemy.

810
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,494
Nothing more, nothing less.

811
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,498
You knew.

812
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,756
Is that why you were stalling me?

813
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:44,135
Please do something only you can do.

814
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,262
"Something only I can do"?

815
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:50,558
I need you to stall the serpent
while I look for the bladder cherry.

816
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,351
The serpent?

817
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,979
Where is he?

818
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:58,691
He is somewhere closer than you expect.

819
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,986
Somewhere very close to me?

820
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,698
Could it beâ€¦

821
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:15,041
You seem too calm
for someone who knows who I am.

822
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:18,795
Yeon told me

823
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,006
that you can't kill me.

824
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:26,219
He's right.

825
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,850
I'm quite fond of you.

826
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:24,795
Mom.

827
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:29,508
Dad.

828
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,558
He wanted to give a warning.

829
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:21,852
I promise I'll save you.

830
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,021
So you'll attack the serpent head-on?

831
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:25,731
I'm going to find his weakness.

832
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,192
I'll kill everyone dear to you.

833
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:30,486
There will be a bigger disaster.

834
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:31,779
Don't lay a finger on them.

835
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:34,448
Take a good look. I'm you.

836
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,617
What about Ji-a? Where is she?

837
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,202
An epidemic will break out.

838
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:40,705
No one will dare to be happy.

839
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:42,123
Why, Ji-a? Why?

840
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:44,709
Bring everything back to its place.

841
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:50,798
