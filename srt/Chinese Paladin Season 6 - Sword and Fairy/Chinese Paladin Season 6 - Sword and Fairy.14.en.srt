=Episode 14=

21
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:06,759
Someone is following us.

22
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,999
Jinzhao, what do you think
the relationship between the person

23
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:14,640
behind Mrs. Shi and Mr. Lin is?

24
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,439
Catch that person, and we'll know.

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Everyone, relax.

26
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:21,599
Shifang and Miss Ming will assist us.

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,280
It's right ahead.

28
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,079
Let's go.

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,680
Miss Ming, Jinzhao
and the others have already gone in.

30
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,840
Why haven't the people
of the Qiyuan Sect arrived yet?

31
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,160
No hurry.

32
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,640
Here they come.

33
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,640
He carries the same scale
as Miss Shuo Xuan.

34
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,919
He is Lin Yuan.

35
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,680
Something's fishy.

36
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,960
This is the place marked on the map.

37
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,400
Since they've lured us here,

38
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,000
why don't they show up and kill us?

39
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,080
As expected,
these are the Dragon Crystals.

40
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,720
Have they changed their plan?

41
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,360
Interesting.

42
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:46,000
Now, I can't feel the one
who was following us.

43
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,520
But Lin Yuan has appeared.

44
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,440
Mr. Lin, how come you're here?

45
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:02,319
Why are you here?

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,520
What a coincidence.

47
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,039
I saw you all entering the mine.

48
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,520
I was worried about your safety,

49
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,640
so I followed to check.

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,679
As long as you're safe, that's good.

51
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,919
Yue, Qi,

52
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:18,679
what's this for?

53
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,280
Mr. Lin, we already know you're a demon.

54
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,039
Mr. Lin, did you
know about our past all along

55
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,319
and have been deceiving us?

56
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,039
There are some misunderstandings.

57
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,080
Let's take this outside.

58
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:32,880
Mr. Lin, please tell us the truth.

59
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,600
Enough talk. Just take him down.

60
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,240
Qi.

61
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,720
Oh, no.

62
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:24,399
They're still inside.

63
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,799
Miss Ming, could you please
think of something?

64
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,639
Qi!

65
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,760
Jinzhao, are you alright?

66
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:03,880
Yes.

67
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,280
Crawl out slowly.

68
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,280
Jinzhao!

69
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,559
Jinzhao.

70
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,320
Jinzhao?

71
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,959
Jinzhao, are you alright?

72
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
Are you injured?

73
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,839
Xian Qing, I'm fine.

74
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,679
How about you? Are you hurt?

75
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
I can feel that you are hurt.

76
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,519
I'm really fine.

77
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:16,280
Don't rush.

78
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,280
I'll remove these rocks now

79
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:19,200
to get you out.

80
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:19,920
Wait.

81
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,559
There was a collapse just now.

82
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,000
If we use force to remove them,

83
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:25,119
there might be another one.

84
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,639
It won't be good
if it endangers Yue and Miss Yue.

85
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,239
It's your nature
to always consider others first

86
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,000
that worries me the most.

87
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,880
Jinzhao, wake up.

88
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,519
Wake up.

89
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,519
Jinzhao,

90
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:25,359
I thought you were dead.

91
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,839
Jinzhao!

92
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,760
Why are you coughing blood?

93
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,440
Just because I was pinned by a stone.

94
00:09:41,239 --> 00:09:42,440
I will be better soon.

95
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Jinzhao, hang in there.

96
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,839
I will definitely get you out of here.

97
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,399
Silly, I'm not dead.

98
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,440
What are you crying for?

99
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,600
I'll help you up.

100
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,239
Qi.

101
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,959
Do you remember?

102
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,119
What?

103
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,920
After we woke up in the Wuyan Village,

104
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,160
I came to the same mine

105
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,079
to earn travel expenses.

106
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,800
There was a collapse too.

107
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,399

145
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,160
you already saved me once.

thank goodness

148
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,560
you didn't leave me.

we've always been by each other's side.

to you?

Qi.

00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:53,480
Jinzhao, let's go.

156
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,759
Let's go.

157
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:05,920
- Zhaoyan.
- Xian Qing.

158
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:10,560
I am here.

159
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,240
I am here too.

160
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,479
- Qi, Jinzhao.
- Zhaoyan.

161
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:26,920
- How are you two?
- Where is Senior Xian Qing?

162
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,160
Zhaoyan, Jinzhao seems injured.

163
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,040
Do you have a way to move these stones?

164
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,240
Dou Bao!

165
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,480
Jinzhao, Little Yue.

166
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:43,999
Ming Xiu, Shifang.

167
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,240
Dou Bao.

168
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,959
- Let's go.
- Go.

169
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,959
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

170
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,240
Hurry up.

171
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,199
That was close.

172
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,959
This time, credit goes to Dou Bao.

173
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,319

It works faster.

Thanks.

175
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,480
Are you injured?

176
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:36,959
It's not serious.

177
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,519
Thank you for saving me just now.

178
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,839
Zhao Yan, you're too polite with me.

179
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:45,120
No.

180
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:48,079
How are you?

181
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,600
I'm fine, Miss Ming. Thank you.

182
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,600
How are you now?

183
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,480
Better.

184
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,920
Jinzhao.

185
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:07,839
I'll answer

186
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:09,959
your question

187
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,959
when it's only us.

188
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,399
I didn't expect this visit
to the Wuyan Village

189
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:32,720
would not only yield nothing

190
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,280
but almost cost us our lives.

191
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,920
But it's not true that we got nothing.

192
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,280
Mr. Lin.

193
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,720
Lin Yuan.

194
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:52,800
Come on.

195
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,560
How could you have
someone attack them like that?

196
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,879
Commander Ge, I had
no intention of taking their lives.

197
00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:00,600
I just wanted to trap them in the cave

198
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:03,040
to buy time to transport
the last batch of the Dragon Crystals.

199
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,759
But General Lin Yuan suddenly appeared.

200
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,199
He must have followed us here.

201
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,519
The Sea of Clear Skies must have known
we are collecting the Dragon Crystals

202
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,999
and will intensify
the vigilance against us.

203
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,639
It's my failure.

204
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,879
I must return immediately

205
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,600
to report this matter
to my eldest brother.

206
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,240
Now that the Dragon Crystals
have been fully collected,

207
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:28,199
you can withdraw
to the Yujie Hub immediately.

208
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,759
Yes.

209
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:31,560
Alright.

210
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,120
Help me pack it.

211
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,160
Mr. Lin.

212
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:49,639
Where am I?

213
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,519
Just confess.

214
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,160
What should I confess?

215
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,519
It's killing me with pain.

216
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,759
What's your relationship with Shuo Xuan?

217
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,480
What are you talking about?

218
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,920
I have no idea what you mean.

219
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,199
Who is Shuo Xuan?

220
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:30,360
You demon.

221
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,079
You aren't gonna tell us?

222
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,480
It seems I can't hide it anymore.

223
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:41,519
Young lord,

224
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,240
please forgive my earlier rudeness.

225
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,240
Me?

226
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,999
Qi is actually the young lord
of our Yu Clan.

227
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,280
Yu?

228
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,240
What?

229
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,639
The Y-Yu Clan?

230
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,920
We are sea demons
living in the Sea of Clear Skies.

231
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,800
Miss Yue is a demon?

232
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,920
But Little Yue has no demonic aura.

233
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,119
Her Lordship of Yu Clan, Zhu Yu,

234
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:09,440
is a mythical beast

235
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,239
that has existed since ancient times.

236
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,800
You can't compare him
to any other demons.

237
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,239
You say Qi is your Lordship's child.

238
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:21,519
Why did you abandon her
in the Mortal Realm,

239
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:24,080
completely ignoring her for three years?

240
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,879
This is Her Lordship's punishment
for you,

241
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,639
so you ended up being a mortal

242
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,599
stranded in the Mortal Realm.

243
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:34,840
Punishment?

244
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:38,680
D-Did Little Yue do anything wrong?

245
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,399
We have a forbidden technique

246
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,840
called the Husheng Spell.

247
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:45,999
If it's cast on someone,

248
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:50,200
that person will lose the memory

249
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,040
and the previous personality
will be erased.

250
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:54,160
From then on,

251
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,336
this person must live for the one
who used the technique

252
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,280
and protect that one

253
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,200
their whole life.

254
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,519
Losing the personality and memory,

255
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,479
and living only
for another person from then on.

256
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:13,800
Yes, three years ago, our young lord

257
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,160
traveled in the Mortal Realm.

258
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,639
When passing by Wuyan Village,

259
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,119
she unintentionally used

260
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
the Husheng Spell on a young mortal.

261
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,280
Once this spell is cast,
it can't be undone.

262
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,359
Her Lordship loves you,

263
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,840
but it was such a grave mistake,
so you can't go unpunished.

264
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,960
Thus, Her Lordship erased your memory,

265
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,359
turning you into a whole new person

266
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,519
to better reflect on yourself
in the Mortal Realm.

267
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,920
Could that mortal youth be Yue?

268
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,479
Over these three years,

269
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,960
we've also been asking around
everywhere for Yue's origins.

270
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:48,479
But your background is very mysterious.

271
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,920
It's still unknown to this day.

272
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:51,680
In that case,

273
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:54,280
we could only leave our young lord
and you in this village.

274
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,719
Her Lordship worries about you,

275
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:58,320
so he asked me and Shuo Xuan
to protect you in secret.

276
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,280
Then have you found one

277
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,560
who looks exactly like Jinzhao?

278
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,639
Jinzhao.

279
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,399
I will go to the Sea of Clear Skies.

280
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,119
Well, okay.

281
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,639
Her Lordship misses you a lot.

282
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,879
I'll go too.

283
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:41,519
Then let's go together.

284
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:45,040
Are you all going
to the Demon Realm with the demon?

285
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,280
We are friends first.

286
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,479
The mortal and demon thing comes second.

287
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:53,999
Xiu.

288
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,040
Hanjiang usually can't bear
to scold Xiu.

289
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,960
If he knew Xiu had
no concern for companions,

290
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,800
it would be me who got rebuked.

291
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:49,440
You're annoying!

292
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,440
No, I'm not.

293
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,359
You finally smiled.

294
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:24,639
I'm not talking to you.

295
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:26,680
You're doing it, aren't you?

296
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,239
I know

297
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,519
that your mother was killed by a demon.

298
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,320
For years, you have been persistent
in eradicating demons.

299
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,960
That's because I was young then.

300
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,239
I couldn't protect her.

301
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,999
But now, I absolutely will not allow
demons to do wrong before me.

302
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:46,399
But, Xiu,

303
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:48,680
you want to eradicate demons,

304
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,280
but you always refuse
to understand them.

305
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:56,160
Do you know that if you want to win,
you must know yourself and your enemy?

306
00:23:59,359 --> 00:23:59,960
Quibbling.

307
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:03,800
Later in the Yu Clan's turf,

308
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,800
you must restrain your temper.

309
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:08,719
I know. I'm not an idiot.

310
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,119
Aren't you?

311
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:12,920
You!

312
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:31,840
Jinzhao.

313
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,479
If what Mr. Lin,

314
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:41,160
no, what Lin Yuan said is true,

315
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,920
then I am

316
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,999
the reason you lost your memory.

317
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,840
I'm sorry.

318
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,519
Silly, haven't you also said

319
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,160
that his words might not be true?

320
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,040
Everyone, look!

321
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:00,879
What is that?

322
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:12,888
(Sea of Clear Skies,
Yu Clan's home on Kun's spine)

323
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,999
Oh my, am I seeing this right?

324
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,119
A city floats in the sky!

325
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:24,920
You're right.

326
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:28,359
That is the Sea of Clear Skies,

327
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,320
our home.

328
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,119
I'll go call Xian Qing and Miss Ming.

329
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:41,719
Is this really my home?

330
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,080
It seems a bit desolate.

331
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,280
The Sea of Clear Skies

332
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:01,359
was once the pearl of the sea.

333
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,599
But over a decade ago,
it faced great disaster

334
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,200
causing great harm to our clan.

335
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,479
Up to now,

336
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:09,840
we have all been recuperating.

337
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:12,920
What kind of great disaster was it?

338
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,920
Young lord, you will learn of it.

339
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,200
Hello.

340
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,599
Shifang,

341
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,040
this is a ritual unique
to the women of our clan.

342
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:32,999
But you're a man.

343
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,800
Is Miss Shuo Xuan also here?

344
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,119
I never knew you had
a romantic side, Mr. Ju.

345
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
Shifang, so there's someone

346
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,560
who you've got feelings for here.

347
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,920
When we get to the great hall,

348
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,560
you will meet Her Lordship.

349
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,359
As well as Shuo Xuan.

350
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,359
Please.

351
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,560
This is the entrance.

352
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,639
Everyone, follow me.

353
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:25,200
Miss Shuo Xuan.

354
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,840
It's been a while.

355
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,320
Your Lordship.

356
00:27:37,211 --> 00:27:38,488
(Lord Zhu Yu of the Yu Clan)

357
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:47,239
(General Lin Yuan of Yu Clan)

358
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:50,160
This is Zhu Yu, the Lord of Yu Clan.

359
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,119
What a familiar feeling.

360
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:58,719
Qi.

361
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,840
You

362
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,479
are my mother?

363
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,359
It hurts?

364
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:03,840
Not anymore.

365
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:11,920
Qi, you are growing.

366
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:13,399
Young lord,

367
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:16,999
the bloodline of Kun flows within you.

368
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,639
Now scales have begun to appear.

369
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:22,280
That indicates your
mythical beast's power has awakened.

370
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,519
Kun.

371
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:27,800
In the North Sea,
there is a fish by the name of Kun.

372
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,320
Are you really Qi's biological mother?

373
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,920
Qi is my own flesh and blood.

374
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,960
Then, am I

375
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,200
truly Qi's Husheng?

376
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:56,840
Your Lordship,

377
00:29:57,639 --> 00:29:59,200
my bad for letting them know about

378
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,680
the Husheng Spell
without your permission.

379
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,560
I will personally explain this later
to the young lord and Yue.

380
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,440
This matter concerns our secrets.

381
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,680
Please come this way.

382
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:14,560
Alright.

383
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,999
Then we will take our leave.

384
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:20,119
Shuo Xuan,

385
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,759
take them to the guest rooms.

386
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:29,960
Follow me.

387
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:37,920
I don't believe what you said.

388
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:39,999
Any evidence?

389
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,040
Yue,

390
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:48,599
the resonance of your energy
with the young lord's

391
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:49,999
is the best proof.

392
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,639
And power resonance is mutual.

393
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:57,960
Previously, our young lord was young

394
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,320
and lacked sufficient power,

395
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,920
so your power was activated

396
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:03,920
to protect her.

00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,040
Young Lord!

400
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,519
(Xi Luo, Zhu Yu's attendant)
Her Lordship knew you would return

401
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,440
and specially prepared
a welcoming ceremony.

402
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:44,960
You've been away for three years.

403
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:48,119
Everyone is waiting to see you.

404
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,680
Qi,

405
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,800
it's a joyous thing to find your family.

406
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,479
Stay with your mother.

407
00:32:29,912 --> 00:32:30,960
By Her Lordship's command,

408
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,920
ensure the young lord is dressed up
before the welcoming ceremony.

409
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,999
Why must I dress up like this?

410
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:43,519
Because you are to attend
the welcoming ceremony.

411
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,599
I don't want to attend any ceremony.

412
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,119
I'm going to find Jinzhao.

413
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:53,960
Are you referring to that young mortal?

414
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,479
Do you want him
to be your future prince consort?

415
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,119
Prince consort?

416
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,840
Your prince consort

417
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,359
will be forever with you.

418
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:12,119
You will share happiness
and suffering together.

419
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,999
I want Jinzhao to be my prince consort.

420
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,800
I want to be with him forever.

421
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,680
It's just that I don't know
if he wants to.

422
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,960
To my knowledge,
nobody refuses to be a prince consort.

423
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,719
Really?

424
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,719
And it doesn't matter
even if he doesn't want to.

425
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,320
In our territory,

426
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,200
we will surely find

427
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,680
a perfect prince consort for you.

428
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,999
No need. I only want Jinzhao.

429
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,599
Jinzhao.

430
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,920
Jinzhao, would you like
to be my prince consort?

431
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,599
Xi Luo says my prince consort

432
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,999
can be with me forever

433
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,599
and that we'd share happiness
and face hardships together.

434
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,040
If you'd like to be my prince consort,

435
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:32,879
we'll be together forever.

436
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,399
Now we have money and status.

437
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:42,999
We can have ten eggs
with a bowl of noodles.

438
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,560
Jinzhao, what's wrong?

439
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,599
Are you thinking about
the Husheng thing?

440
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,040
It's alright.
I'll be your Husheng from now on.

441
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,920
I will protect you.

442
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,280
I just want

443
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,280
to be with you as Yue Jinzhao.

444
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,040
Are you blaming me

445
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:25,840
for making you lose your memory?

446
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:27,879
Of course not.

447
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,399
Back in the mine,

448
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:33,639
my only thought

449
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
was to be with you forever.

450
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,479
But...

451
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:43,680
Now I'm no longer certain.

452
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,920
Not certain about what?

453
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,519
Not certain

454
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,560
whether my feelings for you are true

455
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:59,560
or just the result of the Husheng Spell.

456
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:09,239
We're like blossoms side by side,
connected but with separate roots.

457
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:14,679
Are our feelings fake?

458
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:17,800
They are of course real.

Your Lordship,

00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,679
the Qiyuan Sect's strongholds
were successively destroyed.

466
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,360
I found it suspicious,

467
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:55,560
so I followed Ge Qingfei
of the Hengdao Sect to Wuyan Village.

468
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:59,239
But unexpectedly, my identity was exposed
by Yue Jinzhao and the others.

469
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:02,400
To guard the truth,

470
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:05,479
I had no choice but to falsely invent
a spell called Husheng.

471
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,519
Please punish me, My Lord.

472
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,360
It's alright. If not for this,

473
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,400
I would not be able to see Qi again.

474
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,999
It's just that she mustn't
know the truth yet.
