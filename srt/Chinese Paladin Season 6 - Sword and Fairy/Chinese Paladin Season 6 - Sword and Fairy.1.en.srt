=Sword and Fairy=

20
00:01:58,023 --> 00:02:02,328
Legend has it that Lord Ming
is the ancient behemoth Kun.

21
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:06,366
It roams the world above the clouds

22
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:09,607
(Tea houses and restaurants)
and has the power to destroy the world.

23
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:13,816
The human cult Qiyuan Sect
reveres Lord Ming

24
00:02:13,906 --> 00:02:15,467
and brings calamity to humanity.

25
00:02:15,707 --> 00:02:17,986
The major sects led by the Luo Mansion

26
00:02:17,986 --> 00:02:20,027
search everywhere for Lord Ming,

27
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:21,666
wishing to vanquish it.

28
00:02:22,427 --> 00:02:24,986
Lord Ming, having absorbed
a vast amount of dark energy,

29
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:26,386
is about to lose control.

30
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:30,706
Many civilians who believe in
the Qiyuan Sect are petrified.

31
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:34,066
A great catastrophe
is imminent upon the world.

32
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:40,852
(Yujie Hub, guardians of the Six Realms,
territory of the Hengdao Sect)

00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:42,546
It's about time.

34
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:44,467
Huan,

35
00:02:45,026 --> 00:02:46,467
seal away Qi's memories

36
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:48,346
and send her to the Mortal Realm.

37
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:54,546
The hope of saving all beings
in the future

38
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:56,746
is now entrusted to her.

39
00:03:58,187 --> 00:03:59,787
Master, I know it's you.

40
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,066
Master, stop hiding.

41
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:05,947
Come out.

42
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:16,186
Has Commander Ying

43
00:04:16,186 --> 00:04:17,507
agreed to take us to the human world?

44
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:24,706
Master, what's wrong with you?

45
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:26,346
You're acting so strange today.

46
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:31,266
Qi,

47
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:33,787
your sword originates from thoughts.

48
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:35,706
Do you know your mission
behind that sword?

49
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:40,667
My mission behind the sword?

50
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:43,587
Does carrying a sword
mean I must kill people?

51
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:46,427
But I don't want to kill anyone.

52
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,466
Master, what do you want to do?

53
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:05,266
Master, what are you going to do?

54
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:15,380
=Episode 1=

55
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:18,626
Master, I know it's you.

56
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:21,147
Master, stop hiding.

57
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:22,027
Come out.

58
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:23,587
Qi.

59
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:25,867
Qi.

60
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:27,427
Qi.

61
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,826
Qi, wake up.

62
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:37,546
Awake?

63
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:41,706
Yue...

64
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:43,466
Jin...

65
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:47,986
zhao!

66
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:49,986
What?

67
00:05:50,186 --> 00:05:51,027
Why did you pinch me?

68
00:05:51,572 --> 00:05:52,806
(Yue Qi)

69
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,587
I dreamt of my master again.

70
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:56,106
If you had not suddenly interrupted,

71
00:05:56,427 --> 00:05:58,227
I would have seen clearly
what he looked like.

72
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:00,387
Enough. You say this every time.

73
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:01,986
If you could,
you'd have seen him clearly.

74
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:04,227
I guess your master
doesn't exist at all.

75
00:06:05,106 --> 00:06:06,867
How can you say that?

76
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,466
If he doesn't exist,

77
00:06:08,587 --> 00:06:10,427
where did I learn those moves from?

78
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:14,666
Yue Qi,

79
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:17,867
I took care of you
with great hardship for three years,

80
00:06:18,406 --> 00:06:19,608
(Yue Jinzhao)
but I can't hold a candle

81
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:21,187
(Yue Jinzhao)
to your faceless master.

82
00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:29,266
Be gentle.

83
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:30,467
Don't use violence.

84
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,506
I'll use violence.

85
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:34,986
I will.

86
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,826
I'll hit you.

87
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:38,706
I am your elder brother.

88
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,347
Who says you're older than me?

89
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:46,027
3 years ago, when we woke up
in Wuyan Village,

90
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:46,666
both of us

91
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,506
didn't remember what happened before.

92
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:50,027
And it was you who said

93
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:51,826
that our birthdays were on the same day.

94
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,506
You don't understand

95
00:06:55,506 --> 00:06:56,627
anything else

96
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:58,386
but you remember this clearly.

97
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:00,666
Well,

98
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,067
today is the 14th day
of the 7th month, our birthday.

99
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:05,147
So, what should we eat?

100
00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:06,266
Egg noodles.

101
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:07,106
Let's go.

102
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:10,867
Here, enjoy your meal.

103
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,226
A bowl of egg noodles, please.

104
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:17,347
Without green onions.

105
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:18,067
Okay!

106
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:24,266
Qi, your hair rope is so worn out.

107
00:07:24,706 --> 00:07:25,427
Let's replace it.

108
00:07:25,907 --> 00:07:26,666
I can't throw it.

109
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:28,907
I was wearing it when I woke up.

110
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:31,106
It might be related to my background.

111
00:07:31,386 --> 00:07:33,106
Maybe it was really given by my master.

112
00:07:33,506 --> 00:07:35,307
I really do hope you have a master.

113
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:37,307
That way, we would have
a clue about our origins.

114
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:38,986
I really did dream of him.

115
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:42,347
It's just that, in my dream,

116
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:44,347
I couldn't see his face.

117
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,826
Nor could I remember what he said.

118
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:49,467
But,

119
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:51,307
I was thinking,

120
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:52,907
- thinking...
- Your noodles.

121
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:53,506
Thinking what?

122
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:57,266
Enjoy.

123
00:07:58,147 --> 00:07:59,347
I must be hungry.

124
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:01,106
What for?

125
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:06,427
Jinzhao, you said
you were older than me.

126
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,986
Show me some love.

127
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:09,907
The same old rules.

128
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,027
Whoever grabs it eats it.

129
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:52,067
You said it.

130
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:53,946
Whoever grabs it first eats it.

131
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,307
You eat it.

132
00:08:58,467 --> 00:08:59,307
Why aren't you eating?

133
00:09:01,347 --> 00:09:03,706
Jinzhao, are you serious?

134
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:06,867
Do you have to use Mindlink
to snatch an egg?

135
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,268
(Sichuan Pepper Powder)

136
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:33,467
You're cheating.
You've learned to be bad.

137
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:35,546
I learned that from you.

138
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,106
This bowl of noodles is mine now.

139
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,467
Why do you love egg noodles so much?

140
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:53,427
Because it is the first food

141
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,546
you made for me.

142
00:09:58,627 --> 00:09:59,106
Qi,

143
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:01,666
eat slower.

144
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:03,386
Leave some soup for me.

145
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:11,187
Come on.

146
00:10:15,307 --> 00:10:16,187
I drew this last night.

147
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:18,187
This is the person I saw
with my left eye.

148
00:10:19,506 --> 00:10:21,067
What a scratch.

149
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:21,627
What?

150
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:23,347
Scratch?

151
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:25,386
This captures both
the person's looks and vibe, okay?

152
00:10:27,347 --> 00:10:28,466
It can ward off evil.

153
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:32,947
Stop kidding around.

154
00:10:33,827 --> 00:10:34,786
Compared to your dream,

155
00:10:34,986 --> 00:10:36,427
my left eye is more reliable.

156
00:10:36,747 --> 00:10:38,146
Every time the trail goes cold,

157
00:10:38,427 --> 00:10:39,067
my left eye

158
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:41,026
always manages to foresee something,

159
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:42,026
although...

160
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:45,986
Although the price of seeing the future
is intense pain in your left eye.

161
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,146
I could recite these words
of yours by heart by now.

162
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:50,586
Why do you care?

163
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,267
Anyway, this time in Yinghui Fort,

164
00:10:53,507 --> 00:10:54,827
we have to find this man in red.

165
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:55,546
No matter what,

166
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:57,427
we must find him.

167
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,948
(Yinghui Fort)

168
00:11:20,387 --> 00:11:21,026
Jinzhao,

169
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:23,986
you haven't given me
this year's birthday present yet.

170
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:28,586
It's all yours.

171
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:31,187
Why are you so generous today?

172
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:39,666
Yue Jinzhao,

173
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,586
you don't want

174
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:41,986
to give me a birthday present, right?

175
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:44,346
No, I'm out of money.

176
00:11:44,546 --> 00:11:46,226
If we keep going like this,
we will go bankrupt.

177
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:47,466
You see.

178
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:48,427
Hotel costs aside,

179
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:50,546
last night we had
two large bowls of beef noodles.

180
00:11:50,546 --> 00:11:51,466
That was eight coins.

181
00:11:51,947 --> 00:11:52,947
You are a glutton,

182
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:54,307
and we spent another five coins.

183
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:57,106
Lastly, you took a chestnut cake.

184
00:11:57,226 --> 00:11:58,187
Most importantly,

185
00:11:58,387 --> 00:12:00,827
you were still hungry and ate
another two bowls of egg noodles.

186
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,707
We're out of money.

187
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:05,827
So,

188
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:07,507
we must first find this person.

189
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:08,346
I've calculated it.

190
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:09,867
With our pace,

191
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:10,986
within one hour,

192
00:12:10,986 --> 00:12:12,546
we can run through
the entire Yinghui Fort.

193
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:16,346
Although it's a foolish method.

194
00:12:17,586 --> 00:12:18,747
Then you come up with a smart way.

195
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:21,226
Let's go.

196
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:24,827
Start from this point

197
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:26,067
and meet here in one hour.

198
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:28,026
Got it. You're unlovable.

199
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:34,026
Have a look.

200
00:12:34,026 --> 00:12:35,747
Top-notch jewelry.

201
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:36,586
Lady.

202
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:37,226
Sir,

203
00:12:38,267 --> 00:12:39,427
how much is this?

204
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:40,867
10 coins.

205
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:42,747
10 coins?

206
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,346
More expensive
than two bowls of beef noodles.

207
00:12:57,786 --> 00:13:00,387
That annoying guy didn't give me money.

208
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:03,412
(Recruiting mourners, providing
three meals, 10 coins per day)

209
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,827
Recruiting mourners,

210
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:09,226
providing three meals,

211
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:10,986
10 coins a day.

212
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:15,387
I want to make money.

213
00:13:15,947 --> 00:13:16,546
Alright.

214
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:17,666
Just try crying.

215
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:18,586
Okay.

216
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:26,747
I can't cry.

217
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:27,666
How do I cry?

218
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:29,627
Just cry like you did when your family

219
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:30,466
died.

220
00:13:30,546 --> 00:13:31,387
I don't have a family.

221
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:32,827
You don't have a family.

222
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:33,627
Isn't that very pitiful?

223
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:34,827
But I've got Jinzhao.

224
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:35,427
Not pitiful at all.

225
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:35,546
Not pitiful at all.

226
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:37,906
By the way, after a person dies,

227
00:13:37,906 --> 00:13:39,187
they enter the cycle of reincarnation,

228
00:13:39,187 --> 00:13:40,267
which means starting over again.

229
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:41,226
Why should I cry?

230
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:45,267
This girl doesn't seem
like a normal person.

231
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,867
Walk away, lady.

232
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:51,387
Oh, no! The horse is spooked!

233
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:52,226
Oh, no! The horse is spooked!

234
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:14,427
Are you alright?

235
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:17,827
Child, are you okay?

236
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:19,832
(Luo Zhaoyan, the head of the Luo family)
Thank you very much.

237
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:21,067
Thank her.

238
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,226
Master, are you okay?

239
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:24,267
Go check if there are any casualties

240
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:25,867
and check the damage to the shops.

241
00:14:26,146 --> 00:14:26,627
Yes.

242
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:35,747
Sorry, lady.

243
00:14:36,187 --> 00:14:37,427
That horse belongs to my family.

244
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:38,786
It got startled just now.

245
00:14:39,106 --> 00:14:40,586
Thank you for your help.

246
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,387
Red clothes.

247
00:14:43,906 --> 00:14:44,986
High ponytail.

248
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,187
Lady?

249
00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:02,586
But you are much prettier
than the picture.

250
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:08,786
This is a thank-you gift.

251
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:09,586
Please accept it.

252
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:12,307
Thank you, sir.

253
00:15:12,507 --> 00:15:13,747
You are so generous,

254
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,827
but ten coins will be enough for me.

255
00:15:18,346 --> 00:15:19,346
This is what you deserve

256
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,466
for your kindness.

257
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,507
I gotta go. Goodbye.

258
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:33,867
There are no white ones left.

259
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,187
This green one is okay, right?

260
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:37,827
O great Lord Ming,
blessings upon all beings.

261
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:40,067
Our sect serves Lord Ming

262
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:41,427
and makes people happy.

263
00:15:41,427 --> 00:15:43,707
Anyone who asks shall receive.

264
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:44,627
Don't you agree?

265
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:45,827
(Exquisite Fans)
Anyone shall receive?

266
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:47,827
- We tell the masses...
- Let me go take a look.

267
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:49,947
(Can they help me and Jinzhao)

268
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:51,986
(find our origins?)

269
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:55,906
- May Lord Ming bless us.
- May Lord Ming bless us.

270
00:15:55,906 --> 00:15:58,546
Mr. Meng, why aren't the two persons
Lord Shengxuan invited

271
00:15:58,786 --> 00:15:59,666
here yet?

272
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:00,986
What's the rush?

273
00:16:06,026 --> 00:16:09,346
The faith in Lord Ming is very strong.

274
00:16:09,627 --> 00:16:11,307
He is now traveling the world

275
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:14,106
and blessing us all from afar.

276
00:16:14,387 --> 00:16:17,546
We should even pay
more homage to Lord Ming.

277
00:16:17,906 --> 00:16:19,466
- May Lord Ming bless us.
- May Lord Ming bless us.

278
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,026
Hasn't one just arrived?

279
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:23,586
- May Lord Ming bless us.
- May Lord Ming bless us.

280
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:25,666
You appear to be unfamiliar.

281
00:16:26,307 --> 00:16:28,346
Is it your first time
hearing about our sect?

282
00:16:28,827 --> 00:16:29,707
Who are you?

283
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:31,067
(Meng Cheng, an emissary of the Qiyuan Sect)
I am Meng Cheng.

284
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:33,067
I am an emissary of the Qiyuan Sect.

285
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:36,146
I have forgotten my past.

286
00:16:36,307 --> 00:16:37,507
Can you tell me about it?

287
00:16:38,786 --> 00:16:41,146
That's a piece of cake.

288
00:16:42,387 --> 00:16:43,427
To tell you the truth,

289
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,867
I am proficient in magic spells.

290
00:16:46,307 --> 00:16:47,267
Magic spells?

291
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,707
Can you tell me about my origins?

292
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:52,986
Please wait.

293
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:05,427
We agreed to meet here.

294
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,546
Where did Qi go?

295
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:15,267
Qi is over there.

296
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:22,747
I see it.

297
00:17:23,947 --> 00:17:25,586
You must come from
a rich or noble family,

298
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:27,947
and you sneaked out to have fun
without your family's knowledge.

299
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:33,187
You are wrong.

300
00:17:33,627 --> 00:17:35,026
If I were of wealth or nobility,

301
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:36,707
why haven't my family
come looking for me?

302
00:17:37,586 --> 00:17:38,546
Well,

303
00:17:39,707 --> 00:17:41,427
haven't you forgotten
all about your past?

304
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:42,827
How do you know I'm wrong then?

305
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:43,786
Moreover,

306
00:17:44,026 --> 00:17:46,067
our Lord Ming is omniscient

307
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:47,666
toward all matters in the world.

308
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:49,267
He certainly cannot be wrong.

309
00:17:52,986 --> 00:17:55,346
Then tell me, where is my family now?

310
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,026
Lady, your faith is insufficient.

311
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:00,986
I can't divine any further for you.

312
00:18:02,546 --> 00:18:03,827
You simply don't know.

313
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:05,106
Not so.

314
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:08,586
Insufficient faith means
that your merit is still not much.

315
00:18:09,187 --> 00:18:10,106
But today,

316
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:12,947
if you offer a small amount
of gold and silver to Lord Ming,

317
00:18:12,947 --> 00:18:14,827
you can increase
your connection with him.

318
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:16,867
Then I will be able to divine for you.

319
00:18:19,786 --> 00:18:20,106
Look,

320
00:18:20,947 --> 00:18:22,707
so many people are accumulating merits.

321
00:18:23,026 --> 00:18:23,786
You should go now,

322
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:25,707
or it'll be too late.

323
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:35,627
Believe the Qiyuan Sect
for Lord Ming's blessing.

324
00:18:35,627 --> 00:18:37,387
Pay homage to Lord Ming
to accumulate merits.

325
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:40,546
Pay homage to Lord Ming.

326
00:18:42,267 --> 00:18:42,747
Lady,

327
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:44,026
I've been investigating this sect.

328
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:44,986
The so-called merits

329
00:18:44,986 --> 00:18:46,466
are just a means
for them to collect money.

330
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:47,307
Don't trust them.

331
00:18:47,546 --> 00:18:48,346
Nonsense.

332
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,666
They bring benefits to us.

333
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:50,707
We make these donations

334
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:52,067
voluntarily to Lord Ming.

335
00:18:52,546 --> 00:18:52,906
Yes.

336
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:54,586
- Yes.
- We do it voluntarily.

337
00:18:54,786 --> 00:18:55,827
- It's voluntary.
- Voluntary.

338
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:13,688
(Yunlai Inn)

339
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:18,520
(Yunlai Inn)

340
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:21,546
Let's set off.

341
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,107
Go.

342
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:23,707
(It's him.)

343
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:25,427
(He is key to our search
for our background.)

344
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:27,187
(We must find a way to gain his trust.)

345
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:28,067
Your merit is respectable.

346
00:19:32,146 --> 00:19:34,307
This person slanders our sect
with malicious intent.

347
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:35,227
Stop him!

348
00:19:35,227 --> 00:19:35,746
Stop him!

349
00:19:35,746 --> 00:19:36,427
That's right.

350
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:38,987
How could the Qiyuan Sect
be slandered at will?

351
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:39,947
Who is this?

352
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:40,987
Jinzhao.

353
00:19:45,587 --> 00:19:46,266
Who might you be?

354
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:48,866
I am just an ordinary man

355
00:19:49,187 --> 00:19:51,026
who rights wrongs, promotes goodness

356
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:55,347
and is determined
to uphold the honor of the sect.

357
00:19:55,947 --> 00:19:56,866
Mr. Meng,

358
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,266
isn't this another person
from the portrait?

359
00:19:59,987 --> 00:20:01,427
Isn't this a good thing?

360
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:03,506
(Making your wishes come true,
ascend soon with eternal peace)

361
00:20:03,506 --> 00:20:04,666
Take it easy.

362
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:07,987
This young man really speaks the truth.

363
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:12,947
All thanks to Lord Ming's blessing.

364
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:13,707
That's correct.

365
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,866
- May Lord Ming bless us.
- May Lord Ming bless us.

366
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:25,587
- May Lord Ming bless us.
- May Lord Ming bless us.

367
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,987
I have come all this way in pursuit

368
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:28,626
and have seen
the Qiyuan Sect harming lives.

369
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:29,906
Lord Ming is the chief culprit.

370
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,427
You apostles
are also guilty of great evil.

371
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:36,266
You keep insulting the Qiyuan Sect.

372
00:20:36,587 --> 00:20:37,626
You are the one to blame.

373
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:39,707
Mr. Meng,

374
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:41,666
I will teach him a good lesson.

375
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,666
Good. May Lord Ming bless you.

376
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:45,307
He'll help you punish this hellion.

377
00:20:46,107 --> 00:20:47,666
Sir, why not join our sect

378
00:20:47,786 --> 00:20:48,707
and you may ascend?

379
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:50,386
Is it a real fight, Jinzhao?

380
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:51,987
Of course. Let's go.

381
00:21:15,987 --> 00:21:16,506
Jinzhao.

382
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:25,396
(Yunlai Inn)

383
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:50,266
Jinzhao.

384
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:51,146
This place is dangerous.

385
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:52,707
Mr. Meng, please retreat.

386
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:53,947
Alright.

387
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:54,866
Wait a moment.

388
00:21:55,386 --> 00:21:56,746
You said to let us join the sect.

389
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:57,427
Is that true?

390
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:59,347
I'll wait for you
at the Fujin Hall later.

391
00:21:59,347 --> 00:22:01,427
Good. Wait until I'm done
with this audacious man.

392
00:22:06,707 --> 00:22:07,187
Take this.

393
00:22:12,216 --> 00:22:13,556
(Tavern)

394
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:23,476
(Cakes)

395
00:22:44,506 --> 00:22:46,827
(This girl is so strong.)

396
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,107
Qi, stop.

397
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:56,746
My apologies for offending you just now.

398
00:22:57,666 --> 00:22:58,307
What do you mean?

399
00:22:59,107 --> 00:23:00,107
The audience has left.

400
00:23:00,107 --> 00:23:00,947
Why keep acting?

401
00:23:03,352 --> 00:23:04,536
(Carriage and Horse Shop)

402
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:07,666
You did it on purpose.

403
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:09,546
Jinzhao is good at acting
and deceiving others.

404
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,307
Don't you feel ashamed?

405
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:12,707
How can you be so gullible?

406
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:13,347
You're really naive.

407
00:23:13,546 --> 00:23:13,746
You're really naive.

408
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,307
Who says I was deceived?

409
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:18,467
The bag just now was filled with stones.

410
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:20,026
Not a single coin in it.

411
00:23:20,427 --> 00:23:21,506
All the coins are here.

412
00:23:22,906 --> 00:23:25,107
Since when did you learn
to play tricks on people?

413
00:23:25,427 --> 00:23:27,546
You were the one
who tricked me with stones first.

414
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:34,427
(Yunlai Inn)
Sorry. Just now, I thought

415
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:35,947
you were really going
to give money to them.

416
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:37,026
No, I wasn't.

417
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:39,546
And I didn't expect
to inadvertently deceive them.

418
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:41,626
You're truly adorable.

419
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:43,546
Good taste.

420
00:23:43,546 --> 00:23:44,546
My name is Yue Qi.

421
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:45,707
This is Yue Jinzhao.

422
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:49,587
My name is Luo Zhaoyan.

423
00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:50,866
The Luo family head?

424
00:23:53,546 --> 00:23:55,546
Although we have been
at Yinghui Fort for only two days,

425
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:57,347
we have heard that for centuries,

426
00:23:57,347 --> 00:23:59,187
your family has been protecting
the nearby residents

427
00:23:59,307 --> 00:23:59,866
and is much loved.

428
00:24:01,227 --> 00:24:02,506
I've heard a storyteller say

429
00:24:02,906 --> 00:24:05,067
that your family is known
as the Twilight Luo Family.

430
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:07,266
Twins in your family all pass away

431
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:09,386
before reaching
their twenties or thirties.

432
00:24:10,227 --> 00:24:10,786
I'm sorry.

433
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:12,227
She's immature

434
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:13,107
and has no filter.

435
00:24:13,307 --> 00:24:13,866
Sorry.

436
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:17,146
It's okay.

437
00:24:17,827 --> 00:24:18,827
Everyone knows it.

438
00:24:19,187 --> 00:24:20,386
I've got used to such words.

439
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:23,187
I'm sorry.

440
00:24:24,427 --> 00:24:24,786
It's okay.

441
00:24:25,746 --> 00:24:26,107
You two.

442
00:24:26,386 --> 00:24:28,146
The Qiyuan Sect schemes
for money and hurts people,

443
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:30,067
but the mastermind,
Lord Ming, stays hidden.

444
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,866
It's a real maze of secrets.

445
00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:34,146
I just saw her talking with Meng Cheng,

446
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:35,307
worried she'd fall for it,

447
00:24:35,427 --> 00:24:36,227
so I took action.

448
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:38,626
How dare they deceive us?

449
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:40,546
Consider it their bad luck.

450
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:42,026
Since our goal is the same,

451
00:24:42,026 --> 00:24:42,987
how about joining forces?

452
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:46,546
They've been gone for a while.

453
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:47,866
Come on, or we won't catch up.

454
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:51,067
Let's join hands.

455
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:54,906
Qi,

456
00:24:56,866 --> 00:24:58,347
he's the one I saw with my left eye.

457
00:25:01,307 --> 00:25:01,707
Watch him.

458
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,546
Okay, I'll definitely keep
a close eye on him.

459
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:05,827
Go.

460
00:25:13,107 --> 00:25:13,746
Miss Yue.

461
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:15,347
What?

462
00:25:17,786 --> 00:25:19,746
Nothing.

463
00:25:21,626 --> 00:25:22,266
Luo,

464
00:25:23,187 --> 00:25:25,067
how old are you, and where is your home?

465
00:25:25,187 --> 00:25:26,026
How many in your family?

466
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:26,906
Are you married?

467
00:25:27,786 --> 00:25:28,786
She doesn't mean that.

468
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:32,187
That's exactly what I mean.

469
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:33,347
Do you know what you're saying?

470
00:25:33,427 --> 00:25:35,746
Am I not asking for his information?

471
00:25:37,347 --> 00:25:37,866
Mr. Yue,

472
00:25:38,947 --> 00:25:39,707
I know

473
00:25:40,546 --> 00:25:42,427
Miss Yue definitely
has no interest in me.

474
00:25:42,947 --> 00:25:44,707
Yes, I'm interested in you.

475
00:25:46,227 --> 00:25:46,546
I...

476
00:25:47,827 --> 00:25:50,146
I-I-I am a boring man.

477
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:51,187
Mr. Luo,

478
00:25:51,827 --> 00:25:52,906
he has entered the Fujin Hall.

479
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:54,626
If we want to find out

480
00:25:54,626 --> 00:25:57,146
whether this is a stronghold
of the Qiyuan Sect,

481
00:25:57,506 --> 00:25:58,746
we have to go in.

482
00:26:00,866 --> 00:26:02,187
It seems you have a clever plan.

483
00:26:02,947 --> 00:26:04,666
I have just gained that person's trust.

484
00:26:05,227 --> 00:26:06,546
I plan to pretend to join them

485
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:07,906
to see if he can take me inside.

486
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,107
But before that,

487
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:10,786
could you lend me some money?

488
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:12,746
This.

489
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:18,427
What about mine?

490
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:19,427
What about hers?

491
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:22,947
It's up to you two.

492
00:26:25,026 --> 00:26:25,786
I'll assist out here.

493
00:26:25,947 --> 00:26:26,987
If you two need me, call me.

494
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:28,626
We will. Let's go.

495
00:26:39,707 --> 00:26:41,107
You almost drove
Luo Zhaoyan away just now.

496
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:41,707
Do you know?

497
00:26:42,786 --> 00:26:44,906
But that's how it's written
in the storybooks.

498
00:26:45,307 --> 00:26:46,827
That's what a matchmaker asks.

499
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:47,947
Are you going to marry him?

500
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:53,307
Luo is dashing and awe-inspiring
with unyielding integrity.

501
00:26:53,626 --> 00:26:55,386
And he gave us two gold leaves.

502
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:57,146
What a good choice for a husband.

503
00:26:57,386 --> 00:26:59,067
His name is Luo Zhaoyan.

504
00:26:59,347 --> 00:27:00,906
You can respectfully
address him as Master Luo

505
00:27:01,026 --> 00:27:02,307
or call him Mr. Luo affectionately

506
00:27:02,427 --> 00:27:03,947
or at least call him Zhaoyan.

507
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:05,347
What does Luo mean?

508
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:06,906
Because it represents his good manners.

509
00:27:13,987 --> 00:27:14,467
Alright.

510
00:27:15,026 --> 00:27:16,786
Since you don't like me
calling him that,

511
00:27:16,786 --> 00:27:18,266
I won't call him that anymore.

512
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:19,467
Nor am I ever gonna ask again,

513
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:20,746
if you don't want me to.

514
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,266
Little flatterer.

515
00:27:29,746 --> 00:27:31,187
He's out. Let's go.

516
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:33,666
Mr. Meng.

517
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,666
May Lord Ming bless us.

518
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:39,666
Seeing you two safe and sound

519
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:40,626
puts me at ease.

520
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,026
Did you punish that villain?

521
00:27:43,707 --> 00:27:45,386
Even though he got something,

522
00:27:45,506 --> 00:27:47,227
we still managed to drive him off.

523
00:27:48,386 --> 00:27:48,947
What's that?

524
00:27:49,107 --> 00:27:50,546
All thanks to Lord Ming's blessing.

525
00:27:50,947 --> 00:27:51,546
Mr. Meng,

526
00:27:51,707 --> 00:27:53,666
you said earlier
you would let us join your sect.

527
00:27:54,026 --> 00:27:54,746
Is that true?

528
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,227
Of course it's true.

529
00:27:56,866 --> 00:27:58,626
You two are truly loyal to Lord Ming.

530
00:27:58,786 --> 00:28:00,347
You will surely receive his grace.

531
00:28:01,427 --> 00:28:02,227
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

532
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:03,866
This is a little token
of my appreciation.

533
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,307
Please accept it.

534
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:07,947
You don't have to.

535
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:13,786
Qi, you're being naughty again.

536
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:16,506
Mr. Meng.

537
00:28:19,347 --> 00:28:20,266
Mr. Meng,

538
00:28:20,626 --> 00:28:23,187
we sincerely wish to join the sect.

539
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:26,266
Since you know things,

540
00:28:27,307 --> 00:28:27,987
follow me.

541
00:28:36,824 --> 00:28:40,276
(Wine)

542
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:43,107
Take care, sir.

543
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:53,506
These flowers look so strange.

544
00:28:55,707 --> 00:28:57,307
Don't just sniff it.
What if it's poisonous?

545
00:28:57,906 --> 00:28:58,307
Let's go.

546
00:29:10,427 --> 00:29:10,906
Qi,

547
00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:14,347
look, these statues
are just like real people.

548
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:15,347
Too eerie.

549
00:29:16,026 --> 00:29:18,026
What craftsmanship!

550
00:29:19,506 --> 00:29:22,227
Each of these stone statues is unique.

551
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,067
So interesting.

552
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:23,587
Don't touch it.

553
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,987
These were the followers
who were fortunate enough to ascend.

554
00:29:29,307 --> 00:29:30,827
These were all real people?

555
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:33,506
Mr. Meng,

556
00:29:34,427 --> 00:29:36,227
this is the ascension
as practiced by our sect?

557
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:41,987
Not just anyone is eligible
and fortunate enough to ascend.

558
00:29:42,587 --> 00:29:44,546
Aside from Director Gao Xiao,

559
00:29:44,666 --> 00:29:46,026
even I have to put in extra effort.

560
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:48,707
Director? What director?

561
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:50,707
You're not aware of this, are you?

562
00:29:51,906 --> 00:29:54,187
Beneath our Lord Ming is Shengxuan.

563
00:29:54,866 --> 00:29:57,227
Shengxuan conveys the lord's command
to the sect leader.

564
00:29:57,427 --> 00:29:59,506
The sect leader oversees
the directors of various regions.

565
00:29:59,786 --> 00:30:01,506
Under the directors
are emissaries such as me.

566
00:30:01,746 --> 00:30:05,266
Each emissary is responsible
for leading and managing the disciples.

567
00:30:07,546 --> 00:30:08,146
I understand now.

568
00:30:08,386 --> 00:30:11,386
So the sect in the Yinghui Fort

569
00:30:12,307 --> 00:30:14,187
is governed by Director Gao Xiao.

570
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:15,506
That's right.

571
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:18,546
The laws are strict and clear.

572
00:30:18,546 --> 00:30:20,786
It's worthy of a large sect
with followers everywhere.

573
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:22,467
Qi, we've found ourselves a big backer.

574
00:30:23,347 --> 00:30:24,427
The sect is amazing,

575
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:25,866
and Mr. Meng is also impressive.

576
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:27,987
Let's go.

577
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:36,227
(I found you.)

578
00:30:36,947 --> 00:30:37,386
(Qi.)

579
00:30:38,456 --> 00:30:40,244
(Shengxuan of the Qiyuan Sect)

580
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:55,947
A flying big fish.

581
00:30:57,266 --> 00:30:58,146
What big fish?

582
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,026
Such lack of experience.

583
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:03,307
This is the ancient divine beast
worshipped by our sect,

584
00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:03,906
Kun.

585
00:31:14,546 --> 00:31:16,146
Qi, what's wrong?

586
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:20,707
Why does this feel somewhat familiar?

587
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:29,146
Done.

588
00:31:29,866 --> 00:31:31,746
Mr. Meng, what is this for?

589
00:31:31,987 --> 00:31:32,987
Have we offended you?

590
00:31:34,947 --> 00:31:36,587
Though the two of you are quite skilled,

591
00:31:37,307 --> 00:31:38,227
your brains...

592
00:31:43,947 --> 00:31:44,746
Mr. Meng,

593
00:31:44,827 --> 00:31:47,227
we sincerely wish to join your sect.

594
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:49,187
Why did you lock us up?

595
00:31:49,386 --> 00:31:49,906
Girl,

596
00:31:50,347 --> 00:31:52,906
you'll have to ask
Lord Shengxuan about that.

597
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:55,866
Lord Shengxuan.

598
00:31:57,266 --> 00:31:57,786
Farewell.

599
00:31:58,746 --> 00:31:59,707
- Mr. Meng.
- Mr. Meng.

600
00:31:59,707 --> 00:32:00,386
Mr. Meng.

601
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:08,587
Jinzhao, why do I feel

602
00:32:08,587 --> 00:32:10,546
he deliberately lured us here?

603
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:11,467
Me too.

604
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:13,067
But don't worry.

605
00:32:13,746 --> 00:32:14,866
We will get help soon.

606
00:32:24,786 --> 00:32:25,067
Direc...

607
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:33,347
Director Gao.

608
00:32:36,987 --> 00:32:37,947
Director Gao.

609
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,508
(Gao Xiao, Qiyuan Sect's director)

610
00:32:43,866 --> 00:32:44,987
Director Gao!

611
00:32:49,546 --> 00:32:50,906
You cur!

612
00:32:51,347 --> 00:32:52,506
Are you on fire or what?

613
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,146
Be ruthless in deed
and calm in character.

614
00:32:57,386 --> 00:32:57,906
Yes.

615
00:32:58,026 --> 00:32:59,746
Take your time. What's the matter?

616
00:33:00,427 --> 00:33:02,546
Lord Shengxuan ordered me
to capture two persons.

617
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:03,666
I've led them here

618
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:04,786
without much effort.

619
00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:06,146
What?

620
00:33:07,427 --> 00:33:08,347
Take it slow.

621
00:33:08,347 --> 00:33:09,347
It's alright.

622
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,266
My legs are numb.

623
00:33:11,347 --> 00:33:12,107
Say that again.

624
00:33:12,347 --> 00:33:13,266
What did you just say?

625
00:33:13,427 --> 00:33:14,947
I locked them in the passageway.

626
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:17,746
Good job.

627
00:33:18,587 --> 00:33:19,467
I'll credit you for this.

628
00:33:19,906 --> 00:33:22,067
I'm going to report to Lord Shengxuan.

629
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:26,266
No need.

630
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:28,666
Gao Xiao, we're here.

631
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:37,347
Didn't you say it was two people?

632
00:33:37,707 --> 00:33:38,746
But there are three.

633
00:33:41,026 --> 00:33:42,307
Aren't you that audacious man?

634
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:43,307
You.

635
00:33:45,546 --> 00:33:47,906
Are the three of you
conspiring to deceive me?

636
00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:50,587
I feel sorry for you.

637
00:33:50,587 --> 00:33:51,227
Guards!

638
00:33:51,746 --> 00:33:52,347
Attack!

639
00:34:44,227 --> 00:34:45,347
I-I-I'll go call for help.

640
00:34:45,506 --> 00:34:46,347
I'm going to get help.

641
00:34:52,227 --> 00:34:53,227
You're just unlucky

642
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:54,987
to meet Qi.

643
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:09,866
Please spare my life!

644
00:35:10,307 --> 00:35:11,666
When you did those harmful misdeeds,

645
00:35:11,906 --> 00:35:12,906
did you ever imagine this day?

646
00:35:13,866 --> 00:35:14,866
Don't.

647
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:17,427
Don't come.

648
00:35:26,746 --> 00:35:27,187
You!

649
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:29,347
Y-Y-You useless thing.

650
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:30,427
Why are you panicking?

651
00:35:31,026 --> 00:35:31,987
I've been running

652
00:35:32,146 --> 00:35:33,506
this Fujin Hall for countless years.

653
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:35,427
How dare you ruffians run wild here?

654
00:35:36,227 --> 00:35:38,546
Today, I'm gonna wreck
this place of yours.

655
00:35:50,906 --> 00:35:51,347
Jinzhao.

656
00:35:53,546 --> 00:35:53,827
Qi!

657
00:35:54,906 --> 00:35:55,347
Jinzhao.

658
00:35:56,347 --> 00:35:56,947
Jinzhao.

659
00:35:58,786 --> 00:35:59,386
Miss Yue.

660
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:10,187
What have you done to Qi?

661
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:11,826
She...

662
00:36:12,106 --> 00:36:13,306
I...

663
00:36:20,987 --> 00:36:21,787
They have merged.

664
00:36:22,906 --> 00:36:23,787
They have merged.

665
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:26,227
Only Lord Ming can merge with soul fish.

666
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:27,947
Lord Ming.

667
00:36:28,947 --> 00:36:31,187
Lord Ming has appeared.

668
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,547
- May Lord Ming bless us.
- May Lord Ming bless us.

669
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:39,507
Lord Ming,

670
00:36:39,787 --> 00:36:42,227
you see us in a perilous situation,

671
00:36:42,386 --> 00:36:44,146
so you came out to guide us?

672
00:36:45,467 --> 00:36:47,227
No, I am not Lord Ming.

673
00:36:47,586 --> 00:36:48,707
I am not.

674
00:36:49,386 --> 00:36:51,066
Jinzhao, think of a solution!

675
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:51,826
Qi.

676
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:23,066
Jinzhao.

677
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,386
Jinzhao.

678
00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:30,027
Jinzhao.

679
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:33,066
Jinzhao.

680
00:37:42,547 --> 00:37:43,987
Jinzhao.

681
00:37:54,987 --> 00:37:55,586
Qi.

682
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:56,826
Qi,

683
00:37:57,947 --> 00:37:59,066
come back.

684
00:37:59,427 --> 00:38:00,106
Come back to me.

685
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:00,586
Qi.

686
00:38:00,586 --> 00:38:01,306
Who are you?

687
00:38:01,427 --> 00:38:02,267
Don't listen to her.

688
00:38:02,826 --> 00:38:04,187
Qi, don't listen to her.

689
00:38:04,187 --> 00:38:04,987
Jinzhao.

690
00:38:04,987 --> 00:38:06,146
Don't listen to her.

691
00:38:06,146 --> 00:38:07,106
Jinzhao abandoned you.

692
00:38:07,427 --> 00:38:07,826
No!

693
00:38:07,826 --> 00:38:09,267
Jinzhao has abandoned you.

694
00:38:09,747 --> 00:38:10,467
Who are you?

695
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:11,386
Jinzhao abandoned you.

696
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:12,066
Don't listen to her.

697
00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:14,427
I won't deceive you.

698
00:38:14,906 --> 00:38:15,987
Come back to me.

699
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:17,747
Qi.

700
00:38:18,187 --> 00:38:18,666
Jinzhao abandoned you.

701
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:19,146
Qi.

702
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:21,386
Jinzhao abandoned you.
