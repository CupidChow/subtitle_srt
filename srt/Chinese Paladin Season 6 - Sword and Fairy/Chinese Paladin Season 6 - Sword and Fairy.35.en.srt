If you continue to cry like this,

106
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:06,554

00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:20,594
I promised you I would not die,

111
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:23,235
so I definitely won't.

112

I'm sorry.

00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:07,155

00:14:08,434 --> 00:14:09,155
(succeed?)

Jinzhao, you...

118
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:34,554
I'm fine.

119
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,475
I'm really fine.

120
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:41,674
Qi,

121
00:14:43,194 --> 00:14:43,674
it's over.

Jinzhao,

124
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,954
My Thought Sword
originates from my thoughts.

125
00:15:01,954 --> 00:15:03,115
I've changed my thoughts.

126
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:05,434
So the power of Thought Sword
has changed too.

127
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:08,314
Zhu Yu fell asleep.

128
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:11,875
We did it.

129
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:17,954
You found a way to make it work.

130
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:19,954
You fulfilled a sword-wielder's duty.

131
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:45,434
Qi,

132
00:15:47,355 --> 00:15:48,475
it's the Qixi Festival.

133
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:51,434
Let's go to Jing'an.

134
00:15:53,515 --> 00:15:53,995
Okay.

135
00:15:55,074 --> 00:15:56,074
Let's go to Jing'an.

136
00:16:51,554 --> 00:16:52,194
Miss Ming?

137
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:53,314
Xiu.

138
00:17:00,635 --> 00:17:01,355
We are here.

139
00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:20,634
I'll take you home.

140
00:17:40,074 --> 00:17:40,834
I know

141
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,634
you are worried about Xiaoyuan,

142
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:45,475
and you're sad and self-blaming.

143
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:49,435
This

144
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,114
is

145
00:17:55,834 --> 00:17:58,435
the first time you've held me.

146
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:11,794
Although...

147
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,995
Although the world

148
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:19,394
thinks

149
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:23,275
you are cold and heartless,

150
00:18:26,634 --> 00:18:27,435
I

151
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:29,834
know

152
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:34,154
very well

153
00:18:36,314 --> 00:18:37,195
that

154
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:41,314
your heart

155
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:43,955
is

156
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:47,035
the warmest.

157
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:01,955
Qingfei,

158
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:08,475
I'll take you back
to the room for treatment.

159
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:53,554
Qingfei?

160
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:07,715
Qingfei.

161
00:20:08,154 --> 00:20:09,554
Don't waste it.

162
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:12,995
Xuwei,

163
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:16,275
I hope

164
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:18,955
that this time

165
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,195
we will win.

166
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:24,634
It's because

167
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:27,354
we have already

168
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,235
given too much.

169
00:20:32,594 --> 00:20:33,435
I hope

170
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:38,195
that when all this

171
00:20:39,755 --> 00:20:40,955
is over,

172
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:46,634
you can really let go

173
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,715
of the heavy burden on you,

174
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:53,154
and together...

175
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:56,955
Together...

176
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:08,794
Qingfei?

177
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:12,515
Don't fall asleep, Qingfei.

178
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:18,594
(If you fall asleep,)

179
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:22,314
(it might be hard for you
to wake up again.)

180
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:40,275
(Jinzhao,)

181
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,354
(it seems we have done something)

182
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:44,554
(quite remarkable together.)

183
00:21:45,794 --> 00:21:46,435
(Of course.)

184
00:21:48,154 --> 00:21:49,675
(Peace has been restored to the world.)

185
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,354
And the common people

186
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:53,995
can now live happily ever after.

187
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:57,074
Qi,

188
00:21:58,755 --> 00:22:01,035
what do you want to do in the future?

189
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:04,995
Of course, to continue adventuring
through jianghu with you.

190
00:22:06,114 --> 00:22:07,475
Now we have money.

191
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:08,515
In the future,

192
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:10,955
we can have egg noodles
with lots of eggs.

193
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:14,154
You only care about eating.

194
00:22:16,874 --> 00:22:17,515
Qi,

195
00:22:20,275 --> 00:22:22,154
in the future,
you will see many landscapes

196
00:22:24,314 --> 00:22:25,515
and meet many people.

197
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:28,675
You should always remain this happy.

198
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:32,995
If we get tired,

199
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:35,275
we can rest on Mount Yuqing

200
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:37,515
and visit Ming Xiu and Mr. Gu.

201
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:39,634
If we get cold,

202
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:42,195
we can visit Zhaoyan and Xian Qing.

203
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:45,275
Xian Qing's wolf fur must be very warm.

204
00:22:54,394 --> 00:22:55,195
Qi,

205
00:22:57,475 --> 00:22:58,995
I want to eat candied haws.

206
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:01,874
I used to always buy them for you.

207
00:23:02,955 --> 00:23:03,675
Can you

208
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,275
buy them for me once today?

209
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:14,435
Okay.

210
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:15,715
I'll buy them for you.

211
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:17,114

212
00:23:17,755 --> 00:23:18,195

What are you doing?

263
00:31:15,354 --> 00:31:16,275
I was thinking

264
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:19,035
that it's Jinzhao's and my birthday,

265
00:31:19,915 --> 00:31:21,035
and we should eat egg noodles.

266
00:31:23,594 --> 00:31:24,955
Yue Jinzhao is already dead.

267
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:29,794
You've already said that many times.

268
00:31:31,554 --> 00:31:32,515
But do you really understand

269
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:35,035
what death means?

270
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,755
Death is the loss of life.

271
00:31:39,634 --> 00:31:41,235
It's when the soul leaves the body.

272
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,154
It's something that everyone
ultimately experiences.

273
00:31:46,995 --> 00:31:48,314
Then repeat after me.

274
00:31:49,435 --> 00:31:50,755
Yue Jinzhao is already dead.

275
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:54,035
Yue Jinzhao is already dead.

276
00:31:54,554 --> 00:31:55,554
Say it again.

277
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:57,475
Jinzhao is already dead.

278
00:31:57,554 --> 00:31:58,354
Again.

279
00:32:03,675 --> 00:32:04,675
I don't want to.

280
00:32:05,074 --> 00:32:06,794
Yue Jinzhao is already dead!

281
00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:07,915
Miss Ming,

282
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:10,195
stop.

283
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:19,554
If she can't accept

284
00:32:19,675 --> 00:32:21,354
the fact that her loved one
has passed away,

285
00:32:22,475 --> 00:32:23,915
how is she supposed to go on living?

286
00:32:25,995 --> 00:32:26,955
Even the one we thought

287
00:32:27,035 --> 00:32:28,755
would always spoil her is gone.

288
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:32,275
How much longer can we accompany her?

289
00:32:35,394 --> 00:32:36,475
If, one day,

290
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:37,995
we are no longer here,

291
00:32:39,715 --> 00:32:40,874
what is she to do?

292
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:03,354
Miss Yue...

293
00:33:03,755 --> 00:33:04,995
Jinzhao has already died.

294
00:33:06,475 --> 00:33:07,114
I know.

295
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:12,915
Doesn't everyone ultimately die anyway?

296
00:33:17,554 --> 00:33:18,554
Why don't you get some sleep?

297
00:33:44,634 --> 00:33:45,435
Jinzhao,

298
00:33:46,195 --> 00:33:47,314
I'm so hungry.

299
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:11,435
Didn't you want to eat noodles?

300
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:15,475
Today is your birthday. Eat up.

301
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:39,634
Don't they taste good?

302
00:34:44,674 --> 00:34:45,194
That's good.

303
00:34:46,154 --> 00:34:48,154
We were worried
they wouldn't suit your taste.

304
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:50,554
They are tasty.

305
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:54,475
I've never had noodles
this delicious before.

306
00:34:55,955 --> 00:34:57,074
The noodles are soft

307
00:34:58,194 --> 00:34:59,074
yet not mushy.

308
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:03,554
The first time Jinzhao cooked noodles,

309
00:35:04,355 --> 00:35:05,754
he cooked them for so long

310
00:35:06,554 --> 00:35:08,194
that they nearly turned into porridge.

311
00:35:09,395 --> 00:35:10,955
Later, when he cooked noodles,

312
00:35:11,955 --> 00:35:13,194
they were always undercooked.

313
00:35:17,835 --> 00:35:19,274
And the vegetable leaves are green.

314
00:35:23,114 --> 00:35:24,475
The noodles Jinzhao cooked for me

315
00:35:25,234 --> 00:35:27,274
had yellow vegetable leaves in them.

316
00:35:28,714 --> 00:35:30,395
I said they wouldn't taste good
like that.

317
00:35:32,035 --> 00:35:33,674
The next time he served me noodles,

318
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:37,355
he just quickly
blanched the vegetable leaves.

319
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:45,114
This egg is still runny in the center.

320
00:35:47,835 --> 00:35:49,915
This is my favorite way to eat eggs.

321
00:35:51,995 --> 00:35:54,114
But Jinzhao never cooked them
like this for me.

322
00:35:54,915 --> 00:35:55,714
He said

323
00:35:56,475 --> 00:35:57,915
he was afraid
it'd give me a stomach ache.

324
00:36:00,355 --> 00:36:02,194
I think he just didn't know
how to cook them.

325
00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:21,395
What's wrong?

326
00:36:25,274 --> 00:36:26,035
Nothing.

327
00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:28,714
I just ate too quickly.

328
00:36:28,995 --> 00:36:30,194
I feel a bit uncomfortable.

329
00:36:30,915 --> 00:36:31,714
Then stop eating them.

330
00:36:31,714 --> 00:36:32,315
No.

331
00:36:32,915 --> 00:36:34,915
Jinzhao told me not to waste food.

332
00:36:42,114 --> 00:36:43,074
They are really delicious.

333
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:50,835
I've finished.

334
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:55,274

00:41:06,395 --> 00:41:06,995
Besides,

379
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:09,114
your eyes are much more swollen
than mine.

380
00:41:10,194 --> 00:41:11,395
I also cried just now.

381
00:41:13,114 --> 00:41:14,315
I don't want to talk to you.

382
00:41:14,955 --> 00:41:15,554
Xiaoyuan.

383
00:41:17,674 --> 00:41:18,795
Am I very familiar with you?

384
00:41:19,194 --> 00:41:20,274
Call me Leader Qili.

385
00:41:22,035 --> 00:41:23,315
Once you've cried,
you shouldn't cry again.

386
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,114
You need to grow up.

387
00:41:25,995 --> 00:41:27,475
What's so good about growing up?

388
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:29,835
Xuwei and Qingfei
are both so badly injured.

389
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:31,795
Luohuan is even dead.

390
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:36,274
No one can stay a child forever.

391
00:41:39,435 --> 00:41:41,634
If someone could always remain a child,

392
00:41:44,915 --> 00:41:47,194
it's because someone else
is bearing the burdens

393
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:52,114
that she should carry for her.

394
00:41:53,634 --> 00:41:54,795
I don't need you to tell me that.

395
00:42:06,835 --> 00:42:07,395
(Yue Qi,)

396
00:42:08,074 --> 00:42:09,074
