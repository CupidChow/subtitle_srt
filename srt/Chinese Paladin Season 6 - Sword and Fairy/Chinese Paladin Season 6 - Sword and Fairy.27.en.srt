Maiming.

27
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:28,840
Congratulations.

28
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:30,072
Maiming.

29
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:31,520
You took your revenge.

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,304
It's you.

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,120
You killed my father!

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,879
Don't come over!

33
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,800
My Zhaoyan

34
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,759
is such an innocent
and upright silly girl.

35
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:46,199
Maiming.

36
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,024
Maiming.

37
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,696
You are Zhaoyan?

38
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,360
You are both in this together.

39
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:01,960
It's you!

40
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,879
You also helped kill my father!

41
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,519
You are also a murderer!

42
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,040
- Kill her.
- kill her.

43
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:16,599
Take him away first.

44
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,432
Okay.

45
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,680
Hold on.

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,040
Don't run away!

47
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,296
Maiming.

Hold on.

Maiming!

Maiming!

57
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,239
You mustn't die, Maiming.

58
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:02,559
Maiming.

59
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,479
You silly girl.

60
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,080
I've racked my brains

61
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,160
to drive you out of the Luo family

62
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:13,759
just to keep you from getting hurt.

63
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,959
Why are you so silly

64
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:19,319
and stubborn?

65
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,839
I wasn't stubborn.

66
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,264
Maiming.

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,199
You are my only family.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,479
I'll listen to you from now on.

69
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,880
I won't let you die. You mustn't die.

70
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:29,919
Maiming!

71
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,919
You mustn't die.

72
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,360
You shouldn't cry.

73
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:38,872
It...

74
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,280
it isn't easy for me

75
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:42,800
to finally

76
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,112
die.

77
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,679
Moreover,

78
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
a murderer

79
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,199
is to be killed in return.

80
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:00,959
No.

81
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,039
Maiming, you mustn't die.

82
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
You cannot die.

83
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,168
Rehai.

84
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,319
Rehai has the life force.

85
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,319
It can save you, right?

86
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:15,119
Re...

87
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,240
Silly girl.

88
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,319
You are the guardian of Rehai now.

89
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,880
I don't want it.

90
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,880
I don't want it.

91
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:32,800
I don't want it.

92
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,280
Though I'm already
deeply trapped in endless abyss,

93
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,160
yet still,

94
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,919
I wish you enjoy endless peace and joy.

95
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,679
Zhaoyan.

96
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,319
The condemnation of heaven on Luo family

97
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,839
has finally ended.

98
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,759
Maiming.

99
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:10,640
I'm so tired.

100
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,760
I want to rest for a while.

101
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,320
Don't.

102
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,079
Maiming.

103
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,079
Maiming.

104
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,880
Maiming!

105
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,679
Maiming!

106
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:57,559
Maiming.

107
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,000
Why have you returned?

108
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,160
According to the original plan,

109
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:13,976
we should have found
a remote village to hide in temporarily,

110
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,079
and come back to look for Master
after the storm subsided.

111
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,519
I have but three days to live.

112
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:23,600
In that case,

113
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,079
I might as well die where I should die.

114
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,399
Will you really be satisfied

115
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,440
if you can just die?

116
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,000
I consider myself to be
a very greedy person.

117
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,880
Very greedy.

118
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,079
When the time comes,

119
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,624

At the time of lifting

127

in order to prevent Zhaoyan
from getting hurt,

128
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,000
it was forcibly stopped.

129

140

Isn't this the painting I drew?

00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,728

It's just a pity

148
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,800
that I couldn't see

149
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,319
your paintings

150
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:46,968

154
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Alright.

155
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:16,560
Maiming.

156
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,879
He's fulfilled

157
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:36,600
his own wishes in all the paintings.

158
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,480
In my dream yesterday,

159
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,280
I dreamed of what happened

160
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,399
to the Luo family
on the day of Rehai bloodbinding.

161
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,240
Maiming's soul

162
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:53,999
was thus permanently trapped here.

163
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,959
Because I had to lend my life to him,

164
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,959
I was destined to pass away early.

165
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,079
So I told Maiming

166
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,839
that I was willing
to lend my life to him,

167
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,160
and I was also willing
to live and die with him.

168
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:18,720
Why wouldn't he just believe me?

169
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,600
(Having been lonely for long,)

170
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:26,720
(you can meet someone
who would rather give up her own life)

171
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,839
(than to give up on you.)

172
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,399
(Is that why)

173
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:36,120
(you forcibly terminated
the spell then?)

174
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,519
(Luo Maiming.)

175
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,879
Perhaps it was just for me

176
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:46,680
that Maiming rushed
to lift the bloodbinding.

177
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,319
Luo Maiming

178
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,920
could continuously borrow life
to be reborn,

179
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,680
while I have

180
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,800
only one life.

181
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,399
As he killed so many people,

182
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,040
he should've deserved to be killed.

183
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:08,999
But in this world,

184
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,240
I am the one least qualified
to condemn him.

185
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,079
Xian Qing,

186
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,639
I don't know what to do.

187
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,504
If that is the case,

188
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:31,839
then use the rest of your life

189
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,360
to atone for his crime.

190
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,408
Atone for his crime?

191
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,880
Atone for his crime?

192
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:53,360
Atone for his crime?

193
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,040
Is that possible?

194
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,999
Definitely.

195
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,824
Zhaoyan.

196
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:15,280
I will do it together with you.

197
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,920
I have something to do.

198
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,120
But I want to go alone.

199
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,720
I know you want to accompany me.

200
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,160
This is the final concern
of Luo family's Master.

201
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,704
I want to handle it myself.

202
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,519
Alright.

203
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,232
Do you see her?

204
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:39,879
The Luo family members
in the Western Regions

205
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,199
died because of this person.

206
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,864
Hasn't the Luo family's reputation
always been good?

207
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,399
It has changed since the day
of the grand family ceremony.

208
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,959
It's said that over a hundred people
were killed.

209
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,439
- Over a hundred people were killed?
- Over a hundred people were killed?

210
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:51,879
She is such a female demon!

211
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:52,720
What is she here for?

212
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,496
What is she doing here?

213
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:57,656
- Definitely up to no good.
- Let's go have a look.

214
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,079
She is up to no good.

215
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,959
Luo Zhaoyan, what are you here for?

216
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,360
This wasn't done by us.

217
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,040
This was smashed by the families
of those you've killed.

218
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,319
Don't worry.

219
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,240
I will not harm you.

220
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,639
By the way,

221
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:16,319
I will not continue to serve
at your home.

222
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,680
I am afraid to be criticized
by people behind my back.

223
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,920
What is this?

224
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,399
Yeah.

225
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,680
Everyone.

226
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,199
I am the former Master
of the Luo family,

227
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,439
Luo Zhaoyan.

228
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,839
Today, I ask all present
to bear witness.

229
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,879
From today on,

230
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:42,120
all the properties under the name
of Maiming and I

231
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,639
shall belong to the stewards and clerks.

232
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,639
And please also help me sell off
all the properties that we've deposited

233
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,519
in money dealers and other places

234
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,760
to compensate the families
of the deceased.

235
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,920
I am here today.

236
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,040
If any of you have
any grievances or hatred,

237
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,079
feel free to take it out on me.

238
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,008
Do not harm the innocent.

239
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,999
I am the only one

240
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:07,120
to scrape by in this world.

241
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,360
My mother says
you're a murderous lunatic!

242
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:13,496
Kill her!

243
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:14,639
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

244
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:15,360
I'll kill you!

245
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,199
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

246
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:22,160
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

247
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,120
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

248
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,399
She deceived people!

249
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:26,800
Murderous lunatic!

250
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,600
Shameless!

251
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,560
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

252
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,319
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

253
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:32,240
I'll kill you!

254
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,639
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

255
00:18:38,072 --> 00:18:38,840
Enough!

256
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:42,399
Who is this?

257
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:53,879
Didn't I say I would come alone?

258
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:57,079
You could come.

259
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,759
I could follow too.

260
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Most of you are not
related to the Luo family.

261
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,440
Over the years, you have also
received favors from the Luo family.

262
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:11,192
Yet today you turn against them
so quickly.

263
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,479
Come on.

264
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:17,599
Keep throwing!

265
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:21,879
- Go.
- Go.

266
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:22,680
Xian Qing.

267
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,016
Let's go.

268
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:35,960
Thank you.

269
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,320
If other people can't scold you,

270
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,399
what about me?

271
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:42,519
Can I scold you?

272
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,200
She knelt down.

273
00:19:56,639 --> 00:19:57,399
She knelt down.

274
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,719
For the rest of my life,
I will atone for this.

275
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:11,479
From now on,

276
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,759
I will no longer set foot
in Yinghui Fort.

277
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:22,328
Right.

278
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:26,424
How dare Luo Maiming
who slaughtered all his own kin,

279
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,359
and you, Luo Zhaoyan,

280
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,599
ever come back here again?

281
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,728
This place

282
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:39,680
has been stained by the blood
of those you two killed.

283
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:42,840
Luo Zhaoyan.

284
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:45,920
You are cold-blooded and heartless,

285
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,479
and no different from a demon beast
that devours humans alive.

286
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:51,840
You don't deserve to be a human!

287
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:55,719
Get out!

288
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,879
Kneeling down once is enough.

289
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,408
It's not your fault anyway.

290
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:18,960
Let's go.

291
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:24,639
Luo Zhaoyan!

292
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,759
I hate you!

293
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,264
I hate you.

294
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,280
- Go.
- Go.

295
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,680
- Let's leave.
- Let's leave.

296
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,359
I hate you.

297
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,016
Zhaoyan.

298
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,024
What do you plan to do next?

299
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:54,280
As long as the righteousness remains intact,
there will still be a path to follow.

300
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,400
For the rest of my life,

301
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,320
I will try to do more good deeds

302
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,639
to atone for the sins of Maiming and I.

303
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:05,840
I seek no fame or fortune.
I wanna stay true to myself.

304
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:10,160
No matter how the world sees you,

305
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,160
I will always be by your side.

306
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:27,280
(Qi,)

307
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:30,552
(where on the earth are you?)

308
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,280
Yue.

309
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,320
Have a seat.

310
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,119
Yue.

311
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,040
Sorry to make you worry these past days.

312
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,136
Miss Yue's whereabouts remain unknown.

313
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,399
Yet you have been implicated

314
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,840
and couldn't go to search for her.

315
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,519
I also failed to ask Maiming
for clues in time.

316
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,960
I am truly sorry.

317
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,479
The Luo family has encountered
such a disaster.

318
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:23,479
It has distractd you.

319
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,719
Besides,

320
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:27,759
I have been searching everywhere
these past two days,

321
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:29,519
and I still can't find
the location of the Yujie Hub.

322
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,119
So it's all the same wherever I am.

323
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,479
Isn't it that you can sense
each other's whereabouts

324
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:40,800
using the Mindlink
between Miss Yue and you?

325
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:42,599
Yes.

326
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,600
I have also tried that.

327
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,232
The resonance between Qi and I

328
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,160
seems to be blocked
by some external force.

329
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,320
It must be something done by Ying Xuwei.

330
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,399
De'er!

331
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,440
De'er!

332
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:59,359
Have you seen my De'er?

333
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,320
De...

334
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:05,112
Have you seen my De'er?

335
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,200
Uncle.

336
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,800
Who is De'er?

337
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,399
So you haven't seen him either.

338
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,479
De'er!

339
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,080
De'er!

340
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,359
It must be because of something done
by Luo family in secret.

341
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,999
Otherwise,

342
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Nian had been treating
his grandson well,

343
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,719
why did he suddenly turn into
a stone a few days ago?

344
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,759
Sir.

345
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:30,920
Other than person's grandson,

346
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,800
are there any others
who have turned to stone?

347
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,479
How do you know?

348
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,960
So you really have something
to do with this?

349
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,920
Alright, stop talking.

350
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,968
Aren't you afraid they'll harm you?
Just go now.

351
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,040
Go, go.

352
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:45,920
Although the headquarters
of the Qiyuan Sect has been destroyed,

353
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,960
there could still be some
that slipped through the net.

354
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,479
Luo family originally had
significant influence in this area,

355
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:52,312
so we could've deterred them
to some extent.

356
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,759
But now...

357
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:55,999
The Hengdao Sect must
be related to this.

358
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:57,960
We must send
send a message to Mr. Zuo

359
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,200
to ask Zhengwu Alliance to help protect
the citizens of Yinghui Fort,

360
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:03,920
and also ask him to join us in searching
for the Hengdao Sect.

361
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,519
Are you Yue Jinzhao?

362
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,560
Someone asked me
to give you this letter.

363
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,512
It is Qi's jade pendant.

364
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,160
(Lock River Mountain)

365
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,960
Lock River Mountain?

366
00:25:29,999 --> 00:25:31,800
I've never heard of this place before.

367
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,239
But since they have sent the letter,

368
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:37,999
how about you try the Mindlink again?

369
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:50,359
I seem

370
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:52,160
to find her.

371
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,280
I seem to have found Qi.

372
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,200
I will send a message to Xiu

373
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,599
to let her and Shifang meet up with us.

374
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,960
Why would the Hengdao Sect
give us a location that no one knows,

375
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,608
and deliberately cut off
your connection with Little Yue?

376
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,639
Looks like

377
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,776
they're trying to lure us there.

378
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:25,599
They also want to see

379
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:27,599
whether I can find Qi

380
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,359
just relying on Mindlink.

381
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:42,904
It's on the north side.

382
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,759
What's wrong?

383
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:53,040
The Mindlink

384
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,384
seems to have failed again.

385
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:41,440
Jinzhao!

386
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,960
Shifang.

387
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:43,840
Jinzhao!

388
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:48,664
It's still not enough.

389
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,768
It doesn't matter.

390
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,119
If it is needed,

391
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
we can assist you.

392
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,920
It's useless.

393
00:27:58,879 --> 00:27:59,800
I can only rely on myself.

394
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,680
The Mindlink

395
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:05,680
is only related to the love
of Qi and me.

396
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,359
This time,

397
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,680
I must rely on myself.

398
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:18,119
Jinzhao.

399
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,680
We must have another way.

400
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:21,119
Please don't hurt yourself.

401
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,719
(Try again.)

402
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:26,359
(If it's still unsuccessful,)

403
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:31,440
(even if I have to search
every inch of the divine land)

404
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,519
(I must find Qi.)

405
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,568
You found it!

406
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:53,280
I've heard about what happened

407
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,288
in these past few days.

408
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,888
I didn't expect that...

409
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:58,080
It's okay, Ming Xiu.

410
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,408
Thank you for your concern.

411
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,392
I have decided

412
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,144
to live on carrying Maiming's efforts

413
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,968
as a continuation

414
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:08,359
of his life.

415
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,080
I understand.

416
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,560
Xiu.

417
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,776
Have you brought the thing
I asked you to bring for me?

418
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,320
Thank you.

419
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:28,632
Keep them well.

420
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:31,519
These are all that's left
the master refined for you.

421
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,160
If you continue to casually
give away your energy to others,

422
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:37,440
sooner or later you will turn
into your original form.

423
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,432
Zhaoyan likes my skin and fur
quite a bit.

424
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,359
If that day really comes,

425
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,160
Zhaoyan will take me in.

426
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,040
No problem.

427
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:52,639
It's just

428
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:55,160
that I'm penniless right now.

429
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,280
If you follow me in the future,

430
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,719
you might have to be a vegetarian.

431
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,080
I've had quite a bit of meat.

432
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,960
Trying out vegetarianism
is also quite good.

433
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
Jinzhao.

434
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,960
Why would the Hengdao Sect
want to capture Little Yue?

435
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:18,599
Maybe it's because there's
a trend of breakdown

436
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,639
in the dealings between Zhu Yu
and the Hengdao Sect.

437
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:24,040
Therefore, the Hengdao Sect
took Qi as a hostage.

438
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,200
Nine Springs.

439
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,632
The Hengdao Sect.

440
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,359
The Sea of Clear Skies.

441
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,479
All of this is like a mystery,

442
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:35,399
enveloping Qi and me.

443
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,840
To unravel all these mysteries,

444
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:40,920
I can only ask Ying Xuwei.

445
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,119
Look!

446
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,288
There is a city floating
in the sky over there!

447
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:54,680
(Qi.)

448
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:56,359
(Wait for me.)

449
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,399
Truly unlike the mortal world.

450
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,399
It is inferior to the azure beyond,

451
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,000
yet it is at the pinnacle
of the human world.

452
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,280
Making a fuss over nothing.

453
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,040
Doesn't the Yunlai Stone also
move through the sky?

454
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,479
No.

455
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:25,680
You don't know.

456
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,759
This city is not floating
by magic or energy,

457
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,440
but by gadget techniques.

458
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:32,479
You are quite knowledgeable.

459
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:36,840
Where is Qi?

460
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,119
I want to see Qi.

461
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,440
If you want to see her,

462
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,536
you have to get past me first.

463
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,040
Wasn't it you who called us here?

464
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:44,560
Why do we still have to fight?

465
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,320
You hurt Luohuan so much.

466
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,879
I'm going to beat you hard.

467
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:49,999
(Xiaoyuan.)

468
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,216
(What did eldest brother
tell you just now?)

469
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,720
(Do you want to be punished by him?)

470
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,040
(Eldest brother has a word specifically
for Yue Jinzhao and Yue Qi.)

471
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:58,936
(You can follow her to the guest room.)

472
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,999
You want to stop us?

473
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,879
Xiu.

474
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:03,639
Since we're here, let's settle in.

475
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,040
We need to trust Jinzhao and Little Yue.

476
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,479
Lead the way.

477
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,816
Follow me.

478
00:33:22,648 --> 00:33:23,755
She is inside.

479
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,280
Jinzhao.
