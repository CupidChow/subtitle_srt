00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,200
Mr. Yue

22
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,200
and Miss Yue

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,799
are chosen by the Hengdao Sect

24
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,880
to kill Zhu Yu.

25
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:05,719
Yes.

26
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,280
I never appreciate
the Hengdao Sect's approach.

27
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:11,599
But Qi made her choice.

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,359
I'm going to stand by her.

29
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,560
I truly admire

30
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,359
your lofty spirit.

31
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:22,640
Mr. Zuo.

32
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,359
I bet you know that

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,839
Zhu Yu has been consuming Qiyuan Orbs

34
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:27,999
as if she's out of control.

35
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,759
The Zhengwu Alliance

36
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:31,879
is no match for her alone.

37
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,000
You only stand a chance

38
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,840
if you join hands with us.

39
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,360
Is that a threat?

40
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,919
I'm just stating the fact.

41
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,680
What a pity that our reputation

42
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,399
should end up disdained because of me.

43
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,000
It matters more to save lives.

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,520
Not many people know

45
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,759
that the Hengdao Sect
controls the Qiyuan Sect.

46
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,160
All you have to do is keep it a secret.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,119
We may fool others.

48
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,839
But how do we fool ourselves?

49
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,000
You can't.

50
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,280
But it's all about
having a clear conscience.

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,159
Leader.

52
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,479
Death shall be my redemption.

53
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,119
I'd die for the alliance.

54
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,960
To protect our reputation, I can

55
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,000
drop out of the alliance

56
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,400
to assist them.

57
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:28,559
Alright.

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,519
You have a backbone.

59
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,960
I'll make you the vanguard.

60
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,040
Thank you.

61
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:36,559
Mr. Yue.

62
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,720
Please inform Ying Xuwei

63
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,000
that I agree

64
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,080
to work with the Hengdao Sect.

65
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:51,879
Thank you.

66
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:53,879
Leader.

67
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,000
This is

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,680
purely my decision.

69
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,280
You're only pressured by me

70
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,640
to carry out the task.

71
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,000
Later,

72
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:11,319
I'll make it clear to the people.

73
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:15,039
We pledge loyalty to you, leader.

74
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:21,880
Mr. Zuo.

75
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:25,080
Once Rehai reaches Zangfeng Plains,

76
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,479
Zhu Yu will come.

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,640
Then

78
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,839
you will handle the Yu Clan

79
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,280
on Earth.

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,080
Yujie Hub will handle the remnant

81
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,759
on the Sea of Clear Skies.

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:36,959
Alright.

83
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,640
From now on,

84
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,559
I will mobilize all our disciples

85
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:43,000
against Zhu Yu.

86
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,959
Zuo Guanren agreed to work with us?

87
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,679
Yue Jinzhao made a deal with him.

88
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,199
Xuwei.

89
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:07,319
Do you regret it?

90
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:11,919
I know I'm beyond redemption.

91
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,119
All I can do is to save the Six Realms.

92
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:17,800
Excuse me.

93
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,039
Something is

94
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,679
bothering me.

95
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,240
When

96
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,720
did Maiming contact you?

97
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,199
Does it matter?

98
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,360
It matters to me.

99
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,199
Please kindly tell me.

100
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,240
Back in the Luori Village,

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,360
when you were asking Qi

102
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,039
about Rehai,

103
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,640
my people overheard you.

104
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,119
Then, Xuwei visited the Luo family

105
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,360
and spoke with Luo Maiming.

106
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,640
Luo Maiming was a smart guy.

107
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:04,640
He assessed the situation
and made a deal with us.

108
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,360
This is...

109
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,080
the key ring of Rehai.

110
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,799
This key ring of Rehai

111
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,119
is an important item against Zhu Yu.

112
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,559
Next time we meet,
we'll discuss how to deal with Zhu Yu.

113
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,040
I've agreed
to side with you against Zhu Yu.

114
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,799
In exchange,

115
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,359
will you show me
some sincerity, Mr. Ying?

116
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,880
I wonder if the way
to remove the Bloodbinding

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,880
can show my sincerity.

118
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,559
We teamed up against Zhu Yu.

119
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,280
He did it

120
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,079
to learn how to remove
the Bloodbinding spell.

121
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,639
Thank you.

122
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:58,280
No problem.

123
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,600
I always thought that

124
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,119
Maiming had committed

125
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,239
heinous crimes.

126
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:19,720
I dare not even

127
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,359
think about him these days.

128
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:27,920
But now,

129
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,200
I know that he's done his part

130
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,399
to help take down Zhu Yu,

131
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,079
I...

132
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,480
don't know what to think.

133
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,839
If you're confused,

134
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,720
just follow your heart.

135
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:50,839
Think about

136
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,200
your initial aspiration.

137
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,399
It may offer you the courage to face it.

138
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,880
My initial aspiration?

139
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:18,799
Xuwei.

140
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,200
Have some tea.

141
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,559
What's wrong?

142
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,040
I talked too much?

143
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,600
I know you're soft.

144
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,359
If Zuo Guanren acts
according to the plan,

145
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,000
we have a greater chance.

146
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,079
There's only one final step.

147
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,519
With Qi and Yue Jinzhao excluded,

148
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:52,679
four people

149
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,280
can approach the Yu Clan.

150
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,399
If we keep our promise

151
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,280
to Luo Maiming,

152
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,720
Luo Zhaoyan and Xian Qing are excluded.

153
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,040
As for those two...

154
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,440
Ju Shifang

155
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,359
and Shuo Xuan

156
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,119
seem to have

157
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,760
something going on.

158
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,399
If anything goes wrong,

159
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:20,320
we will do it ourselves.

160
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,239
We must send the removal method

161
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,519
of the Bloodbinding
to Mist Soul no matter what.

162
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,679
For some people,

163
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,920
the safety of one person

164
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,200
matters more than anything.

165
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,399
I didn't believe that.

166
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,160
Xuwei.

167
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,559
I'm thinking.

168
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,679
Once the war is over,

169
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,679
let's take Xiaoyuan

170
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,040
to travel to the Mortal Realm.

171
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,200
Alright.

172
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,600
Xian Qing.

173
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,480
Are you practicing
for the battle tomorrow?

174
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:03,879
Yeah.

175
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,920
Shall we exchange a few moves?

176
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,680

Want a break?

203
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:31,160
Alright.

204
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:41,360
It seems that

205
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,120
your mindset changed just now.

206
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,600
You told me to keep

207
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
my initial aspiration.

208
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,399
I've been thinking

209
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,959
and I finally figured it out

210
00:13:58,319 --> 00:13:59,280
during our practice.

211
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,040
It's my aspiration and obligation
to shoulder my duty

212
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,839
and protect

213
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,360
the people I care about.

214
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,600
You have a great ambition.

215
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,079
I will stand by you.

216
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,439
I can die for anyone,

217
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,280
but I only live for one person.

218
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,560
Ms. Ge.

219
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:45,920
I've learned a lot

220
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,480
about gadgets from you these days.

221
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,319
Thanks.

222
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,319
No problem.

223
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:50,720
Right.

224
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,240
Thanks to your

225
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,240
instructions,

226
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,999
I've managed to improve it.

227
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,560
Shifang.

228
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:00,319
Coming.

229
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,360
Ms. Ge.

230
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,448
Jinzhao is calling me.

231
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,480
See you.

232
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:06,800
Go ahead.

233
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,199
Goodbye.

234
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,040
And farewell.

235
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,759
Mr. Zuo.

236
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,480
How did it go?

237
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:04,800
Chen Qianjun and our people were spotted

238
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,959
by the demons at the Zangfeng Plains

239
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:09,600
and suffered a huge loss.

240
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,199
The battle hasn't started

241
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,240
and we're already suffering huge losses?

242
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,639
Mr. Zuo.

243
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,800
Please do me a favor.

244
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,240
The gadgets of Yujie Hub

245
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,439
can attack the physical form of Kun.

246
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,399
But it's a mythical beast.

247
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,920
The attack has to
land on the weakest spot

248
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,800
to work.

249
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,240
You've observed Zhu Yu for years

250
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:32,839
and came up with

251
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:34,199
three possible spots

252
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,680
without certainty.

253
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,680
The stored energy

254
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,280
allows the Yujie Hub
to launch three attacks.

255
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,839
The Hengdao Sect needs
the Dragon Crystals in Wuyan Village.

256
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,199
The more crystals we dig out,

257
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,959
the more likely we can win.

258
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:52,480
I thought the Hengdao Sect
could see the future

259
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,040
and had an awe-inspiring power.

260
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,560
In the end,

261
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,079
they need us to dig rocks for them.

262
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,079
Lingyun.

263
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,360
(See the future?)

264
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:03,280
We're not doing this for
the Hengdao Sect or the Yujie Hub.

265
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,800
It's for the people.

266
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:08,480
That's right.

267
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,639
To fight for the people
is to fight for ourselves.

268
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,120
Miss Yue, you're truly wise.

269
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,720
Lingyun.

270
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,120
Work on it.

271
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:26,296
Understood.

272
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,160
Where is Shifang?

273
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,120
He went to check on the gadgets
at the Jiqiao Hall.

274
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,280
It's his birthday.

275
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:41,600
Never mind.

276
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,399
Get to business.

277
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:58,040
Come in.

278
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,680
Senior Xian Qing?

279
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:27,640
(Ju Shifang.)

280
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,200
(I've entrusted the way
to undermine Zhu Yu)

281
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,680
(to someone trustworthy.)

282
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,080
(Come at 13:15)

283
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,999
(to the river shore of Jing'an)

284
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,200
(if you're interested.)

285
00:20:02,388 --> 00:20:03,768
(Ming Xiu)

286
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:35,560
Hello?

287
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,960
Hello?

288
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:57,599
Cang Feng.

289
00:20:58,399 --> 00:20:59,560
You delivered the letter?

290
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,719
Then Miss Ming...

291
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,239
I asked her to meet me tomorrow.

292
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,920
(Ju Shifang)
The note said

293
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,280
if I was ready to sacrifice myself,

294
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,440
you could help us undermine Kun's power.

295
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,008
It's from my master.

296
00:21:23,004 --> 00:21:24,404
(The bottle contains Yue Qi's blood.)

297
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,040
(Yue Qi and Zhu Yu are bonded by blood.)

298
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:31,080
(Her blood is the key
to removing the Bloodbinding.)

299
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,919
(Smudge the blood on Shuo Xuan)

300
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,320
(and injure her)

301
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,560
(so that she enters the Core
of the Demon Realm for treatment.)

302
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,480
(Yue Qi's blood)

303
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:43,080
(and the power of Rehai)

304
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:45,159
(will remove the Bloodbinding)

305
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,839
(between Zhu Yu and Mist Soul.)

306
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,359
(Zhu Yu's Vitality Energy
will drop massively)

307
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:57,359
(and that's
your best chance to kill her.)

308
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:59,920
M-Miss Shuo Xuan?

309
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,840
Does it have to be her?

310
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,160
Yes.

311
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,080
Shuo...

312
00:22:14,744 --> 00:22:15,512
You're hesitating.

313
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,599
If you're scared,

314
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,879
forget it.

315
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,759
So it's Shifang's birthday.

316
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,800
He never mentioned it.

317
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:35,599
Shifang

318
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:37,840
will be one year older tomorrow.

319
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,399
Mr. Zuo and Mr. Ying

320
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,280
were discussing the battle earlier.

321
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,879
It sounded like Mr. Zuo wanted to

322
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,239
celebrate Shifang's birthday.

323
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
But he may not have time for it.

324
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,759
When we toured around Jing'an at night,

325
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,239
I think he mentioned that

326
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:56,680
he would love to celebrate

327
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,040
his birthday just like Ming Xiu did.

328
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,759
What do you think?

329
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:07,719
Jing'an has become desolate.

330
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,239
A night tour

331
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:10,599
may only upset him.

332
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,999
Any other ideas?

333
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:19,440
How about this?

334
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,399
Let's get some things

335
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:22,359
and decorate this place before he

336
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,200
comes back.

337
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:25,040
Alright.

338
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:27,560
And we should make a noodle with an egg.

339
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:32,920
Miss Shuo Xuan.

340
00:23:51,239 --> 00:23:51,800
I got this.

341
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,999
Give it to me.

342
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:01,639
It contains

343
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:03,280
Little Yue's blood?

344
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,239
Yes.

345
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:09,639
Jinzhao and Xian Qing
told us to be careful.

346
00:24:10,719 --> 00:24:11,479
The Hengdao Sect

347
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,560
may send the removal method

348
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,879
to Mist Soul regardless of our safety.

349
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,639
But I guess they don't know

350
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,560
that it should be you.

351
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,920
Jinzhao and Little Yue
are the keys to taking down Zhu Yu.

352
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,519
And

353
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:30,399
Luo Maiming cares about Zhaoyan.

354
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:31,399
So...

355
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,759
only Xian Qing, Miss Ming, and I

356
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:35,160
got the letter, right?

357
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,759
Not the wolf demon.

358
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:39,879
Then...

359
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,759
So if I make it,

360
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,080
Miss Ming won't take the risk, right?

361
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,879
I can't guarantee that.

362
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:27,032
(Jiqiao Hall)

363
00:25:38,193 --> 00:25:42,808
(Jiqiao Hall)

364
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,599
I just tried my new...

365
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,879
gadget.

366
00:26:05,008 --> 00:26:06,427
(Stay Focused and collected)

367
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,320
Nobody's here?

368
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,920
That's better.

369
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:16,600
That's better.

370
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,239
That's better.

371
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:27,200
That's better.

372
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:33,479
Shifang.

373
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,280
Yang.

374
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,800
In trouble again?

375
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,519
N-No.

376
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:46,359
Our leader wants to see you.

377
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,800
What's wrong?

378
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:02,519
Come on in.

379
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,399
Shifang.

380
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:41,680
Go ahead.

381
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,599
It's your 20th birthday.

382
00:27:57,879 --> 00:28:00,040
I'm supposed to hold a ceremony for you.

383
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,999
But it's a critical time
with the battle pending.

384
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:07,960
So I downsized it.

385
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:11,599
From now on,

386
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,840
you'll be a real adult.

387
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,920
I wish you longevity

388
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,200
and happiness.

389
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,320
Get up.

390
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,840
You've grown up.

391
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:00,920
Shifang.

392
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,879
Shifang.

393
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,519
Happy birthday.

394
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:05,560
Shifang, happy birthday.

395
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,440
Mr. Zuo.

396
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,800
I still have many things to do.

397
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,960
Enjoy the night.

398
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:26,119
Alright.

399
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,719
Shifang, happy birthday.

400
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Let's drink tomorrow.

401
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:37,840
Come on.

402
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,680
Come on.

403
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:43,280
Sit.

404
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,680
Shifang, happy birthday.

405
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,200
Look.

406
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,479
Ming Xiu

407
00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:52,320
made the noodles for you.

408
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:53,639
Dig in.

409
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:01,999
Ming Xiu.

410
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,280
It's your birthday.

411
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,200
Happy birthday.

412
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,108
(So if I make it,)

413
00:30:11,427 --> 00:30:13,347
(Miss Ming won't take the risk, right?)

414
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,879
Shifang, happy birthday.

415
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:19,999
Rest assured,

416
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,680
we'll be celebrating

417
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,440
all your birthdays with you

418
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,200
every year from now on.

419
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,119
Yeah.

420
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:28,680
The birthday boy

421
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,560
has to make a wish.

422
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,200
Come on.

423
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:31,519
Make a wish.

424
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,200
Make a wish.

425
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:32,680
Hurry.

426
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,440
My wish is to become

427
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,680
a great gadget technician like my mom

428
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,399
and

429
00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:15,879
to gather for birthdays

430
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,960
like we're doing right now.

431
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,519
What's wrong?

432
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,479
Make a wish.

433
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:02,160
Shifang.

434
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,519
What's wrong?

435
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:05,719
What's wrong?

436
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,840
Nothing.

437
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,479
I...

438
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
I haven't celebrated my birthday

439
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,280
with such a big crowd for many years.

440
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:28,320
Wen Yang used to keep me company.

441
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,119
And our leader, sometimes.

442
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,519
But they've been very busy.

443
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,479
I celebrated my birthday alone
most of the years.

444
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,479
But it's alright now.

445
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:46,080
I have you.

446
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,479
It's the first time

447
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,680
I'm celebrating my birthday
with so many friends.

448
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,359
I think my life

449
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,719
is worth it.

450
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:56,999
Yeah.

451
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,479
Come on.

452
00:32:58,879 --> 00:32:59,399
Shifang.

453
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:01,280
We'll celebrate your birthday

454
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:04,639
with you every year from now on.

455
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,080
Be good.

456
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:10,040
Dig in.

457
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:11,160
Try it.

458
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:18,119
Okay.

459
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,639
Then...

460
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,639
Then...

461
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,440
it's a deal.

462
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,599
You'll celebrate

463
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:28,320
my birthday every year.

464
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,160
This day every year.

465
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,960
I won't change at all.

466
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,320
No problem.

467
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:42,200
You want a demon spell

468
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,599
to stay young forever.

469
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,519
It's Shifang's birthday.

470
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,560
We need alcohol.

471
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,479
Let's get wasted.

472
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:54,800
Alright.

473
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:05,519
Come on.

474
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,359
- Shifang.
- Shifang.

475
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,999
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

476
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,920
I must send the removal method

477
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,080
to the Mist Soul inside Kun.

478
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:19,160
That's the only way
for Jinzhao and the others

479
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,800
to stop the madness of Zhu Yu.

480
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:23,840
I can do this.

481
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:25,719
I have to.

482
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,680
I have to.

483
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,200
Mr. Gu died for me at the headquarters

484
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,359
of the Qiyuan Sect.

485
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:35,359
It's my turn

486
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:37,599
to protect you.

487
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,119
It's my turn to protect you.

488
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,759
Mother,

489
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,639
you'll be watching me from heaven.

490
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,719
Right?

491
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,439
I'm crying?

492
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,360
So embarrassing.

493
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,439
Dou Bao.

494
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:38,360
Let's go.

495
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,560
Enemy approaching.

496
00:36:59,239 --> 00:36:59,679
Wait.

497
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,159
Hasn't he been to

498
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,800
the Sea of Clear Skies
with our young lord?

499
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:04,519
It's weird.

500
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,999
Why did he come here alone?

501
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,600
General said that

502
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:10,120
the young lord had betrayed us.

503
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,040
Her friends are our enemies.

504
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,199
Get him. Go.

505
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,080
Go.

506
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,560
Stop!

507
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:18,880
Get him.

508
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,040
Understood.

509
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:48,400
Ju Shifang.

510
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,679
You shouldn't be here.

511
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,679
We're enemies, not friends.

512
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,999
I won't show mercy

513
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,880
on the battlefield.

514
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:57,999
I want to...

515
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,800
I want to see Miss Shuo Xuan.

516
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:02,719
You think you can just
ask to see our lord?

517
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:04,759
Who do you think you are?

518
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,232
Take him away.

519
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,120
