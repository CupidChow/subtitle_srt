Ju Shifang.

00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:06,963
You shouldn't be here.

23
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,282
We're enemies, not friends.

00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:10,523
I won't show mercy

25
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:12,002
on the battlefield.

26
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:14,243
I want to...

27
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:16,123
I want to see Miss Shuo Xuan.

28
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,722
You think you can just
ask to see our lord?

29
00:02:19,882 --> 00:02:21,123
Who do you think you are?

30
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:22,328
Take him away.

31
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:25,243
Let go.

32
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:34,602
Shuo Xuan.

33
00:02:36,842 --> 00:02:38,002
Why bother catching a loser?

34
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:46,963
Why are you here?

35
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:49,363
I...

36
00:02:50,282 --> 00:02:51,203
I came here...

37
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:53,243
Miss Shuo Xuan.

38
00:02:54,282 --> 00:02:55,363
I'm here to challenge you.

39
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,083
You?

40
00:02:58,483 --> 00:02:59,162
I know.

41
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:00,803
You think I'm a loser.

42
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:03,562
But I have to stop you.

43
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:06,083
You have the key ring of Rehai, right?

44
00:03:06,162 --> 00:03:08,042
Can you stop eyeing Rehai?

45
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:09,683
Ying Xuwei said

46
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,403
that he had enough Qiyuan Orbs.

47
00:03:11,762 --> 00:03:12,243
You fool!

48
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:14,203
You think you can stop us?

49
00:03:14,523 --> 00:03:15,643
Don't try to be a hero.

50
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:16,523
I'm not trying.

51
00:03:17,683 --> 00:03:19,243
I'm just doing what I want

52
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:21,162
and protecting people I care about.

53
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:23,203
You said that

54
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:26,083
the people of the Yu Clan value

55
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:27,442
absolute power.

56
00:03:28,203 --> 00:03:29,442
I'd like to challenge you now.

57
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:30,923
If I win,

58
00:03:30,923 --> 00:03:33,042
you will listen to me
and not open up Rehai.

59
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:34,322
Otherwise...

60
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,322
Otherwise...

61
00:03:37,523 --> 00:03:39,203
Otherwise, you're not a hero.

62
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:41,602
Madman.

63
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,083
You can kill him.

64
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:47,282
But don't make fun of his resolution.

65
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:50,643
Say no more.

66
00:03:51,403 --> 00:03:51,842
Let him go.

67
00:04:23,843 --> 00:04:26,123
You still have time to take it back.

68
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:31,002
I won't take it back.

69
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:32,642
I will win.

70
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:25,962
Dou Bao.

71
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:27,522
Dou Bao.

72
00:05:29,202 --> 00:05:29,642
Dou Bao.

73
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:31,762
Dou Bao.

74
00:05:32,962 --> 00:05:33,562
Dou Bao.

75
00:05:37,723 --> 00:05:38,243
Dou Bao.

76
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:45,202
Dou Bao.

77
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:50,043
Dou Bao.

78
00:05:58,082 --> 00:05:58,723
You lost.

79
00:06:15,762 --> 00:06:16,803
Won't you give up?

80
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:20,483
I once said that

81
00:06:22,043 --> 00:06:22,962
if we had to

82
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:24,962
fight each other one day,

83
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:27,562
I'd lead you to the right path.

84
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:29,723
But I've said that

85
00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:32,642
I'm already walking the right path.

86
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:34,522
Miss Shuo Xuan.

87
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,283
Do you remember?

88
00:06:38,202 --> 00:06:39,843
When we first met,

89
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:41,843
you said that

90
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:44,723
if I went close to you,

91
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:47,402
you'd tear me apart.

92
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:50,082
If you come close to me again,

93
00:06:50,762 --> 00:06:52,683
I'll tear you apart.

94
00:06:58,123 --> 00:06:58,923
I remember that.

95
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:56,002
I may not have a chance

96
00:07:57,002 --> 00:07:58,923
to say it out loud if I don't do it now.

97
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:01,723
I'm timid,

98
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:04,683
weak, and selfish.

99
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,202
But I've

100
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:12,882
always been

101
00:08:13,882 --> 00:08:15,923
following your steps,

102
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:19,043
and I've been

103
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:20,762
dreaming

104
00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:23,882
of being a hero or a great man that

105
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:25,843
you'd respect.

106
00:08:59,203 --> 00:08:59,802
It's...

107
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:01,402
It's just that

108
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,642
we hold different sets of values.

109
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:06,483
So...

110
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:08,443
So we're bound

111
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:10,922
to be enemies.

112
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:32,802
Ju Shifang.

113
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:33,723
Enough!

114
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:35,802
No matter how it ends,

115
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:37,402
I admire your courage.

116
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:38,522
Go back.

117
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:47,603
Surrender.

118
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,323
This is not a fight.

119
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:50,963
It's a suicide.

120
00:10:18,522 --> 00:10:19,963
Ju Shifang, stop there.

121
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:22,882

122
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:25,802

(It feels kind of awkward)

148
00:12:10,682 --> 00:12:12,483
(to write down your names like this.)

149
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:16,882
(I'd been hiding)

150
00:12:17,882 --> 00:12:19,603
(in my little world before I met you.)

151
00:12:21,522 --> 00:12:23,083

I've been dreaming that one day

182
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:04,002
you'll use my invention.

183
00:15:05,522 --> 00:15:07,243
I couldn't face it.

184
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,203
I'm useless and selfish

185
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:13,563
and almost got Mr. Gu killed.

186
00:15:15,443 --> 00:15:17,282
Sorry, Jinzhao.

187
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:20,603
But I want to do better.

00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,443
You'll celebrate

193
00:15:40,203 --> 00:15:42,203
my birthday every year.

194
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:45,042
This day every year.

♪Under the sycamore tree♪

196
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:49,656

198
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:56,939

209
00:16:58,843 --> 00:16:59,323
Shuo Xuan.

210
00:16:59,963 --> 00:17:00,642
Are you alright?

211
00:17:01,282 --> 00:17:02,843
I won't disrupt Her Lordship's plan.

212
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:06,003
Rest and be better.

213
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:07,402
Right.

214
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:10,442
Have you performed the Meditation Spell

215
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,283
on Her Lordship again?

216
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:15,123
It didn't work again.

217
00:17:18,323 --> 00:17:19,803
You're still restless.

218
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:23,642
Cultivate yourself while you're resting.

219
00:17:29,242 --> 00:17:29,843
Lin Yuan.

220
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:35,323
How did he manage to do that?

221
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:39,722
Wasn't he a coward?

222
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:42,722
Do you still

223
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:47,003
think of him as a coward?

224
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:08,323
Miss Shuo Xuan.

225
00:18:09,242 --> 00:18:10,563
This is for you.

226
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,482
I'm not interested in these things.

227
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:21,323
I got a nice name

228
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:22,962
for this Luban lock.

229
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:24,962
"To An Acquaintance."

230
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:29,402
You always brush me off with some

231
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:30,442
useless gadget.

232
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,763
I-I just...

233
00:19:04,803 --> 00:19:05,763
You like me?

234
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:07,563
(Well,)

235
00:19:07,603 --> 00:19:08,603
(I saw you...)

236
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:11,722
(We admire heroes and warriors.)

237
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:12,803
(You...)

238
00:19:13,242 --> 00:19:14,882
(You're a coward
who can't even defeat me.)

239
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:17,043
(I've become...)

240
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:19,043
(much better than before.)

241
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:22,642
(If being a great hero needs)

242
00:19:22,882 --> 00:19:24,242
(to sacrifice many lives,)

243
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:26,442
(I will give up being a hero.)

244
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:31,722
(I've always dreamed)

245
00:19:32,642 --> 00:19:34,442
(of being a hero or a great man that)

246
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,003
(you'd respect.)

247
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:38,003
(It's just that)

248
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:40,962
(we hold different sets of values.)

249
00:19:42,202 --> 00:19:43,803
(We're bound to be enemies.)

250
00:19:46,722 --> 00:19:47,563
(Miss Shuo Xuan.)

251
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:49,003
(I...)

252
00:19:50,162 --> 00:19:51,242
(I just want to say)

253
00:19:53,123 --> 00:19:53,843
(sorry.)

254
00:19:56,682 --> 00:19:57,882
To an acquaintance.

255
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:03,523
You fool.

256
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,922
To an acquaintance.

257
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:15,202
Ms. Ge.

258
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,402
Is that true?

259
00:20:18,162 --> 00:20:19,922
My mom was a member of the Hengdao Sect?

260
00:20:21,283 --> 00:20:21,803
That's right.

261
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:24,523
She left the design

262
00:20:24,563 --> 00:20:26,922
of Dou Bao at Yujie Hub.

263
00:20:28,202 --> 00:20:29,202
The Hengdao Sect was

264
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:31,043
founded to pass on the techniques.

265
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:32,962
It gathered

266
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:35,202
those who love gadgets.

267
00:20:35,563 --> 00:20:37,962
But the world is in grave danger,

268
00:20:38,523 --> 00:20:40,043
so we're up against Zhu Yu.

269
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:41,962
Then...

270
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,402
my mom was a master of gadgets,

271
00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:46,083
right?

272
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:47,922
Of course.

273
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:50,763
She was really talented.

274
00:20:55,162 --> 00:20:56,283
She even

275
00:20:56,962 --> 00:20:59,442
designed this arm for me.

276
00:21:01,682 --> 00:21:02,202
Then...

277
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,123
Then why...

278
00:21:04,242 --> 00:21:05,803
Why did she leave the Hengdao Sect?

279
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,682
She fell in love with someone.

280
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,482
Twenty years ago,

281
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:16,803
your mom

282
00:21:17,722 --> 00:21:19,003
left the Yujie Hub

283
00:21:19,242 --> 00:21:21,083
to seek further development of gadgets.

284
00:21:22,043 --> 00:21:22,642
One day,

285
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,642
she sent a letter to Yujie Hub saying

286
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:28,922
that she met someone and no longer

287
00:21:29,843 --> 00:21:31,603
wanted to wander the world.

288
00:21:40,803 --> 00:21:42,363
I was young when my mom

289
00:21:43,283 --> 00:21:44,123
passed away.

290
00:21:46,962 --> 00:21:49,603
There are many things I don't remember.

291
00:21:51,363 --> 00:21:52,202
And

292
00:21:52,763 --> 00:21:54,803
I'm only left with Dou Bao.

293
00:21:57,962 --> 00:21:58,442
Your mom

294
00:21:59,323 --> 00:22:00,482
always said that

295
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:04,803
the gadget technique
was not about making a living,

296
00:22:05,363 --> 00:22:07,642
but about benefiting the people.

297
00:22:08,523 --> 00:22:09,083
I'd like to

298
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:10,962
pass on this teaching to you.

299
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,323
I have to talk to Luohuan.

300
00:22:17,162 --> 00:22:17,763
See you.

301
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:21,043
Thank you, Ms. Ge.

302
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:42,603
Mom.

303
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:45,722
I will make something

304
00:22:46,962 --> 00:22:48,123
more awesome.

305
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:54,162
Shuo Xuan has the key ring of Rehai.

306
00:22:54,803 --> 00:22:57,083
I will make her recover before Rehai

307
00:22:57,283 --> 00:22:58,363
reaches Zangfeng Plains.

308
00:22:59,192 --> 00:23:00,120
Thank you, Your Lordship.

309
00:23:02,744 --> 00:23:03,224
Your Lordship.

310
00:23:03,992 --> 00:23:05,402
The Hengdao Sect
and the Zhengwu Alliance

311
00:23:05,642 --> 00:23:06,962
have been watching us.

312
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:09,242
We'll be under attack

313
00:23:10,043 --> 00:23:11,283
once we open up Rehai.

314
00:23:14,003 --> 00:23:14,763
It's alright.

315
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:17,482
The Hengdao Sect is focusing

316
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,043
on the Zangfeng Plains.

317
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:19,922
Your Lordship.

318
00:23:20,642 --> 00:23:21,803
Why don't we launch an attack

319
00:23:22,162 --> 00:23:23,043
on Yujie Hub

320
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:25,003
to snatch their Qiyuan Orbs?

321
00:23:29,523 --> 00:23:31,603
The dark feelings of humans
will corrupt my mind

322
00:23:33,043 --> 00:23:36,162
if I keep consuming Qiyuan Orbs.

323
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:38,363
Say no more.

324
00:23:39,603 --> 00:23:41,642
Make sure everything goes perfectly.

325
00:23:43,242 --> 00:23:43,642
Understood.

326
00:23:57,962 --> 00:23:59,323
Qiyuan Orbs.

327
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:02,722
If I want to

328
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,083
satisfy my hunger,

329
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:09,202
the Qiyuan Orbs are not enough.

330
00:24:26,843 --> 00:24:28,682
(It's about
the life and death of our clan.)

331
00:24:29,962 --> 00:24:31,003
(I wish you were)

332
00:24:31,882 --> 00:24:33,882
(still that benevolent mythical beast.)

333
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:11,563
Xiu.

334
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:14,442
Are you bothered?

335
00:25:18,442 --> 00:25:18,962
Uncle,

336
00:25:21,763 --> 00:25:22,763
I received a letter

337
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:27,083
before Mr. Ju passed away.

338
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:44,363
(Come at 13:15
to the river shore of Jing'an.)

339
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:56,123
I've seen

340
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:58,682
this handwriting
in Luo's secret chamber.

341
00:26:00,482 --> 00:26:01,242
Luo Maiming.

342
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:04,642
It's him.

343
00:26:08,563 --> 00:26:10,363
Only Shifang and you got this letter?

344
00:26:19,482 --> 00:26:20,043
Xiu.

345
00:26:21,202 --> 00:26:22,962
I haven't seen you like this for years.

346
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:35,123
I guess

347
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:37,803
you're thinking

348
00:26:39,323 --> 00:26:40,803
that if you had done something,

349
00:26:42,202 --> 00:26:43,482
Shifang may not be dead.

350
00:26:44,722 --> 00:26:45,043
Right?

351
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:54,722
Don't be confused.

352
00:26:55,843 --> 00:26:58,043
What has happened can't be changed.

353
00:27:01,442 --> 00:27:02,482
It's like a fantasy

354
00:27:03,003 --> 00:27:03,682
or an illusion.

355
00:27:04,882 --> 00:27:05,642
Delving into it

356
00:27:06,882 --> 00:27:08,642
will only stop you from progressing.

357
00:27:18,202 --> 00:27:18,722
I won't.

358
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:21,442
You're a tough girl.

359
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:23,283
Good for you.

360
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:34,803
If it was Luo Maiming's plan,

361
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,123
I should be the one

362
00:27:39,922 --> 00:27:40,922
sent to die.

363
00:27:42,242 --> 00:27:43,402
Why didn't I get a letter?

364
00:27:47,283 --> 00:27:47,843
Uncle,

365
00:27:48,722 --> 00:27:49,803
I don't think Luo Maiming

366
00:27:50,442 --> 00:27:51,722
had the heart to kill you.

367
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:53,242
Why not?

368
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:56,043
Why wouldn't he?

369
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:03,242
(I see.)

370
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:05,283
(I see.)

371
00:28:07,123 --> 00:28:08,843
(Luo Maiming, you're so shrewd.)

372
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,563
(He entrusted Zhaoyan to me.)

373
00:28:13,843 --> 00:28:15,922
(She's the one he cares about the most.)

374
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:22,722
Uncle.

375
00:28:25,763 --> 00:28:26,722
Don't worry about me.

376
00:28:28,162 --> 00:28:28,682
It's late.

377
00:28:29,363 --> 00:28:30,123
Go to bed.

378
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:34,083
Let's head back to Yujie Hub tomorrow.

379
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:31,363
The Zhengwu Alliance
is heading to Zangfeng Plains.

380
00:29:32,843 --> 00:29:34,083
Just like Shifang, they're

381
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:35,922
risking themselves

382
00:29:37,202 --> 00:29:39,083
to earn us a chance to kill Zhu Yu.

383
00:29:40,003 --> 00:29:40,803
There will be casualties

384
00:29:41,442 --> 00:29:42,563
in the battle against Kun.

385
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:45,043
But it hasn't even started,

386
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:47,323
and Shifang has...

387
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:53,323
The deceased is gone.

388
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,202
The survivors should live on.

389
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:57,003
Shifang left us a lot more

390
00:29:57,843 --> 00:29:59,162
than a painful memory.

391
00:30:04,363 --> 00:30:05,283
Speaking of which,

392
00:30:06,202 --> 00:30:07,482
when I first met him,

393
00:30:08,363 --> 00:30:09,722
he was peeking at
Shuo Xuan in the shower

394
00:30:10,962 --> 00:30:12,402
and got kicked into the water.

395
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:24,603
He showed me what a friend was like.

396
00:30:26,043 --> 00:30:26,482
Yeah.

397
00:30:29,083 --> 00:30:29,563
Strange.

398
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:33,523
Since when did I stop

399
00:30:34,962 --> 00:30:37,003
finding him weak and timid?

400
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:41,402
I'm not even surprised

401
00:30:44,202 --> 00:30:45,523
that he ended up like this.

402
00:30:47,442 --> 00:30:47,962
Yeah.

403
00:30:50,202 --> 00:30:50,803
We are

404
00:30:52,123 --> 00:30:53,642
not who we used to be.

405
00:31:03,323 --> 00:31:05,363
I have to save the world from Zhu Yu.

406
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:10,642
Jinzhao.

407
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:13,162
I'm not afraid.

408
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:22,242
We are not afraid.

409
00:31:36,922 --> 00:31:38,083
Two of you

410
00:31:38,283 --> 00:31:39,922
will die soon.

411
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,323
W-What do you mean?

412
00:31:42,682 --> 00:31:43,843
Don't try to scare us.

413
00:32:01,162 --> 00:32:02,123
This is the main control.

414
00:32:07,402 --> 00:32:08,123
Did you

415
00:32:09,283 --> 00:32:10,283
send Shifang to die?

416
00:32:11,882 --> 00:32:14,442
We needed to send
Yue Qi's blood to Mist Soul.

417
00:32:15,323 --> 00:32:17,482
We had to get access to Zhu Yu

418
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:18,482
through Shuo Xuan.

419
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:21,642
So Shifang had to be sacrificed?

420
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:25,242
If we can't stop Zhu Yu,

421
00:32:25,922 --> 00:32:26,882
everybody will die.

422
00:32:28,003 --> 00:32:30,043
It's just a matter of time.

423
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:51,323
This is the light turret
we'll use to attack Kun.

424
00:32:52,722 --> 00:32:55,803
I'll operate it in person tomorrow.

425
00:32:58,363 --> 00:32:59,563
For the Mortal Realm,

426
00:33:00,242 --> 00:33:01,882
I'll try my best to stop Zhu Yu.

427
00:33:04,323 --> 00:33:07,202
The Zhengwu Alliance will reach
Zangfeng Plains tomorrow.

428
00:33:12,442 --> 00:33:13,123
(Zhu Yu.)

429
00:33:14,563 --> 00:33:16,242
(The final battle will be tomorrow.)

430
00:33:19,147 --> 00:33:22,923
(Vast and boundless)

431
00:33:33,162 --> 00:33:34,402
Drinking alone makes you sulky.

432
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:36,202
Drinking together is a pleasure.

433
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,162
I never drink alone.

434
00:33:39,682 --> 00:33:40,363
I don't believe you.

435
00:33:42,482 --> 00:33:43,442
Whatever.

436
00:34:26,403 --> 00:34:28,563
You threw this coin
after so much hesitation.

437
00:34:29,123 --> 00:34:29,842
Won't you take a look?

438
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:43,242
No need.

439
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:46,762
Thanks for the wine.

440
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:56,162
Hanjiang.

441
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:58,322
It occurs to me

442
00:34:59,483 --> 00:35:02,282
that Jinzhao has your temperament.

443
00:35:15,123 --> 00:35:15,642
Mr. Yue.

444
00:35:16,242 --> 00:35:17,043
What's wrong?

445
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:18,202
Miss Ming.

446
00:35:18,802 --> 00:35:19,883
If anything happens to me,

447
00:35:19,963 --> 00:35:20,443
please

448
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:21,802
take care of Qi.

449
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:24,162
Why?

450
00:35:24,963 --> 00:35:26,963
You always fight together.

451
00:35:27,563 --> 00:35:28,603
She won't be safe

452
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:29,963
if anything happens to you.

453
00:35:30,043 --> 00:35:30,682
Not really.

454
00:35:31,722 --> 00:35:32,883
Qi has grown up.

455
00:35:33,202 --> 00:35:34,403
Even if I'm not there,

456
00:35:34,682 --> 00:35:35,202
she'll be fine

457
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,483
around you.

458
00:35:38,322 --> 00:35:38,923
Jinzhao.

459
00:35:39,682 --> 00:35:40,722
You don't believe in fate.

460
00:35:43,162 --> 00:35:43,842
What is fate?

461
00:35:45,322 --> 00:35:46,642
Even if I knew the result,

462
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:49,242
I'd do my best to fight for it.

463
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,403
So anyway,

464
00:35:52,043 --> 00:35:53,923
I'll bear the consequences tomorrow.

465
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:57,963
I didn't expect you

466
00:35:58,443 --> 00:35:59,642
to be so insightful.

467
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,443
Anything is possible.

468
00:36:04,322 --> 00:36:04,802
What if?

469
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,043
If anything goes wrong,

470
00:36:07,563 --> 00:36:08,923
I'll entrust

471
00:36:09,523 --> 00:36:10,722
the mythical beast to you.

472
00:36:11,923 --> 00:36:12,282
Goodbye.

473
00:36:18,563 --> 00:36:19,923
The gadgets of Yujie Hub

474
00:36:20,483 --> 00:36:22,083
can attack the physical form of Kun.

475
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,242
But it's a mythical beast.

476
00:36:24,802 --> 00:36:26,722
The attack has to
land on the weakest spot

477
00:36:26,722 --> 00:36:27,483
to work.

478
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:30,123
You've observed Zhu Yu for years

479
00:36:30,762 --> 00:36:31,722
and came up with

480
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:32,963
three possible spots

481
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:34,483
without certainty.

482
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:36,242
The stored energy

483
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:39,362
allows the Yujie Hub
to launch three attacks.

484
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:42,322
I didn't say yes.

485
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,523
I also have someone to protect.

486
00:36:53,642 --> 00:36:54,523
I can do it, too.

487
00:37:05,762 --> 00:37:06,242
So?

488
00:37:06,242 --> 00:37:07,003
Did you find her?

489
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:08,722
I can't find Ming Xiu anywhere.

490
00:37:09,202 --> 00:37:10,282
Where can she be?

491
00:37:10,923 --> 00:37:12,603
Ming Xiu is a careful person.

492
00:37:12,883 --> 00:37:14,162
Was she compelled to leave?

493
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:17,563
Ever since Hanjiang

494
00:37:18,242 --> 00:37:18,762
passed away,

495
00:37:18,762 --> 00:37:20,443
nobody could contain her.

496
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,362
I was negligent.

497
00:37:23,043 --> 00:37:23,682
We must not delay.

498
00:37:24,003 --> 00:37:24,802
I'll open up Rehai.

499
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,563
Try to enter Mist Soul.

500
00:37:26,642 --> 00:37:27,483
Let's split up.

501
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:29,043
No, we shouldn't.

502
00:37:29,802 --> 00:37:30,642
Yeah, Zhaoyan.

503
00:37:30,842 --> 00:37:31,722
Let's stick together.

504
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:33,443
Yeah, we can't split up.

505
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:38,443
Okay.

506
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,322
Let's face it together.

507
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:01,362
Rehai

508
00:38:02,202 --> 00:38:03,682
has moved to Zangfeng Plains.

509
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:07,923
Zhu Yu will take Shuo Xuan there.

510
00:38:09,443 --> 00:38:11,162
According to our plan,

511
00:38:11,802 --> 00:38:13,802
when Shuo Xuan uses the fake key ring

512
00:38:13,802 --> 00:38:15,443
to open up Rehai,

513
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,043
Luo Zhaoyan will open up Rehai, too.

514
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:19,483
Right then,

515
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:20,362
Zhu Yu will

516
00:38:20,362 --> 00:38:22,123
unexpectedly absorb the power of Rehai.

517
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,963
The unbinding spell will be activated

518
00:38:25,242 --> 00:38:26,802
and Zhu Yu will lose
Vitality Energy fast.

519
00:38:29,362 --> 00:38:30,883
I hope it goes well.

520
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:39,339
(Zangfeng Plains)

521
00:38:44,842 --> 00:38:47,083
If you don't come to your senses,

522
00:38:47,963 --> 00:38:50,563
the Zhengwu Alliance
will fight you to the end.

523
00:38:50,883 --> 00:38:52,282
Mr. Zuo, you're a heroic man.

524
00:38:52,802 --> 00:38:53,722
If we weren't enemies,

525
00:38:54,043 --> 00:38:55,403
I'd make friends with you.

526
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:56,642
We're enemies.

527
00:38:57,443 --> 00:38:58,083
Save it.

528
00:38:59,403 --> 00:38:59,762
Alright.

529
00:39:05,883 --> 00:39:06,362
