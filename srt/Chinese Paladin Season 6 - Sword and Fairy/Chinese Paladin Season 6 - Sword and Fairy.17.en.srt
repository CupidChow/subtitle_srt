00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:20,159
(Sorry, Zhu Yu.)

22
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:22,079
(But I need to enter
your sea of awareness.)

23
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,919
(I must figure out something.)

24
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,559
(So this is her sea of awareness?)

25
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,519
Zhu Yu.

26
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,799
How did you get in here?

27
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,879
Zhu Yu,

28
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,479
I learned the Meditation Spell
from the texts.

29
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:33,879
I'm sorry

30
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,519
for entering without permission.

31
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,559
The Meditation Spell?

32
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,239
What do you want to do now?

33
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,360
I want to know

34
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:46,720
if there's really a way
to undo the Husheng Spell.

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,960
Husheng Spell?

36
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,159
Is it for that ridiculous human?

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,280
Jinzhao is not ridiculous.

38
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:55,720
Don't say that.

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,040
Selfish, hypocritical, greedy, angry.

40
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,199
Humans fight

41
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,360
and kill

42
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,880
for their own interest.

43
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,640
Is there anything humans won't do?

44
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,440
Zhu Yu,

45
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,600
why would you say such things?

46
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,119
Why can't I?

47
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,640
Humans are the only ones

48
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,640
on this earth who can blush

49
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,959
and who need to blush.

50
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:27,000
You entered my sea
of awareness for a human.

51
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,440
That's just despicable!

52
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,568
You are not Zhu Yu.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,128
I have to leave.

54
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:36,120
Don't leave.

55
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,839
Since you're here, don't leave.

56
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,600
Better stay and keep me company.

57
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,280
After all, the Husheng Spell
can't be undone.

58
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,759
Why bother staying with humans?

59
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,136
What?

60
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,919
The Husheng Spell doesn't exist at all.

61
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,679
There is no Husheng Spell?

62
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:07,832
Let me out!

63
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,679
Qi.

64
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,679
(It's Qi.)

65
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,440
What's wrong, Jinzhao?

66
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,520
Nothing. You guys go ahead.

67
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,039
Are you sure?

68
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,319
Qi,

69
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:03,000
is that you?

70
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:13,440
What happened to you?

71
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,200
Qingfei.

72
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,160
Xuwei.

73
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,959
Our spies just told us

74
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,880
Qi was accidentally injured
by Zhu Yu yesterday.

75
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,079
Injured?

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
This time, when you see Zhu Yu,

77
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:46,320
you must remind her
to abide by our agreement

78
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,519
and make sure Qi leaves there
as soon as possible.

79
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,639
Understood.

80
00:06:55,686 --> 00:06:58,712
(Core of the Demon Realm,
Sea of Clear Skies)

81
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:19,359
Your Lordship,
you have been here all night.

82
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:20,720
You should rest.

83
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,480
The young lord will surely recover.

84
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,280
(For Yue Jinzhao,
you even risked your safety)

85
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,440
(and entered my sea of awareness.)

86
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,839
Your Lordship.

87
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,200
The Hengdao Sect has sent people.

88
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,320
(Among the Nine Springs, Mist Soul)

89
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
(is the gloomiest
and most chaotic place in the world.)

90
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,399
(It has strong time energy,)

91
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,079
(so it can slow down time,)

92
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,040
(make people forget
their recent memories and...)

93
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,239
(Travel back in time.)

94
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,280
(Travel back in time.)

95
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,720
I heard Qi was injured.

96
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,559
Don't worry.

97
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,559
She's recuperating
in the Core of the Demon Realm.

98
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
She'll be fine in a few days.

99
00:08:31,384 --> 00:08:34,328
(Mist Soul inside the Core
of the Demon Realm)

100
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,480
Why would it be so serious?

101
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,720
(The spring's power has made
a connection with Qi?)

102
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,440
Master.

103
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,440
Master.

104
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,600
Master, can you please take me
to the Mortal Realm for fun?

105
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,784
Please.

106
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,496
Master.

107
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,720
Shouldn't we be at the Yujie Hub?

108
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:04,920
Where are we?

109
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,399
I got it.

110
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,000
You brought me to the Mortal Realm
I wanted to come to.

111
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,519
Qi,

112
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:19,760
who am I?

113
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,200
You are my master.

114
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,608
Huan.

115
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,600
You are the nicest person
in the world to me.

116
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,040
(Is it the power of Mist Soul)

117
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,800
(that brings the memory of Qi
back to three years ago?)

118
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,120
You thought I wouldn't recognize
you with a mask on?

119
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,079
This mask is so ugly.

120
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,920
(If this is a gift from heaven,)

121
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,199
(then allow me to indulge for a moment.)

122
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:19,079
Qi, do you remember Yue Jinzhao?

123
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,079
Who is Yue Jinzhao?

124
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,512
(I guessed it right.)

125
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:25,999
Don't think about that.

126
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,160
Let's hurry out

127
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,760
to see what's delicious and fun.

128
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:35,079
What's the matter?

129
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,800
Others mustn't see us.

130
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,600
I know.

131
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,759
We sneaked out from the Yujie Hub.

132
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,639
So we need to be careful.

133
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,040
Your Lordship,

134
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,879
we came this time
to deliver the Qiyuan Orbs for you.

135
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,560
But I also want to remind you.

136
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:02,879
Do you still remember the agreement?

137
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,879
Bian Luohuan
didn't keep his mask on tight,

138
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,240
which led Yue Jinzhao
and the others to find this place.

139
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,720
What right do you have
to hold us accountable?

140
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,600
He had a moment of carelessness

141
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,920
because he was trying to save Qi.

142
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,680
Your Lordship,
you would understand, right?

143
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,959
16 years ago,

144
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,959
in order to save your clan,

145
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,560
you bound Mist Soul with your own blood.

146
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:28,999
And my eldest brother,
as the guardian of Mist Soul,

147
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:30,800
to ensure the Nine Springs
would remain stable,

148
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,959
made an agreement with you.

149
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,560
You haven't forgotten all this,
have you?

150
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:37,959
Of course not.

151
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,079
You support the Qiyuan Sect

152
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,079
to provide Her Lordship
with the Qiyuan Orbs.

153
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:45,519
And Her Lordship had
our young lord taken away

154
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,240
by you as a hostage.

155
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,680
Over the years, Her Lordship
has never seen the young lord even once.

156
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,519
Isn't that enough?

157
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,439
But now, you keep Qi with you.

158
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,759
Are you going to break our agreement?

159
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,120
Sorry to be blunt,

160
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:09,280
but why is Qi injured?

161
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,680
Wasn't it you who hurt her?

162
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,519
Take a look.

163
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,959
Come on.

164
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:21,912
Just take a look.

165
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,480
Just take a look.

166
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:25,720
This one's not bad.

167
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,480
Do you like any of them?

168
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,439
Do you want it?

169
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,439
Qi, wait here for a moment.

170
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:38,560
Take a look.

171
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,319
How much are these two?

172
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,999
You're a stranger here, right?

173
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:49,120
We never

174
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,639
take money for goods here.

175
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,439
It's all about bartering.

176
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,079
Is this okay?

177
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,199
Yes.

178
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,560
Thanks.

179
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,720
Take care.

180
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:18,560
Give it a try.

181
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:23,680
Let me help you put it on.

182
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:31,672
Look at that.

183
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,800
It's so pretty.

184
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:41,176
Look over there.

185
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,639
Wanna take a look?

186
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,120
This is a Green Conch.
It's not ordinary.

187
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,240
It can record any sound.

188
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,160
Here, it's all about bartering.

189
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,079
I have nothing to my name.

190
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Nothing can be used for trade.

191
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,879
Are these okay?

192
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,784
No.

193
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:24,984
Master, you're so poor.

194
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,480
Girl, this can be traded.

195
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,680
This cannot be traded.

196
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:44,800
W-W-Why can't it be traded?

197
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,839
When did I get this?

198
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,160
(The power of Mist Soul is fading.)

199
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,160
(Time is running out.)

200
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,879
Qi, are you happy today?

201
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,280
Yes.

202
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,319
Today is my happiest day.

203
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:28,680
This is also my happiest day
in three years.

204
00:17:32,376 --> 00:17:33,360
Listen.

205
00:17:34,744 --> 00:17:36,839
I want to eat all the delicacies

206
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,959
and try all the fun things
in the Mortal Realm.

207
00:17:39,512 --> 00:17:41,240
I want to make many friends,

208
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,319
just like in the stories,

209
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,959
and go on adventures with them.

210
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,399
(You will.)

211
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:58,079
(I also want to listen to
storytelling, watch plays,)

212
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,480
(and see flowers in the sky.)

213
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,480
(You will.)

214
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,056
(I also want to...)

215
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,160
(You will.)

216
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,199
(The power of Mist Soul is fading.)

217
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,839
(And you're about to wake up soon.)

218
00:18:17,752 --> 00:18:20,669
♪Only through the eyes♪

219
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,439

223
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,199
Sleep.

224
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,720
When you wake up,

225
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,160
you will forget this all.

226
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,599
Whether Qi stays or leaves is up to her.

227
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,560
Huan, when did you get here?

228
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,399
Your Lordship,

229
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,800
I hope you will stick to our agreement.

230
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,359
I will consider it.

231
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:47,096
Don't worry.

232
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:49,400
Qi has fallen asleep.

233
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:54,840
Your Lordship,
as long as you keep your promise,

234
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,920
we will deliver the Qiyuan Orbs on time.

235
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,208
The young lord is fine.

236
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,399
It's just that there are
two masks beside her.

237
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,639
I will keep this orb

238
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:44,479
and study it carefully.

239
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,800
If I can develop something
that counters it,

240
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,719
it would be fortunate for the people.

241
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,320
Mr. Zuo,

242
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,239
Gao Xiao has already gone
to the headquarter,

243
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,200
leaving only Meng Cheng
as the scapegoat.

244
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,040
But we are already investigating

245
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,280
its exact location.

246
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:00,040
Good.

247
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:03,359
Once we know more about it,

248
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:04,879
we'll set off.

249
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:10,399
Thank you for your hard work today.

250
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,200
The two of you are tenacious

251
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,040
and incredible.

252
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:19,200
I wonder if you would like
to join our alliance.

253
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,639
Shifang,

254
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:25,920
this time you returned in glory.

255
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:28,560
You'll still be the head
of the Jiqiao Hall.

256
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,639
Thank you.

257
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:34,519
I will fulfill my duties
as the head in the future.

258
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,160
Miss Ming
has already joined our alliance.

259
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,399
Why don't you two join as well?

260
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,080
It would be a great pleasure

261
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,280
to join you,

262
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,680
but I'm the Master of the Luo family.

263
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,200
I'm afraid I can't.

264
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,320
I hope you can understand.

265
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:58,160
(Joining them is not a bad idea,)

266
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,239
(but they are in irreconcilable conflict
with demons.)

267
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,440
Mr. Zuo, I am used to wandering out.

268
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,879
I might have trouble adjusting.

269
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,479
Please let me think about it.

270
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,200
It's alright.

271
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:17,719
Our gate is always open to you.

272
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:19,759
Thank you.

273
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,680
What? Someone's thinking of you?

274
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,320
That would be great.

275
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:17,599
But you, Hanjiang,

276
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,200
you can't wait to see
tomorrow's sunrise, right?

277
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:23,080
At least,

278
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,399
it's more pleasing to the eye than you.

279
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:26,680
Who wouldn't want to see it?

280
00:23:43,224 --> 00:23:44,184
I'm going to Pureness.

281
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:09,260
You're awake.

282
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:18,099
How're you feeling?

283
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:21,848
Sore.

284
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,060
Like I was in a fight in my dream.

285
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,819
What happened yesterday?

286
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,660
I remember I used the Meditation Spell

287
00:24:37,939 --> 00:24:39,819
and entered your sea of awareness.

288
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,400
And then you...

289
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:52,900
Zhu Yu, there is no such thing
as the Husheng Spell,

290
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,140
right?

291
00:24:56,939 --> 00:24:57,660
You know now.

292
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,140
You lied to me.

293
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,339
I have my reasons.

294
00:25:18,699 --> 00:25:21,339
Then, what's the deal with you
in your sea of awareness?

295
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,020
Qi, don't ask anymore.

296
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:29,020
I don't want to lie to you.

297
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,900
Zhu Yu,

298
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:37,780
you're scary.

299
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,339
Rest here.

300
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,596
Zhaoyan, hope you're doing well.

301
00:26:31,224 --> 00:26:34,968
- Mount Yuqing...
- Mount Yuqing...

302
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:36,677
Jinzhao, Shifang,

303
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:40,376
I heard you calling my name.

304
00:26:40,376 --> 00:26:41,272
What happened?

305
00:26:42,872 --> 00:26:45,560
Well, Zhaoyan, sorry.

306
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,031
We opened the letter.

307
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:49,755
But I assure you
I only read the first line.

308
00:27:00,184 --> 00:27:02,872
(Zhaoyan, hope you're doing well.)

309
00:27:03,736 --> 00:27:04,760
(It's been a few days.)

310
00:27:05,496 --> 00:27:07,928
(I wonder how you guys have been.)

311
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,352
(Mount Yuqing has stunning cloud views,
and it's comfortable.)

312
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,272
(I'm looking out at Jing'an,)

313
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,064
(thinking everything there
must be fine.)

314
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:17,656
(Today is Xiu's birthday.)

315
00:27:17,944 --> 00:27:19,704
(Hanjiang and I are going there.)

316
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:22,968
(We're about to see each other,
and I'm glad about that.)

317
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:26,584
It's alright.

318
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:28,344
Senior Xian Qing says

319
00:27:28,344 --> 00:27:29,848
it is Ming Xiu's birthday

320
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:30,840
and that Mr. Gu will come.

321
00:27:31,576 --> 00:27:32,952
So it's Ming Xiu's birthday.

322
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:36,088
Birthday? Then we need
to prepare birthday gifts.

323
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,260
Excuse me.

324
00:28:01,701 --> 00:28:02,661
What is this for?

325
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,416
Today is the death anniversary
of our former queen, Ling Ye.

326
00:28:07,512 --> 00:28:09,248
A grand sacrificial ceremony
is being held ahead.

327
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,900
(Ling Ye?)

328
00:28:19,352 --> 00:28:20,280
Ling Ye?

329
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:27,260
Why is Zhu Yu called Ling Ye now?

330
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,821
You're leaving?

331
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:31,701
I haven't decided yet,

332
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,100
but I must tell Jinzhao

333
00:30:34,341 --> 00:30:35,780
that the Husheng thing is not real.

334
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:36,980
You mustn't leave.

335
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,100
That is my business.

336
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:40,541
What's it to you?

337
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:41,100
You!

338
00:30:42,421 --> 00:30:44,140
You come and go as you please.

339
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,620
What do you take this place for?

340
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:48,701
But all of you are lying to me.

341
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:51,341
If you leave, what about Her Lordship?

342
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,221
Haven't you seen how much she loves you?

343
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:00,260
But she shouldn't have lied to me.

344
00:31:01,701 --> 00:31:04,661
And her other side.

345
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:08,181
It's dark and terrifying,

346
00:31:08,421 --> 00:31:11,181
making me feel uncomfortable and scared.

347
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:14,421
You saw it?

348
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:18,020
You know it, too?

349
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:23,221
Her Lordship will not harm us.

350
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:26,301
You must have saddened
Her Lordship again.

351
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:27,860
Go to apologize to Her Lordship.

352
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,541
Shuo Xuan,

353
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,461
ever since I met you
in the Jincui Oasis,

354
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,661
you've been treating me badly.

355
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,661
Do I owe you money

356
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,900
or have I done something to you?

357
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,421
You took away my mother.

358
00:31:47,821 --> 00:31:49,541
You are Zhu Yu's daughter, too?

359
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,581
My mother was Ling Ye,
the previous queen of our clan.

360
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,140
The body that Zhu Yu is using now

361
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,061
is my mother's.
