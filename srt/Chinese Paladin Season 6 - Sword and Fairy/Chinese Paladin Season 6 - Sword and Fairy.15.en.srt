=Episode 15=

21
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,200
Ever since Qi was born,

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,439
we have always been

23
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,719
avoiding her meeting with Zhu Yu.

24
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,679
Now that they've reunited,

25
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,999
I'm afraid
the situation will be unfavorable.

26
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,480
It was my fault.

27
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,480
I never thought

28
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,120
that Lin Yuan would come
to Wuyan Village.

29
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,439
The Sea of Clear Skies is also aware

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,960
that we are collecting Dragon Crystals.

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,800
They probably already guessed

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,079
we'd use those crystals against them.

33
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,480
That's not a problem.

34
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,719
After all these years,

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,759
haven't we always been beware of

36
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,120
and testing each other?

37
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,399
What I'm more worried about is

38
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:45,360
that they might tell Yue Jinzhao

39
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,320
about his origins.

40
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,280
I believe Zhu Yu will keep her word

41
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,000
before finding a safe method

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,160
to rescue the Yu Clan.

43
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,000
She will not tell Yue Jinzhao the truth.

44
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,119
But Yue Jinzhao already knows

45
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,680
that he resembles Bian Luohuan.

46
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,199
Moreover, he can find us

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,479
by following the Qiyuan Sect.

48
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:10,760
We are not ready yet.

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,400
Then we'll speed it up

50
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,040
to deal with the Qiyuan Sect.

51
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,479
After all, we have enough Qiyuan Orbs.

52
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,280
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,440
What are you doing here?

54
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:20,479
It was my slip before,

55
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,000
so Jinzhao knocked off my mask.

56
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,119
I'm to blame.

57
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:24,919
I will find a remedy for that.

58
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,960
There's no use talking about it now.

59
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,199
Not long ago,

60
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,440
I just used the Zhengwu Alliance

61
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:33,960
to eliminate the Jiangning branch
of the Qiyuan Sect.

62
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,119
The sect leader is dead.

63
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,680
I want to write to Gao Xiao about it

64
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,360
and let him succeed as sect leader.

65
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,680
I will be responsible

66
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,599
for the affairs of the Qiyuan Sect.

67
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,640
Xuwei,

68
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:46,199
I've been in charge of the Qiyuan Sect.

69
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,000
You continue
to watch over the Sea of Clear Skies.

70
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,320
If Zhu Yu forcibly keeps Qi,

71
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,199
we must step in and stop it.

72
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,759
Don't overthink it.

73
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,559
You are seriously injured.

74
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,919
He hopes that you can rest well.

75
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,080
Qingfei.

76
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,559
I understand.

77
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,600
He is afraid

78
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,080
I will do things outside our plan again.

79
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:23,839
Well,

80
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,280
he is worried about you.

81
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,039
I think he did the right thing.

82
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,672
Ling Ye.

83
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,240
Why is Zhu Yu called Ling Ye now?

84
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:12,520
Qi.

85
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,440
You're here.

86
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,119
Zhu Yu.

87
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,759
Does the Yu Clan have many spells?

88
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:21,280
Yes.

89
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,839
Can you teach me?

90
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,000
You are my daughter.

91
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,720
As long as you want to learn,

92
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,479
I will certainly teach you all I know.

93
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,119
Really?

94
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,559
Can you teach me
how to lift the Husheng Spell?

95
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,880
Jinzhao lost most of his memory
because of me.

96
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,039
I feel very guilty.

97
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,559
The Husheng Spell?

98
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,039
It is a secret of the Yu Clan.

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,759
So you are unwilling to teach me?

100
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,880
Of course not.

101
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,919
As long as you want,

102
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,720
I can do anything for you.

103
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:01,000
I...

104
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,319
It is getting late.

105
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:03,880
You should go to bed.

106
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,479
I'll teach you

107
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,319
another day, okay?

108
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:26,160
What?

109
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,639
Are you afraid I'll kill myself?

110
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,440
Enjoy your wine

111
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,239
to forget.

112
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,920
Jinzhao, let's drink.

113
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,280
Come on.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,799
Let's get drunk.

115
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,799
Come on.

116
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,320
Qi always likes water.

117
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,639
I always say she's like a fish.

118
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,000
Surprisingly, I was right.

119
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,480
So she is Kun.

120
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,720
Her thoughts are always different.

121
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,200
Scales will grow on her body.

122
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,600
Now it all makes sense.

123
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:37,880
What about Kun?

124
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,720
What about humans?

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,519
Come on.

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,720
A toast to Qi for finding her origins.

127
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,959
Are you okay, Jinzhao?

128
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,239
What could be wrong with me?

129
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:00,399
Qi has found her origins.

130
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,280
I'm so happy for her.

131
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,359
Humans can be quite interesting.

132
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,519
Obviously, you are pretending

133
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:13,600
to smile.

134
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,160
I'm pretty good.

135
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm not pretending.

136
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,679
You are.

137
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:29,559
Today we know

138
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,760
Little Yue is a young lord
of the Yu Clan.

139
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Yet you're a guy without memories.

140
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,440
You must feel sad.

141
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:42,959
Indeed, I am.

142
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:47,559
Are you blaming Little Yue?

143
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:48,600
How could I?

144
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,040
I am just sad.

145
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:55,200
The one who's been
with Qi for three years.

146
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,320
Is that me?

147
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,440
Is it really Yue Jinzhao?

148
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,559
The desire to be with Qi

149
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,399
and protect her.

150
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,280
Does it belong to Yue Jinzhao?

151
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:18,160
Is Qi dependent on me

152
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,600
because of Yue Jinzhao?

153
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Jinzhao, in my opinion,

154
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,440
you're asking for

155
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:32,760
needless worries.

156
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:35,639
Yes.

157
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,079
No past, and no memories.

158
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,720
The only thing for sure

159
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,720
in the past three years is
that I am Yue Jinzhao.

160
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,519
But now,

161
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,679
I can't even be sure of that anymore.

162
00:09:58,839 --> 00:09:59,832
Think positive.

163
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,959
You've been looking for your past.

164
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:06,720
Anyway, you've found it.

165
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,399
Yes.

166
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,359
You're right.

167
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,760
Qi has finally found her family.

168
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,920
I should be happy for her.

169
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:35,639
Jinzhao.

170
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:37,280
Jinzhao.

171
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,040
And you.

172
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,319
Since you like someone,

173
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,360
you must let her know your feelings.

174
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,519
I...

175
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,519
I'll give it a try.

176
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,399
I will.

177
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,680
I made it again this time.

178
00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:37,040
Xian Qing.

179
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,079
Come.

180
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:47,959
Thank you.

181
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:48,759
Feel better?

182
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,120
Yes.

183
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,839
I just need to get through this moment.

184
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,839
Zhaoyan.

185
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,600
Twins in your family die young.

186
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,319
Do you know why?

187
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
Could you please stop asking?

188
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,800
I don't want to lie to you.

189
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:14,519
Never mind.

190
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,519
If you don't want to, then don't.

191
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,439
Xian Qing, don't worry about me.

192
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,800
I'm already used to it.

193
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:27,999
But even if you don't love yourself,

194
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,480
think about the people around you.

195
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,280
They will feel bad.

196
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,879
I won't let them know.

197
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:35,879
But I know.

198
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,280
It pains me.

199
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,839
Xian Qing, you must be kidding.

200
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,560
Miss Shuo Xuan.

201
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,680
Where are you?

202
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,720
Shuo...

203
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,160
Maybe next time.

204
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,999
(Since you like someone,)

205
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,040
(you must let her know your feelings.)

206
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,800
Miss Shuo Xuan.

207
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:50,639
Why is it you again?

208
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,720
Why do you follow me?

209
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,712
I...

210
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,519
Well...

211
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,160
I...

212
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,920
I...

213
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,560
Well...

214
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,399
You like me?

215
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,560
Well,

216
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,720
I just came from over there

217
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,399
and saw you.

218
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,079
We admire heroes and warriors.

219
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,959
You're a coward
who can't even defeat me.

220
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,120
I have already become stronger

221
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:33,879
than before.

222
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:36,519
Alright then.

223
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,280
Let's have a fight.

224
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:39,879
If you win,

225
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,240
I'll allow you to fall for me.

226
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,160
But if you lose,

227
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,959
you will be out of my sight.

228
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,399
Well...

229
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,240
Fight or not?

230
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,199
Yes.

231
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:55,959
Zhaoyan.

232
00:14:58,759 --> 00:14:59,759
Do you really not know?

233
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,360
Or are you pretending not to know?

234
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:10,639
Do you know what you are talking about?

235
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,360
I do.

236
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,839
You said that we are friends.

237
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,920
But I don't want us to be just friends.

238
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,800
I also don't just want
to be your confidant.

239
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,600
The hairpin I gave you represents

240
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,079
my feelings for you.

241
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,680
You have feelings for me too.

242
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,999
So why do you keep avoiding it?

243
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,959
I am a human with a short life.

244
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,480
I don't care about it.

245
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:52,560
Just tell me.

246
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:55,519

I...

269
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,120
I'm not strong enough now.

270
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,439
But I will become stronger eventually.

271
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,959
One day,

272
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:40,120
I will become a great hero.

273
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:43,280
So...

274
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,439
- So now...
- You are also quite interesting.

275
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,360
Miss Shuo Xuan.

276
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,759
What do you like?

277
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:53,280
The Sea of Clear Skies and Her Lordship.

278
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,920
Are they the same?

279
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,079
Her Lordship is the Sea of Clear Skies.

280
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:00,959
The Sea of Clear Skies is Her Lordship.

281
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:04,480
Do you like anything else?

282
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,600
I also like little fish.

283
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,639
I like fish too.

284
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:12,519
I mean it.

285
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,319
It tastes good to be baked or fried.

286
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:16,800
Get lost.

287
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:22,680
Sorry.

288
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,600
Miss Shuo Xuan.

289
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,839
That's not what I meant.

290
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:25,839
I'm sorry, Miss Shuo Xuan.

291
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,920
I...

292
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,879
I messed it up again.

293
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,376
Zhaoyan.

294
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,560
Take care of yourself.

295
00:18:40,639 --> 00:18:42,079
Maiming, you too.

296
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,719
The Sea of Clear Skies
and the young lord of the Yu Clan.

297
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,040
The young lord of the Yu Clan

298
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:10,999
could be Bian Luohuan's disciple.

299
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,879
Cang Feng.

300
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:16,560
Things are getting more interesting.

301
00:19:17,528 --> 00:19:19,119
You love the fun.

302
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,800
I've been staying in my room for long.

303
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:25,440
Now the time is right.

304
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,519
Since Yue Qi is Kun,

305
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,479
it makes sense

306
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,280
that why she could
cause the Rehai key ring to react.

307
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,759
Why?

308
00:19:40,152 --> 00:19:44,160
The key rings are made
from divine objects.

309
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:47,719
The power of Nine Springs
resonates with each other.

310
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,399
The Rehai key ring is made
from a dragon's horn.

311
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:59,920
The Mist Soul key ring is made
from the scales of Kun.

312
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:05,680
So, if Yue Qi can cause Rehai to react,

313
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:09,560
it's not surprising at all.

314
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,280
I see.

315
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:27,879
Zhaoyan is really having a good time.

316
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,280
The colorful world makes her get lost.

317
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:53,080
The young girl has finally grown up.

318
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,800
Zhu Yu, as we agreed yesterday,

319
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,879
shouldn't you teach me

320
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:10,119
how to undo the Husheng Spell?

321
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,119
No.

322
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,280
The moment I mentioned it yesterday,

323
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,879
Zhu Yu tried to avoid it.

324
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:19,479
What should I do?

325
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:24,320
Why is Jinzhao here?

326
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,719
You want Qi to stay
in the Sea of Clear Skies?

327
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,080
Qi has wandered with me for three years.

328
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:30,920
She has suffered a lot.

329
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:33,719
She deserves to return to her world.

330
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:38,599
But you can't decide for her.

331
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,599
Actually, I have thought
about taking Qi away.

332
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:44,680
But she has found her family.

333
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,968
Everyone here

334
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,960
will respect and care for her.

335
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,599
I can't take away everything

336
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,519
that belongs to her
because of my selfishness.

337
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,200
But she is willing to go with you.

338
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,759
You are the most important to her.

339
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,200
I taught Qi everything I know.

340
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,719
The reason she wants to go with me

341
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,160
is that I was the only one she had
in the past three years.

342
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,999
It's not like that.

343
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,479
You are determined to leave

344
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,399
because of the Husheng Spell.

345
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:36,719
(Qi is using the Resonance Spell.)

346
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,119

347
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,440

00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,479
I know your longing for a mother.

378
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,840
So whether I'm by your side,

379
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,040
I cannot replace

380
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,040
your mother Zhu Yu.

381
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:36,639
But I don't want
to be separated from you.

382
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,200
In the beginning,
you may not be used to it.

383
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,440
But gradually, you will.

384
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:00,280
How could I?

385
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:01,639
You will.

386
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:04,399
Just like the jade pendant
that you used to have

387
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,920
can be dropped inadvertently.

388
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,280
Jinzhao, wait here for me.

389
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,080
I'll go retrieve the jade pendant.

390
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:17,879
Wait for me.

391
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,840
Miss Yue is innocent,
but she's not foolish.

392
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,960
One day she'll understand

393
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,960
that in her world,

394
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,440
it's not just the two of you.

395
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,200
Overprotection is inappropriate.

396
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:36,599
(Goodbye.)

397
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:38,359
(Qi.)

398
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
Where is it?

399
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,239
Finally found it.

400
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,040
Yue Jinzhao has left.

401
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,399
He left by the Yunlai Stone.

402
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:53,200
This is what he left behind.

403
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,320
Inside this,

404
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,920
I've written about some things Qi likes.

405
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,920
It's what I've learned
by taking care of her

406
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,560
in the past three years.

407
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:22,296
Rest assured,

408
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:28,239
I will take care of Qi,
just like you did.

409
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,119
(Qi loves food.)

410
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,200
(She is not a picky eater.)

411
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,800
(Her favorite is egg noodles)

412
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,920
(and pastries in Jing'an.)

413
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,519
As we mentioned last time...

414
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,960
(She likes storytelling
and reading storybooks.)

415
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:07,519
(She loves to hear tales and anecdotes.)

416
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,719
(Whenever she encounters a storyteller,)

417
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,519
(she will listen carefully.)

418
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,560
A shock through the heavens.

419
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,160
Lightning flashes and thunder roars.

420
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:18,440
That life breaks free from its shackles

421
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,440
and soars into the sky.

422
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:26,119
And a legend unfolds.

423
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,280
(Apart from good food,)

424
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,080
(she is not particular
about clothes or accommodations.)

425
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,680
(However, she will have a better life
in the future.)

428
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,519
(Qi is very clever,)

429
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,879
(but sometimes she is a bit slow
in human relations.)

430
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,080

(Also,)

434
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:10,200
(Qi is a young lord,)

435
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:13,399
(but don't impose many rules
and restrictions on her.)

436
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:15,599
(She does not like that.)

437
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:19,160
(What she needs is a carefree life.)

Little Yue is not with you.

What are you planning to do next?

448
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:13,879
Now that Qi has found her family,

449
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,560
I need to find mine.

450
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:18,560
I need to find Bian Luohuan.

451
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,999
I want to find out my origins

452
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,719
and eradicate the Qiyuan Sect

453
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:23,840
to prevent them...

454
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,080
Footprints here.

455
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,920
What's wrong, Jinzhao?

456
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,519
Nothing.

457
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,040
I suddenly thought of one thing.

458
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,840
Since we encountered
Gao Xiao's demon beast

459
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,800
by the Yinma River,

460
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,119
the stronghold of the Qiyuan Sect

461
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:04,479
might be nearby.

462
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,040
It makes sense.

463
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,280
If we want to eradicate Qiyuan Sect,

464
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,119
we may have to cooperate
with the Zhengwu Alliance.

465
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:12,639
But we've already fallen out with them.

466
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,040
I don't have to go.

467
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:18,920
Xian Qing.

468
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:22,040
Xian Qing, are you still mad

469
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,200
at Zuo Guanren?

470
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:27,759
I don't care about that

471
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,719
at all.

472
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,040
I have lived for over a thousand years,

473
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:34,719
while Zuo Guanren is barely over fifty.

474
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,320
How could I possibly quibble

475
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:38,200
with my junior over such trivialities?

476
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,960
And I've lived as I please
for a thousand years.

477
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,680
I've traveled a lot with you.

478
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,119
And now I am tired.

479
00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:51,399
You can go back to Mount Yuqing, Uncle.

480
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:55,759
Will you come back and join us again?

481
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,119
Did you follow me

482
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,200
because you have something to tell me?

483
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,479
I know

484
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,440
you left

485
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,719
to facilitate the cooperation
with the Zhengwu Alliance.

486
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:38,999
You know me best.

487
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,664
However,

488
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
I thought you came to give me an answer.

489
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,639
I...

490
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,119
I...

491
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,920
Never mind. I have a journey ahead.

492
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,519
Farewell.

493
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:12,120
I want...

494
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,592
I...

495
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,880
What do you want?

496
00:36:21,439 --> 00:36:23,040
I want...

497
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:27,919
I want you to join us again.

498
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,080
I also want to be with you.

499
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:34,880
Farewell.

500
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:55,679
Farewell.

501
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,239
Your Lordship.

502
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,439
How is the young lord?

503
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,239
Qi is fine.

504
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:10,328
But just now,

505
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,880
I saw her cry.

506
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,320
Cry?

507
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:20,239
She is your child.

508
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,159
How could Kun cry?

509
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:28,080
Right, how could Kun cry?

510
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,512
I am still Kun.

511
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:37,040
But my daughter is becoming more
like a human.

512
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,840
She has traveled
in the Mortal Realm for too long.

513
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:43,840
She's been assimilated by humans.

514
00:38:44,919 --> 00:38:46,120
This can't go on anymore.

515
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:49,600
Your Lordship,
why not take this opportunity

516
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,640
to keep the young lord by your side

517
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:52,800
in the Sea of Clear Skies?

518
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:54,159
Absolutely not.

519
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:57,880
Your Lordship.

520
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,400
If the young lord stays for a long time,

521
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,360
I fear it will break our agreement
with the Hengdao Sect.

522
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,840
At worst, we'll fall out with them.

523
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,320
It's not yet the time.

524
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,439
Your Lordship.

525
00:39:21,439 --> 00:39:22,199
One more thing.

526
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:25,560
The Hengdao Sect
is mining Dragon Crystals.

527
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:28,400
And Dragon Crystals can be used
as energy for mechanisms.

528
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,880
I fear that they may be used
against our people in the future.

529
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:34,880
It's not a concern.

530
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,439
The most important thing now is
to find Rehai.

531
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,199
Yes.

532
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,560
With the life force of Rehai,

533
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:49,640
Your Lordship can heal us soon.
