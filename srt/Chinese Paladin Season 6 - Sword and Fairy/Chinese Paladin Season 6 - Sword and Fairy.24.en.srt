00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:02,296
(Luo Mansion)

22
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,599
I sensed it.

23
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,120
The Luo family indeed
has the hole of spring.

24
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,680
Please excuse my manners.

25
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,000
I wonder why you have come.

26
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,360
Don't play dumb.

27
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,199
Hand over the key ring of Rehai.

28
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,559
Alright then.

29
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,160
I will if you can touch it.

30
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,440
Big talk!

31
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:19,093
Your Lordship.

32
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:24,373
(He can block Her Lordship's attack!)

33
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,373
Within the territory of Rehai,

34
00:04:29,173 --> 00:04:30,733
no one can harm me.

35
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,453
The key ring of Rehai
is a treasure of the Six Realms

36
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:34,652
and is super valuable.

37
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:37,212
How would I possibly hand it over?

38
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:42,492
Here comes the one

39
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:46,253
who's meant to come.

40
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,344
Mr. Ying,

41
00:04:56,344 --> 00:04:57,973
you are very well informed.

42
00:04:58,412 --> 00:04:59,412
We've just arrived,

43
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:01,132
and you came immediately.

44
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:03,893
It concerns Rehai.

45
00:05:04,453 --> 00:05:05,492
I had to come.

46
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,613
Mr. Ying, I've heard a lot about you.

47
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:10,572
You've all come from afar.

48
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:12,253
Tea has been prepared.

49
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:13,772
Please follow me.

50
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:46,013
How is it?

51
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:47,572
Any news on Lang Mo?

52
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,456
(Lang Mo is in the Mangwan Village.)

53
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:52,852
We only know he is in a village

54
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:54,812
called Mangwan in the Western Regions.

55
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,733
No other news for now.

56
00:05:58,173 --> 00:05:58,933
We must not delay.

57
00:05:59,132 --> 00:06:01,092
Let's change our course
to the Mangwan Village.

58
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:01,972
Xiu,

59
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:04,412
go back to Mount Yuqing

60
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:06,252
to hold vigil for Hanjiang.

61
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:08,893
Leave the matters of the village to us.

62
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:10,292
Rest assured.

63
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:12,613
Okay.

64
00:06:13,412 --> 00:06:14,412
I'll stay with him.

65
00:06:15,173 --> 00:06:16,972
Me, and me too.

66
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:19,213
I'll stay to keep Miss Ming company.

67
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:19,773
Besides...

68
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:21,893
Besides...

69
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:24,412
I want to hold vigil for Mr. Gu too.

70
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:25,213
- Good.
- No need.

71
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:28,613
Shifang,

72
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:30,733
if Xiu gets angry,

73
00:06:31,013 --> 00:06:31,893
say nice things to her.

74
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:34,412
If she is unhappy and hits you,

75
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:35,692
you take it.

76
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:40,173
My punches

77
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:42,132
really hurt.

78
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:44,532
I'm tough. I'm not afraid.

79
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:48,453
You're really grown up.

80
00:06:49,613 --> 00:06:50,572
I'm happy

81
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:52,493
and yet somewhat sad.

82
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:03,972
Mr. Ju and I will ride Lingxiao there.

83
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:06,412
You keep the Yunlai Stone.

84
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,252
If anything happens,

85
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:11,213
send a paper crane to me.

86
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:13,653
Well...

87
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:19,092
It doesn't matter who keeps it.

88
00:07:19,532 --> 00:07:20,252
We're family.

89
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:24,893
Okay.

90
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:30,773
Now that we're done saying goodbye,

91
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:33,173
I'll go tell Jinzhao and Little Yue

92
00:07:33,532 --> 00:07:35,213

This is the Xiangzhen Forest.

113
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:17,173
Beyond the woods,

114
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:18,213
there's a village up ahead.

115
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:20,252
It must be the Mangwan Village.

116
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:26,852
Jinzhao, what is this?

117
00:09:26,972 --> 00:09:27,933
How can you see so far?

118
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:30,532
This is a spyglass.

119
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,368
It's made according to ancient designs.

120
00:09:33,812 --> 00:09:34,333
Have a go.

121
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:39,213
I can't see anything at all.

122
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:40,812
You need to twist it.

123
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:42,453
Then it becomes clearer.

124
00:09:42,904 --> 00:09:44,412
I see it!

125
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:46,893
I really can see very far.

126
00:09:46,893 --> 00:09:47,412
You like it?

127
00:09:50,412 --> 00:09:52,333
The device made
by Shifang is very exquisite.

128
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:55,692
When we go back,

129
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,572
I'll ask Shifang to make one for you.

130
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:08,372
Look, Jinzhao.

131
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:09,333
Isn't that Lang Mo?

132
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:14,853
Yes, it's really Lang Mo.

133
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:15,492
Let's go.

134
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:25,653
You really came.

135
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:38,213
Luo Maiming,

136
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:40,533
hand over the key ring of Rehai now!

137
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:47,492
I can hand it over,

138
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:50,692
but

139
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:53,653
I want to see who makes the offer

140
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:55,612
that aligns more with my desire.

141
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:00,413
What I want

142
00:12:01,932 --> 00:12:05,052
is the method to lift
the Rehai Bloodbinding.

143
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:07,453
Do either of you have it?

144
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:09,492
I don't have it.

145
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:11,932
He does.

146
00:12:15,893 --> 00:12:16,973
I do have it.

147
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:22,773
But why should I tell you?

148
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:24,612
Ying Xuwei,

149
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,372
Mist Soul is still in the Core
of the Demon Realm.

150
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:36,653
Since

151
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:39,853
I won't be told the method
to lift Bloodbinding,

152
00:12:41,413 --> 00:12:43,013
I'll hand over Rehai

153
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,093
to Her Lordship

154
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:47,333
so Her Lordship can absorb it at will.
How about that?

155
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:54,132
Mr. Luo,

156
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,973
are you threatening me?

157
00:12:59,052 --> 00:12:59,732
How could I?

158
00:13:01,653 --> 00:13:04,492
I just want you to stay

159
00:13:05,293 --> 00:13:07,293
so we will have a good discussion.

160
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:11,453
Once a large amount of energy
is drained from the hole of spring,

161
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:13,492
it'll inevitably threaten
the Six Realms.

162
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:18,052
We've all got people
we care about in this world,

163
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:21,213
and none of us want
to see such things happen.

164
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:25,732
I can tell you

165
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:28,692
the unbinding method,

166
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:31,172
but my condition is

167
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,492
that I'll keep

168
00:13:34,653 --> 00:13:36,093
the key ring of Rehai later.

169
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:40,812
I agree.

170
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:46,773
The day the Bloodbinding
is successfully lifted,

171
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:51,333
I will personally present
the key ring to you, Mr. Ying.

172
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:24,773
It's you guys who saved me.

173
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:26,413
Sorry about that.

174
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:30,252
You are

175
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:31,732
Master Luo!

176
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:33,692
Yes.

177
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:36,973
Previously, due to some reasons,

178
00:14:37,172 --> 00:14:39,052
I had to disguise as a man.

179
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:41,653
Lang Mo,

180
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,293
were you hunting for prey just now?

181
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:45,333
Correct.

182
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:46,853
I'm looking for a demon beast.

183
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:51,773
Others shun demon beasts at all costs.

184
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:53,413
Why do you seek it out on purpose?

185
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:01,973
It's a long story.

186
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:04,932
Before, in the Luori Village,

187
00:15:05,413 --> 00:15:08,492
Master Luo used the treasures
seized from the Qiyuan Sect

188
00:15:08,612 --> 00:15:10,293
as our travel money back home.

189
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:12,172
I saw a beautiful bead,

190
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:14,052
so I brought it back

191
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:16,492
for my wife, Yu Xiang.

192
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:20,132
It's so pretty.

193
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:26,773
Put it on me.

194
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:36,213
It's truly lovely.

195
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:39,333
But who would know
after Yu Xiang put it on,

196
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:40,893
the Qiyuan Orb

197
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:43,013
fused into her body?

198
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:51,052
Ever since then,

199
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:55,572
she's been getting weaker and weaker.

200
00:15:59,653 --> 00:16:00,372
I seek demon beasts,

201
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:03,252
hoping to get a demon beast's inner orb

202
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:04,692
to prolong Yu Xiang's life.

203
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:08,812
The Qiyuan Orb.

204
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:10,333
That's right.

205
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,973
Are you here for the Qiyuan Orb?

206
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:15,093
Then do you know

207
00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:16,333
the method to remove it?

208
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:23,172
Could you take us

209
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:25,093
to take a look at her?

210
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:27,333
This way, please.

211
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:34,132
Zhu Yu.

212
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:40,372
You've got plenty of Qiyuan Orbs.

213
00:16:40,853 --> 00:16:43,333
Why insist on obtaining Rehai?

214
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:45,172
The Qiyuan Orbs come from humans.

215
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:49,093
The Vitality Energy in them
is imbued with humans' dark emotions,

216
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:50,893
far less pure than that of Rehai.

217
00:16:51,492 --> 00:16:52,333
Nowadays,

218
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:55,372
I often feel like a stranger to myself.

219
00:16:56,213 --> 00:16:58,893
Healing my clan before I lose my sanity

220
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:02,132
is the most prudent way I can think of.

221
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:06,853
Taking your clan into the time stasis

222
00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:08,893
is the most prudent way.

223
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:10,572
That's just sacrificing our clan

224
00:17:10,853 --> 00:17:12,413
in exchange for what you call safety.

225
00:17:12,612 --> 00:17:13,413
How is that prudent?

226
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,052
You're afraid you can't control me.

227
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:23,052
You've decided
to use my daughter to scheme

228
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:25,533
against me, haven't you?

229
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:27,480
When the time comes,

230
00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:30,132
even if I lose my sanity,

231
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:32,533
what will you be afraid of?

232
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:45,240
(Luo's Residence)

233
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:48,293
This way, please.

234
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:02,132
Yu Xiang.

235
00:18:05,932 --> 00:18:07,812
Yu Xiang.

236
00:18:08,612 --> 00:18:09,372
Do you still remember

237
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:10,372
Master Luo,

238
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:11,812
the one who saved us?

239
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:12,692
She's here.

240
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:14,093
Yu Xiang.

241
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:17,572
Yu Xiang.

242
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:28,653
She's been like this for so long,

243
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,893
subsisting on the herbs I gather

244
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:32,053
and also

245
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,212
the inner orbs of demon beasts I hunt.

246
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:44,173
It's all my fault.

247
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:46,092
It's all because of me

248
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:49,813
that Yu Xiang ended up like this.

249
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:52,573
Sir,

250
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,293
please save her.

251
00:18:57,893 --> 00:18:59,612
Jinzhao, they are so pitiful.

252
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:08,452
Let's save her.

253
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:11,053
We will, but not now.

254
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:23,452
I'm sorry.

255
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:25,893
She's beyond help.

256
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:36,533
She can't be saved?

257
00:19:37,972 --> 00:19:39,452
Not even you can save her?

258
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:44,573
Yu Xiang.

259
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,132
I'm sorry, Lang Mo.

260
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:50,252
If I had found
this Qiyuan Orb that day...

261
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:50,893
Zhaoyan,

262
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:52,893
don't blame yourself.

263
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:54,212
Don't, Zhaoyan.

264
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,852
It's not your fault.

265
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:05,452
Could you please leave?

266
00:20:06,893 --> 00:20:08,332
I have to make medicine for Yu Xiang.

267
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:10,693
Mr. Lang,

268
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:12,893
may I ask you a question?

269
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:26,773
Luohuan,

270
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,773
why is there no movement
at all over there?

271
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:33,212
Will Lang Mo really make a move on them?

272
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:36,332
For his wife, he will.

273
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:42,452
This time,
thanks to Qingfei's persuasion,

274
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:44,852
Xuwei allowed the two of us
to monitor him together.

275
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:46,852
Otherwise, it'd be so boring
for you alone.

276
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:49,173
It's not just surveillance.

277
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:50,773
I know.

278
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,452
We'll also snatch them to the Yujie Hub.

279
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:53,893
But Luohuan,

280
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:55,372
why do we

281
00:20:55,452 --> 00:20:57,533
suddenly have to snatch them up?

282
00:20:59,413 --> 00:20:59,972
Xiaoyuan,

283
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:01,332
do you know

284
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:03,972
we're not doing good things?

285
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:05,492
I know.

286
00:21:06,013 --> 00:21:06,933
So what?

287
00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:09,173
No matter what you guys do, I'll help.

288
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:13,092
Why did you hit me again?

289
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,852
Precisely because we are
not doing good deeds

290
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:17,212
but you don't care.

291
00:21:17,732 --> 00:21:18,893
This is what Xuwei,

292
00:21:19,252 --> 00:21:20,972
Qingfei and I least want to see.

293
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:23,293
Although we're doing bad things,

294
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:25,053
it is to protect the Six Realms.

295
00:21:25,372 --> 00:21:26,132
How awesome!

296
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,013
Xiaoyuan,

297
00:21:31,092 --> 00:21:32,332
no matter what,

298
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:34,092
doing evil

299
00:21:34,732 --> 00:21:35,773
is wrong.

300
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:39,212
We shouldn't feel superior.

301
00:21:39,813 --> 00:21:41,573
Sacrificing so many innocent people

302
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:43,413
to achieve what we believe,

303
00:21:44,252 --> 00:21:45,933
we're the ones to be condemned.

304
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:48,732
But it doesn't concern you.

305
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:50,332
When we return,

306
00:21:50,612 --> 00:21:52,092
I'll let Xuwei give you
a good lesson again.

307
00:21:52,252 --> 00:21:53,053
I don't want that.

308
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:56,013
And this? Do you want it?

309
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:03,212
I want a butterfly.

310
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:04,693
It's prettier.

311
00:22:05,773 --> 00:22:07,053
Picky.

312
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:16,293
Lang Mo,

313
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:18,092
my condolences.

314
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:20,533
It will pass.

315
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:22,653
Where are you going?

316
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:26,092
There is a grassland
in front of the village.

317
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:29,173
Yu Xiang used to

318
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:31,852
spend a lot of time there
looking at the scenery.

319
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:38,732
Let's go.

320
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:50,773
They're here. Let's go.

321
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,332
Everyone,

322
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:30,852
sorry about this.

323
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:35,693
Qi.

324
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:39,773
Qi.

325
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:47,773
Come out.

326
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:54,332
Bian Luohuan.

327
00:23:56,212 --> 00:23:57,208
Luohuan, hurry up.

328
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:03,413
The people you want are already here.

329
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:04,893
How do I remove the Qiyuan Orb?

330
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:06,813
I'll help you with it.

331
00:24:29,413 --> 00:24:30,212
Luohuan, watch out!

332
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,533
It seems
that Lang Mo has already told you.

333
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:46,732
How can you go back on your word?

334
00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:50,533
Mr. Lang,

335
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:52,773
may I ask you a question?

336
00:24:56,933 --> 00:24:58,933
How did you know
it was called the Qiyuan Orb?

337
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:00,732
That's right.

338
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:02,933
This is a remote place.

339
00:25:03,813 --> 00:25:04,972
How did you know of it?

340
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:07,933
And at that time you said,

341
00:25:08,252 --> 00:25:09,252
"You really came."

342
00:25:10,013 --> 00:25:11,653
Later you mentioned the Qiyuan Orb.

343
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,933
Seems someone from the Qiyuan Sect
had told you earlier

344
00:25:15,452 --> 00:25:16,332
we would come.

345
00:25:18,132 --> 00:25:18,893
Well...

346
00:25:20,773 --> 00:25:22,212
Their headquarters have been destroyed.

347
00:25:22,653 --> 00:25:24,092
What's left
are just some sorry stragglers.

348
00:25:24,612 --> 00:25:27,053
It's unlikely for them
to spread to this place.

349
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:29,852
Is it Bian Luohuan and his cohorts?

350
00:25:31,492 --> 00:25:32,173
Is it or not?

351
00:25:36,852 --> 00:25:38,053
You all have saved my life.

352
00:25:39,013 --> 00:25:40,092
I'm very grateful.

353
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:43,492
But this concerns the life of Yu Xiang.

354
00:25:43,612 --> 00:25:44,852
We know how to remove the Qiyuan Orb.

355
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:49,773
Really?

356
00:25:51,372 --> 00:25:52,413
But didn't you just say

357
00:25:53,132 --> 00:25:53,972
she couldn't be saved?

358
00:25:55,173 --> 00:25:56,013
Let me try

359
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:57,732
and you'll know.

360
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:36,852
Yu Xiang.

361
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:42,252
I-I-It's really been taken out.

362
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:47,732
Mr. Lang,

363
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:50,212
we need you to help us put on a play.

364
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:57,773
Luohuan, stop wasting words with them.

365
00:26:57,893 --> 00:26:58,893
Just grab them and go.

366
00:27:27,252 --> 00:27:27,693
Yu Xiang.

367
00:27:28,132 --> 00:27:28,813
Lang Mo.

368
00:27:53,013 --> 00:27:54,013
It's all your fault.

369
00:27:54,693 --> 00:27:55,173
Run.

370
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:09,732
What were you sneaking around
for just now?

371
00:28:15,492 --> 00:28:16,212
Forget it.

372
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:18,533
You'd just lie even if I asked.

373
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:22,252
You've remembered it all.

374
00:28:24,092 --> 00:28:25,252
When you were at the Fengyan Inn,

375
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:27,492
I asked you if you were my master,

376
00:28:28,252 --> 00:28:28,972
but you denied it.

377
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:30,852
I'm sorry.

378
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:34,372
I couldn't tell you at the time.

379
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:38,212
How about in the Luori Village?

380
00:28:40,293 --> 00:28:41,013
At the Luo's.

381
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:43,132
Jing'an.

382
00:28:44,132 --> 00:28:45,132
Qiyuan's headquarters.

383
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:49,132
You had so many chances

384
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:52,132
but you never planned to tell me.

385
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:55,053
Even now,

386
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:57,573
you're still hiding it from me.

387
00:29:03,693 --> 00:29:04,413
I...

388
00:29:19,096 --> 00:29:19,972
You were

389
00:29:21,252 --> 00:29:22,173
drugging me?

390
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:30,332
Jinzhao.

391
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:55,773
(Oh, no.)

392
00:29:56,653 --> 00:29:57,933
(I've got no strength left.)

393
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:01,852
Come on.

394
00:30:03,332 --> 00:30:04,173
Come here.

395
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:05,813
Let's keep fighting.

396
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,053
Don't use your inner strength,

397
00:30:10,732 --> 00:30:12,492
or you'll risk a backlash.

398
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:19,492
Let go of me.

399
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:28,053
Jinzhao.

400
00:30:34,492 --> 00:30:35,132
Jinzhao!

401
00:30:48,053 --> 00:30:48,773
You wanna die?

402
00:30:55,732 --> 00:30:56,504
Jinzhao!

403
00:31:28,372 --> 00:31:29,212
Qi.

404
00:31:44,573 --> 00:31:45,173
Luohuan!

405
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:47,732
Qi.

406
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:53,624
Luohuan.

407
00:31:54,492 --> 00:31:55,224
Luohuan!

408
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,061
Qi.

409
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:00,780
Luohuan.

410
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,140
Luohuan.

411
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:03,581
Luohuan, are you alright?

412
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,780
Luohuan.

413
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:06,296
Luohuan.

414
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:08,541
I'll go avenge you.

415
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:09,221
Xiaoyuan,

416
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:12,980
take Yue Jinzhao and Yue Qi away

417
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,740
and don't hurt them.

418
00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:18,813
Luohuan.

419
00:32:19,452 --> 00:32:20,293
Luohuan!

420
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,133
(No other choice.)

421
00:32:26,476 --> 00:32:27,277
Xian Qing.

422
00:32:28,116 --> 00:32:28,797
Xian Qing!

423
00:32:33,956 --> 00:32:34,877
You, and you,

424
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:35,716
come with me.

425
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:47,956
What, looking for a beating?

426
00:32:48,236 --> 00:32:49,557
If you take one more step forward,

427
00:32:49,757 --> 00:32:50,716
I will kill him.

428
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:53,996
You want to bring back a dead man now

429
00:32:54,437 --> 00:32:56,596
or to capture a live one later?

430
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:57,757
It's up to you.

431
00:32:57,877 --> 00:32:58,437
You're lying.

432
00:32:58,757 --> 00:33:00,116
Aren't you friends?

433
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:02,968
I am a demon.

434
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:05,557
You want to see if a demon thinks

435
00:33:05,716 --> 00:33:06,956
like a human?

436
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:15,896
Make your decision.

437
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,196
Bian Luohuan might not hold on

438
00:33:18,757 --> 00:33:20,316
much longer with his injuries.

439
00:33:21,476 --> 00:33:22,744
Darn you!

440
00:33:50,116 --> 00:33:50,716
Qi.

441
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:24,716
Qi.

442
00:34:28,076 --> 00:34:28,716
Qi.

443
00:34:29,716 --> 00:34:30,397
Qi.

444
00:34:55,557 --> 00:34:56,157
Xian Qing.

445
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,596
We will return
to Mount Yuqing immediately.

446
00:35:12,637 --> 00:35:13,368
Master Luo.

447
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,056
Thank you

448
00:35:21,356 --> 00:35:23,316
for saving Yu Xiang today.

449
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:33,996
Though it's not a panacea,

450
00:35:34,557 --> 00:35:35,997
I hope it can help him

451
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:37,237
ease the pain a little.

452
00:35:39,316 --> 00:35:39,957
Thank you.

453
00:36:51,197 --> 00:36:52,197
Has Yue woken up?

454
00:36:52,756 --> 00:36:53,677
Still unconscious.

455
00:36:57,036 --> 00:36:57,877
What's on your mind?

456
00:36:59,997 --> 00:37:00,677
I am thinking,

457
00:37:01,397 --> 00:37:02,397
our visit to that village

458
00:37:02,397 --> 00:37:03,516
was completely impromptu.

459
00:37:04,316 --> 00:37:06,596
How did Bian Luohuan learn about it?

460
00:37:08,596 --> 00:37:09,316
You got any ideas?

461
00:37:11,477 --> 00:37:12,316
I asked the disciples

462
00:37:12,677 --> 00:37:14,957
of my family to secretly investigate
Lang Mo's whereabouts.

463
00:37:15,157 --> 00:37:16,477
Only one can access the report.

464
00:37:19,076 --> 00:37:19,717
It's Maiming.

465
00:37:24,477 --> 00:37:25,316
So you suspect

466
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,957
it was Luo Maiming
who informed Bian Luohuan?

467
00:37:31,637 --> 00:37:32,397
I do not know.

468
00:37:33,997 --> 00:37:35,836
I thought I knew Maiming very well,

469
00:37:36,596 --> 00:37:37,756
but now I realize

470
00:37:39,796 --> 00:37:41,877
I don't really know him.

471
00:37:43,316 --> 00:37:44,116
Let's go to your house

472
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,076
and figure out everything.

473
00:37:49,276 --> 00:37:51,197
Bian Luohuan took Qi back
to the Yujie Hub.

474
00:37:51,997 --> 00:37:54,197
If Luo Maiming is truly
in cahoots with Bian Luohuan,

475
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:56,516
perhaps he knows where the Yujie Hub is.

476
00:38:00,917 --> 00:38:02,157
You might not know it.

477
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:04,836
Maiming can take the energy
of Rehai for his own use.

478
00:38:04,997 --> 00:38:05,997
Then within the territory

479
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:07,157
of Rehai, no one can beat him.

480
00:38:08,516 --> 00:38:09,237
What of it?

481
00:38:10,477 --> 00:38:11,677
No matter how tough it gets,

482
00:38:12,316 --> 00:38:13,637
I'm determined to find Qi.
