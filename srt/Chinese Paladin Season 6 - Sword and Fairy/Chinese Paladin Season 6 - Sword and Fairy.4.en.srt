21
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,840
Such fine iron poplar wood.

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,439
Thank you for making this happen, Luo.

23
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,319
Don't mention it.

24
00:02:12,359 --> 00:02:13,960
Where are Yue and Little Yue?

25
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,880
They have already set off
for Luori Village.

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,400
Wasn't it agreed
that we would set off together?

27
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,839
Probably they are angry with me.

28
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,320
Perhaps it will just be
the two of us traveling from now on.

29
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,039
It's alright.

30
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,919
After all,
we are going to the same place.

31
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,719
Maybe we'll meet them on the way.

32
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,559
Jinzhao,

33
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,439
didn't you say that my past
is connected with the Nine Springs?

34
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,720
Why don't we stay
at the Luos' place to find it out?

35
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,799
I'm afraid Luo Maiming

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,360
deliberately let me
into the Octagonal Tower yesterday.

37
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,640
Even if you are related
to the Nine Springs,

38
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,320
he certainly won't tell us.

39
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:10,280
Fortunately,
there's still a clue from Lord Ming.

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,159
Following it,
we can also find out your origins.

41
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,760
But walking to Luori Village

42
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,519
would be too tiring, wouldn't it?

43
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,320
I want to take a carriage,

44
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,799
drink ice water, and eat icy fruits.

45
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,080
You can dream on. Let's go.

46
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,720
Yue, Little Yue, get on the carriage.

47
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,919
Let's go.

48
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,799
My dream has come true.

49
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,040
I, Shifang, and Zhaoyan

50
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,599
will all wait for you together
in Luori Village, Jinzhao.

51
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,479
Let's see who gets there faster.

52
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,760
Yue, you should get on quickly too.

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,960
Jinzhao, why are you
wearing such a cold expression today?

54
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,159
Is it because
you woke up too early today

55
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,640
and haven't gotten over
your morning grumpiness?

56
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,039
No, it's not that.

57
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,479
It's because
Jinzhao is as tough as steel.

58
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,600
It's all because of you.

59
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,039
I was afraid that you'd be deceived
without knowing it.

60
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,600
Jinzhao, are you still angry at Zhaoyan?

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,319
If you are angry with him

62
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,360
and want to ignore him,

63
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,640
I will ignore him too.

64
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:36,000
You can keep this to yourself.

65
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
There's no need to speak it aloud.

66
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,319
It's alright.

67
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,199
I covered my mouth with my hand.

68
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,640
They wouldn't hear it at all.

69
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:43,880
Really?

70
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,319
Luo, eat something.

71
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,160
What are you looking at?

72
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:08,240
Nothing.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,919
When we were in the carriage,

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,440
you said we were on the same team.

75
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,800
Now, seeing others eat something tasty

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,240
makes you regret it.

77
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,520
I feel a bit regretful
that I didn't get those snacks.

78
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,520
But I don't regret
being on the same team with you.

79
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,119
Jinzhao,

80
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,039
why did you argue with Zhaoyan?

81
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,399
Are you still thirsty?

82
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,959
It is such hot weather.

83
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
The sun is scorching.

84
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,520
Yue, Little Yue, have some snacks.

85
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,559
Thank you.

86
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,639
Ju,

87
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,000
let's go find a water source.

88
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,760
The two of us?

89
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,600
Carrying these is cumbersome.

90
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,559
Here.

91
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:24,480
Let's go.

92
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:24,839
Well...

93
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,799
Jinzhao is so clever.

94
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,280
Zhaoyan,

95
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,280
I'm so thirsty.

96
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,639
Do you have any water with you?

97
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,720
Thank you.

98
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,880
Miss Yue, on your journey so far,

99
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
you seem to always be thirsty.

100
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Jinzhao always says

101
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,559
I'm like a fish
that can't live without water.

102
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,399
Yue has been good to you.

103
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,440
You have been good to me too.

104
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,119
I...

105
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,440
I suspect you're Lord Ming.

106
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,679
I haven't been very nice to you.

107
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,320
If I really were the Lord Ming,

108
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,399
would you kill me?

109
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,600
Yes.

110
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,320
Sorry.

111
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,000
It's okay. You don't need to apologize.

112
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,920
Everyone has the right
to choose their own stance.

113
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,399
I didn't expect you
to be so understanding.

114
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Jinzhao told me it.

115
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,200
Beat him.

116
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,920
Beat him hard.

117
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,559
Being favored by the Lord Ming
is your good fortune.

118
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,239
How dare you escape?

119
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,399
Beat him.

120
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,160
Beat him
until he has no strength to escape.

121
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,399
That's outrageous.

122
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,480
You... You...

123
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,720
How dare you?

124
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,359
I will surely take your life today.

125
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,920
Lord Ming, please protect me.

126
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,119
I am not Lord Ming. I am Yue Qi.

127
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,079
Are you afraid
of revealing your identity?

128
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,559
Lord Ming, it's okay.

129
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,639
Kill all these people.

130
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:33,519
Then your whereabouts won't be revealed.

131
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,079
If anyone is to be killed,
it should be you.

132
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:38,639
No.

133
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,040
You really aren't Lord Ming.

134
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,239
Otherwise, why would you time and again

135
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,679
oppose us, the Holy Sect?

136
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:45,799
Go get her!

137
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,720
Abiding by nature
is the gate of righteousness.

138
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,679
Yue, do I look like a hero this way?

139
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,440
This way, you do.

140
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,760
Alright, Hero Ju,

141
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,880
it's time to find the water.

142
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't end up not becoming a hero,

143
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,519
but instead die of thirst here first.

144
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,639
Yue, what did you call me just now?

145
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,519
Hero.

146
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:06,720
Hero... I am a great hero.

147
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,440
Yue.

148
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,079
Gao Xiao!

149
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,600
Yue. Yue.

150
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,560
Yue,

151
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:08,720
it doesn't seem like
there is a water source nearby.

152
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,399
What's wrong with you?

153
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,280
I'm not sure.

154
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,839
I can't quite explain the feeling.

155
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:17,839
I feel a bit anxious.

156
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,240
You're worried about Little Yue,
aren't you?

157
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,040
Indeed, Little Yue is frail

158
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,480
and gentle,

159
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:32,720
yet adorable.

160
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,999
It's perfectly normal for you
to worry about her.

161
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,160
However, Master Luo is reliable.

162
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,519
You can be at ease.

163
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:43,959
Hero Ju,

164
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,079
clearly, you do not know Qi.

165
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,600
Let's go.

166
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,439
No.

167
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,120
Yue!

168
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,568
Little Yue is actually so formidable.

169
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,079
I was arbitrary.

170
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,079
(After consuming the Qiyuan Orb,)

171
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,600
(the power of Qi
has increased quite a bit.)

172
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,839
Are you okay?

173
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,519
Shifang, keep an eye on that person.

174
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,920
Luo, let's cooperate with each other.

175
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:41,639
Okay.

176
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,199
Qi!

177
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,720
Are you alright?

178
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,480
Jinzhao, I want to try Mindlink.

179
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,800
No, you've just been injured.

180
00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:32,399
Jinzhao, I want to protect everyone.

181
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:06,600
Qi,

182
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:08,319
I can't hold on much longer.

183
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:10,360
I'll hold off the giant scorpion.

184
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,920
You all quickly look for a chance
to leave.

185
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,480
No way.

186
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,839
Whether it's to kill or feel,
we do it together.

187
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,720
I won't leave you alone.

188
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:08,888
(Xian Qing)

189
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:20,408
(Ming Xiu, disciple of Mount Yuqing)

190
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:32,519
You are so impressive.

191
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,800
Thank you for lending a hand.

192
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,999
Thanks.

193
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,160
Done.

194
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,439
It still hurts a lot.

195
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:01,639
It will be better in a while.

196
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,879
This medicine is very good.

197
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,680
This medicine is very precious.

198
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,680
I don't give it to just anyone.

199
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,720
Jinzhao,

200
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,199
does this mean you have made amends
with Zhaoyan?

201
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,439
You're so smart.

202
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,120
Thanks, Yue.

203
00:16:36,728 --> 00:16:37,959
May I have your names?

204
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:38,600
I am...

205
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,199
He is the handsome and dashing,
wise and brave,

206
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,399
unbeatable and generous Luo,
with exceptional martial strength.

207
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,240
I'm Luo Zhaoyan.

208
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:48,720
(This aura...)

209
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:52,199
(It can't be wrong.)

210
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:57,959
This is the renowned head
of the Zhengwu Alliance's Jiqiao Hall,

211
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,920
Ju Shifang.

212
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:05,639
My name is Yue Qi.

213
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,839
And I love eating egg noodles the most.

214
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,639
That's all.

215
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:10,456
Qi.

216
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,120
This is Yue Jinzhao,
and that one is Yue Qi.

217
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,879
I'm Ming Xiu.

218
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,879
A name is but an external fleetness.

219
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:24,439
Just like Xiu,

220
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:25,800
you can call me Xian Qing.

221
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,639
Little Shifang.

222
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,439
Little Zhaoyan.

223
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,560
Little Jinzhao.

224
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,240
Little Qi.

225
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:37,480
Please don't call me Little Qi.

226
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,319
It doesn't sound cool.

227
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:40,439
Just call me Little Yue.

228
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:42,759
Little Yue.

229
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,519
This place is in a remote location.

230
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,160
Xian Qing, Miss Ming,

231
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,480
why have you come here?

232
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,360
Xiu is a disciple of Mount Yuqing.

233
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,800
I am entrusted by her master

234
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,040
to accompany her on a journey.

235
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,439
We passed by this place.

236
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,160
I have heard storytellers mention

237
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,639
that Mount Yuqing

238
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,959
is the most, most, most secretive sect
in the jianghu.

239
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,079
And it's rare to see disciples
of Mount Yuqing in the jianghu.

240
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,959
Little Yue,
you are really well-informed.

241
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,959
Indeed, Mount Yuqing
has a sparse number of people.

242
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:14,199
Yes.

243
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:17,519
We only have two people and one dog.

244
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,248
Between those two people,

245
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:22,560
that dog is quite superfluous.

246
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,399
By the way,

247
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:31,040
why are you all here?

248
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,120
He is the reason we came.

249
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,360
How is it? Does the wound still hurt?

250
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:46,800
It stopped hurting a while ago.

251
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,176
It's just that...

252
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:52,560
Jinzhao,

253
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,160
in the past,
I only wanted to protect you.

254
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,560
But just now,

255
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,248
when I saw Zhaoyan
and the others in danger,

256
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,800
I wanted to protect them too.

257
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,639
It's your first time protecting others

258
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,999
and fighting alongside them.

259
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,200
What does it feel like?

260
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,560
It feels warm here.

261
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,280
Let's go.

262
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:19,599
to see how Miss Ming

263
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:21,080
helped that person.

264
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:46,960
Sir.

265
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,639
You startled me.

266
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,800
Let's hurry on our way.

267
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,160
To where?

268
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,479
I'd very much like
to send you on your way to death.

269
00:19:58,479 --> 00:19:59,960
It was not easy
to bring a human sacrifice back.

270
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:02,119
And it's gone again.

271
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:03,999
Director Gao,

272
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,359
haven't we already
had the rest of the human sacrifice

273
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:07,599
delivered to Luori Village?

274
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,399
So what if one is lost?

275
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,840
It's all your fault.

276
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,200
You are such a lazy bone

277
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,119
and completely useless.

278
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,359
Then...

279
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,119
Let's counter-attack now.

280
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,519
Counter-attack, my foot.

281
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:20,599
How do we counter-attack?

282
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:22,519
You can try it yourself.

283
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,200
It doesn't matter.

284
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,320
After all, Lord Shengxuan said

285
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,719
he would take care
of the Luori Village matter.

286
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,200
Let's leave here for now

287
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,359
and recuperate.

288
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,879
Life is like a play.
We can always start over if need be.

289
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,160
Well said.

290
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:38,119
Come on.

291
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,999
Are you sure he was a human sacrifice

292
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:49,960
abducted by the Qiyuan Sect?

293
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:50,999
That's right.

294
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,560
We've come here specially
to investigate this.

295
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,759
Luori Village
must have a Qiyuan Sect stronghold.

296
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,759
I see.

297
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:00,759
Then Xiu and I

298
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,560
will deal
with the Qiyuan Sect threat here

299
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,560
before we leave.

300
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,440
Thank you for your help.

301
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:10,160
Then Qi and I
will go ahead to scout the situation.

302
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,719
Please take good care of that person.

303
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,680
I've heard

304
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:28,664
that there is a traveling physician
named Bian Luohuan in Luori Village

305
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:30,160
whose medical skills are excellent.

306
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:31,999
I've treated him a bit.

307
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,840
But you still

308
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,680
need to get him there
as soon as possible.

309
00:21:35,224 --> 00:21:35,920
So,

310
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,440
instead of worrying about
being defeated one by one by the enemy,

311
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:40,840
we'd better wait for the opportunities.

312
00:21:52,051 --> 00:21:53,525
(Luori Village)

313
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:13,560
Sir,

314
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,359
may I ask where Physician Bian is?

315
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,519
Physician Bian?

316
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:17,920
He's treating patients
in the thatched cottage.

317
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,599
Over there.

318
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,239
Qi!

319
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:25,560
Where is Senior Xian Qing?

320
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:26,999
Him?

321
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:28,759
He ate too much
and has gone for a walk to digest.

322
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,720
(Bian Luohuan)

323
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,080

325
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:42,759

I am Bian Luohuan.

My name is Yue Qi.

335
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,759
Qi?

336
00:24:36,824 --> 00:24:37,399
Qi?

337
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,560
Jinzhao, aren't you too slow?

338
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,999
You're too fast.

339
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,440
This is the Physician Bian
we've been looking for.

340
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,719
Physician Bian,

341
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,200
this patient has been invaded
by demonic poison.

342
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,280
Please save him.

343
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,359
It's a simple effort for me.

344
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,719
Put the patient on the couch.

345
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,239
The external whip wounds
are easy to treat.

346
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:26,040
But the inner poison

347
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,440
will take some effort.

348
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:29,960
You've handled it properly.

349
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:33,119
After I apply the acupuncture
to expel the poison, he will be fine.

350
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:34,399
However, he has lost too much blood.

351
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,719
He needs to sleep a bit more.

352
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,080
Thank you, Physician Bian.

353
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,119
No matter how you thank me,
I won't charge you less.

354
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:41,840
How did he get injured?

355
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,320
We were traveling here

356
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,639
and found this man being escorted
by the Qiyuan Sect.

357
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
So, we intervened to save him.

358
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,560
Yet he was poisoned
and fell into a coma.

359
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:50,759
We had no choice but to come here
to seek your treatment.

360
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,280
I see.

361
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,080
Jinzhao,

362
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,879
is there a water jug here?

363
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:58,040
I'm really thirsty.

364
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,719
Hold on a little longer.

365
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
I'll take you to find water in a while.

366
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,280
It was inconsiderate of me.

367
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,920
I'll prepare tea
for all of you right away.

368
00:26:17,336 --> 00:26:18,520
How amazing!

369
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,759
Why is Little Yue's cup
different from ours?

370
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:25,812
Physician Bian,

371
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:27,292
we are quite thirsty as well.

372
00:26:42,092 --> 00:26:43,251
This water is really sweet.

373
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:49,572
Physician Bian,
we need to go to the village

374
00:26:49,812 --> 00:26:51,172
to find a place to stay for the night.

375
00:26:51,332 --> 00:26:53,251
Please take care of this person for now.

376
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:56,131
I am truly sorry, Physician Bian.

377
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:57,292
I've also been injured.

378
00:26:57,651 --> 00:26:59,651
I may need to rest here for a bit.

379
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:00,692
Please feel free.

380
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:17,452
Let's go.

381
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:32,572
Physician Bian, have we met before?

382
00:27:33,172 --> 00:27:33,731
Perhaps.

383
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:38,452
I have an ugly appearance.

384
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:40,971
It's inconvenient to show my real face.

385
00:27:42,812 --> 00:27:43,491
Qi,

386
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:44,771
it's impolite to do so.

387
00:27:45,251 --> 00:27:45,651
Let's go.

388
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:07,651
What's going on
with you and Physician Bian?

389
00:28:08,172 --> 00:28:09,611
What do you mean, 'what's going on'?

390
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:11,172
Have you seen him before?

391
00:28:11,651 --> 00:28:13,172
If you've seen him, I have.

392
00:28:13,332 --> 00:28:15,491
If you haven't seen him,
I haven't seen him either.

393
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,052
Alright, then.

394
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,532
Let's go spread the message.

395
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:24,692
I'll stay here with Zhaoyan.

396
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:27,932
Are you staying for him, or...

397
00:28:30,771 --> 00:28:32,251
(Why am I even getting angry?)

398
00:28:32,952 --> 00:28:33,532
Never mind.

399
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:35,052
Then, take care.

400
00:29:03,052 --> 00:29:04,011
I didn't expect

401
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,292
that you,
who are usually lazy by nature,

402
00:29:06,532 --> 00:29:07,932
would be willing to be close to humans.

403
00:29:11,052 --> 00:29:11,731
Xiu

404
00:29:12,932 --> 00:29:15,532
Luo Zhaoyan has half of my demoic power.

405
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:18,172
You've given away
so much of your cultivation.

406
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:20,332
Is it strange for him
to have half of your demonic power?

407
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:22,292
Xiu, you understand me so well.

408
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,412
I'm very gratified.

409
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:26,491
Could it be

410
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,371
that he is the child from 20 years ago?

411
00:29:30,891 --> 00:29:31,491
Help!

412
00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:34,011
Help!

413
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,032
Help!

414
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:40,011
Help! Help!

415
00:30:15,611 --> 00:30:16,332
Human,

416
00:30:17,212 --> 00:30:18,251
this is a land of demons.

417
00:30:18,932 --> 00:30:20,251
You shouldn't be here.

418
00:30:24,212 --> 00:30:25,052
You are a demon as well.

419
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:29,131
Then you also possess demonic power.

420
00:30:32,011 --> 00:30:33,971
I beg you.

421
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:35,611
Lend me your demonic orb

422
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:37,212
to save my daughter.

423
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:39,692
I'm begging you.

424
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,491
I'm begging you.

425
00:30:42,172 --> 00:30:43,251
Please.

426
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:44,052
But back then,

427
00:30:44,812 --> 00:30:46,971
he clearly said
it was to save his daughter's life.

428
00:30:54,692 --> 00:30:55,131
Shifang.

429
00:30:57,891 --> 00:30:58,532
Where is Little Yue?

430
00:30:59,011 --> 00:31:00,491
She went
to see Luo and the injured person.

431
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:04,092
Ma'am,

432
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:05,371
we're passing through here.

433
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:06,332
Are there

434
00:31:06,452 --> 00:31:07,891
any vacant thatched cottages
in the village?

435
00:31:14,812 --> 00:31:16,771
Yue,

436
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:19,251
could we really startle the enemy
by asking like this?

437
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:22,412
The moment
we brought people into the village,

438
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:23,932
we had already startled the enemy.

439
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:26,452
Only when Luori Village is rife
with rumors can we be at ease.

440
00:31:26,692 --> 00:31:28,131
If there isn't a single piece of news,

441
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:29,812
we must be prepared.

442
00:31:33,172 --> 00:31:34,971
Yue, you are really well-informed.

443
00:31:36,332 --> 00:31:36,971
But, Yue,

444
00:31:37,692 --> 00:31:40,532
we don't know
if Physician Bian is good or bad.

445
00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:42,011
And Luo is injured.

446
00:31:42,452 --> 00:31:43,932
Little Yue wouldn't be in danger, right?

447
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:44,932
Rest assured.

448
00:31:45,532 --> 00:31:46,251
Ten of you can't beat

449
00:31:46,332 --> 00:31:47,611
one wounded Luo Zhaoyan.

450
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:48,971
And ten wounded Luo Zhaoyans

451
00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:51,572
can't beat one well-fed Qi.

452
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:54,771
I also want one like Little Yue...

453
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:56,212
What did you say?

454
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:56,851
I didn't hear clearly.

455
00:31:58,412 --> 00:32:00,851
I said I also wanted a sister
like Little Yue.

456
00:32:02,692 --> 00:32:04,491
Plain noodles! Egg noodles!

457
00:32:04,611 --> 00:32:05,812
Sir, a bowl of egg noodles.

458
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:07,172
Alright, coming right up.

459
00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:16,332
Sir.

460
00:32:16,971 --> 00:32:18,412
Can I get credit here?

461
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:21,976
You have no money?

462
00:32:22,771 --> 00:32:24,371
If you're not eating, then hurry along.

463
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:25,412
Don't hinder my business.

464
00:32:25,731 --> 00:32:26,332
Two bowls.

465
00:32:26,692 --> 00:32:27,212
Physician Bian.

466
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:28,092
Here.

467
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:30,532
Alright, coming right up.

468
00:32:31,611 --> 00:32:33,611
Physician Bian, why are you here?

469
00:32:34,251 --> 00:32:34,891
I'm just passing through.

470
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:43,212
The jade pendant you have
is quite unique.

471
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:46,452
Jinzhao gave it to me.

472
00:32:51,532 --> 00:32:53,651
You seem to really like fish.

473
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:55,812
Yes, I do.

474
00:32:56,332 --> 00:32:59,131
I like them so much
that I can't bear to eat them.

475
00:32:59,932 --> 00:33:00,452
By the way,

476
00:33:01,651 --> 00:33:04,572
I also have a hair tie
with a little fish that I really like.

477
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:06,731
I've worn it for three years already.

478
00:33:10,808 --> 00:33:11,692
Look.

479
00:33:33,131 --> 00:33:34,131
I like fish a lot too.

480
00:33:34,692 --> 00:33:37,052
I used to have a little fish at home.

481
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:39,052
We grew up together.

482
00:33:42,532 --> 00:33:43,292
And then?

483
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,292
And then

484
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:48,651
it got lost.

485
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:49,491
Got lost?

486
00:33:51,332 --> 00:33:52,452
Did you find it then?

487
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:55,052
I couldn't find it again.

488
00:33:57,971 --> 00:33:59,771
You must have been very sad.

489
00:34:10,812 --> 00:34:12,131
Enjoy your noodles.

490
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:14,771
Here.

491
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:30,572
Here's an egg for you to eat.

492
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:35,011
Thank you, Physician Bian.
You're really kind.

493
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:36,692
If it were Jinzhao,

494
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:38,692
he'd definitely have snatched my egg.

495
00:34:39,052 --> 00:34:40,052
That's right.

496
00:34:42,131 --> 00:34:43,572
Jinzhao, give it back to me.

497
00:34:43,891 --> 00:34:44,532
No.

498
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,572
I still have patients to treat.

499
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:50,228
Thank you, Physician Bian.

500
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:52,891
Take care, Physician Bian.

501
00:34:56,771 --> 00:34:57,651
Why was he here too?

502
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:00,172
I don't know.

503
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:01,572
Maybe he was hungry too.

504
00:35:03,731 --> 00:35:04,692
This is really tasty.

505
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:06,771
Slow down.

506
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:09,491
You've got hair in your mouth.

507
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:13,011
Then I'll meet up with Shifang.

508
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:15,608
I won't go with you.

509
00:35:15,608 --> 00:35:16,572
Physician Bian gave me a lot of money,

510
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:18,251
enough for me to eat many bowls.

511
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,332
Alright, then get back soon
after you finish eating.

512
00:35:22,932 --> 00:35:24,812
Luo and that person are still hurt.

513
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:25,611
Rest assured.

514
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:27,332
I will certainly take good care of them.

515
00:35:27,532 --> 00:35:29,052
Okay. Slow down.

516
00:35:34,292 --> 00:35:35,731
Sir, another bowl, please.

517
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:39,971
I wonder what there could be
in this village.

518
00:35:45,692 --> 00:35:46,932
Miss Shuoxuan?

519
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:47,812
Shifang,

520
00:35:48,651 --> 00:35:49,651
how has the rumor been spread?

521
00:35:50,932 --> 00:35:51,812
It's just that area left.

522
00:35:52,332 --> 00:35:52,731
Let's go.

523
00:35:57,611 --> 00:35:59,371
You said the Qiyuan Sect
attacked and hurt people.

524
00:35:59,611 --> 00:36:00,212
Yes.

525
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:01,851
But fortunately,
thanks to Physician Bian.

526
00:36:01,932 --> 00:36:04,052
The injured person
has already been treated by him.

527
00:36:05,891 --> 00:36:07,011
We have pursued the traces
all the way here.

528
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,572
Maybe it's related to Luori Village.

529
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:09,691
Sir,

530
00:36:09,892 --> 00:36:12,132
has there been anything unusual
in the village lately?

531
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:15,171
Then I'll have to go back and ask.

532
00:36:15,491 --> 00:36:18,052
But there are only a few households
in our village.

533
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:19,211
And everybody knows each other well.

534
00:36:20,171 --> 00:36:22,211
It's unlikely there are bad people here.

535
00:36:22,332 --> 00:36:22,931
Rest assured, sir.

536
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:24,092
With us here,
there's no need to be afraid.

537
00:36:24,612 --> 00:36:26,251
It's just that we need to rest here
for two days

538
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:27,771
and wait for the patient to get better.

539
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,852
Are there any vacant thatched cottages
in the village?

540
00:36:30,211 --> 00:36:30,892
Yes, there are.

541
00:36:31,211 --> 00:36:33,451
There are a few empty thatched cottages
on the northwest side of the village.

542
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:34,372
I'll take you there.

543
00:36:40,971 --> 00:36:41,931
The village head has returned.

544
00:36:43,532 --> 00:36:45,411
Dad, were those two young men earlier

545
00:36:45,731 --> 00:36:47,411
talking about the Qiyuan Sect
attacking and harming people?

546
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:48,491
Yes, Zhuo.

547
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:49,491
That's right.

548
00:36:49,971 --> 00:36:52,171
You all must be extra careful.

549
00:36:52,332 --> 00:36:54,251
Our village is the only one nearby.

550
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:56,612
Could it be
that there are Qiyuan Sect members here?

551
00:36:57,292 --> 00:36:58,092
Impossible.

552
00:36:58,612 --> 00:37:00,771
How could there possibly be
Qiyuan Sect members in our village?

553
00:37:01,132 --> 00:37:01,771
Exactly.

554
00:37:02,092 --> 00:37:04,532
They said
the person attacked by Qiyuan Sect

555
00:37:04,652 --> 00:37:06,852
is recuperating
at Physician Bian's place.

556
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:07,971
When he wakes up,

557
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,572
we can just ask him.

558
00:37:09,652 --> 00:37:10,771
Yeah, we can.

559
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,211
We must ask him once he's awake.

560
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:17,211
Drink slowly.

561
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:19,771
Here. Have something to eat.

562
00:37:22,052 --> 00:37:23,572
Are all these for me?

563
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:30,491
Physician Bian, you are so kind.

564
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:32,532
Is Physician Bian here?

565
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:47,931
Miss Yue,

566
00:37:48,971 --> 00:37:51,011
we must be cautious and prudent
in everything we do.

567
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:52,971
Especially when we are away from home...

568
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:54,852
We should help each other even more

569
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,171
and share with each other.

570
00:37:59,251 --> 00:37:59,812
Thank you.

571
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:01,411
Miss Yue,

572
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:03,491
thank you for helping me out today.

573
00:38:04,132 --> 00:38:06,292
No need to thank me.
That's what friends are for.

574
00:38:09,171 --> 00:38:09,931
Miss Yue,

575
00:38:10,931 --> 00:38:11,572
I'm sorry.

576
00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:13,812
Why do you say that?

577
00:38:15,572 --> 00:38:18,332
I've been suspecting all along
that you were Lord Ming.

578
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:20,771
Even though Maiming said
you might not be,

579
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,411
my suspicions
were never truly cleared away.

580
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:25,532
I am not Lord Ming.

581
00:38:26,451 --> 00:38:27,971
Miss Yue, you are innocent and adorable.

582
00:38:28,132 --> 00:38:30,812
You're also brave enough
to lend a hand in times of danger.

583
00:38:30,971 --> 00:38:32,812
I think we've become friends.

584
00:38:34,652 --> 00:38:35,411
Physician Bian,

585
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:38,332
is what those outsiders said true?

586
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:39,971
Just give us a straight answer.

587
00:38:40,332 --> 00:38:41,812
We're all scared to death.

588
00:38:42,211 --> 00:38:43,171
Yes, Physician Bian.

589
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:44,771
Just tell us.

590
00:38:44,892 --> 00:38:46,451
I still have the patient
waiting for treatment.

591
00:38:46,971 --> 00:38:48,771
It's not a solution for you
to wait outside.

592
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:50,132
It would be better for you to go home.

593
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,332
Once the patient wakes up,

594
00:38:51,852 --> 00:38:53,731
your questions will be answered.

595
00:38:53,812 --> 00:38:55,052
Village Head...

596
00:38:55,332 --> 00:38:55,931
That's true.

597
00:38:56,052 --> 00:38:56,852
Alright then, Physician Bian.

598
00:38:57,052 --> 00:38:58,411
We'll just wait
for the patient to wake up.

599
00:38:58,892 --> 00:38:59,892
Then let's go first.

600
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:01,092
Let's go.

601
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:02,211
We're leaving, Physician Bian.

602
00:39:03,771 --> 00:39:05,171
Since we're friends now,

603
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:08,052
I want to tell you something.

604
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:11,292
Okay, feel free to speak.

605
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:17,731
I feel Physician Bian

606
00:39:18,132 --> 00:39:19,731
is familiar

607
00:39:19,812 --> 00:39:21,372
since I first saw him.

608
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:22,931
He feels like Jinzhao.
