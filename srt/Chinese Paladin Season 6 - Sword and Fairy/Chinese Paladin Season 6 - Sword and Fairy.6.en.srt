I thought there were
precious items inside.

22
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,800
It turned out to be just
some ordinary valuables.

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,359
Those people from Qiyuan Sect

24
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:15,560
have looted so many valuables.

25
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,280
There must be a lot of victims.

26
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,359
What is this stone for?

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,904
Master Luo.

28
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,120
Heroes.

29
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,000
Heroes?

30
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,079
Is that referring to us?

31
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,759
What is it, everyone?

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,559
Heroes.

33
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,919
We'll never forget that you've saved us.

34
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:42,480
If there's anything I can help with,

35
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,840
I'll spare no effort.

36
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,160
It's okay, please get up.

37
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,800
It is our duty.

38
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,239
So this is what it feels like

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,640
to be a hero.

40
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,680
Everyone, are you leaving now?

41
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,079
We've been missing for days.

42
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,640
Our families must be extremely worried.

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,519
Since we were saved by you luckily,

44
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,280
it's time for us to go home.

45
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,280
But you all were kidnapped here.

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,479
You should have no money left.

47
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,040
We will figure it out on the way.

48
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,879
Even if we have to drink from rivers
and eat wild vegetables,

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,239
we will still make it home.

50
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,119
Whatever you say, Zhaoyan.

51
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,239
Everyone,

52
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,000
we found some of the Qiyuan Sect's loot.

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,879
Take some as travel expenses.

54
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,440
I'll make up for it later.

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,752
Thank you.

56
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,199
Thank you, hero.

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,320
Thank you so much, hero.

58
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:41,199
Let's go.

59
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:56,040
This pearl is beautiful.

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,519
Yu Xiang will definitely like it.

61
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,839
Thank you, heroes.

62
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,600
Thank you.

63
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,199
Many thanks.

64
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,399
Not bad for the Master
of the Luo family, Zhaoyan.

65
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,000
You flatter me, Senior.

66
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,039
It's the first time I've heard
uncle praise people.

67
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,199
Interesting.

68
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Yue Qi is suspected as Lord Ming.

69
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,600
And before it's resolved, we suspect
Bian Luohuan to be the Didact.

70
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,520
Maiming.

71
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,280
Do you think he is
the mastermind of Qiyuan Sect?

72
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,759
Just invite them to the Luo family.

73
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,319
We'll see about it then.

74
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:48,919
Okay.

75
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,119
Cang Feng.

76
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,160
I have a premonition.

00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,319
Physician Bian will surprise me.

78
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,200
You had a tough time, right?

79
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,728
Next time,

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,359
don't do such foolish things.

81
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,440
Whether it's for me

82
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,280
or for him.

84
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,760
I once swore not to use this spell.

85
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,040
But you're severely poisoned.

86
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,792

128
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,240

130

If you violate it,
you will be chastised.

132
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,759

137

No.

158

he will return soon.

whereabouts by chance.

in the Western Regions.

168
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:06,600

169
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,519

in Little Yue's room?

179
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,480
I suddenly felt sleepy

180
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:21,759
and dozed off.

181
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:23,720
It seems Jinzhao has also been affected.

182
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:25,528
If that's the case,

183
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,360
it's not strange

184
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,600
that Bian Luohuan has an antidote
that could save Miss Yue.

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,920

186

Why the people from Qiyuan Sect

187
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,800
would take the risk of exposure

188
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,519
to save Little Yue?

189
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,639
Could it be that

190
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:44,120
Physician Bian knew Little Yue?

191
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,959
Did I say something wrong?

192
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,199
You're not wrong.

193
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,480
The people from Qiyuan Sect
referred to Qi as Lord Ming.

194
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,399
Bian Luohuan is suspected to be
the sect leader or the Didact.

195
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,199
Bian Luohuan took the risk to save Qi.

196
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,160
The two of them…

197
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:06,920
Lord Ming?

198
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,040
It seems that a lot had happened

199
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,199
before we met.

200
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,879
Yeah.

201
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:15,920
Someone deliberately led us

202
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,160
to the Qiyuan Sect's
stronghold at Fujin Hall.

203
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,519
Qi took the Qiyuan Orb

204
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,079
and was seen as Lord Ming
by the Qiyuan Sect.

205
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,120
We are also baffled by that.

206
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,208
Everyone,

207
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,199
Qi and I have unclear backgrounds

208
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,439
and strange things keep happening.

209
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:36,888
Over the last three years,

210
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,959
we've been looking for our roots.

211
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,399
If you have any clue,

212
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,600
please be sure to tell us.

213
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:42,999
Even if

214
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,759
it does relate to the Qiyuan Sect.

215
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:47,800
Of course.

216
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:48,879
We are all friends.

217
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,560
Everyone has their secrets.

218
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,759
As long as we have no malice,

219
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,720
we are friends.

220
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,999
Jinzhao, we trust you.

221
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,519
Why not bring Physician Bian
to the Luo family

222
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,024
and see if Maiming can
get anything from him?

223
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,944
That's right.

224
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:04,600
Bian Luohuan is very likely

225
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,920
to be working for the Qiyuan Sect.

226
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,920
Let's set a trap for him.

227
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:11,439
I'll go and invite him.

228
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:13,560
Let's rest here tomorrow

229
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,648
and set off the day after.

230
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:15,992
Okay.

231
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,184
Physician Bian.

232
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,648
May I come in?

233
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:48,600
Come in.

234
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,439
Physician Bian.

235
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,319
Thanks to you,

236
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,839
Miss Yue is recovering.

237
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,040
We plan to set off
the day after tomorrow.

238
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,879
We brought you a lot of trouble lately,

239
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:07,519
so I came to invite you

240
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:08,680
to be our guest at the Luo Mansion.

241
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,240
It's no trouble.

242
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:13,280
I haven't been of much help.

243
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,560
I've only done my duty.

244
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,199
It's just a visit.

245
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,240
Please don't decline, Physician Bian.

246
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,680
Then I shall humbly comply.

247
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,079
I'll take my leave now.

248
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,360
Qi, you're awake.

249
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:01,920
How are you feeling?

250
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,792
I want water.

251
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,168
Okay, here.

252
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,360
So?

253
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,480
How do you feel?

254
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,360
Silly girl.

255
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:30,759
In the secret chamber, you could've
just dodged that arrow yourself.

256
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:32,360
Why did you protect Bian Luohuan?

257
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:36,720
I don't know.

258
00:18:37,336 --> 00:18:38,424
I just felt that

259
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:41,720
he's someone important

260
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:43,560
like you.

261
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:45,999
And I can't let him get hurt.

262
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:49,920
He's nothing like me.

263
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,560
I am the only one.

264
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,999
You can't compare me to him.

265
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:53,720
Do you hear me?

266
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,160
Just look at yourself.

267
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,879
He's fine.

268
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,040
But you have to suffer.

269
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:05,200
If I hadn't saved Physician Bian,

270
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,744
he would've died, right?

271
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,304
I don't understand

272
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,320
why humans fear death,

273
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,479
but you said

274
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,639
life is very precious.

275
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,856
A man has only one life.

276
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:19,040
Just like Zhaoyan said today,

277
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,479
even the life of an enemy

278
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:22,840
should not be taken lightly.

279
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,519
You wouldn't have said this before.

280
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,288
You are right.

281
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,759
But Zhaoyan is always right.

282
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:45,999
Yeah, Zhaoyan is right.

283
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,359
So you don't listen to me, right?

284
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,384
Jinzhao.

285
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,160
I just dreamed about you.

286
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:00,239
Me?

287
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,040
I dreamed that you gave me

288
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,800
a beautiful butterfly.

289
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,399
I gave you a butterfly?

290
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Yes, in my dream.

291
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,999
I only saw half of your face,

292
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,519
but I still recognized you.

293
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,320
Take a look at the bottom.

294
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,239
(You gave me a glowing
butterfly that can fly.)

295
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:29,912
(You put it at the bottom
of the food box)

296
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:30,776
(and waited for me to open it.)

297
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,080
How do you make a butterfly?

298
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,119
This is no work for a man.

299
00:21:11,595 --> 00:21:13,944
Jinzhao, I finally found you.

300
00:21:14,276 --> 00:21:14,676
Look.

301
00:21:15,036 --> 00:21:16,796
This is my latest invention.

302
00:21:16,995 --> 00:21:18,556
This elbow can even move.

303
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:19,676
Look, it can move when turned.

304
00:21:19,676 --> 00:21:21,916
Shifang, I'm not free today.

305
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:22,875
I'm thinking.

306
00:21:23,276 --> 00:21:24,196
Show it to me tomorrow.

307
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:30,036
What are you thinking about?

308
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:32,355
Tell me, I might be able
to give you some advice.

309
00:21:39,995 --> 00:21:40,635
Here is the thing.

310
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:42,744
Well,

311
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:45,240
I have a friend

312
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:50,396
who may perhaps

313
00:21:51,036 --> 00:21:54,635
possibly

314
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:56,916
have a girl in his heart.

315
00:21:59,556 --> 00:22:00,396
Do you understand?

316
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,916
I… do.

317
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:05,956
You're talking about Zhaoyan.

318
00:22:06,276 --> 00:22:06,916
What?

319
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:09,635
Zhaoyan.

320
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:14,916
A friend who has a girl in his heart.

321
00:22:15,276 --> 00:22:16,156
That's Zhaoyan, isn't it?

322
00:22:16,355 --> 00:22:17,432
What?

323
00:22:19,436 --> 00:22:19,835
Look.

324
00:22:20,595 --> 00:22:21,720
Your friend

325
00:22:22,235 --> 00:22:23,595
must be one of us.

326
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,196
Who said I only have

327
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:27,556
just you guys as friends?

328
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:29,276
Then I can also say

329
00:22:29,396 --> 00:22:32,515
you have Shuo Xuan in your heart.

330
00:22:32,796 --> 00:22:33,956
Nonsense.

331
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:34,956
I…

332
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:38,556
Jinzhao, don't talk nonsense.

333
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:39,436
Right.

334
00:22:40,156 --> 00:22:40,515
Then it's…

335
00:22:40,595 --> 00:22:41,956
Jinzhao, Shifang.

336
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:43,276
Luo.

337
00:22:44,715 --> 00:22:45,475
Here you are.

338
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:46,835
Luo, you came at the right time.

339
00:22:46,835 --> 00:22:47,556
We were just talking about you.

340
00:22:47,796 --> 00:22:49,115
What?

341
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:53,036
We are talking about a girl.

342
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:56,276
She told my friend

343
00:22:56,635 --> 00:22:58,635
that she dreamed of me… my friend

344
00:23:00,156 --> 00:23:02,635
giving her a butterfly.

345
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:04,408
Really?

346
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:06,995
Were we talking about this?

347
00:23:09,196 --> 00:23:11,316
What do you think that means?

348
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:13,475
I know now.

349
00:23:14,475 --> 00:23:15,595
It means

350
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:16,824
your friend

351
00:23:17,676 --> 00:23:19,076
is a butterfly.

352
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:21,076
Nonsense.

353
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,076
I think she might be hinting at you…

354
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:29,515
your friend

355
00:23:29,835 --> 00:23:30,956
about her expectations.

356
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:35,595
Expectations?

357
00:23:37,235 --> 00:23:39,436
That's right.

358
00:23:41,995 --> 00:23:44,216
You are truly the master, Luo.

359
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:45,595
Not only knowledgeable,

360
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,156
but also knows girls well.

361
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:49,595
Brilliant.

362
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:50,595
Shifang,

363
00:23:51,715 --> 00:23:53,196
I remember you have a box

364
00:23:53,276 --> 00:23:54,595
that can be opened
through a mechanism.

365
00:23:54,956 --> 00:23:55,396
Is it still there?

366
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:57,475
You mean

367
00:23:57,475 --> 00:23:59,316
the box that can be remotely
controlled to open.

368
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:00,796
Right, can I borrow it?

369
00:24:02,355 --> 00:24:03,672
You want to use my gadget?

370
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:04,995
Can I?

371
00:24:04,995 --> 00:24:06,316
Of course you can.

372
00:24:06,715 --> 00:24:08,436
Jinzhao, I've been dreaming that one day

373
00:24:08,676 --> 00:24:09,556
you'll use my gadget.

374
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,115
Jinzhao, wait here.

375
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:13,036
I'll go get it.

376
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:13,635
Okay.

377
00:24:13,956 --> 00:24:14,755
Wait here for me.

378
00:24:15,196 --> 00:24:15,995
I'll wait.

379
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:19,755
Expectation of me.

380
00:24:20,956 --> 00:24:22,556
You borrow Shifang's gadget

381
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:24,676
to give Miss Yue a surprise?

382
00:24:26,036 --> 00:24:26,595
How do you know?

383
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:53,475
Jinzhao, where are you taking me?

384
00:24:53,755 --> 00:24:54,316
Here we are.

385
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:59,156
Okay, three, two, one.

386
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:14,648
It's so beautiful!

387
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:17,396
Jinzhao, how did you find this place?

388
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:25,676
How did you find it?

389
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:28,235
I just found it.

390
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:43,436
Why is there no fragrance?

391
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:01,208
Butterflies!

392
00:26:05,595 --> 00:26:07,355
Butterflies!

393
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:10,235
So many butterflies!

394
00:26:37,436 --> 00:26:39,076
Jinzhao, look, butterfly.

395
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:44,796
You are so bad.

396
00:26:44,796 --> 00:26:46,235
You blew away my butterfly!

397
00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:22,355
Jinzhao.

398
00:27:23,036 --> 00:27:25,355
Isn't that the Polaris you talked about

399
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,115
that can be used for navigation?

400
00:27:30,396 --> 00:27:31,515
It's that one.

401
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,076
You can't even find the right star.

402
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:35,676
What if you get lost one day?

403
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:40,436
I have you with me.

404
00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:41,835
You wouldn't abandon me, would you?

405
00:27:48,475 --> 00:27:49,196
(Mr. Yue,)

406
00:27:50,156 --> 00:27:51,316
(is she really your sister?)

407
00:27:52,595 --> 00:27:53,436
(You're not)

408
00:27:54,076 --> 00:27:55,835
(acting like a typical elder brother.)

409
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:01,436
What are you doing?

410
00:28:06,556 --> 00:28:07,916
Now you can't abandon me.

411
00:28:14,036 --> 00:28:14,676
Qi,

412
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:17,176
who am I

413
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:18,916
to you?

414
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:20,440
You're Jinzhao.

415
00:28:21,956 --> 00:28:23,396
No, I mean,

416
00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:26,676
do you see me as a brother

417
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:28,956
or someone else?

418
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:32,984
You're Jinzhao.

419
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:43,556
What's wrong?

420
00:28:44,276 --> 00:28:44,796
Nothing.

421
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:49,515
I shouldn't be expecting anything.

422
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:55,436
But it's good
you don't take me as your brother.

423
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:02,796
It's a bit cold. Let's go back.

424
00:29:03,436 --> 00:29:03,995

Little Yue, you have recovered well.

464
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:36,595
Physician Bian is great indeed.

465
00:31:37,276 --> 00:31:38,392
Physician Bian saved me?

466
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:39,576
Yes.

467
00:31:42,556 --> 00:31:43,115
Jinzhao.

468
00:31:44,276 --> 00:31:44,995
What's wrong with your leg?

469
00:31:45,475 --> 00:31:45,875
I…

470
00:31:46,115 --> 00:31:46,635
He's fine.

471
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,556
He just carried me
for a while last night.

472
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:51,115
He must be faking.

473
00:31:51,196 --> 00:31:52,835
Last night?

474
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:55,796
That's very grateful of you.

475
00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:57,115
Of course.

476
00:31:57,355 --> 00:31:58,276
I'm not heavy.

477
00:31:58,515 --> 00:32:00,475
You just carried me for a little while.

478
00:32:00,715 --> 00:32:01,595
How can you be sore?

479
00:32:01,715 --> 00:32:02,956
You're definitely faking.

480
00:32:03,076 --> 00:32:04,156
That's right.

481
00:32:11,355 --> 00:32:13,144
Ming Xiu, save me.

482
00:32:15,715 --> 00:32:17,272
Physician Bian, what brings you here?

483
00:32:19,115 --> 00:32:20,916
Are you coming with us?

484
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,036
Physician Bian,

485
00:32:27,036 --> 00:32:28,796
thank you for saving me last night.

486
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:30,276
You wake up

487
00:32:30,475 --> 00:32:32,235
because of your
abundant spiritual power.

488
00:32:32,835 --> 00:32:34,835
Moreover, you saved me yesterday.

489
00:32:42,595 --> 00:32:43,796
Now that everyone's here,

490
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:44,875
let's get going.

491
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,472
(Yunlai Stone)

492
00:33:09,316 --> 00:33:10,475
This stone is magical.

493
00:33:10,595 --> 00:33:11,864
It's like an island.

494
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:14,235
This is the Yunlai Stone,

495
00:33:14,396 --> 00:33:15,676
a divine stone from ancient times.

496
00:33:15,916 --> 00:33:17,995
It can take you anywhere you wish to go.

497
00:33:23,676 --> 00:33:25,156
Ming Xiu, what is this?

498
00:33:32,355 --> 00:33:34,276
It's used to confirm the destination.

499
00:33:42,796 --> 00:33:44,355
Qi, slow down.

500
00:34:01,796 --> 00:34:02,676
Thank you, Physician Bian.

501
00:34:04,355 --> 00:34:05,956
Thank you for saving my Qi,
Physician Bian.

502
00:34:09,635 --> 00:34:10,796
A jealous one.

503
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:31,556
I wonder if you two have any plans.

504
00:34:31,995 --> 00:34:32,676
If you don't mind,

505
00:34:33,396 --> 00:34:35,196
please stay for a few more days.

506
00:34:36,956 --> 00:34:37,816
We'd be delighted.

507
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:40,115
No need.

508
00:34:40,796 --> 00:34:42,316
Since Uncle wants to stay,

509
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:43,595
I will take my leave first.

510
00:34:44,076 --> 00:34:44,835
Thank you, Master Luo.

511
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:47,676
Before we set off,

512
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:49,396
Hanjiang had specified

513
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:50,796
that you should make more friends.

514
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:54,515
There's no rush to send the greeting
cards to the Zhengwu Alliance.

515
00:34:55,995 --> 00:34:57,112
If you leave so abruptly,

516
00:34:57,875 --> 00:34:59,196
he will be sad.

517
00:35:01,276 --> 00:35:03,076
I will never befriend those
who harbor demons.

518
00:35:18,156 --> 00:35:19,595
Ming Xiu is leaving?

519
00:35:20,088 --> 00:35:21,355
That's her nature.

520
00:35:22,436 --> 00:35:23,355
Please don't mind her.

521
00:35:27,196 --> 00:35:28,515
Let's go, everyone.

522
00:35:35,115 --> 00:35:35,835
Physician Bian.

523
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:37,556
After you.

524
00:35:48,076 --> 00:35:49,316
(This time at the Luo Mansion,)

525
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:51,076
(I wonder if I'll see Luo Wangping)

526
00:35:51,595 --> 00:35:53,515
(who took away my cultivation.)

527
00:36:00,276 --> 00:36:01,036
Surround Bian Luohuan.

528
00:36:01,276 --> 00:36:02,232
Yes!

529
00:36:07,156 --> 00:36:08,516
You have finally

530
00:36:09,196 --> 00:36:10,396
shown your trap.

531
00:36:11,115 --> 00:36:11,996
What's going on?

532
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:13,676
Isn't Physician Bian coming here

533
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:15,075
as a guest?

534
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:16,476
Little Yue.

535
00:36:16,956 --> 00:36:18,996
Physician Bian is very likely
to be related to the Qiyuan Sect.

536
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:22,716
Physician Bian.

537
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:24,875
Is that true?

538
00:36:25,795 --> 00:36:26,476
Do you believe in them

539
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,156
or me?

540
00:36:33,035 --> 00:36:34,275
I believe in Jinzhao.

541
00:36:40,795 --> 00:36:41,275
Then

542
00:36:41,676 --> 00:36:43,275
why do you bother asking?

543
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:45,795
Let's go.

544
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,236
Qi, stop watching.

545
00:36:53,676 --> 00:36:54,996
If it's really related to our origins,

546
00:36:55,075 --> 00:36:56,236
this is the best way.

547
00:37:02,315 --> 00:37:04,436
(It's the first time Qi cares
so much about someone.)

548
00:37:05,795 --> 00:37:06,872
