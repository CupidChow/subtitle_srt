21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,800
Is there another way?

22
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:18,880
I knew it would come to this.

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,759
If there was another way to save Huan,

24
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,159
you wouldn't make this choice.

25
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,239
I knew the answer

26
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,079
but I couldn't help asking you.

27
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,360
I was hoping to find evidence
in the last three years

28
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,520
to prove that the past could be changed.

29
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,439
I even kept him away
from Mangwan Village.

30
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,599
But in the end, nothing has changed.

31
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,519
Back then, you delayed
Zhu Yu's transformation

32
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,000
with the power of Mist Soul
to contain her.

33
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,280
Thus, you were cursed,

34
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,720
causing severe decay of your viscera.

35
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:17,519
Otherwise, you would have chosen to
resonate with Qi by yourself.

36
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,680
All these years,

37
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,000
Huan and I have always
been afraid of losing you.

38
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:34,680
Today,

39
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:41,159
you're getting a taste of this feeling.

40
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,119
You are afraid, aren't you?

41
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,960
It's perfectly normal

42
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,199
to be afraid of losing loved ones.

43
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,559
All these years,

44
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:10,119
Huan and I have been
afraid of losing you.

45
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,256
Xuwei, Qingfei, where is Luohuan going?

46
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:24,312
He wouldn't tell me.

47
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,280
He's going somewhere far, far away.

48
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,360
Luohuan, it's getting late.
They're not coming.

49
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,056
It's not time yet.

50
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,399
Did something happen
to Jinzhao and Little Yue?

51
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,240
Guards.

52
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,440
You're truly heartless.

53
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,039
Are you going to grab us
and throw us down?

54
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,240
I'm asking you to stay.

55
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,640
Let's see if you can.

56
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,280
What's the matter, Ying Xuwei?

57
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:12,536
You don't trust us?

58
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,000
Jinzhao, Little Yue.

59
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,168
You shouldn't have come back.

60
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,600
We'd never abandon our friends.

61
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,448
You're right.

62
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,399
Of course, I wouldn't misjudge someone.

63
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,559
I'm ready. Let's go.

64
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,256
Let's go.

65
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,904
Let's go.

66
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,600
Qingfei, Xiaoyuan, take care.

67
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,559
Qingfei, why can't I see Luohuan off?

68
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,320
I wanted him to bring me gifts.

69
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,760
Have you copied the scriptures?
Don't be so naughty.

70
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,280
I just want to see Luohuan off.

71
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,440
I can copy the scripture later.

72
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,679
Anyway, Luohuan will help.

73
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,584
Bian Luohuan.

74
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,000
You're in a good mood?

75
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:01,160
Would you rather see me cry?

76
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,056
True, if I were the one
being sent to die, I'd be afraid.

77
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,920
Just a few days ago,
you saw me as a deadly enemy.

78
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,440
But now you're talking to me so calmly.

79
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,959
It's so strange.

80
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,959
Strange, indeed.

81
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,280
Consider it me feeling sorry for myself.

82
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,200
You think we are the same?

83
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,959
I did wonder if we were the same person
in the beginning.

84
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,679
But later, I realized

85
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,440
that we were worlds apart.

86
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,120
How so?

87
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,600
You're stingy, cheap,
and slick with words.

88
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,632
Enough...

89
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,160
I knew you wouldn't say anything nice.

90
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,399
But I slowly changed my opinion of you

91
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:06,559
until I came to see you in a new light.

92
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,519
Forget it. To be honest,
I became who I am today

93
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,559
partly thanks to you.

94
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,040
What you've been through
made you what you are now.

95
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,160
Exactly. I am just me.

96
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:28,839
Anyway, we are completely different.

97
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,288
Yeah.

98
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,559
Now that I think about it,
I chose the name

99
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,399
"Yue Jinzhao" by myself.

100
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,519
What does it mean?

101
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,639
Surpass the past self.
Everything starts from today.

102
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,880
Good name.

103
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,720
How are they suddenly getting along?

104
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,440
Little Yue, back when you were treated

105
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,119
as a piece of weapon at Yujie Hub,

106
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,200
it must have been hard for you.

107
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,839
Actually, my decade or so at Yujie Hub

108
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,119
wasn't as miserable as you all imagined.

109
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:29,272
How come?

110
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,480
Bian Luohuan was nice to me.

111
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,439
He accompanied me as I grew up,
educated me, and taught me swordplay.

112
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,999
He would try his best
to give me whatever I wanted.

113
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,832
But...

114
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:55,360
(What should I say to that?)

115
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,800
But a bird kept in a cage

116
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,120
lives in an illusion
without freedom, after all.

117
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,999
It's different when I'm with Jinzhao.

118
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,800
He showed me around
the Mortal Realm for three years.

119
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,160
There may have been hardships,
but I was truly alive.

120
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:26,519
The Resonance Spell between us
was never about control.

121
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,399
It's the bond between us.

122
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,208
Thanks.

123
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Mr. Ying, by decree of Her Lordship,

124
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,319
enter the hall alone.

125
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,120
Ying Xuwei, we'll wait for you here.

126
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,784
Miss Shuo Xuan.

127
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,399
Do you know
what the Qiyuan Orbs are for?

128
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,360
The Hengdao Sect
offers them to Her Lordship

129
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,079
to keep their
sad little hole of spring safe.

130
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,680
Each orb is a human life.

131
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,920
They don't feel guilty about it.

132
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,959
Why should I?

133
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,639
Besides, without the Qiyuan Orbs,

134
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:48,160
how would Her Lordship cure my people?

135
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,424
So, that's what you've been thinking.

136
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,560
Are you troubled because

137
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,319
you don't know whom to side with

138
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,568
if we fight Shuo Xuan?

139
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:20,160
No, I'm worried
about Jinzhao and Little Yue.

140
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:22,959
Miss Shuo Xuan and I

141
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,920
want to protect different things.

142
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:34,160
Miss Shuo Xuan, goodbye.

143
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,439
You want to enter Mist Soul.

144
00:13:58,199 --> 00:13:59,224
Yes.

145
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,800
What if I don't allow it?

146
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:14,839
Once upon a time, Shennong said,

147
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,199
'What has passed
is all predestined and bound to happen.'

148
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,800
If someone forcibly changes history

149
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,519
and disrupts the stream of time,

150
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,600
it will lead to the collapse and chaos
of the entire universe.

151
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Bian Luohuan went through Mist Soul
to exchange for Yue Jinzhao.

152
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,920
The encounter between Yue Jinzhao
and Qi is an established history.

153
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:45,560
If you insist on preventing us
from entering Mist Soul,

154
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,920
which prohibits Huan
from exchanging for Yue Jinzhao,

155
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,759
then Qi wouldn't meet Jinzhao
and the history would be changed.

156
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,040
The entire universe would collapse.

157
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,720
The Yu Clan would also cease to exist.

158
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:10,480
Even if I don't
grant you access to Mist Soul,

159
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,399
other factors will ensure that
the story takes the predestined course.

160
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,959
Ying Xuwei, I may
allow you to enter Mist Soul.

161
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,759
But I want
the key ring of Rehai in exchange.

162
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,280
Someone will bring it here
once they enter Mist Soul.

163
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,519
Alright, if you break your word,

164
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,319
I swear I will wipe out the Yujie Hub.

165
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,144
We're here.

166
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,879
I don't know
why Her Lordship let you in.

167
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,680
Xuwei, open up Mist Soul.

168
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,079
The Time Rift only lasts
for a moment, hurry.

169
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,088
Let's get in.

170
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,288
Come on.

171
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:41,080
Luohuan.

172
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:47,439
Yes, Xuwei?

173
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,648
Go ahead.

174
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,016
Take care, all of you.

175
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,720
This place seems detached from reality.

176
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,199
It's more desolate than
the other holes of springs

177
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,360
we've been to

178
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,759
as if it is no longer in this world.

179
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,280
The Split Abyss and the Time Rift

180
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:46,480
are beyond the Six Realms.
They are indeed otherworldly.

181
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,560
We managed to get here thanks to fate.

182
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:53,759
How do we determine

183
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,759
which point in time to return to?

184
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,800
The stream of time will tell us.

185
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:09,272
It may be dangerous.

186
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:12,560
Wait for us outside just in case.

187
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,096
Okay.

188
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,368
Let's go.

189
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,632
Let's go.

190
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,879
This is the secret chamber
of Luori Village.

191
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,680
Aren't we supposed
to go back to Yujie Hub?

192
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:43,800
How did we end up here?

193
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,160
I bet the stream of time

194
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
led us here for a reason.

195
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,479
What about the slaves?

196
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,800
Don't worry,
our past selves will save them.

197
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:09,879
It's the box we use
to store the Qiyuan Orbs.

198
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:10,920
- Watch out.
- Qi.

199
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,519
Oh right, you're the one
who set up the trap.

200
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,440
You forgot everything, yet you

201
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,519
risked yourself for me.

202
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:56,280
After all, you are my master.

203
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,096
Shifang.

204
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:08,792
The Dragon Crystal.

205
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,936
Okay.

206
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:19,680
This Dragon Crystal
led us to Wuyan Village.

207
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,599
There, we met Uncle Lin Yuan

208
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,080
and learned about Qi's identity.

209
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:31,200
We must guide our future selves

210
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,879
to do the same things.

211
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,719
It's us from three years ago, hurry up.

212
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,248
How did it go?

213
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,879
It seems that once we do our job,

214
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,719
we'll be sent back here.

215
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,800
That saves us a lot of trouble.

216
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:37,759
Let's go. It's time
to steal my past self.

217
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,560
Guys, it only concerns the three of us.

218
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,576
Let us deal with it.

219
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,440
Okay, let's meet up here later.

220
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,840
Qi, let's go.

221
00:23:01,884 --> 00:23:03,768
(Three years ago)

222
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,592
Master.

223
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,999
Master, take me
to the Mortal Realm for fun, please.

224
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,479
Naughty kid. Practice your swordplay.
All you think about is to play.

225
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:25,999
Master, I've lain in the Sea of Clouds
for a decade a Kun.

226
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:28,840
Then I stayed in Yujie Hub
for years in the human form.

227
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,560
It's been a whole decade and more.

228
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,879
I've come to know every single ant here.

229
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,840
Master, please.

230
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,399
Take me to the Mortal Realm, please.

231
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:41,759
Please, you've been nagging so much
that my ears are developing calluses.

232
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,719
Check it out. All thanks to you.

233
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:44,728
- See?
- There's nothing.

234
00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:48,920
Please, take me out for fun.

235
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
I really want some fun.

236
00:23:51,479 --> 00:23:55,032
Master, you are the best.
Please take me out.

237
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:56,680
Fine...

238
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:01,680
Go practice
at the Hundred-Foot Spring Platform.

239
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,519
I'll plead with Xuwei

240
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,719
to see if I can take you out, alright?

241
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:07,280
You must keep your word.

242
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,639
Of course. When have I
ever gone back on word?

243
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:38,280

00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:01,879
According to Ying Xuwei,

308
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:06,040
Bian Luohuan will tell him
about the exchange here, let's go.

309

312
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,040

313

Yue Jinzhao.

314
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:43,800
Xuwei, do you remember?

315
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,999
That's the name I once chose for myself.

316
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,599
My father passed away when I was young
and my mom got ill

317
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,200
from overwork.

318
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:03,200
She would hit me, curse me,
and end up abandoning me.

319
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:06,560
I got this scar on my face from then.

320
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:10,200
You found me wandering the street

321
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,920
and took me back to Yujie Hub.

322
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,119
You asked for my name.

323
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:20,440
I said my name was Yue Jinzhao.

324
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:24,840
Surpass the past self.
Start everything anew.

325
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,264
Do you remember what you said back then?

326
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,519
To avoid the past is an evasion.

327
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,320
Only by facing it,
can you truly move beyond.

328
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:54,759
Yes, indeed.

329
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,999

Qingfei and Xiaoyuan again.

Xuwei, you are the strongest among us.

333
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,279
You've been sheltering me
from all the wind and rain.

334
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,399

336
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,360
This time,

337
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,040
it's a real farewell.

338
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,119

She doesn't know us at this point.

345
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,680
It doesn't look like
she's going to grab someone's fur.
