21
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:16,960
Our honored guest has arrived.

22
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,304
My sincere welcome.

23
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,960
I have been waiting for your arrival,
Commander Ying.

24
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,280
You can resonate with Rehai.

25
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,400
I bet you're one of the guardians
of the Nine Springs.

26
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,000
Which hole of spring are you guarding?

27
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,864
Mist Soul.

28
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,879
I met Physician Bian some time ago

29
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,199
and I had many questions to ask.

30
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,559
You're here for...

31
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,080
I came for Rehai.

32
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:49,720
Commander Ying, you're really direct.

33
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,199
I heard the Zhengwu Alliance
wiped out the Qiyuan Sect.

34
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,280
The disciples mistook Miss Yue
for Lord Ming. Not only that.

35
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,640
She also turned into Kun on the spot.

36
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,160
You're very well-informed, Mr. Luo.

37
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,080
It seems that Luo Zhaoyan
has told you about it.

38
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,080
The Qiyuan Sect
was giving out Qiyuan Orbs

39
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,399
for Lord Ming to absorb energy.

40
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,959
Now you destroyed the Qiyuan Sect.

41
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,880
Is it because you've gathered
enough Qiyuan Orbs?

42
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,440
You found the answer. Why bother asking?

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,032
Not so.

44
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:40,640
There are many things
I haven't figured out.

45
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,080
Like the story between the Hengdao Sect
and the Sea of Clear Skies.

46
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:48,679
And why are you interested in Rehai

47
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,679
as the guardian of Mist Soul?

48
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,399
To achieve better cooperation,

49
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:00,959
please answer my questions.

50
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,720
I hope we can work well together.

51
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,039
This is the key ring of Rehai?

52
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,759
This key ring of Rehai

53
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,080
is an important item against Zhu Yu.

54
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,399
It's made from the dragon bone of Guixu.

55
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,919
Shennong forged
the key ring with dragon bone.

56
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:47,864
I duplicated it

57
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,360
to confuse Zhu Yu.

58
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,039
Interesting. The key ring
of Rehai can be forged.

59
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,080
Cang Feng, keep it.

60
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,919
Cang Feng, you're also
a guardian of Rehai now.

61
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,496
I appreciate that.

62
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,760
Next time we meet,
we'll discuss how to deal with Zhu Yu.

63
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,239
I've agreed
to side with you against Zhu Yu.

64
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,000
In exchange,

65
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,559
will you show me
some sincerity, Commander Ying?

66
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,079
I wonder if the way to remove
the Bloodbinding can show my sincerity.

67
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,160
Of course, it can.

68
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,679
Bloodbinding the hole of spring
defies the will of heaven.

69
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:54,839
It can only be removed
with the help of a kin's blood.

70
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,559
The closer the kin,
the more likely it's going to work.

71
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,399
Blood of a close kin.

72
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:09,480
There is another way.

73
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,320
The blood of the whole clan
works the same.

74
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,559
Zhaoyan, you finally came back.

75
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,880
What's that face?

76
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:58,839
Did you do something behind my back?

77
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,839
No, Maiming, Miss Ming needs a favor.

78
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
My master died.

79
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,200
I heard that the Dragon Pool
can bring back the deceased.

80
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,839
I'd like to go there through Rehai.

81
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,000
Miss Luo, please help me.

82
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,408
Maiming.

83
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,959
The Dragon Pool
is stationed with a garrison.

84
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,600
No one can enter easily.

85
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
Miss Ming, you don't look so well.

86
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,440
Why don't you rest tonight and enter

87
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:40,239
the Dragon Pool tomorrow?

88
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,784
Thank you.

89
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,880
Your friends have settled in?

90
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,080
Thank you, Maiming.

91
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,679
I will see Xian Qing and others now.

92
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,320
Zhaoyan, may I have a word with you?

93
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,600
You told them about Rehai.

94
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:21,119
It seems that you consider them
your important partners.

95
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:28,320
We've been through life and death.
I trust them.

96
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,359
I don't trust anyone,

97
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,239
but you.

98
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,839

I always say that I want to

make the Luo family thrive

But now...

You only have a few years left
because I took your life.

110
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,399
You disguise yourself
as a man to protect me.

111
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,959
Don't you resent such fate?

112
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,920
Don't you hate me?

My mind has never changed.

115
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,600
I'd be lying if I say
I've never felt resentment.

116
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,879
But since it's decided
that I can't live long,

117
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,920
I might as well focus on
living a brilliant life.

118
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,959
It gives me more freedom

123
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,160

Why don't you live as a girl?

136
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,439

182
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:41,976
Where is Zhaoyan?

183
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:43,768
She fell sick.

184
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,680
She told us to get you into Rehai first.

185
00:20:49,304 --> 00:20:50,759
How is she doing?

186
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:53,280
It's a chronic problem.
She just needs some rest.

187
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,879
We know Zhaoyan.

188
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,479
She'd come to say goodbye
even if she was sick.

189
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,160
I persuaded her to stay and rest.

190
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,008
What's wrong, Uncle?

191
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,599
Xian Qing is gone?

192
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:40,719
Yeah, he was right behind us.

193
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,440
I bet he has things to deal with.

194
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,519
Let's head to Dragon Pool first.

195
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,440
Yeah, let's deal with the things
about Mr. Gu first

196
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,160
and meet them later. Let's go.

197
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,744
Zhaoyan.

198
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:40,399
Maiming, what's going on?

199
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,800
A distinguished guest visited yesterday.

200
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:48,560
Guess what he told me?

201
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:53,960
He told me
how to remove the Bloodbinding.

202
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Really?

203
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,840
Back then, I thought

204
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:06,359
I could sacrifice just myself.

205
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,479
But I ended up as a prisoner forever,

206
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,840
constantly borrowing life from others

207
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:17,160
and living like a walking dead.

208
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:19,960
I know, Maiming.

209
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,479
You've been tormented all these years.

210
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,920
There is a way out now, right?

211
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:32,479
Yeah, he said only the blood
of the closest kin would work.

212
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:40,200
You need my blood.

213
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,840
Zhaoyan, do you remember

214
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,479
that you'd live or die with me?

215
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,519
I do. Of course.

216
00:23:56,399 --> 00:23:58,280
But all you have to do is ask, Maiming.

217
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,519
Why did you chain me up?

218
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:01,840
Because you've changed.

219
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,879
There is someone else on your mind now.

220
00:24:10,236 --> 00:24:12,952
(Guixu Maze of Memory)

221
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,920
What's going on?

222
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,399
Hello, intruders.

223
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,464
Are you the garrison of the Dragon Pool?

224
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,280
We're with the guardian of Pureness
and we're heading to the Dragon Pool.

225
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,448
Please let us pass.

226
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,759
Guardian of Pureness?

227
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,960
This guardian is so dark deep down.

228
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:42,424
What...

229
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,399
Miss Ming.

230
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,432
Ming Xiu.

231
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,359
Qi, hold my hand.

232
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:52,639
Stay lost in the maze
of memories forever.

233
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,160
Where is Xian Qing and others?
You didn't hurt them, right?

234
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,800
You're still thinking about him.

235
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,759
Where are they, Maiming?

236
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,560
Don't hurt them, okay?

237
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,399
I shouldn't have let you
go to the Luori Village.

238
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,759
That wolf demon
took the chance to approach you.

239
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,999
So you're targeting...

240
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:27,064
Yeah.

241
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,320
I'll kill the wolf demon.

242
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:36,200
Are you crazy, Maiming? Are you mad?

243
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:42,239
Why? You're worried
about him, aren't you?

244
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:43,320
Maiming.

245
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,359
By the end of the day,
you'll be back to normal.

246
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,800
Xian Qing, go! He's after you!

247
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,840
You're here.

248
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,719
Maiming...

249
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:25,359
Maiming...

250
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:27,040
Go, Xian Qing!

251
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:39,440
Luo Maiming,
you've always cherished Zhaoyan.

252
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:41,719
And she's done a lot for you.

253
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:45,840
I'm the one you want.
Why do you have to do this to her?

254
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,080
We've been
keeping each other company for years.

255
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,879
But now she only cares about you.

256
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,119
In that case, I might as well kill her.

257
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,960
You want to kill her? No way.

258
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:12,840
Maiming, let him go.

259
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,848
Xian Qing.

260
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,759
Maiming, please.

261
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,759
Maiming, please let him go.

262
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,119
Please don't hurt him.

263
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,136
Xian Qing.

264
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,599
I-I'm here.

265
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:51,928
Xian Qing.

266
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,519
Wolf demon,
if I apply a bit more pressure,

267
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,560
your life would be at risk.

268
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,936
Try again.

269
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,080
Xian Qing...

270
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,848
Xian Qing.

271
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:30,680
Mother, Uncle killed the demon.

272
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,519
We're safe now.

273
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:36,359
It's supposed to be your birthday.

274
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,519
- I don't want to celebrate it.
- What a pity.

275
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,200
I only want you.

276
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,240
Mother.

277
00:29:01,879 --> 00:29:05,599
Mother...

278
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,440
Mother.

279
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,999
Mother, wake up.

280
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,719
Wake up, Mother.

281
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:22,200
Is that Miss Ming's memory?

282
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:32,119
Judging from what the garrison said,

283
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:36,599
we should find the way out of here
through your memory.

284
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,479
Miss Ming, what happened after that?

285
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,840
Ming Xiu, it doesn't help
to avoid the past.

286
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,719
Miss Ming, I don't know
what happened back then,

287
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,800
but you got adopted by Mr. Gu.

288
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,408
So your family...

289
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:09,639
What has happened doesn't fade away
even if you choose to avoid it.

290
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:10,680
Shut up.

291
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,719
Miss Ming, when I was hiding in my room,

292
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,200
Mr. Gu told me
to face everything with courage.

293
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,080
I think that's what he'd say to you.

294
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,519
Mother.

295
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:45,999
Mother...

296
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,040
Why didn't you tell me you were hurt?

297
00:30:57,999 --> 00:30:59,000
Mother.

298
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,879
Mother.

299
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,639
Mother.

300
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,320
Mother.

301
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:15,128
Master.

302
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:24,119
Now I see why Ming Xiu
hates demons so much.

303
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,440
That's why you never
celebrate your birthday.

304
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,599
Garrison, we shouldn't have
barged into the hole of spring.

305
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,560
But we have no choice.

306
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,560
Please stop your malicious trick.

307
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,320
This scene is from her memory.

308
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:52,759
I simply restored it.

309
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:54,440
There are all kinds of memories.

310
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,759
Ming Xiu had so many
nice memories with Mr. Gu.

311
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:57,759
Why didn't you show that?

312
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,680
You're just a monster
who spies on people's secrets.

313
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:05,592
Xiu.

314
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,479
You dreamed about your mother again?

315
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:16,599
Is there any spell
to bring her back, Master?

316
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:27,160
The best comfort for the deceased

317
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,999
is to live well.

318
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:33,680
As long as the living inherit
the wishes and beliefs of the deceased,

319
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,608
the deceased are in a sense resurrected,

320
00:32:36,696 --> 00:32:38,072
having their lives continued.

321
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,399
What happened?

322
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:03,736
Where are we now?

323
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,359
Ming Xiu is gone.

324
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,359
W-What on earth is that?

325
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,359
So ugly.

326
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:19,879
Joys, sorrows, fury, and pleasures.

327
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,999
I appear in the shape of human memories.

328
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:26,440
How I look represents people's minds.

329
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,479
That's enough. Where is Miss Ming?

330
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,840
The guardian of Pureness is too obsessed

331
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:35,440
to leave the maze of memories.

332
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,719
Let Ming Xiu out.

333
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,800
If she remains immersed in it,

334
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,560
no one can get her out.

335
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,519
Xian Qing...

336
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,920
Xian Qing...

337
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,719
So naive.

338
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,599
I can crush you easily right now.

339
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,968
You want to save her?

340
00:34:11,896 --> 00:34:14,800
There is another way.
Would you like to try it?

341
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,032
I heard that the demons
can't live without their demonic orbs,

342
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,440
which contain all their energy.

343
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:29,080
I'm very curious.

344
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,680
Why don't you show me your orb?

345
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,639
Maiming...

346
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,560
Xian Qing, no!

347
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,368
No.

348
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:53,960
The person who sets up the game
is asking the pawn to make a choice?

349
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,879
The demonic orb and the demonic power

350
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,840
mean nothing to me.

351
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,080
If you want them, have them.

352
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,639
Xian Qing...

353
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,040
My life is worth it when I have someone

354
00:35:29,759 --> 00:35:30,776
to die for.

355
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,479
No, Xian Qing.

356
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,400
I heard that demons die
very soon after they're depleted

357
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,840
of their demonic orbs.

358
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:46,360
Xian Qing...

359
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,759
Maiming...

360
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,800
Xian Qing...

361
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,400
Xian Qing...

362
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,439
Maiming...

363
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:12,400
The removal of Bloodbinding
