21
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:14,467
Master,

22
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:18,788
Shifang,

23
00:02:20,627 --> 00:02:21,707
and all common people

24
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,627
who are suffering.

25
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:32,948
(The hole of spring Pureness
can foresee the future.)

26
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:36,600
(Whoever holds the Pureness key ring)

27
00:02:37,187 --> 00:02:38,587
(may catch a glimpse of the future.)

28
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:41,668
(If I could foresee)

29
00:02:42,187 --> 00:02:43,388
(the true weakness of Kun...)

30
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:56,228
Why can't I see anything?

31
00:02:59,307 --> 00:02:59,788
Master.

32
00:03:02,627 --> 00:03:03,828
Because I am not determined enough?

33
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:07,587
Master.

34
00:03:08,907 --> 00:03:09,427
Help me.

35
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:12,988
I have to see it.

36
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:15,027
(Xiu,)

37
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:17,467
(to foresee the future,)

38
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:19,508
(don’t use your eyes,)

39
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,788
(but feel it with your heart.)

40
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:31,988
(Master.)

41
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:33,948
(Your eyes...)

42
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:36,467
(I see.)

43
00:03:37,988 --> 00:03:39,707
(In order to protect
the power of spiritual vein,)

44
00:03:40,907 --> 00:03:42,508
(Shennong sealed the Nine Springs.)

45
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:45,147
(The leakage of divine power
is an accident.)

46
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:47,828
(Otherwise, even as a guardian,)

47
00:03:49,268 --> 00:03:50,828
(if he wants to use
the power of Pureness,)

48
00:03:52,027 --> 00:03:53,108
(he has to pay the price.)

49
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,348
Xiu, what's the reason
the Pureness exists?

50
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:00,948
Master.

51
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:05,828
It's a mockery from the heaven,

52
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:08,427
making people think

53
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:10,228
they can know the secrets of heaven.

54
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:13,228
But they find themselves

55
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:15,427
cannot escape from fate.

56
00:04:19,307 --> 00:04:20,427
If I say so,

57
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,427
would you be disappointed?

58
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:25,788
Pureness and people.

59
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,028
I protect them

60
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:30,028
because I want to.

61
00:04:31,148 --> 00:04:32,708
Xiu, you are no longer a little girl.

62
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:34,427
Don't be swayed by others

63
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,307
in your way moving forward.

64
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:38,947
Just ask yourself,

65
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:41,028
and be true to your heart.

66
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:47,187
That's really tough.

67
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:54,307
Master.

68
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:56,348
You once said,

69
00:04:56,988 --> 00:04:58,788
you're glad to have the opportunity

70
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,988
to be a guardian of Pureness,

71
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:05,668
who can guide the future
in the direction you want

72
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:08,108
and protect the people you want to.

73
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:10,747
Today,

74
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:13,627
I get it now.

75
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:19,747
Xiu, you have found your path.

76
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:33,427
Way of Heaven.

77
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:35,387
Fate.

78
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:38,148
That power

79
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,067
that thinks it can control everything.

80
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:43,108
At the cost of these eyes,

81
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:46,788
show me what I want to see.

82
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,067
If they're not enough,

83
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,747
take my hands,

84
00:06:53,187 --> 00:06:53,908
my legs,

85
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:56,268
and my life.

86
00:07:51,187 --> 00:07:51,908
Mr. Zuo.

87
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:53,267
Just surrender.

88
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,028
The Zhengwu Alliance has been wiped out.

89
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:15,988
Zhengwu Alliance

90
00:08:16,627 --> 00:08:18,867
fights for the common people.

91
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:20,267
Dying in battle today

92
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:23,187
is also a way to fulfill my mission.

93
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:27,548
You are an opponent I respect.

94
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:31,148
Bros, don't go far.

95
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:32,787
I'm coming.

96
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:07,507
General,

97
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:09,507
Her Lordship and Lord Shuo Xuan
are coming soon.

98
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:02,988
Today, I

99
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:05,147
bestow this sword

100
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:06,787
upon you.

101
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:10,547
I have lived for decades,

102
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:12,708
and have never misjudged any person.

103
00:11:16,348 --> 00:11:17,147
From now on,

104
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:20,108
I will mobilize all our disciples

105
00:11:20,627 --> 00:11:21,708
against Zhu Yu.

106
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:26,747
Rest assured,

107
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:29,027
we'll

108
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:31,667
handle the rest of it.

109
00:11:56,627 --> 00:11:57,588
Her Lordship.

110
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:17,708
Bad news.

111
00:12:18,348 --> 00:12:19,027
Bad news.

112
00:12:20,468 --> 00:12:21,108
What's wrong?

113
00:12:21,228 --> 00:12:22,108
Luohuan, Qi,

114
00:12:22,147 --> 00:12:22,867
and Luo Zhaoyan

115
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,928
have gone to Zangfeng Plains.

116
00:12:29,188 --> 00:12:30,147
I was careless.

117
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:31,588
I know

118
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:33,348
they would never let a companion

119
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:34,308
go on an adventure alone.

120
00:12:35,348 --> 00:12:37,468
Bring back to Yue Jinzhao
and Qi immediately.

121
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,228
We can't lose them.

122
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:41,988
I'll go get them both.

123
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:42,708
I'll go too.

124
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:44,787
You two, be careful.

125
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:47,267
Don't worry.

126
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:05,308
Your Lordship.

127
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:08,027
Rehai has already moved here.

128
00:13:09,428 --> 00:13:10,147
Shuo Xuan.

129
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,708
Open the Rehai.

130
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,228
Yue Qi.

131
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:22,747
You are the young lord of Yu clan.

132
00:13:23,547 --> 00:13:24,147
Zhu Yu.

133
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:25,348
Stop.

134
00:13:25,787 --> 00:13:27,507
I will find the perfect solution.

135
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:34,387
Zhu Yu.

136
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:35,228
Qi.

137
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:37,027
Shuo Xuan.

138
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:38,588
Hurry.

139
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:43,747
Zhaoyan.

140
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:44,988
Open the Rehai.

141
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:03,188
Yue Qi and Zhu Yu
share the same bloodline.

142
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:06,828
Her blood is the key
to release the Bloodbinding.

143
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,708
You need to get Shuo Xuan to be tainted
with the blood and damage her seriously,

144
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:13,547
forcing her to go to Mist Soul
of Core of the Demon Realm to heal.

145
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,507
The blood of Yue Qi,
combined with the power of Rehai,

146
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:20,108
can activate the way to

147
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,267
release the Bloodbinding
between Zhu Yu and Mist Soul.

148
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,588
Once the Bloodbinding is released,
Zhu Yu'll lose her Vitality Energy soon.

149
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:31,348
That will be the perfect time
to kill Zhu Yu.

150
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:33,787
Mist Soul.

151
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,468
Your Lordship.

152
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:37,828
Your Lordship.

153
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:40,147
Your Lordship.

154
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:41,387
What's wrong, Your Lordship?

155
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:42,948
Mist Soul

156
00:14:44,588 --> 00:14:46,267
is releasing the Bloodbinding.

157
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:51,228
Your Lordship.

158
00:15:05,228 --> 00:15:05,867
Yue Qi.

159
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:07,387
It's you who did this.

160
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:08,547
Shuo Xuan.

161
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:10,147
Go protect Her Lordship.

162
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:11,867
Leave it to me.

163
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:31,468
You go after Zhu Yu.

164
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:32,267
Leave it to us.

165
00:15:33,747 --> 00:15:34,108
Let's go.

166
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:40,867
General Lin Yuan.

167
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:42,108
Long time no see.

168
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:43,267
Ms. Ge.

169
00:15:44,147 --> 00:15:45,948
We've been dealing with
each other for years,

170
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:47,867
but we have to end up at this point.

171
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:50,667
Qingfei, just beat them.

172
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:51,627
Go.

173
00:15:51,747 --> 00:15:52,428
Catch them!

174
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:06,188
Ying Xuwei.

175
00:16:08,308 --> 00:16:09,348
I saw the weakness

176
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:11,387
of Zhu Yu at Pureness.

177
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:12,468
First one

178
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:14,488
is at three feet along the lateral line.

179
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:41,147
Second one

180
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:43,064
is in the center of the dorsal fin.

181
00:16:56,867 --> 00:16:57,547
Third one

182
00:16:58,428 --> 00:16:59,747
is at two feet on the pectoral fin.

183
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:38,228
(My daughter.)

184
00:18:39,468 --> 00:18:40,547
(It is your blood)

185
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:43,668
(that makes it difficult for me
to bloodbind the Mist Soul again.)

186
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:12,908
Her Lordship.

187
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:35,948
(Why do I have the sudden palpitations?)

188
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:42,747
Report.

189
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:44,347
Ms. Ge is injured.

190
00:19:52,188 --> 00:19:54,067
Keep an eye on the Kun.

191
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:54,547
Yes.

192
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:33,948
Since when have you been so selfless?

193
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:36,868
Having spent many years with you,

194
00:20:37,507 --> 00:20:38,668
I am naturally influenced.

195
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:45,267
Pretty good.

196
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:49,148
If Hanjiang were here,

197
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:52,747
he'll be very pleased.

198
00:20:56,868 --> 00:20:57,347
Of course.

199
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:28,868
Uncle.

200
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:30,628
You gave me your demonic power.

201
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:32,908
It's the punishment.

202
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:35,668
To be tainted
by the demonic power you despise,

203
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,067
are you mad?

204
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,188
Uncle,

205
00:21:42,908 --> 00:21:43,388
thank you.

206
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:53,468
Qingfei.

207
00:21:54,868 --> 00:21:55,267
Qingfei.

208
00:21:58,587 --> 00:21:59,708
Why is she so seriously injured?

209
00:22:00,148 --> 00:22:01,908
Kun's scales fell down,

210
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:03,388
and we held them up,

211
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,708
letting others go first.

212
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:06,148
And then,

213
00:22:06,547 --> 00:22:08,708
Qingfei pushed me and Lin Yuan away,

214
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,787
but she got trapped underneath.

215
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:15,587
I managed to dig them up.

216
00:22:16,347 --> 00:22:17,708
Lin Yuan is already dead.

217
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,668
And Qingfei is also seriously injured.

218
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:23,747
Xiaoyuan.

219
00:22:26,468 --> 00:22:27,027
I'm here.

220
00:22:27,307 --> 00:22:28,507
I am okay.

221
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,188
Now

222
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:33,148
hurry up...

223
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:34,668
Go...

224
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:35,908
Go...

225
00:22:36,307 --> 00:22:37,067
monitor

226
00:22:38,547 --> 00:22:41,067
the situation of Sea of Clear Skies.

227
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:42,668
But...

228
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:45,547
You go.

229
00:23:16,107 --> 00:23:16,668
Young lord.

230
00:23:17,107 --> 00:23:19,547
Xi Luo, don't waste time.

231
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:21,388
Who wants to interfere
with Her Lordship today

232
00:23:21,587 --> 00:23:22,507
has to die.

233
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:34,388
Go after Zhu Yu.

234
00:23:34,587 --> 00:23:35,228
I'll handle this.

235
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:36,188
Qi, go.

236
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:35,148
Zhaoyan.

237
00:24:39,507 --> 00:24:40,107
Xian Qing.

238
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:58,107
Qi.

239
00:25:05,267 --> 00:25:06,228
You shouldn't come.

240
00:25:09,148 --> 00:25:10,668
We come here with the hopes

241
00:25:10,668 --> 00:25:11,267
of many people.

242
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:13,628
No matter what,

243
00:25:14,428 --> 00:25:15,507
we will try our best.

244
00:25:17,988 --> 00:25:19,587
In the face of ultimate power,

245
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:21,027
how is hope

246
00:25:21,827 --> 00:25:23,428
any different from despair?

247
00:25:23,908 --> 00:25:25,228
As long as there's a glimmer of hope,

248
00:25:26,228 --> 00:25:27,307
there'll be a chance to survive.

249
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,547
Since we all just want to survive,

250
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:32,988
let's see who's got the best shot.

251
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:34,628
Alright.

252
00:25:35,908 --> 00:25:36,948
If that's the case,

253
00:25:37,948 --> 00:25:39,027
then entrust your fates

254
00:25:39,628 --> 00:25:41,388
to your swords.

255
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:43,148
What is fate?

256
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:44,948
If you ask me,

257
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:47,827
I am my own fate.

258
00:26:38,747 --> 00:26:39,228
Qi.

259
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,952
Zhu Yu stimulated her inner strength

260
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:42,267
and accelerated the transformation.

261
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,307
This is the best chance.

262
00:26:47,868 --> 00:26:48,547
(Mother.)

263
00:26:49,587 --> 00:26:51,188
Qi, hurry up.

264
00:26:57,307 --> 00:26:57,868
Jinzhao.

265
00:27:00,188 --> 00:27:01,388
Jinzhao, how are you?

266
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:04,027
I'm fine, one more.

267
00:27:05,628 --> 00:27:06,027
Qi.

268
00:27:57,668 --> 00:27:58,228
Are you okay?

269
00:27:58,267 --> 00:27:58,787
I am okay.

270
00:28:25,388 --> 00:28:27,428
No one can stop me.

271
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:05,067
Zhaoyan.

272
00:29:17,107 --> 00:29:17,827
(The curse is gone,)

273
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:19,428
(but I don't)

274
00:29:19,868 --> 00:29:21,747
(have much Vitality Energy left, right?)

275
00:29:47,908 --> 00:29:48,347
Formation.

276
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:42,747
Jinzhao.

277
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:07,388
Zhaoyan.

278
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,787
Xian Qing, no!

279
00:31:39,908 --> 00:31:40,587
(Hanjiang.)

280
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:42,988
(Without your elixir,)

281
00:31:44,628 --> 00:31:46,628
(I wonder what it's going
to be like when I lose)

282
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:48,708
(all my energy.)

283
00:32:01,948 --> 00:32:02,507
(Zhaoyan.)

284
00:32:02,908 --> 00:32:03,428
