00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,568
Xian Qing,

22
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,000
Xian Qing, come here.

23
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,744
Be careful.

24
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,159
Xian Qing, you rest here.

25
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:15,960
I'll go look for some herbs.

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,976
Zhaoyan.

27
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,640
You're my medicine.

28
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,224
I'm sorry, Xian Qing.

29
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,320
I made you end up like this.

30
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,559
So gravely injured. I'm sorry.

31
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,039
It's okay.

32
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:45,800
Why did it become like this?

33
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,056
Do you hate him?

34
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,399
He and I are the closest,

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,519
yet we are the ones
who hurt each other the most.

36
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,384
Don't worry.

37
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,960
I will always be with you.

38
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,799
When Maiming imprisoned me today,

39
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,159
he said he found a way
to break the binding.

40
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:29,760
A way to break the binding?

41
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,920
Our family has been bound to Rehai

42
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,040
and thus enduring
the heavenly punishment.

43
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,960
Maiming and I,
because of the twin's curse,

44
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,119
have also been enduring the same pain.

45
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,199
But Maiming, after all, has endured
more than 200 years of torment

46
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,640
and has never been able
to step out of the family.

47
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,879
He must have held some resentment.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,040
I owe him.

49
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,720
Why do you think that?

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,240
I'd like to free him from the binding,

51
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,000
but he doesn't want it.
He doesn't even want me.

52
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,600
He had been my entire life.

53
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,399
After I met you all,
he only has himself left.

54
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,240
He can't escape
the prison of the family,

55
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:24,800
so, he wants to trap me here too.

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,640
It's what I owe him.

57
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,304
No.

58
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,919
It's your family. Your family owes him.

59
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,160
You are the family head, but you...

60
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,640
Xian Qing.

61
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,600
You are Luo Zhaoyan.

62
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,912
I am Luo Zhaoyan.

63
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,479
I am Luo Zhaoyan.

64
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,559
From now on, I'll live only for myself.

65
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,199
(Maiming, our father has passed away.)

66
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,479
(From now on, we only have each other.)

67
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,080
(I will protect you.)

68
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,520
(Let's live and die together, alright?)

69
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,319
(Maiming, as long as you want it,)

70
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
(I will be like I used to be.)

71
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,440
(I will protect you like I used to.)

72
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,759
I hate you.

73
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:52,640
Xiu.

74
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,880
Master.

75
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,032
Do you like it?

76
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:56,120
Yeah.

77
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,679
Xiu.

78
00:05:58,679 --> 00:05:59,800
What would you like for lunch?

79
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:02,488
Stir-fried greens?

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,160
I don't want to eat burnt greens.

81
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,160
The families I found for you before

82
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,904
were well-off and also treated you well.

83
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:12,888
But you refused to be adopted by them.

84
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,920
You can only get burnt greens
to eat when living with me.

85
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,440
I hate demons and also humans.

86
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,559
I only want you.

87
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,920
Silly, in the Six Realms,
there are both good and bad beings.

88
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,952
You can't generalize it to all.

89
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,600
I have a friend named Xian Qing

90
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,440
who often comes to freeload
but has good cooking skills.

91
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,320
Next time he comes,
let's have him cook for us.

92
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:44,920
Play a game with me.

93
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,000
No, the cloud pear tree
wasn't there at that time.

94
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,360
I was still in the illusion.

95
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,959
My oversight. You found it.

96
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:06,519
Guardian of Pureness,
I underestimated you.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,201
(Dragon Pool)
So he's just a snoopy man.

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,120
Commonly known as a freak.

99
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,441
(Dragon Pool's Garrison, Guard of Guixu)
I just mirror your thoughts. Next time...

100
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:24,641
You won't have another chance.

101
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:28,761
Is that so? Then let's wait and see.

102
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:36,440
What's wrong, Qi?

103
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,441
Just feeling a bit odd. It's nothing.

104
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:50,456
You've arrived.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,041
Another one of the garrison.

106
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:57,960
I am not one of them.

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,024
Then what are you?

108
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,720
(Su He, Dragon Pool's Incarnation)
I'm Su He, the Dragon Pool.

109
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,624
Dragon Pool?

110
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,641
I've heard each spring has its form,

111
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,201
but I never thought
you'd take human form.

112
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,881
I am already aware of your intentions
from the stream of memories.

113
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:19,400
Can you truly revive the departed?

114
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,840
I cannot revive someone
without a trade-off.

115
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
At the cost
of the existence of the wisher,

116
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,560
I can bring back the person they want.

117
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,072
The existence of the wisher?
What does that mean?

118
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:44,520
The number of lives in the world
is fixed and cannot be changed.

119
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,041
To resurrect a life,

120
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,601
the wisher must sacrifice

121
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,441
their own life

122
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:02,400
and all the memories
associated with them.

123
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,800
Isn't this just trading
one life for another?

124
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:12,960
And after that,

125
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,441
it's as if the wisher never existed.

126
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:17,656
That is impossible.

127
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,240
The impact of what the wisher
has done will also vanish.

128
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,048
Wouldn't all get mixed up?

129
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:28,041
The garbled parts will be corrected
by the path of heaven.

130
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,240
The traces of the wisher
will naturally be overlaid by others.

131
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,041
So you mean

132
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:40,441
what that one did will be remembered
as done by someone else

133
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:43,120
and that no one
will feel anything wrong.

134
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,080
Exactly.

135
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,010
Jinzhao, if one day,
something happens to me,

136
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,609
you must not exchange yourself for me.

137
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:54,250
Because I don't want
to forget you at all.

138
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,320
Don't talk nonsense.

139
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,890
Miss Ming, you mustn't do it.

140
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,929
If you exchange yourself for Mr. Gu,

141
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:04,010
then there will be no Ming Xiu
in this world.

142
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,850
Ming Xiu, even the traces
that you've ever left will be gone.

143
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,170
The best comfort for the departed

144
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,929
is to live well.

145
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,170
As long as the living inherit
the wishes and beliefs of the deceased,

146
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,650
the deceased are in a sense resurrected,

147
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,330
having their lives continued.

148
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,296
I

149
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:37,289
will live on as the continuation
of my master's life.

150
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,330
And then one day...

151
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:47,130
(We'll meet again.)

152
00:10:57,729 --> 00:11:01,570
Ming Xiu, you can make such a decision.

153
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,250

There must be memories
of Qi and me, right?

182
00:13:24,849 --> 00:13:28,450
I want to know
what our past was actually like.

183
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:37,010
You can go to
the Ruins of Memory on your own.

184
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,090
But you will also bear
the pain from your past.

185
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,450
Have you thought it through?

186
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,488
I'm not afraid.

187
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,849
Qi, are you ready?

188
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,328
(Ruins of Memory)

189
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:07,690
Is it to make a wish to the divine tree?

190
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,450
Like the tree
outside the Matchmaker's temple?

191
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,536
Let's give it a try.

192
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,530
Divine tree, please reveal to me
all memories from three years ago.

193
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:32,250
Also, please let me
retrieve my memories.

194
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:05,912
Qi.

195
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,536
Jinzhao.

196
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:12,010
Jinzhao, look, it is working.

197
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:24,289
These seem all your memories.

198
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:31,169
Is this me?

199
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,969
So this is what you
looked like as a child.

200
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,409
You look quite cute, actually.

201
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,056
Who is this person?

202
00:15:50,169 --> 00:15:52,289
Probably a friend of mine from before.

203
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:05,289
You'd been together all this time.

204
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:12,130
Yes, I really want to see
what he looks like as a grown-up.

205
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,304
Look, that's it.

206
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:28,729
Jinzhao, this person looks like you.

207
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:45,530
This is me?

208
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:53,530
The one who's grown up with you is me?

209
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:00,369
Jinzhao, so these are just our memories.

210
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:11,864
Bian Luohuan.

211
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:17,688
Bian Luohuan?

212
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,968
How could it be him?

213
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:33,976
It's all him.

214
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:39,369
Qi, what's wrong?

215
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:54,200

I've taken the medicine
left by Hanjiang.

248

I'm much better now. Don't worry.

249
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,810
Jinzhao, Little Yue,
you finally came back.

250
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,424
I'm going back.

251
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,849
Miss Yue, are you all right?

252
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,770
Something happened. What about you?

253
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:45,969
Something happened to us too.

254
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,969
I'll tell you about it later.

255

How is Xiu?

256
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,776
She is waiting for us.

257
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:58,329
Miss Ming gave up
on exchanging herself for Mr. Gu.

258
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:02,930
Xiu would never do anything
to disappoint Hanjiang.

259
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,410
Let's go and see Hanjiang off together.

260
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:40,290
(Master, all of a sudden,)

261
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,650
(I realize I'm not alone.)

262
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,689
(These guys who have been with me)

263
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,290
(must be the friends
you told me about before.)

264
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:56,729
(But I was slow to understand it.)

265
00:22:56,729 --> 00:22:58,329

266
00:22:58,329 --> 00:22:59,810

267
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:10,616
(Master,)

268
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:15,209
(I'll live my life to the fullest,
just like you would've wanted,)

269
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,609
(and guard Pureness forever.)

(Mr. Gu, I will not let you down.)

00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:30,089
(I'll forge a path of my own.)

272
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:38,569
Xiu, let Hanjiang rest in peace.

273
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,089
Master, may you rest in peace.

274
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,969
(Mr. Gu, farewell.)

275
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:24,024
Jinzhao.

276
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,329
If you don't respond, I'm coming in.

277
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,489
I heard you didn't find your memories

278
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,410
in the Ruins of Memory.

279
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,170
You can't accept that?

280
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:15,352
Can you?

281
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:22,089
Past memories don't matter to me.

282
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,689
What does it matter
if they exist or not?

283
00:25:26,729 --> 00:25:28,209
It's easier to talk.

284
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:35,530
Alas, poor Hanjiang.

285
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:39,849
He borrowed my demonic orb
to extend his life for half a day,

286
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:42,329
and all of it was used on you.

287
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:45,770
I have let Mr. Gu down.

288
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:51,369
Now, I can't even

289
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,410
call myself Yue Jinzhao rightfully.

290
00:25:56,569 --> 00:25:58,449
Nor can I rewrite my destiny as he said.

291
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:06,689
Hanjiang spoke
of struggling against fate.

292
00:26:08,449 --> 00:26:11,250
Is it nonsense to you?

293
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:16,010
I don't know where I came from
or why I exist at all.

294
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:21,770
Mr. Gu needed to know
one's birth characters

295
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,130
to tell the fortune.

296
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:28,410
Without even my birth characters,
how can I talk about change?

297
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,250
Let alone surpassing it.

298
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,856
Come with me.

299
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,729
Say what you just said
in front of him again.

(Gu Hanjiang's Tomb)

301
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:58,369
He once cautioned you with his life

302
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:00,969
that no matter what setbacks
you encounter,

303
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,969
you must continue
to move forward and not fall down.

In this world,

308
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:49,489

What? Even you look down on me?

313
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,729
(The future can be changed.)

314
00:28:57,489 --> 00:28:58,808
Even if the future is terrible,

315
00:28:59,388 --> 00:29:01,849
Miss Yue is by your side.
What is there to fear?

316
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,209
Take this coin as a token.
