=Episode 28=

21
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,280
Xuwei has been waiting for you
for a long time.

22
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,759
You want to know about your origins,
don't you?

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,984
Then come with me.

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,192
Xuwei.

25
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
You've all been plotting and scheming
for so long.

26
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,039
So tell us the truth now.

27
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,280
We must start from the very beginning,
the story of Zhu Yu.

28
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,680
(Zhu Yu bound Mist Soul by blood.)

29
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,079
(We have been collecting a great deal of
Vitality Energy for her to feed on,)

30
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,119
(and heal the Yu clan.)

31
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,000
(But inside the Qiyuan Orb,)

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,440
(there were still some dark emotions
left by humans on the brink of death.)

33
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,839
(Zhu Yu devoured all of them)

34
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,440
(and gradually became demonic.)

35
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:18,000
(If somehow things got out of control,)

36
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,400
(the Six Realms
would be doomed for sure.)

37
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,784
(Therefore, we have reached an agreement
with Zhu Yu.)

38
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,320
(Once the situation gets out of control,
we can kill her.)

39
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,879
(But only the child she created)

40
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,000
with her own flesh and blood
has the ability to kill her.

41
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,400
Zhu Yu personally named that child "Qi".

42
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,320
What nonsense are you talking about?

43
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:10,199
This is the truth
you have long desired to know.

44
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:19,319
What about Jinzhao?
What does he have to do with this?

45
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,464
Three years ago,

46
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,880
someone told me about the existence
of Yue Jinzhao for the first time.

47
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:31,839
Xuwei, there is something
I'd like to tell you.

48
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,600
I don't want to hear it.

49
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
But I haven't even said anything yet.

50
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,280
It's always about Qi, isn't it?

51
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,720
Xuwei, Qi has been in the Yujie Hub
for over a decade.

52
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,800
Long enough for her

53
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:49,039
to know every single ant here.

54
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:56,959
Please, just for one day,
let me take her to the Mortal Realm.

55
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,679
Be back the next day, okay?

56
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,759
I won't give up on this.

57
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,896
Hold on.

58
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,472
Get her out of here now.

59
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:36,568
Xuwei.

60
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,048
Luohuan?

61
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,096
You're not Luohuan.

62
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,479
You weren't wearing this when I saw you.

63
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,528
Who are you?

64
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,880
I am Huan.

65
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,320
I can't believe you drugged me.

66
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,040
Sorry, Xuwei. But I am Huan,

67
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,160
from three years in the future,
to be precise.

68
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,480
Then why are you here?

69
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,959
What I'm about to tell you

70
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,160
may sound completely unbelievable.

71
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,760
But it's fine. Time will tell.

72
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,079
Three years later,
due to severe injuries,

73
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,480
I won't be able to resonate with Qi.

74
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,760
I could not join her in the mission
to confront and defeat Zhu Yu.

75
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,839
That's why I traveled here
from Mist Soul

76
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,600
and made it to Dragon Pool
to exchange for a new me.

77
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:57,839
I'll leave him in this time and space

78
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,959
to resonate with Qi
in this world in my place,

79
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,352
and restart the mission to kill Zhu Yu.

80
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:05,432
I have erased Qi's memories,

81
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,480
and will to send her
to the Mortal Realm.

82
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,480
She would wake up in Wuyan Village,

83
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,880
with another person.

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,119
Another person? What about you?

85
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,320
He is the one I will exchange
from the Dragon Pool.

86
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,072
His name is Yue Jinzhao.

87
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,559
Yue Jinzhao.

88
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,200
His resonance with Qi
will far surpass mine.

89
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,320
They will spend three years
exploring the Mortal Realm,

90
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,880
until they gain the power
to kill Zhu Yu.

91
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,368
I don't believe it.

92
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:15,959
I didn't believe it at first.

93
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:26,280
Xuwei told me Qi had been taken away
three years ago.

94
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,440
There would be someone named Yue Jinzhao

95
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,008
to replace me and stay by Qi's side.

96
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,000
I just couldn't believe it.

97
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,239
Not until I went to Wuyan Village
and saw him with my own eyes.

98
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,280
Xuwei, I'm in a hurry to find Qi.

99
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:51,160
Stop joking with me.

100
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,959
Yes, Xuwei, that could be someone else.

101
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,496
Qi.

102
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,752
Qi.

103
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,920
Let's take them back first.

104
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:51,519
Upon examination, we discovered
that you can indeed resonate with Qi.

105
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,600
Moreover, your resonance exceeded mine.

106
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,119
So Xuwei decided to have you

107
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,679
take my place and resonate with Qi
to complete the mission.

108
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,399
We informed Zhu Yu about this.

109
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,160
She agreed to send you two back
to the Mortal Realm to live for a while.

110
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,799
We brought you back to Wuyan Village.

111
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:19,920
Huan was responsible for
secretly protecting you

112
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,519
and guiding you
through your experiences.

113
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,519
As is said, three years later,
I have sustained serious injuries.

114
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,639
That person and Xuwei's words

115
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,720
have all been verified today.

116
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:37,360
I cannot revive someone
without a trade-off.

117
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,879
At the cost
of the existence of the wisher,

118
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,360
I can bring back the person they want.

119
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,759
The number of lives in the world
is fixed and cannot be changed.

120
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,839
To resurrect a life, the wisher must
sacrifice their existence,

121
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,480
and all memories related to themselves
as the price.

122
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,680
Only then can I bring back
the person they want.

123
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,280
Isn't this just trading one life
for another?

124
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,199
And after that,

125
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:12,720
it's as if the wisher never existed.

126
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,079
The anomalies will be corrected
by the path of heaven.

127
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,240
The traces of the wisher
will naturally be overlaid by others.

128
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,839
So you mean

129
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,040
what that one did will be remembered
as someone else's doing,

130
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,480
and nothing seems to be wrong to anyone.

131
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:33,208
Exactly.

132
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,839
Miss Ming, you mustn't do it.

133
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,319
If you exchange yourself for Mr. Gu,

134
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:41,040
then there will be no Ming Xiu
in this world.

135
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,680
Ming Xiu, even the traces
that you've ever left will be gone.

136
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,480
I've always been suspicious of you.

137
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,040
You deliberately schemed against
me and Qi,

138
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,600
and even guided her to gain power
by absorbing the Qiyuan Orb.

139
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,120
I didn't understand why.

140
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,600
Now it all became clear.

141
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,920
Turns out Qi and I are here to fulfill
an important mission.

142
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:23,959
It was an accident that Qi
absorbed the Qiyuan Orb at Fujin Hall.

143
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,800
The incident at the headquarters
was my doing.

144
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,199
It has nothing to do with Luohuan.

145
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,040
You have planned all of this

146
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,519
just to get Jinzhao and me
to kill Zhu Yu?

147
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:54,560
We would not have done it

148
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,800
if we had had any other choice.

149
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,040
Currently, petrification is occurring
in various places.

150
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:05,199
It seems that Zhu Yu has begun
to ripen and absorb the Qiyuan Orb,

151
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,519
which means she has
completely lost her mind.

152
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,360
Have you seen my De'er?

153
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,280
It must have been Luo family
scheming behind the scenes.

154
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,999
Uncle Nian's grandson
had been doing well.

155
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,120
How could he suddenly
turn into a stone a few days ago?

156
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,936
Turns out all of this

157
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,072
has been the doing of Zhu Yu.

158
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,240
If Zhu Yu is not killed,

159
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:38,240
the entire realm will be plunged into
misery and suffering.

160
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,199
Yue, Miss Yue, those from Hengdao Sect
must be deceiving you.

161
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:03,928
How could this happen?

162
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:07,959
Ying Xuwei has invited us to visit
the Sea of Clear Skies tomorrow.

163
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:09,560
We'll enter the Mist Soul,
and see it in person.

164
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,280
Traveling back to three years ago
through the Mist Soul?

165
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,999
Yes, it just occurred to me

166
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,240
that Maiming had collected information
about the Nine Springs.

167
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:24,440
It was recorded in a book

168
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,160
that the Mist Soul can change time

169
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,079
and allow people to go back in time
to the past.

170
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,519
Jinzhao, Little Yue, we will
go with you tomorrow.

171
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,399
Xian Qing is right.
Let's face this together.

172
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,528
Thank you.

173
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,128
Jinzhao.

174
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,079
Miss Yue, he may need some time

175
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,399
to process it.

176
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,224
Little Yue, go get some rest.

177
00:15:09,272 --> 00:15:10,280
Miss Yue.

178
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,639
I'm fine. I'm going to get
the Yunlai Stone from Ming Xiu.

179
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,296
Qingfei.

180
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,160
Drinking while you're so weak?

181
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,208
Qingfei, have some with me.

182
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,480
That day, you took her to
the Hundred-Foot Spring Platform,

183
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,519
I thought you wanted her to recall
your kindness.

184
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,360
I didn't expect her to fight with you.

185
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,839
I couldn't hold back

186
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,879
and told her everything you did.

187
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,879
Huan, I'm sorry. I should have
asked you first.

188
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:17,080
Never mind. It doesn't matter anymore.

189
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,808
Why?

190
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,048
Why what?

191
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,920
Don't play dumb. You obviously
didn't want to reconcile with her.

192
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,040
You wanted her to hate you.

193
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,519
I knew you would be able to
see through it.

194
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,439
Huan, what's the real reason?

195
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,448
I'd prefer to have her hatred

196
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,319
if she doesn't love me.

197
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,040
Still, better than being forgotten.

198
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:37,480
Jinzhao, don't stay by yourself.

199
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:39,759
I would be worried.

200
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,800
Qi, to be honest,

201
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,759
I don't know how to face you.

I prefer you to be the only swordsman.

Xuwei, bad news!

224
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,479
Qi and Yue Jinzhao have run away.

225
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,119
Did you let them go?

226
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:04,920
Yes, I informed the guards in advance
not to stop them.

227
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,280
Why? You are out of your mind!

228
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,280
We've spent years
planning for this moment.

229
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:28,056
How dare you!

230
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:36,639
They will come back.

231
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,879
I know they will, and I trust them.

232
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,519
Given we got their friends in Yujie Hub,

233
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:48,999
they will be back no matter what.

234
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,960
Xuwei, we only have half a day left.

235
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,960
I hope you're right.

236
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,239
(Qi, Yue Jinzhao,)

237
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,680
(this is the last thing
I can do for you.)

238
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,359
I didn't expect the origins of Jinzhao
and Little Yue to be so extraordinary.

239
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,248
Miss Yue came
to borrow the Yunlai Stone.

240
00:21:20,248 --> 00:21:22,648
She must have left here with Mr. Yue.

241
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,824
I, for one, hope they go
as far away as possible.

242
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:30,479
It shouldn't be just them

243
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,800
to deal with this huge responsibility.

244
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,759
Shifang, are you worried

245
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,960
that the Hengdao Sect
will take us as hostages?

246
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,119
Of course not.

247
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:45,359
If Hengdao Sect dares to do so,
we'll fight our way out.

248
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:48,920
I'm just worried that the two kids

249
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,320
won't allow us to be held captive.

250
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,479
Jinzhao, what's wrong?

251
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,840
I'm thinking about my origin.

252
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,160
Turns out, my existence is to ensure
the safety of mortals.

253
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,639
That's why the world

254
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:27,879
needs Yue Jinzhao.

255
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,359
But isn't it

256
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,704
too much for me?

257
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,399
Has anyone asked for my opinion?

258
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,879
Do you regret discovering your origins?

259
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:46,968
Yes.

260
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:51,119
If we had stayed in Wuyan Village,

261
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:54,160
we would have lived a peaceful life,

262
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,239
poor but stable,

263
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,759
like every ordinary person.

264
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:11,080
But then, we wouldn't have made it
to Yinghui Fort.

265
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,080
We wouldn't have had
so many good friends,

266
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,719
nor would we have had
so many precious experiences.

267
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,280
Just look on the bright side.

268
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:33,280
Jinzhao, Jing'an is right there.

269
00:23:34,264 --> 00:23:35,352
Let's go have some fun.

270
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:59,519
Look, how beautiful it is.

271
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,208
Let's go.

272
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,376
Check this out.

273
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:30,119
Jinzhao, today, let's put aside
all our worries and have fun.

274
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:35,032
Okay.

275
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,168
Impressive.

276
00:25:24,828 --> 00:25:25,848
Hit the mark again.

277
00:25:29,176 --> 00:25:30,264
Impressive.

278
00:25:33,176 --> 00:25:34,232
So amazing!

279
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,764
Here you go.

280
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:40,088
Is it sweet?

281
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,119
Sweet.

282
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,320
Here you go, kids.

283
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,040
- Miss.
- I want one.

284
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,080
- Me too.
- I want one too.

285
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,280
Here you go.

286
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,800
- I want one too.
- Miss, I want one too.

287
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,999
- Miss.
- Miss.

288
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,200
Let's go.

289
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,680
It's really great to be a child.

290
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,359
So carefree, with no worries at all.

291
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,639
Yeah, even if the sky falls,

292
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:04,080
tall guys like us would hold it up.

293
00:26:05,852 --> 00:26:08,824
(Prayer Pavilion)

294
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:18,136
Want to write something?

295
00:26:18,136 --> 00:26:19,224
Let me see.

296
00:26:23,964 --> 00:26:25,820
(A lifetime filled with love)

297
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,128
(Peace and prosperity for my offspring)

298
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,280
Jinzhao, people always make wishes
to the invisible deities.

299
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,048
Does it really work?

300
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,759
Maybe they're not worshiping the deities
but the heaven and earth.

301
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:50,680
The heaven and earth?

302
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,759
The grace of heaven and earth
nourishes all beings.

303
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,519
They are probably seeking blessings
from heaven and earth.

304
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,119
But I think people should
worship themselves instead.

305
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,080
Even if heaven and earth
grant them grace,

306
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:12,080
they still have to work hard
to create and maintain good lives.

307
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,519
Yes, you're right. We're on our own.

308
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,960
(Prayer Pavilion)

309
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:27,672
Yaofang, the moon is beautiful,
isn't it?

310
00:27:27,672 --> 00:27:28,759
Yes.

311
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:30,479
Let's go appreciate together.

312
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:31,512
Alright.

313
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,920
Mr. and Mrs. Ji.

314
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,479
Mr. Yue, Miss Yue.

315
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,040
This is the girl I told you about,

316
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,920
the one you mistook for Zhu'er.

317
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:46,680
Miss, I am truly sorry.

318
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,800
I was confused at the time
and caused you trouble.

319
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,160
No worries.

320
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,560
You treated me
to delicious tofu pudding, remember?

321
00:27:55,352 --> 00:27:56,359
Right.

322
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,752
Mr. Ji,

323
00:27:57,752 --> 00:27:59,599
Mrs. Ji has recovered, hasn't she?

324
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,759
My wife is pregnant.

325
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,560
Ever since we had a child again,

326
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,320
Yaofang has suddenly returned to normal.

327
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,536
Do you want to touch it?

328
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:28,879
Can I listen to it?

329
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,759
How come I can't hear anything?

330
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,200
The baby is still small.
Naturally, you can't hear it.

331
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,200
However, I can sense every breath

332
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,639
and heartbeat of it.

333
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:55,800
Even in the noisiest marketplace,

334
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,800
I wouldn't miss a single beat.

335
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:05,399
I often recall when you were
growing inside me,

336
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,359
I was amazed at how such a tiny life

337
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,560
had a heartbeat that was louder than
any other sound in the world.

338
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:20,759
My mother has said the same to me.

339
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:23,359
She must have loved you very much.

340
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,119
Jinzhao, do you know what I'm thinking?

341
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,680
I want the child in Mrs. Ji's belly
to be born safely.

342
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,728
Jing'an is so lively.

343
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:55,960
I hope everyone can live
in peace and safety.

344
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,680
I want to protect everything here.

345
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:07,800
Qi.

346
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,024
Let's return to the Yujie Hub.

347
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,816
I have thought it through.

348
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:20,479
Even if I start over,

349
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,160
I'd still leave Wuyan Village
and embark on this journey with you.

350
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,360
Jinzhao.

351
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,440
I was an orphan born in Nine Springs.

352
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:43,999
But I grew up in this world, I think

353
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,639
I should try my best to do something
for its sake.

354
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,800
I'll try my best to find a solution
that satisfies both sides

355
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,479
to protect Zhu Yu and the Mortal Realm.

356
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,672
I know.

357
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,192
I have faith in you.

358
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,224
The jade pendant.

359
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,952
Let me put it on you.

360
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,879
There, now the pendants
are a matching pair.

361
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:27,960
Qi,

362
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:33,239
from now on, no matter what happens,

363
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:39,040
I will always be by your side
and we will face it together.

(Pray for peace of the world.
Qi, Jinzhao)

368
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:41,976
Fancy a drink?

369
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,048
A pre-death drink?

370
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:47,800
Huan.

371
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,759
Xuwei is waiting for you
on the rooftop. Go meet him.

372
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:51,119
Your organs will deteriorate faster
if you drink like this.

373
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,960
Even if no one will treat you
in the future,

374
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:56,080
you do not have to destroy yourself.

375
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
Sit.

376
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,248
Sorry,

377
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,680
for being an incompetent brother.

378
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:31,928
Well, that's true.

379
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,280
You've been acting smug since childhood.

380
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:37,759
Every time Qingfei and I made mistakes,

381
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,599
you would severely scold us.

382
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:45,800
A terrible brother indeed.

383
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,200
If I had known the truth
three years ago,

384
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:00,472
and chosen to run away,

385
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:03,448
what would you do?

386
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,528
You wouldn't.

387
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,119
Actually, I really wish I had.

388
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,040
But there are things
that I must do myself.

389
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,640
Moreover,

390
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:39,639
given the blood of so many innocents
on our hands,

391
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,119
we are lucky to have this opportunity

392
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,680
for atonement, aren't we?

393
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,600
Want to atone?

394
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
Maybe in the next life.

395
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,424
It is an honor for me

396
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:37,679
to have you as my eldest brother

397
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,144
in this lifetime.

398
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,048
Drink.

399
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,479
However, I feel so sorry for

400
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,199
Qi and Jinzhao,

401
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,919
who have to bear the consequences
of our incompetence.

402
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,120
Luohuan, why are you drinking?

403
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,640
You're injured. No more drinks.

404
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,800
Xiaoyuan, Luohuan is about
to embark on a long journey.

405
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,120
It's fine to have a little drink
before that.

406
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,880
I was wondering why I was allowed
to stay up late today.

407
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:59,439
Remember to practice your skills
diligently in the future.

408
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,560
If you piss these two off again,

409
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,880
no one will stand up for you.

410
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,479
Luohuan, where are you going?

411
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:08,439
Somewhere fun? For how long?

412
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,280
Don't change the subject.
Promise me first.

413
00:38:24,504 --> 00:38:25,519
Promise me.

414
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:27,759
Alright, you have my word.

415
00:38:27,759 --> 00:38:30,120
I will practice hard and behave myself
from now on.

416
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,840
Luohuan, come with me.

417
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,840
