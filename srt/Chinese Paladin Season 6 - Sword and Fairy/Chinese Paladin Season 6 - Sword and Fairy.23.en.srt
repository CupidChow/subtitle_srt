00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,599
I've seen this...

22
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,720
Can Zhu Yu absorb the Qiyuan Orb

23
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:14,159
like Miss Yue?

24
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,679
Apart from Little Yue,

25
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:18,720
the only one who can do it is...

26
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,280
Lord Ming.

27
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,280
Yue, what should we do?

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,079
Let's go to Lin Yuan.

29
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,360
He's an upright person.

30
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,160
Perhaps he will tell us something.

31
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,399
Shifang, you wait here for Qi.

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,120
Yue.

33
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,879
May I help you?

34
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,120
Mr. Lin.

35
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:50,840
Zhu Yun is Lord Ming, yes?

36
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,759
You saw the soul fish, didn't you?

37
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,519
Yes, Her Lordship is Lord Ming.

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,879
How is the Sea of Clear Skies related
to the Qiyuan Sect?

39
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,799
How did you know?

40
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:14,559
It seems there is a connection.

41
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,159
Qi has already recorded everything

42
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,000
about the Yujie Hub.

43
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,519
Since she is your young lord,

44
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,119
why did you send her to the Yujie Hub?

45
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,400
It's a long story.

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,720
That's okay. We have time for that.

47
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,760
Okay, come with me.

48
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,280
I just want the truth.

49
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,280
Are you ready to face the harsh truth?

50
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,119
Go ahead.

51
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,720
It's a very long story.

52
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:23,959
Come.

53
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,360
The Sea of Clear Skies

54
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,759
was far more beautiful
and prosperous than it is now.

55
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,160
Until that disaster.

56
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,559
What disaster?

57
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:09,640
Right after the disaster,

58
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,399
we came to know

59
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,559
that for over a hundred years,

60
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,919
we have always been living
on the back of Kun.

61
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,440
Sadly,

62
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:24,319
Kun woke up.

63
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,360
Kun

64
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:35,720
is Zhu Yun.

65
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:48,399
In its lifetime,

66
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,479
Kun must be evolved.

67
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,880
And its process will be painful

68
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,160
and deadly due to drastic changes

69
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,000
in a short period.

70
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,160
The Mist Soul can delay the time.

71
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:04,839
Therefore,

72
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,600
for generations,

73
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,720
they have relied on the Mist Soul
to slow down time,

74
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,160
delaying the process of evolution

75
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,480
to lessen the suffering.

76
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,799
But when I was going to be evolved,

77
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,079
I discovered

78
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,679
that the Yu Clan lived right on my back.

79
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,359
And my evolution

80
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,639
almost caused a catastrophe

81
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,359
for the Yu Clan.

82
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,600
I couldn't watch the Yu Clan perish.

83
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,399
So,

84
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,239
while using the Mist Soul
to slow down the evolution,

85
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,160
I drew spiritual power
from the Nine Springs to heal the Yu Clan.

86
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,760
But in that case,

87
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,480
the Spring Vein will be unbalanced,

88
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,440
causing a catastrophe in the Six Realms.

89
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,600
You're right.

90
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:58,920
Although it gets unbalanced,

91
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,839
it will soon recover.

92
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,440
Really?

93
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
I heard from Mr. Gu

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,040
that it takes over 100 years
for the Spring Vein to recover.

95
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,440
Qi.

96
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,399
We are Kun.

97
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,720
A hundred years is merely

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,920
one-thousandth the lifespan of Kun.

99
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,519
But for humans,

100
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,959
100 years is the length of a lifetime.

101
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:33,160
Honestly,

102
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,440
Ying Xuwei said the same as you.

103
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,920
The key ring lit up.

104
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,839
Is there a hole of spring here?

105
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,200
Yes.

106
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,720
It's the Mist Soul.

107
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,399
Right there.

108
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:13,336
(Mist Soul inside the Core
of the Demon Realm)

109
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:14,968
Whenever I see a hole of spring,

110
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,600
I'm always amazed
by the wonders of creation.

111
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,799
We Yu Clan

112
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,639
should have been wiped out
in the last calamity.

113
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,119
Our queen, Ling Ye,
used her last bit of strength

114
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,119
to stop the ascension of Kun.

115
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:31,679
And then,

116
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,639
Kun took Ling Ye's corporeal form

117
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,600
and became the new lord.

118
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,440
Who are they?

119
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:52,720
Well,

120
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,200
they're severely injured clansmen

121
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,519
in the last calamity.

122
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,839
Her Lordship has been healing them,

123
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,920
hoping that one day

124
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,600
they will wake up.

125
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,000
They look

126
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,079
like humans.

127
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,480
I see.

128
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,320
Because of the Mist Soul,

129
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,320
you established a connection
with the Hengdao Sect.

130
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,519
Ying Xuwei.

131
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,359
You have a connection
with the Hengdao Sect.

132
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,359
During the Bloodbinding
of the Mist Soul,

133
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,000
(Ying Xuwei found me.)

134
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,040
(He advised me to use the Mist Soul)

135
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,079
to lead the Yu Clan
into the time stasis.

136
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,679
Time stasis?

137
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,559
Does it mean to lock you up?

138
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:55,639
Pretty much.

139
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,639
He'd put us in a place
where time nearly stopped.

140
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,079
Then they would find ways
to heal the Yu Clan.

141
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,760
What happened after that?

142
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,359
Later, we reached an agreement.

143
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,639
They would gather enough Vitality Energy
to heal the Yu Clan.

144
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,959
After the Yu Clan was healed,

145
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,839
I would break the Bloodbinding
of the Mist Soul.

146
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,480
Vitality Energy?

147
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:26,920
Could it be...?

148
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,040
- Well...
- That's right.

149
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,079
Ying Xuwei

150
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,280
(found and supported a small sect
in the Mortal Realm.)

151
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,720
(He sent them)

152
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,560
(to search for the Qiyuan Orb.)

153
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,959
(So I could absorb the Vitality Energy)

154
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,079
(to heal the Yu Clan.)

155
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,199
(Zhu Yu.)

156
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:50,600
Turns out

157
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:53,439
you really are Lord Ming.

158
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,600
You harmed so many people.

159
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:01,439
You sacrificed the lives
of so many humans.

160
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:02,360
But I have no choice.

161
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,879
I can't watch the Yu Clan perish.

162
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,199
The lives of the Yu Clan matter.

163
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,199
Don't the lives of humans matter too?

164
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,959
Everything is in the past.

165
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,360
And the past cannot be changed.

166
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,199
Zhu Yu.

167
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:33,600
I have another question for you.

168
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,360
Why did I grow up in the Yujie Hub?

169
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:52,079
You're right.

170
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,999
The Hengdao Sect had a deal with us,

171
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,439
but they were still worried.

172
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,399
They want to take the newborn lord
as a hostage

173
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,240
to control the ruler
of the Sea of Clear Skies.

174
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,280
Qi is just a hostage to you?

175
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,040
What about me?

176
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,240
Why my memory has gone blank?

177
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,280
Yue.

178
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:17,519
Your identity is secretive.

179
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,319
If you go on,

180
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,439
I fear you will be in danger.

181
00:12:21,999 --> 00:12:23,280
Why are you so persistent about it?

182
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,759
Where is the Hengdao Sect?

183
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,120
I don't know.

184
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:31,240
Ge Qingfei, the Second Leader

185
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,600
of the Hengdao Sect has been
in contact with us.

186
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,079
Okay.

187
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:37,959
I'll find a way

188
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:40,560
if you won't tell me.

189
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,839
Turns out

190
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,920
for the Hengdao Sect,

191
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,040
I am nothing more than a hostage
to threaten you.

192
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:11,839
I...

193
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,160
Those happy days

194
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,999
were nothing but an illusion.

195
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,319
What about Jinzhao?

196
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
What is he to do with the Yujie Hub?

197
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,319
Qi.

198
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,560
Stop asking.

199
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,120
I don't want the truth to hurt you.

200
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,280
- Stop asking.
- I can bear it.

201
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,040
Zhu Yu.

202
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,839
To me, Jinzhao is the person

203
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,519
I care about the most in this world.

204
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,600
Why do you always hide things
and deceive me about him?

205
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,399
You don't want to tell me, right?

206
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:07,519
Fine.

207
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,079
If you won't tell me,

208
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
I will find a way myself.

209
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:54,399
Will I have a chance

210
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,879
to see Miss Shuo Xuan again?

211
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,280
Miss Shuo Xuan.

212
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,480
What are you doing?

213
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,879
I'm waiting for Little Yue.

214
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,759
She's also here.

215
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:12,519
Miss Shuo Xuan.

216
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,160
Well,

217
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,079
I apologize to you.

218
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:17,920
I no longer eat fish now.

219
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,879
Miss Shuo Xuan.

220
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,319
Is there anything else?

221
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:28,480
I...

222
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,999
Last time I bragged to you
about becoming a hero.

223
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,560
Just forget it.

224
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,240
Right now,

225
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,280
I no longer want to be a hero.

226
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,399
What happened?

227
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,120
What makes you self-aware?

228
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:52,399
A few days ago,

229
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,720
a very kind senior died

230
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
because of me.

231
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,759
Before that,

232
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,160
I always told myself

233
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,639
that I must be a great hero.

234
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,720
Yet, the emergence of a hero

235
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,360
often comes with many casualties.

236
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,120
So what?

237
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,800
They aren't strong enough.

238
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,639
Otherwise, they will become heroes.

239
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,839
That's not right.

240
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,280
If being a great hero needs

241
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,639
to sacrifice many lives,

242
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,879
I will give up being a hero.

243
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:36,399
You are strange.

244
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:38,280
Miss Shuo Xuan.

245
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,600
The Luban lock I gave you...

246
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:43,759
I've thrown it away.

247
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:50,959
Shifang.

248
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,680
Stop watching.

249
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,319
She's left.

250
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:58,800
Every time you see her,

251
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,999
she's mean to you.

252
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:02,120
Why do you like her?

253
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:07,199
Miss Shuo Xuan...

254
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,040
Seems like she's never confused.

255
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,519
She always walks straight ahead,

256
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,839
completely different from me.

257
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,399
She's dazzling.

258
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,240
Hey.

259
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:46,439
Are you interested in that guy?

260
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,560
Of course not.

261
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,240
However,

262
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,759
what are they here for?

263
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,600
They must have guessed our relationship
with the Hengdao Sect.

264
00:17:58,759 --> 00:17:59,680
They came to verify it.

265
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:01,800
So, what did you tell them?

266
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,839
I didn't say what should not be said.

267
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,160
What is this feeling?

268
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,319
It's even more painful
than absorbing the Qiyuan Orb.

269
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:52,920
Your Lordship.

270
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,999
The young lord sent these pastries.

271
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,848
(A taste of Mom)

272
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,599
A taste of Mom.

273
00:19:14,639 --> 00:19:15,840
According to her friends,

274
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,320
these are her favorite
in the Mortal Realm.

275
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,840
My sense of taste

276
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,560
has almost disappeared.

277
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,960
If Qi finds it good,
it must be good, I guess.

278
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:56,359
Your Lordship.

279
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,280
The young lord has regained her memory.

280
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:02,320
Before long,

281
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:05,160
she will know the truth.

282
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:09,719
I fear she can't handle the truth.

283
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,960
She also consumed the Qiyuan Orb.

284
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,359
Why hasn't she been consumed

285
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,999
by the dark emotions of humans like me?

286
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Compared to Your Lordship,

287
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,960
the young lord consumed
much fewer Qiyuan Orbs.

288
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,440
Besides,

289
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:32,280
Your Lordship,

290
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:34,879
you are too lonely

291
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:37,800
and tired.

292
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:43,879
Why does she have to leave?

293
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,200
Why is she unwilling to stay by my side?

294
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:47,639
Your Lordship.

295
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:51,960
Why?

296
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,840
Why?

297
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,280
Complaint.

298
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,040
Resentment.

299
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,560
Jealousness.

300
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,519
Greediness.

301
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,440
Your Lordship.

302
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:06,560
These dark human emotions

303
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:09,719
torment me incessantly.

304
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,680
Your Lordship!

305
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,800
I'm losing control.

306
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,479
I'm losing control.

307
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:16,280
Your Lordship!

308
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,599
Your Lordship!

309
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,479
Your Lordship!

310
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:20,840
Your Lordship, calm down!

311
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:24,999
Selfishness.

312
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,440
Greediness.

313
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,280
Complaint.

314
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:32,840
Resentment.

315
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,719
Pains.

316
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,440
Shuo Xuan.

317
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,440
We're different from humans.

318
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:50,399
So...

319
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:52,879
Darn it.

320
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,479
Your Lordship!

321
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:03,280
Your Lordship!

322
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,160
Stop.

323
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:12,519
Shuo Xuan.

324
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,920
Your Lordship!

325
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,519
Your Lordship.

326
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:54,599
Your Lordship.

327
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,999
Your Lordship!

328
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,680
Xi Luo.

329
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,399
Lin Yuan.

330
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,200
Help!

331
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,680
Save me.

332
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:11,680
Shuo Xuan.

333
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:13,960
Shuo Xuan.

334
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:16,119
Shuo Xuan.

335
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,080
Shuo Xuan.

336
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,560
Shuo Xuan.

337
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,280
Shuo Xuan.

338
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:34,920
Meditation Spell!

339
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,359
Yes, use the Meditation Spell.

340
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:48,519
Your Lordship!

341
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,440
Shuo Xuan.

342
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,560
Your Lordship.

343
00:24:58,879 --> 00:24:59,840
Don't blame yourself.

344
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:02,320
Lin Yuan and Shuo Xuan are both fine.

345
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:04,759
Luckily, Shuo Xuan

346
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,639
has also learned

347
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,440
the Meditation Spell
that every queen must master.

348
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:11,840
Mother.

349
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,359
Back then,

350
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,320
your mother, Ling Ye,

351
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,280
used the Meditation Spell

352
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,239
to connect my consciousness.

353
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,680
Through her eyes,

354
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,920
I saw the joys and sorrows
of the Yu Clan.

355
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:45,119
In fact, I have always been aware
of her existence.

356
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,160
But I never suspected it.

357
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,719
I thought it was just a dream.

358
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Until one day,

359
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,239
my consciousness became warmer.

360
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,680
I couldn't help but get closer.

361
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:07,040
That day,

362
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,399
your mother gave birth to you.

363
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,759
Good girl.

364
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,840
You did very well.

365
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,359
You have inherited the spiritual power
of the Yu Clan queens.

366
00:26:30,239 --> 00:26:33,639
Now, you've mastered
the Meditation Spell.

367
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,399
Get up.

368
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:48,680
Good girl.

369
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,960
You are the future queen

370
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,479
of the Yu Clan.

371
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,119
Your Lordship.

372
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:06,160
To me, you are my mother.

373
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,960
I will always be by your side.

374
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,719
Qi, what's wrong?

375
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:02,440
Nothing.

376
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,759
I suddenly feel a bit unwell.

377
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,040
Ming Xiu, I'm sorry.

378
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,759
Turns out Zhu Yu

379
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:34,560
is the Lord Ming we've been looking for.

380
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,560
No need to apologize, Miss Yue.

381
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,920
This is not your fault.

382
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,320
That's right.

383
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,080
Little Yue is also a victim.

384
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,040
I have found my origins and memories.

385
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:55,840
As for Jinzhao,

386
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,280
Zhu Yu said the truth is cruel to me.

387
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:00,200
She refused to tell me anything.

388
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,920
So did Lin Yuan.

389
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,639
He said the investigation
would endanger his life.

390
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,359
Yue, what should we do next?

391
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:15,800
I can't entirely trust Zhu Yu
and Lin Yuan.

392
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,239
The closer I get to the truth
of my origins,

393
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,639
the more dangerous it is.

394
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,040
I have been searching for my origins,

395
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,960
And I'm not afraid of any dangers.

396
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,879
But you guys

397
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,800
don't have to take the risk with me.

398
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,399
So...

399
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,599
Jinzhao, what's wrong with you?

400
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:39,800
So why are you being foolish?

401
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,879
Yes.

402
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,359
We've come this far.

403
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,719
We should act together.

404
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,160
We have shared life and death.

405
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:49,519
Don't be a loon.

406
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,359
Lin Yuan refused
to tell us where the Hengdao Sect is.

407
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:58,879
Little Yue, you grew up
in the Hengdao Sect.

408
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,599
Do you know where it is?

409
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:04,479
I only remember something
called the Yujie Hub.

410
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,119
It's a city in the sky.

411
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:11,759
Let's find a way to locate it.

412
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,280
The Qiyuan Orb

413
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,599
no longer satisfies me.

414
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,239
When I promised Ying Xuwei

415
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,440
to accept the Vitality Energy
from the Qiyuan Orb,

416
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:32,519
I realized

417
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
that sooner or later,

418
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,479
I would be lost
in the dark human emotions.

419
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:40,719
But I can't stand it.

420
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,599
I'm not willing to suffer.

421
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,280
I want to enjoy a happy time
with my daughter.

422
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,759
Your Lordship.

423
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:54,680
News from the Mortal Realm.

424
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,239
The Luo family

425
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:58,280
is auctioning a gemstone called Rehai.

426
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:01,519
A few days ago, a scout sent a message.

427
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:04,479
Ying Xuwei sent people
to find out about the auction.

428
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,840
However, the progress is still unknown.

429
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:08,639
Bian Luohuan once fell

430
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,560
into the hands of the Luo family before.

431
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,960
In that case,

432
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:14,519
the Hengdao Sect has a connection
with the Luo family.

433
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,040
What if the Luo family spread the word

434
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:23,160
just to lure Your Lordship there?

435
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,280
I have nothing to fear.

436
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,239
I will go with you.

437
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,080
Jinzhao.

438
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:00,719
Jinzhao, your eye is uncomfortable?

439
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,599
This is...

440
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,399
Like Pureness,

441
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,599
my left eye can also

442
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,320
see visions of the future.

443
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,960
When I woke up three years ago,

444
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,119
my left eye became like this.

445
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,440
Every time I see visions of the future,

446
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,560
my eye suffers unbearable pain.

447
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,719
If there is any danger coming,

448
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:31,239
or before something important happens,

449
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,040
his left eye can foresee it in advance.

450
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,560
Zhaoyan.

451
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:37,719
Because of his left eye's guidance,

452
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,879
we found you at the Yinghui Fort.

453
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,239
Incredible.

454
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:46,119
What did you just see?

455
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:49,519
I saw Lang Mo, the one we saved

456
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,999
in the Luori Village

457
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,879
and the little girl swinging hammers
at the Fengyan Inn.

458
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,440
Previously, I no longer believed
in the prophecies of my left eye.

459
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,119
But...

460
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:03,519
Yue, if Lang Mo is in trouble,

461
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,920
we still have to help him.

462
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:05,840
Yeah.

463
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,040
I must go and ask Bian Luohuan

464
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,519
about the purpose of the Yujie Hub.

465
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:19,639
And what exactly is the relationship
between you two?

466
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,200
I do not believe

467
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,719
that you are twin brothers.

468
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:24,040
Exactly.

469
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:25,999
Okay.

470
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,119
I'll find a disciple of the Luo family

471
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,399
and search for Lang Mo.

472
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:40,280
Just now, Zhu Yu left
the Sea of Clear Skies

473
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:41,759
with Shuo Xuan.

474
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,999
They're heading to the Luo Mansion.

475
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,519
It seems that the message
we sent to Lin Yuan

476
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,759
has started to work.

477
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:53,519
Now that Zhu Yu has begun
to covet the power of Rehai,

478
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,960
that means she is not far
from going completely mad.

479
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,560
We are bound to have a battle
with the Sea of Clear Skies.

480
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:09,080
It's time to bring Qi
and Yue Jinzhao back to the Yujie Hub.

481
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:31,960
Mr. Luo.

482
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:35,920
I guess you've been waiting
for my message.

483
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:39,479
Zhu Yu has headed to the Luo Mansion.

484
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
Today, Mr. Luo has to put on an act

485
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,960
with me.

486
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,280
Yue Jinzhao and his company

487
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,519
have gone to the Mangwan Village
to look for Lang Mo.

488
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,479
Thanks for telling me.

489
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,440
Before the grand family ceremony,

490
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,560
I don't want Zhaoyan to be there.

491
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,560
I will send someone to hold her back.

492
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,160
I'll wait for your good news.

493
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,639
Qingfei, I'll go to the Luo Mansion.

494
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,200
You go to the Mangwan Village
and restrain Luo Zhaoyan.

495
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,040
Bring Qi and Yue Jinzhao
back to the Yujie Hub.

496
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:19,200
Xuwei.

497
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:41,080
It's almost the time.

498
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,440
I don't have much time left.

499
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:48,759
It's my responsibility
to bring them back.

500
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:52,879
Moreover, it seems
Qi has regained her memory.

501
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:54,960
I want to see her.

502
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:58,440
Huan, don't be silly.

503
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,560
Brother, sister.

504
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,719
I will go with Luohuan.

505
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:12,199
Alright.

506
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,239
Xuwei.

507
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,919
If Huan insists on going,

508
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:17,679
why not let Xiaoyuan accompany him?

509
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,199
With Xiaoyuan's protection,

510
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:20,679
we can be less worried.

511
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,959
What do you say?

512
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:23,719
Xuwei, I can do it.

513
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:29,759
It's important to complete the mission.

514
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:32,840
Keep Luohuan safe.

515
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,479
No worries.

516
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:36,679
I will protect Luohuan.

517
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:54,679
Let's set out.

518
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,280
Cang Feng.

519
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,519
Get ready for guests.

520
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:21,800
Make two cups of tea.

521
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:22,679
Yes.

522
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:23,360
Wait.

523
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:28,280
