21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,280
Maiming.

22
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,399
Maiming, Bian Luohuan
has been locked in the prison.

23
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:35,416
When will we explore his memory?

24
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,320
You can't wait any longer?

25
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,320
No, it's just
that if he is truly the Didact,

26
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,039
I can find out
where the real Lord Ming is

27
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,840
and take the opportunity
to take down the Qiyuan Sect.

28
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,960
No rush. I want to wait for
Physician Bian to make the first move.

29
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,040
The curse is acting up more frequently.
Do you still insist?

30
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,799
Y-Y-Yes.

31
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:32,119
Would you rather let me
drain all your life force

32
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,320
than break the curse?

33
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:43,360
Yes.

34
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,080
Which one is good? I choose you.

35
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,360
Little Yue, where are the others?

36
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,839
They went to Maiming

37
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,800
to ask how the interrogation
of Physician Bian went.

38
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,839
Shifang.

39
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,872
Thanks.

40
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,160
I always feel like
I've seen this crystal somewhere before.

41
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,880
I seem to be able
to sense the energy inside it.

42
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,440
It's similar to iron poplar wood
but seems to be different.

43
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:58,959
Then can it help Dou Bao upgrade too?

44
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:05,679
Yes, I can put it inside Dou Bao

45
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:06,959
to try out its power

46
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,959
and see if its effects are similar
to those of the iron poplar wood.

47
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:15,040
If yes, we can say
we've made some headway.

48
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,000
Can I go with you?

49
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,760
I think Dou Bao could use
more expressions.

50
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,920
And maybe some more moves too.

51
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,799
I agree. Dou Bao seems too serious.

52
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,280
Then let's go now.

53
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,288
Let's go.

54
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,679
Should I take this or that?

55
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:37,688
Little Yue.

56
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,576
What's wrong?

57
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,480
I'm thinking, should I take
the chicken leg with me

58
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,959
or the rabbit head?

59
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,440
Maybe just take both.

60
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,048
Makes sense.

61
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,944
Let's go.

62
00:06:57,944 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay.

63
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,720
Then can you make Dou Bao speak?

64
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,399
Let me try. I think it's possible.

65
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,440
Can it play drums
and shoot flame at the same time?

66
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,512
Yes.

67
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,920
Still a glutton.

68
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:25,592
Little dog.

69
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,240
So cute.

70
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:37,280
You're so pitiful.

71
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,559
It must be due to poor diet
that you're shedding fur.

72
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:47,920
Here you are.

73
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,079
Where did this dog come from?

74
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,760
Zhaoyan, gently pet it.
This dog is shedding fur.

75
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:04,119
Little Yue, we're going to see Dou Bao.

76
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,880
Right.

77
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,880
You can have this too.

78
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,000
We're leaving, Zhaoyan.

79
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:13,600
Let's leave them alone.

80
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay.

81
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,368
So cute.

82
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:44,639
(Luo playing with the dog
doesn't seem like his usual self.)

83
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,959
(He's a bit like a young lady.)

84
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,959
Master, the lady wants to see you.

85
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,736
Okay.

86
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,680
Jinzhao.

87
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,440
Sir, what are you doing here?

88
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,679
Did you see that dog just now?

89
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:15,448
No, I didn't.

90
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,639
Sir, what happened to your hair?

91
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,280
I'm just getting older
and losing some hair.

92
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,359
Oh, right, what are you going to do?

93
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,440
I'm going to see Bian Luohuan.

94
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,320
Sir, would you care to join me?

95
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,799
Unfortunately,
I have no interest in him.

96
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,239
So you're interested in the Luo family?

97
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,880
What do you mean by that?

98
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,160
You accompanied Miss Ming
down the mountain for a trip,

99
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:01,119
but you stopped at Luo's mansion
and let Miss Ming go ahead by herself.

100
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:04,880
Moreover, you've shown
great care for Luo.

101
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,639
I don't believe you don't have
ulterior motives towards the Luo family,

102
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,119
but I have no intention
of probing into it.

103
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,639
Among the many secrets
of the Luo family,

104
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,079
there must be something
you'd want to know.

105
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,280
Since you asked so sincerely,

106
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,320
how could I not say yes?

107
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:24,984
Thank you, sir.

108
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,240
So it's here.

109
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,920
Interesting.

110
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,168
What happened?

111
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,879
The big fish is about to bite the hook.

112
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,399
I've been waiting here for a long time.

113
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,344
I guessed it when I saw
no guards at the door.

114
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:43,199
The Octagonal Tower
is the forbidden area in our mansion.

115
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,999
Trespassing is punishable.

116
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,360
You'd better explain everything clearly
to avoid suffering.

117
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,079
What do you want me to say?

118
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,519
For instance, why are you here?

119
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,720
I was invited by Master Luo

120
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:04,680
to visit and enjoy the scenery.

121
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,399
But unexpectedly, you set me up.

122
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:10,600
I have a feeling
that you intentionally walked

123
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,800
into our trap, right?

124
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,160
You learned about our family's connection
to the Nine Springs somehow.

125
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,759
But the barrier of our mansion
is not easy to break,

126
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,439
so you deliberately
exposed your identity

127
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,439
to have them let you enter.

128
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,759
Now, you have got your wish.

129
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,079
What do you think of
the scenery of our mansion?

130
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,199
It is unique.

131
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,439
It's in the vast desert,
but it's like a water town.

132
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,120
Seems like it has drawn
life force from somewhere.

133
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,040
And this mural also
arouses much curiosity.

134
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,280
According to legend,
the great god Shennong was born

135
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,639
with Nine Springs, each of which

136
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:03,639
possessed wondrous powers

137
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,120
and got the densest spiritual energy
in the world.

138
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:09,040
They are the hubs of the spiritual veins

139
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,680
and the most important sources of life.

140
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,800
Rehai is the force of life.

141
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:17,800
Your family prospered here.

142
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:21,999
The water source you relied on
was actually Rehai, wasn't it?

143
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,319
And you are the guardian of Rehai.

144
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,199
This straw-woven butterfly is similar
to the one in Bian Luohuan's cottage.

145
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,319
It's not just similar.
It's exactly the same.

146
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:04,439
This is Dou Bao's energy chamber.

147
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,879
Should we put it in?

148
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,928
It works.

149
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,199
The energy chamber
is not very stable right now.

150
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:25,399
After I calibrate it,

151
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,399
it will surely make
Dou Bao's combat abilities level up.

152
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,360
Shifang, do you smell that?
It's so fragrant.

153
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,959
Yes, fragrant.

154
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,600
It smells so good. I'm a bit thirsty.

155
00:14:56,184 --> 00:14:57,980
(Wine)

156
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,428
(Wine)

157
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,120
It's good.

158
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,519
Rehai was supposed to move along
with the path of heaven.

159
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:26,079
But it has been bound to
your mansion for over 200 years.

160
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,040
I think the only way
to stop the movement of Rehai

161
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,319
is through Bloodbinding.

162
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,839
With your soul as the stake
and a blood curse as the binding,

163
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,879
(Rehai is bound here.)

164
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,800
(However, from the day
the Bloodbinding spell succeeded,)

165
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,920
(your soul was trapped,)

166
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,999
(never to be released.)

167
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,480
(You can never take a step away
from Luo mansion.)

168
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,680
(This spell is against the natural law.
People using it will be cursed.)

169
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,519
You've really got something.

170
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:11,680
You even know about Bloodbinding.

171
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,199
For over 200 years, in your family,
no twins have lived past their thirties.

172
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,759
This must be your curse.

173
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,999
Back in Luori Village,
I examined Master Luo.

174
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,160
A great deal of his life force
has been drained from his body.

175
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,800
I guess

176
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,999
it was done by you.

177
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,800
It seems you've got something.

178
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,879
But in Rehai, no one can beat me.

179
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,399
You're so agitated. It seems
you care deeply for Master Luo.

180
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,199
Do you know how to break Bloodbinding?

181
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,319
I don't know, but someone might.

182
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,879
Why should I trust you?

183
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,160
You must have been waiting for so long.

184
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,319
Now, I am the only one you can trust.

185
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:35,360
Why are there no guards today?

186
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,680
We're already at the door.
Let's just go in and check it out.

187
00:17:49,848 --> 00:17:51,736
(Wine)

188
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,776
Little Yue, Little...

189
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:05,800
Little Yue, how much have you drunk?

190
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,240
Wake up, Little...

191
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:15,639
My goodness. Let's go.

192
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,319
If you want to bring back Rehai
to its original path,

193
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,399
feel free to do it.

194
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:27,639
But there's one thing about Miss Yue.

195
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,560
Say it.

196
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,199
The Nine Springs are very secretive.

197
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,399
I once used
Memory Exploration on Miss Yue

198
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,272
and discovered
that she knew about the Nine Springs.

199
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,240
And she said it was told by her master.

200
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,959
Miss Yue consumed the Qiyuan Orb,

201
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,759
so she was considered to be Lord Ming
of the Qiyuan Sect.

202
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:54,319
You are suspected of being the Didact.

203
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:58,680
And you risked your life
to detoxify her.

204
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,440
It seems like you two have
a pretty intense relationship.

205
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,200
Are you Miss Yue's master?

206
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,920
Since you two are here, please come up.

207
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,640
Where is Bian Luohuan?

208
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,239
I don't know what you're talking about.

209
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,359
You trespassed on our forbidden area.

210
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,639
Shouldn't you give me
an explanation first?

211
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,399
You should explain it to us first.

212
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:15,080
You secretly probed into Qi's background

213
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,719
and this time, you had a private meeting
with Bian Luohuan of the Qiyuan Sect.

214
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,352
Who should be explaining?

215
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:24,440
What do you think this place is,
your personal playground?

216
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,759
How can you come and go as you please?

217
00:20:58,264 --> 00:20:59,324
Maiming,

218
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:03,399
they are my friends.

219
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,200
(Adam's apple? This is a man.)

220
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,200
I had a lapse and you managed
to take advantage of it.

221
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,359
Sir, please don't hurt Maiming.

222
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:18,200
Don't worry. I won't.

223
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:26,080
Nonsense. Could he possibly injure me?

224
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,399
Since it's come to this,

225
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,599
I can't keep you as guests
at our mansion anymore.

226
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,320
Zhaoyan, take your friends out
of Luo mansion tomorrow.

227
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,759
Mai...

228
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,560
You have been suspecting Bian Luohuan
is the Didact of the Qiyuan Sect.

229
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,759
You can take him to the Zhengwu Alliance
in the Central Plains.

230
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,479
The alliance and the sect have been
at each other's throats for many years.

231
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,080
They will give you an answer.

232
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,416
Yue, you're here.

233
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,660
Little Yue is blacked out from drinking.

234
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,320
What?

235
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,399
Sir, I shall take my leave.

236
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:13,239
You're still here, so I guess
you want to ask something, right?

237
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,440
You're as smart as they say.

238
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,280
Today, we rashly intruded into
the forbidden area of your mansion.

239
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,440
I hope you and Zhaoyan
will not take offense.

240
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:25,048
No harm done.

241
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,359
I've long admired your reputation,
Senior Xian Qing.

242
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:36,280
Zhaoyan, you mentioned before

243
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,359
that I resembled one
of your family members.

244
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:41,239
That must be Miss Luo, right?

245
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,599
Why are you saying that?

246
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,639
It's not a good thing
for a lady to resemble me.

247
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,840
My words are abrupt. Please forgive me.

248
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:57,759
You and my father
were old acquaintances.

249
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:01,560
You've done my family a favor.
How could I possibly blame you?

250
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,560
You were an old acquaintance
of my father?

251
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,599
We met decades ago,

252
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:10,999
and we agreed to meet again
in the future.

253
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,239
Unfortunately, he didn't show up.

254
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:19,960
Could you please lend me
your demonic orb

255
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,200
to save my daughter?

256
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:24,920
I'm begging you.

257
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,719
Interesting.

258
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,759
But what can you exchange with me

259
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,359
for my demonic orb?

260
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:53,719
My life. I'll exchange my life
for my daughter's life.

261
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,479
I will give you half
of my demonic power,

262
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:27,840
but you must remember your promise

263
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,080
and come back in three months.

264
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,448
I will devour you then.

265
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,392
It's a deal.

266
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,479
(So Zhaoyan clearly
does not know about this.)

267
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:06,840
Before my father passed away,
he spoke of a three-month deadline.

268
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:11,599
But he died mysteriously
before the three months were due.

269
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,560
I am in anguish over his death.

270
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,719
I shall take my leave now.

271
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,680
Zhaoyan...

272
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,479
your naivety is truly irresistible

273
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,440
to people like us.

274
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,040
(So Luo Wangping died
before he could fulfill his promise.)

275
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:00,359
(Well then, let bygones be bygones.)

276
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,759
Luo Maiming has
my demonic power inside too.

277
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,280
But why would those two
want to exchange identities?

278
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:12,080
Jinzhao was right about this.

279
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,519
The Luo family does
have quite a few secrets.

280
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,359
Really interesting.

281
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,359
Drinking so much.

282
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,280
Jinzhao, don't leave.

283
00:26:49,479 --> 00:26:50,800
Are you alright?

284
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,760
Why are you asking this?

285
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,040
Your heartbeat is so fast.

286
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,840
You must be sick.

287
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,536
What are you doing?

288
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,320
You look really good.

289
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,519
A round head, big eyes.

290
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:17,519
Dou Bao, how have you changed like this?

291
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:22,440
I am not Dou Bao.

292
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,680
Dou Bao, wait.

293
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,239
When I install the crystal on you,
you can shoot flame.

294
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:32,719
Call me Dou Bao again
and I will really shoot flame.

295
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,840
It hurts. What are you doing?

296
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,359
Shifang, you're not right.

297
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,080
This stone is of no use.

298
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:53,280
- Dou Bao is not moving at all.
- Yue Qi.

299
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,599
Are you Miss Yue's master?

300
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,680
(Although Bian Luohuan
did not answer directly,)

301
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,560
(this straw-woven fish cannot be faked.)

302
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,640
(What if Bian Luohuan
is really Qi's master?)

303
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,640
Zhaoyan.

304
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,320
You're going on a long trip again.

305
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:55,200
The grand family ceremony
is coming soon. You must not forget.

306
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,639
How could I possibly forget
such an important matter?

307
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:01,399
I've prepared some specialties
of the Western Regions.

308
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,080
Take these to eat on the road.

309
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:05,944
Thanks.

310
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,719
Zhaoyan, I have something important
to tell you after you get back.

311
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,239
Just tell me directly.
Don't be a stranger.

312
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,080
Let's talk after you return.

313
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,320
Alright, then I'll leave.
They are waiting for me.

314
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,160
Have a smooth journey.

315
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,759
Alright, I'm leaving now.

316
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:53,800
There's a tea stall up ahead.

317
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,999
Let's stop and have
some tea for a break.

318
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,239
Traveling from the Central Plains,
it's all greenery along the way.

319
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,519
Much more comfortable than the desert.

320
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,200
Jinzhao, do you want to try
this orange? It's very sweet.

321
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:30,800
I'm not gonna eat it.
If you think it's sweet, have more.

322
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:35,040
Miss Yue, can I have some?

323
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,119
Physician Bian, if you want an orange,

324
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:41,680
I'll go grab another one
for you from the carriage.

325
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,639
Don't bother. I'll just have this one.

326
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,719
Jinzhao, didn't you say
you wouldn't eat it?

327
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,399
I feel like eating now.
Is that not allowed?

328
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,960
Yue, this orange looks very sour.

329
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,119
Who says so? It's so sweet.

330
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:23,320
Everyone else
is drinking tea and resting.

331
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,639
Only you're the most hard-working.

332
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,160
Sir.

333
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,552
What is this?

334
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,176
A letter from Xiu.

335
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,519
As an immortal cultivation sect,
Mount Yuqing

336
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,240
has truly amazing things
like Yunlai Stones and this paper crane.

337
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,999
If you're interested,

338
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:51,359
I will take you there some day.

339
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,800
Great, thanks a lot.

340
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,759
(I've joined Zhengwu and will be there soon.)
Xiu has joined the Zhengwu Alliance.

341
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,800
The alliance received
the letter from Shifang,

342
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,840
so they asked her to get us.

343
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,639
I guess she's almost
at the Fengyan Hotel.

344
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:10,759
Since Miss Ming is about
to arrive. Let's hurry there.

345
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:24,984
What's wrong?

346
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,552
♪Look, the leaves are falling like rain♪

347
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:50,840
♪They symbolize my love♪

348
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,600
♪The distance

349
00:33:59,064 --> 00:34:02,968
♪Following your shadow across miles♪

350
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:09,720
♪Like a bird chasing

♪Just one glance

00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,824
♪And I'm lost in you♪

353
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:21,240
♪My heart can't help
