Qianjun.

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,600
Slow down.

25
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:11,319
The ground seems to be dug
on both sides.

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,400
It's fishy.

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,960
Let's discuss first.

28
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:17,720
Master Yue, what do you say?

29
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,640
To the left.

30
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,120
Do as he says.

31
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:23,880
To the left.

32
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:30,968
Xu.

33
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,680
Can we count on him?

34
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:33,480
Of course.

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,680
Remember what he did

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,120
at the Langyin Pavilion...

37
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,120
Step aside.

38
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:46,599
Sect leader.

39
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,239
Bad news.

40
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,120
The Zhengwu Alliance
is breaking in from the front gate.

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,960
Our people are badly injured.

42
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,559
Sect leader, bad news.

43
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,480
What now?

44
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:54,960
Sect leader.

45
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,800
Someone broke in from the back door.

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,439
How can you be so useless?

47
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,199
Why did they come

48
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,640
to mess things up?

49
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,479
Stop them.

50
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,440
Jinzhao, are you okay?

51
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm fine.

52
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,760
Mr. Xu.

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,239
Mr. Xu.

54
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,000
- Mr. Xu.
- Xu.

55
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,599
Xu.

56
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,199
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,720
Can your apology
bring them back to life?

58
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,919
To the left?

59
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,440
It was awful.

60
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,119
Calm down.

61
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,400
Bad news.

62
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,919
Mr. Chen.

63
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,400
Qiyuan Sect's disciples are coming.

64
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,119
It's urgent.

65
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,479
Consider yourself lucky.

66
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:57,000
Yue Jinzhao.

67
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,159
Calm down.

68
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,879
Let's think about
what we should do next.

69
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,319
They noticed us.

70
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,600
We should split up.

71
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,000
Go get Gao Xiao.

72
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:13,360
And the others should stall the guards.

73
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:15,959
Yue Jinzhao.

74
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,039
I see what you're trying to do.

75
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,759
You want us to die and buy you time.

76
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:22,800
I'll stay with you.

77
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,240
We'll stay with you.

78
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,360
Me too.

79
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,240
Go with Miss Yue to get Gao Xiao.

80
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
Yue Jinzhao, remember.

81
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,280
All our casualties

82
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:33,464
and all the bloodshed

83
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,479
are on you.

84
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,088
Let's go.

85
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,520
Be careful.

86
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,328
Let's go.

87
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,640
Jinzhao.

88
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Mr. Gu told us before we took off

89
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,880
that it'd be risky.

90
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,759
But we came, anyway.

91
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,559
In that case,

92
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,919
we must save more people.

93
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,240
Right?

94
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,119
Yeah.

95
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:44,000
It's you two making trouble here again.

96
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,679
Aren't you a bit too bold?

97
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,240
You've done too much evil.

98
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,360
Today,

99
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll finish you off.

100
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,679
How dare you talk nonsense

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,559
at my place?

102
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,720
Since you are here,

103
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,759
don't think about leaving.

104
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,760
Jinzhao, these disciples look crazy.

105
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,119
It's because of the Qiyuan Orb.

106
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:21,440
Gao Xiao.

107
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
Thank you, Lord Ming.

108
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,760
Jinzhao.

109
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,040
Let me try.

110
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,880
I can save them.

111
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:52,959
Stall them.

112
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,760
Help me.

113
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,119
Thank you, Lord Ming.

114
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,760
Thank you, Lord Ming.

115
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,679
Thank you, Lord Ming.

116
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,480
Qi, no.

117
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
You're going to...

118
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,519
I won't die.

119
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,480
We can't leave them manipulated.

120
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:15,896
Why did you catalyze
so many Qiyuan Orbs?

121
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,399
You came, after all.

122
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,679
Why did you do that?

123
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Qi has consumed the Qiyuan Orbs before.

124
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,079
She wasn't demonized.

125
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,760
Instead, she gained power.

126
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,920
It's her chance
to consume more Qiyuan Orbs and activate

127
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,920
the power of a mythical beast.

128
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,359
How can I let it go?

129
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,079
Luohuan.

130
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,440

00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:07,199
That's our Lord Ming!

191
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,480
It is Lord Ming.

192
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Lord Ming!

193
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,280
She's Lord Ming!

194
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,439
She's Lord Ming!

195
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,199
Is Miss Yue really Lord Ming?

196
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,079
No, she's not.

197
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,999
It doesn't matter.

198
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,639
Catch her first.

199
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,040
- Protect Lord Ming.
- Protect Lord Ming.

200
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:29,879
Mr. Zuo.

201
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,040
Miss Yue is the young lord
of the Yu Clan

202
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:33,399
and the descendant
of mythical beast Kun.

203
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,959
She is not Lord Ming.

204
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:35,680
Besides,

205
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,639
she's never done anything wrong.

206
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:38,759
Yeah, leader.

207
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,240
I've visited the Yu Clan.

208
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:42,519
Everyone,

209
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:44,800
as the leader of the Zhengwu Alliance,

210
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,839
there are things I have to do.

211
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:48,999
Arrest her.

212
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,120
Guanren.

213
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,720
I understand that.

214
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,240
But I have to stand against you.

215
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,959
If she is Lord Ming,

216
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,519
then why is she helping you
destroy the Qiyuan Sect?

217
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,040
Bian Luohuan.

218
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,240
Who are you?

219
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,759
Mr. Zuo, calm down.

220
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,120
Luohuan.

221
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,360
Didact, why are you doing this?

222
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:25,439
Mr. Gao.

223
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,079
You've dedicated yourself
to the Qiyuan Sect for years.

224
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:30,879
Today,

225
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:32,360
I'm going to

226
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,480
reward you handsomely.

227
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,879
No...

228
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,999
Please spare my life, Didact.

229
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:39,280
Spare me.

230
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,240
I...

231
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,959
I don't want to ascend, Didact.

232
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,639
I can't ascend.

233
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,480
I can't die, Didact.

234
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,240
Help me.

235
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,120
Help me.

236
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,280
Why are you stepping back?

237
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,959
Why?

238
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,639
You bunch of...

239
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:57,759
Bunch of fools!

240
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,560
You... You think

241
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,920
these people in power

242
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,399
are nice and kind?

243
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,959
The Qiyuan Orbs you're craving

244
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,319
feed on your lives.

245
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,999
You don't even know that you're tricked.

246
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:11,959
Stepping back?

247
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,120
You're all going to die.

248
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,720
All of you!

249
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,959
You...

250
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,360
And all the slaves

251
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,759
are food for Lord Ming.

252
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,519
They're going to die!

253
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,480
Didact.

254
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,272
Didact.

255
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,959
I don't deserve it.

256
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,120
I...

257
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:39,999
This...

258
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:43,560
What happened?

259
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,399
What happened?

260
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,199
Everyone,

261
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:55,959
you saw it.

262
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,399
The so-called ascension

263
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,360
is death.

264
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,040
You were driven by your desire

265
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,839
to blindly seek ascension.

266
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,399
You don't even know
the truth about Lord Ming.

267
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,720
But you go crazy
over some illusory thing

268
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:15,839
and turn your kindred
against each other.

269
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,560
It is really ridiculous.

270
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,839
Remember my name.

271
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,360
Ying Xuwei.

272
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,160
The Qiyuan Sect

273
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,800
is a gift from

274
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,079
our Hengdao Sect.

275
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,399
I believe we're going

276
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,439
to see each other soon.

277
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,319
Luohuan.

278
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,480
Let's go.

279
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:39,879
Bian Luohuan.

280
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,319
Who are you?

281
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:44,879
Yue Jinzhao.

282
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
You will find out

283
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,216
when the time is right.

284
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,720
It won't take long.

285
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,240
It's fake.

286
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,040
Everything's fake.

287
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,959
Lord Ming.

288
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,600
Ascension.

289
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,079
Utter nonsense.

290
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,319
The self-destruction device is on.

291
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
This place is going to collapse.

292
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,040
Let's die together!

293
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,040
Die together!

294
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,999
Die together!

295
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:23,480
It's collapsing.

296
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,439
To the exit. Hurry.

297
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,519
It's too late.

298
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:28,399
Go ahead.

299
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,399
I'll shut down the device.

300
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,680
Master.

301
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,319
Hurry up. Get out of here.

302
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:36,360
Hurry up.

303
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,759
Go.

304
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,560
- Run!
- Hurry up!

305
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,999
Hurry up!

306
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,272
(Qiyuan Sect's headquarters,
Self-destruction device)

307
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,960
Why did you come?

308
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:25,920
It's too dangerous here.

309
00:19:27,384 --> 00:19:28,925
This place is deadly.

310
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,925
It may collapse at any time.

311
00:19:31,064 --> 00:19:32,357
Stay put.

312
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:37,896
Ju Shifang, can you
send Dou Bao to do it?

313
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:48,560
Ju Shifang.

314
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,440
Hurry up

315
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:50,719
or we'll die here.

316
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:54,280
I...

317
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:06,119
No.

318
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,560
I can't let Dou Bao do it.

319
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,599
I swear I'll protect Dou Bao.

320
00:20:14,488 --> 00:20:19,320
This is the only thing
my mother left me.

321
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:26,560
(I saw a huge casualty)

322
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,560
(of the Zhengwu Alliance at Pureness.)

323
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,599
(If I don't stop it, I'm afraid...)

324
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:35,599
Stay put.

325
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,080
Master.

326
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:40,040
Mr. Gu.

327
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:41,759
Don't go.

328
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,200
Stay back.

329
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,840
(What happened three years ago)

330
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,800
(has come around today.)

331
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:35,479
Mr. Gu!

332
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:36,639
Don't.

333
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:38,399
Don't go.

334
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,200
- Miss Ming.
- Don't.

335
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,160
- Let go.
- Don't.

336
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,048
Miss Ming.

337
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,359
I said let go.

338
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:47,479
Miss Ming.

339
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,599
- Wait here.
- Xian Qing.

340
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,888
Master.

341
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,359
You finally woke up.

342
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,639
Xiu.

343
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,119
Stop crying.

344
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,359
I'm fine.

345
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:07,280
How are you feeling?

346
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,320
I feel

347
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,999
hungry.

348
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:19,040
Can you find me something to eat?

349
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,519
You rarely leave Mount Yuqing.

350
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:50,599
Did you leave

351
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,440
because you saw something at Pureness?

352
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,519
Right before Xiu's birthday,

353
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,719
my key ring glowed.

354
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,519
Do you remember?

355
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,040
I'm going to Pureness.

356
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,800
So I decided to go to Pureness.

357
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,080
And I saw the future there.

358
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,280
Pureness showed

359
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,399
that the attack
on the Qiyuan Sect's headquarters

360
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,719
would take a heavy toll
on the Zhengwu Alliance.

361
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:32,639
How can I sit back and let them

362
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,479
die for the great cause?

363
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,519
So you chose

364
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,960
to sacrifice yourself?

365
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,080
It'd be nice

366
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,840
to change people's fate based on

367
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,560
what I saw at Pureness.

368
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:57,320
Xian Qing.

369
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,239
Do me a favor.

370
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,759
Can you lend me your demonic orb

371
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:09,040
to extend my life for half a day?

372
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:12,560
We're buddies.

373
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,280
All you have to do is ask.

374
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:22,996
(Li's Pharmacy)

375
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,454
These guys got our buddies killed.

376
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:28,902
I'd be so ashamed if I were them.

377
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,458
I'd bury my head in the sand.

378
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,312
I heard Mr. Gu was badly hurt.

379
00:25:32,312 --> 00:25:33,504
I wonder how he is now.

380
00:25:33,504 --> 00:25:35,680
Virtue has its reward.
Mr. Gu will be fine.

381
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,977
The Silver Shadow
our leader gave him was a waste.

382
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,560
Senior.

383
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:54,960
Are you better?

384
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,160
I'm fine.

385
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,560
Since you're here,

386
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,960
come with me.

387
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:05,719
Senior.

388
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:06,920
I...

389
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,359
Did I say you could turn me down?

390
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,879
Master, you just woke up.

391
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,519
Don't worry.

392
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:22,119
Xiu.

393
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,639
This is between them.

394
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:27,719
Hanjiang knows what he's doing.

395
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,200
Please look after Qi

396
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,479
when she wakes up.

397
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,359
Don't worry.

398
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,399
Zhaoyan will take care of her.

399
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,920
Me too.

400
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,840
Ms. Xu, please accept it.

401
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,759
What...

402
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,040
Mr. Gu.

403
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,080
Why are we here?

404
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:06,040
Ms. Xu.

405
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:07,200
Just take it.

406
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,359
We'll bring you

407
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,160
Xu's wage every month

408
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,080
from now on.

409
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,840
He's gone. What wage?

410
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,519
I have to raise my child alone.

411
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:18,999
But I can work.

412
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,639
We may live a poor life,

413
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,519
but we will get by.

414
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,840
My husband was a folk man

415
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,359
and he did silly things,

416
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,840
but he'd never live on others' sympathy.

417
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,999
Neither will we.

418
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,800
Ms. Xu, you got us wrong.

419
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:36,879
It's not like that.

420
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:38,800
Please forgive me.

421
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,639
The Zhengwu Alliance
is only lending you the money

422
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:43,999
to meet urgent needs.

423
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,680
Once Zhengyun grows up,

424
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:47,000
he will pay us back.

425
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:49,040
Ms. Xu, please accept it.

426
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,080
Ms. Xu.

427
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:53,840
Thank you.

428
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,759
Zhengyun.

429
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
Your father was a great man.

430
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,440
Protect your mother from now on.

431
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,712
I will.

432
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,080
Ms. Xu, we will take our leave.

433
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,639
Mother.

434
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:26,879
I'll be a hero once I grow up

435
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,080
and bring you gifts.

436
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,879
Good boy.

437
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,119
You can be a scholar

438
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
or a businessman,

439
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,759
not a fighter.

440
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,879
We'll stay away from jianghu.

441
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,119
If your father was alive,

442
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,359
he'd want you to be safe.

443
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,999
Find a good girl and marry her.

444
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,719
We'll live a peaceful life together.

445
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:52,040
Don't try to be a hero.

446
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,280
But Father was a hero.

447
00:28:57,639 --> 00:28:59,759
But then you wouldn't be able to see me.

448
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,080
Do you still want to be a hero?

449
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:03,200
Mother.

450
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,040
Will I never see Father again?

451
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,519
Mother, I miss Father.

452
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,599
I want Father.

453
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:16,879
I want Father.

454
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,160
Don't turn away.

455
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,960
Remember this very moment.

456
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,639
Don't ever forget it.

457
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,160
Mother, I want Father.

458
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,920
Be good.

459
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,320
You're a tough boy.

460
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
Tough boys don't cry.

461
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,320
Mother, I'm a tough boy.

462
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,200
I will grow up soon

463
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,759
and protect you for Father.

464
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,399
Xu Qiming, bad guy.

465
00:30:00,639 --> 00:30:03,320
You said we'd grow old together
on our wedding day.

466
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,840
But you just died.

467
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:09,560
I shouldn't have married you.

468
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,040
Let's go.

469
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:37,359
Senior.

470
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,960
Why did you show us that?

471
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:46,200
Tell me.

472
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,879
Why were you so upset this morning?

473
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:51,840
I...

474
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:54,999
I was scared.

475
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,440
I was scared that I might

476
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,320
be cursed and condemned.

477
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,040
I was scared

478
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:04,160
I'd be hated.

479
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,639
Me too.

480
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:11,399
And now?

481
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,800
I'm still scared.

482
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,080
They were once alive.

483
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,280
They had friends

484
00:31:17,239 --> 00:31:17,920
and families.

485
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,080
But they died

486
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,040
because of me.

487
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,200
It's my fault.

488
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:26,160
My fault.

489
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,668
I was overly confident

490
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:35,256
and made people
lose their family members.

491
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:42,920
I got so many people killed

492
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,759
but I couldn't face it.

493
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,719
I was so selfish

494
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,960
and almost got you killed.

495
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,160
What scares me the most

496
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:00,080
is that I am a coward.

497
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:02,599
Such a coward

498
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,414
will never become a hero.

499
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:05,960
Get up.

500
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:16,280
Get up.

501
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
Leave me alone.

502
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:19,840
You get to cry?

503
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:21,759
Who says you get to cry?

504
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:22,560
Why can't I cry?

505
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:24,280
Who says guys can't cry?

506
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,879
You pushed me?

507
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,816
Yue Jinzhao, you pushed me!

508
00:32:30,136 --> 00:32:31,128
Are you done?

509
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,680
You think only you're upset?

510
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,119
Don't belittle yourself.

511
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,519
You've done pretty well.

512
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:27,479
I'm sorry.

513
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,759
Jinzhao.

514
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,080
But I want to do better.

515
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,080
I will never forget

516
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,160
what has happened.

517
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:39,960
Me neither.

518
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,320
Are you done fighting?

519
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,639
It looks like you've realized

520
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,119
that you can't undo your mistakes

521
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,808
but you can make amends.

522
00:34:09,336 --> 00:34:12,795
Fear not of the past
to not fear the future.

523
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:13,960
Mr. Gu.

524
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:15,639
You said

525
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:17,999
that guardians of Pureness

526
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:19,879
can see fragments
of the future sometimes.

527
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:21,080
Then...

528
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:23,920
Do you believe in what you've seen?

529
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:26,904
Yes, I do.

530
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,519
But I've also said

531
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,639
that the future can be changed.

532
00:34:33,528 --> 00:34:36,923
Even if the future is a mess,
you have Miss Yue with you.

533
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,440
Take this coin as a token.

534
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:52,080
Don't forget what I said today.

535
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,200
Mr. Ju, don't feel guilty.

536
00:35:09,304 --> 00:35:11,096
We have different things to protect.

537
00:35:11,544 --> 00:35:14,383
I made my choice
and I would bear the consequences.

538
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,080
Alright.

539
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,759
Go back.

540
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:19,999
Thank you, Senior.

541
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:26,440
Qi.

542
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:29,680
Qi.

543
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,479
Why are you fully covered?

544
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,440
Don't be suffocated.

545
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,399
Qi.

546
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,519
Qi.

547
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,040
Jinzhao.

548
00:35:56,344 --> 00:35:57,440
Did I scare you?

549
00:36:03,992 --> 00:36:06,328
You look upset these days.

550
00:36:06,328 --> 00:36:07,959
So I want to cheer you up.

551
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:10,759
What's wrong?

552
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:12,840
Nothing.

553
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,159
I just want to hug you.

554
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,040
Qi.

555
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:35,400
I hope you'll stay with me

556
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,679
forever.

557
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,959
Jinzhao.

558
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,199
I will stay with you forever.
