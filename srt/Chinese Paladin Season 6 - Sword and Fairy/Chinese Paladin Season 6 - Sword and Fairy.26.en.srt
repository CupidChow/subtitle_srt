21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,839
Miss Shuo Xuan,
now the Bloodbinding has been undone.

22
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,239
Rehai will return
to its wandering orbit.

23
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,400
I wonder if Her Lordship
has a plan in mind.

24
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:25,519
How are you to know the whereabouts
of Rehai when the time comes?

25
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,640
Stop beating around the bush.
What are you trying to say?

26
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,680
That day, Her Lordship and I together
coerced Ying Xuwei

27
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,520
to hand over the method
to undo the Bloodbinding.

28
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,320
He has long held a grudge against me

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,439
but could do nothing to me
because I possessed Rehai.

30
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,280
This scroll records
the trajectory of Rehai.

31
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,408
I've heard the Yu Clan keeps its word.

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,559
If you and Her Lordship
are willing to ensure my safety,

33
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,440
I shall certainly reciprocate
and give you the scroll.

34
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,760
What are you two talking about?

35
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:21,479
I'm just a bit curious.

36
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,559
What does the Yu Clan need Rehai for?

37
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,000
This seems to have nothing
to do with you anymore, right?

38
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,119
I've sensed Qi.

39
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,159
I worry that she might have been hurt
in these past few battles,

40
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:58,080
so I have brought her back
for a thorough examination.

41
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,080
It's best if it's as you say.

42
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,160
Xuwei, the matter
of Mr. Luo has been settled.

43
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,319
Then bring out the key ring of Rehai.

44
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,720
Your Lordship,
you can verify it for yourself.

45
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:44,919
Your Lordship...

46
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,839
Your Lordship, we had
an agreement before.

47
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,959
This key ring
is to be guarded by our sect.

48
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,759
Are you planning to break the agreement?

49
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:15,000
The transaction is complete.
I shall take my leave

50
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,759
Qingfei, see him out.

51
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:19,959
All right.

52
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,160
The Yujie Hub
is atop the paramount peak.

53
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,319
I do require someone
to escort me down the mountain.

54
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,360
But the flying mechanism of
the Hengdao Sect is not a good choice.

55
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,919
I wonder if you're willing to escort me
down the mountain, Your Lordship?

56
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,800
Your Lordship, we are going down
the mountain anyway.

57
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,880
Why not let Mr. Luo join us?

58
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Thank you, Your Lordship.

59
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,984
Father.

60
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,496
(Father.)

61
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,880
This is not an inner orb,

62
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,320
but a pill refined
from their own energy by a demon.

63
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,040
Which demon is so foolish

64
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,079
(Luo Zhaoyan)
that he gave it to you?

65
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,679
I have made an agreement
with that wolf demon.

66
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,200
He used half of his energy
to save my daughter.

67
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,720
In three months,
I will return to let it devour me.

68
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,024
Maiming.

69
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,920
If this can successfully
prolong Zhaoyan's life,

70
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,519
my death will be worth it.

71
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:23,839
You have to stand him up.

72
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,800
What does that mean?

73
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:31,320
The demonic power
in this pill cannot be utilized by me.

74
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:36,000
It seems that as long as
the condemnation of heaven exists,

75
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,839
I cannot replenish my Vitality Energy
from other sources.

76
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:44,959
But you can
have Zhaoyan take it and see.

77
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,239
I'm just afraid that until she dies,

78
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,600
this demonic power
will just dissipate in vain.

79
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,559
Jeez, the condemnation of heaven!

80
00:07:57,239 --> 00:08:02,000
Zhaoyan is such a good child.

81
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,440
Luo Wangping, if I tell Zhaoyan

82
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:12,359
that as a twin of our family,
she is destined to die young

83
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,280
because I stole half her life,

84
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:19,160
would she be so nice to me?

85
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,280
She regards you
as her most important elder brother.

86
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:37,080
Don't you have even a bit
of familial affection in your heart?

87
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:41,559
Familial affection?
After I was first reborn,

88
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,920
I told the elders of the family

89
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,679
Bloodbinding Rehai contravened
the Heavenly Laws

90
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,679
and that we would all suffer from
the condemnation of heaven.

91
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,480
Guess what their reaction was?

92
00:08:56,239 --> 00:08:57,760
To prevent me
from undoing the Bloodbinding

93
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,280
and causing the family to lose
the water supply of Rehai,

94
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,679
the then family master,
my elder brother in my first life,

95
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:09,399
decisively ordered my execution.

96
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,920
Luo Wangping, you are a smart person.

97
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,359
You can do many things for me,
who cannot leave the mansion.

98
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,559
So far, you've been a good ally.

99
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,679
You can leave.
I will inform you of my new ideas.

100
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,639
I hope we can continue
to cooperate happily.

101
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,639
Zhaoyan.

102
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,679
Stop hiding. I know you're there.

103
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,600
No, I'm not here.

104
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,359
I'm not here.

105
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,264
Zhaoyan.

106
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,208
I'm not here.

107
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,552
How is Zhaoyan doing?

108
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,999
I cast a calming spell on her

109
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:49,040
to let her sleep well.

110
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,320
Any news about Little Yue?

111
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,600
Judging from the current situation,

112
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,839
they wouldn't harm Qi.

113
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,240
The problem is that no one knows
where the Yujie Hub is.

114
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:06,480
I also can't sense
the Sea of Clear Skies.

115
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,639
The best option is to wait.

116
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
Wait for them to come to me.

117
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,839
Don't worry. We will find Little Yue.

118
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:20,600
You stay with Zhaoyan.

119
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,480
I'll go look again to see
if there's any sign of Qi.

120
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,208
My master wants to see you.

121
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
You dare to come back?

122
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:50,759
I've returned
because my only kin is here.

123
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,056
Since you can't let go,

124
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,319
you shouldn't have destroyed
the things she cares about.

125
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,800
What? You want to kill me?

126
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,519
For 200 years,
I've been putting up with the misery.

127
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:33,600
Dying at your hands now
would be a release.

128
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,399
With your current level of skill,

129
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,480
you're merely an ant beneath my feet.

130
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,959
What? Should I thank you for your mercy?

131
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,519
You drove Zhaoyan out of the Luo family

132
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,240
and sent her to the Mangwan Village.

133
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,759
You spared no effort to protect her,
even annihilating the entire family.

134
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,152
Luo Maiming,

135
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,959
should I say you are pitiable
or detestable?

136
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,879
Say it. What is the real reason
you've come to me?

137
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,999
I came here

138
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,999
to confirm whether her choice
was the correct one.

139
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,639
I still can't accept it.

140
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,120
You killed the entire Luo family,

141
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,920
and you don't leave
a single word of remorse?

142
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:39,439
Remorse?

143
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,839
Between you and me,

144
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:50,999
I can hardly tell
who's more like a demon.

145

177
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,920
to take you
to the Yujie Hub to raise you.

178
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:41,960
She's so adorable.

179
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:59,680
We will take her back to the Yujie Hub
and raise her well.

180
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,840
Her name is Qi.

181
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,920
Qi signifies good wishes.

182
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,560
She hoped you'd be happy and safe.

183
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,040
Happy and safe.

184
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,879
I'll take you to a place, okay?

185
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,440
Why did you bring me here?

186
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,960
You have left something here.

187
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,184
These are...

188
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:03,280
Each star

189
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,920
represents a memory of yours.

190
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,168
So...

191
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:23,080
You wiped out my memories?

192
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,976
Yes.

193
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,719
You manipulated everything in my life?

194
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,032
Yes.

195
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,736
Am I

196
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:57,440
a pawn in your game?

197
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,144
Yes.

198
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:25,160
What on earth do you want?

199
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,840
If you don't tell me,
I'll find out myself.

You shouldn't have treated
Huan that way just now.

207
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,160
Even you've learned to eavesdrop.

208
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:50,800
You only saw Huan's surveillance
and schemes against you.

209
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,719
In fact, he's done a lot for you,
and you just don't know it.

210
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,528
I don't want to know.

211
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:00,519
He once swore to heaven

212
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:03,920
that he would absolutely not
use the Resonance Spell on you.

213
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,680
Otherwise, he would suffer
the divine punishment of burning.

214
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:13,200
But Huan broke his oath twice for you.

215
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:19,320
The first time was in the Luori Village,

216
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:22,399
when you were in a deep coma

217
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,376
and it was hard to control your poison.

218
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:29,200
He immediately used the Resonance Spell
to alleviate your pain.

219
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,296
Qi,

220
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,328
I once swore not to use this spell.

221
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,960

You woke up because you had
abundant spiritual energy.

227
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:27,999
And the second time.

228
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,920
The second time was
at the Qiyuan Sect's headquarters.

232
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:07,960
Jinzhao has sent a letter.
He's waiting for us in the Yinghui Fort.

233
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:15,800
Let's go there now to meet with him.

234
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,528
Okay.

235
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,320
Who are you?

236
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,416
Are you allies of Luo Zhaoyan?

237
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,639
Where is Luo Zhaoyan? Tell us!

238
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:30,648
Tell us!

239
00:30:30,648 --> 00:30:31,999
Say it!

240
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,399
You are here for revenge
against Luo Zhaoyan too?

241
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,280
My wife and I returned home
to attend the grand family ceremony.

242
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:47,840
But my wife was struck by an evil spell
and was greatly weakened.

243
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,200
Those who ran out said

244
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:54,280
everyone under the evil spell died.

245
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,352
How did she survive?

246
00:30:55,992 --> 00:30:58,800
I've heard Luo Zhaoyan has a twin sister
named Luo Maiming.

247
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,200
Let us see her face.

248
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,239
Yes, have her turn her face
and let us take a look.

249
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,920
Otherwise, we will take matters
into our own hands.

250
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,399
- Right, turn around.
- Turn around.

251
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,399
- Turn around.
- Turn around.

252
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:10,712
Xian Qing.

253
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:16,960
Don't be foolish. You didn't kill them.

254
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,280
Someone must give them an explanation.

255
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,224
What's going on?

256
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:34,639
She really looks like Luo Zhaoyan.

257
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:36,664
She must be
Luo Zhaoyan's sister, Luo Maiming.

258
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,719
Say it! Where is your brother?

259
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,280
I am Luo Zhaoyan.

260
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:46,200
I was disguised as a man before,
and there was a reason for it.

261
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,719
I failed to realize and stop
the slaughter in time. I deserve to die.

262
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:59,479
If my death can appease your hatred,

263
00:32:01,112 --> 00:32:02,239
I will do it.

264
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,759
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

265
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:14,960
Avenge our clansmen!

266
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,200
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

267
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Avenge our clansmen!

268
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,840
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

269
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:32,792
Xian Qing.

270
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,096
Stand up.

271
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,680
Zhaoyan, I have indulged
your pride and caprice.

272
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
Now it's my willful time.

273
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,320
Xian Qing.

274
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:03,119
Such a lively scene!

275
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,200
Luo Maiming, how dare you show up?

276
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,920
Luo Maiming.

277
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,999
He is Luo Maiming.

278
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,599
He is Luo Maiming?

279
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,759
The clothes of the person upstairs
did resemble his.

280
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:21,879
Why bother with details?
Just kill them both.

281
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:23,840
After all, they are siblings.

282
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,999
They must both be involved
in the bloody case.

283
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,800
If you all can't discern
right from wrong,

284
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,239
let's see.

285
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,560
Did you truly kill
the members of the Luo family?

286
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,639
Was it really all your doing?

287
00:33:48,216 --> 00:33:49,240
Of course.

288
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,599
- It was him.
- You beast!

289
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,664
- He did it.
- He did it.

290
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:57,800
For dozens of miles around, all rely on
the water source here for survival.

291
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,680
Do you know where this water comes from?

292
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,080
The ancestors of the Luo family

293
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,784
exchanged the early death of Luo's twins
for the inexhaustible water!

294
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,560
- Is what he's saying true?
- What happened?

295
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,119
You're standing on the bones
of the twins without shame,

296
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,440
feasting on their blood

297
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,200
and flesh!

298
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:24,200
Let me ask you all one question.

299
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,800
Did the twins owe you anything?

300
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,560
Maiming, don't say any more.

301
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,599
You pity them

302
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:52,080
and are willing to lay down
your life for them.

303
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
I am not.

304
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,119
Even if your fates are tragic,

305
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,399
even if you brought the water source,

306
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
does that mean you can kill?

307
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,519
Yeah. I don't care
what your reasons are.

308
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,999
I only know blood for blood.

309
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,119
Luo Maiming, you killed the entire clan.

310
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,999
You should repay with your life.

311
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,408
- Right, blood for blood!
- Repay with your life!

312
00:35:20,408 --> 00:35:21,592
- Blood for blood!
- Die for it!

313
00:35:21,592 --> 00:35:22,652
Great.

314
00:35:22,652 --> 00:35:23,768
- Die!
- Die!

315
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,736
Blood for blood.

316
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,040
You didn't repay enough yesterday!

317
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,999
Murderer!
