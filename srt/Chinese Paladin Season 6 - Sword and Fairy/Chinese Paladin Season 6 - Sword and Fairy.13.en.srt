21
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,079
Thank you, Miss Ming.
Thanks to your magic lamp, we escaped.

22
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,536
Jinzhao.

23
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,640
Why is there two of you?

24
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,544
Qi.

25
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,280
Jinzhao, I feel bad.

26
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,760
I'll take you to rest.

27
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,080
Jinzhao, let's find
a place to settle down.

28
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,608
Let's go.

29
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,360
Greetings, Didact.

30
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,519
What is it?

31
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,640
Didact,

32
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,239
today, at the Zhengwu Alliance,
I saw those ruffians again.

33
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,320
And that monster who killed
Zhenyao fish with a single blow.

34
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,680
Didact, the Zhengwu Alliance
is the number one sect in the world.

35
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,119
If that bunch of people
cooperate with them,

36
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,879
it would likely be detrimental to us.

37
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,720
But I used a little trick.

38
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,000
I got someone to poison them
with the Huaxing Powder.

39
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:57,440
If the Zhengwu Alliance knows
there's a demon among those people,

40
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,000
their friendly relationship

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,440
won't last long.

42
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,479
So it was you.

43
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:08,440
Gao Xiao.

44
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,559
Yes.

45
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:14,199
You've done a great job. I will secure
your succession as the sect leader.

46
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,759
Thank you, Didact.

47
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:21,479
I will repay your great kindness
even by risking my life.

48
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,679
I'll take my leave.

49
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,399
(Gao Xiao, I'll get back at you
on behalf of Qi.)

50
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,039
Zhaoyan,
I've brought you trouble this time.

51
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,360
How so? Without you today,

52
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,479
we wouldn't know
Bian Luohuan's identity.

53
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,640
And we don't care if you're a demon.

54
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,000
That's what everyone thinks?

55
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,928
Of course, although you're a wolf demon,
you're kind-hearted towards me...

56
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,160
I mean, all of us.
And you help us a lot.

57
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,624
You...

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And you? What do you think?

59
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,839
To me, you are
a very loyal buddy and friend.

60
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:08,568
Buddy?

61
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,679
Well, at least you don't despise me
for being a demon.

62
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:26,679
I've wanted to give this to you before.

63
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,720
Thank you, but this hairpin
is something used by women.

64
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,064
You knew?

65
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,920
Yes, just as you know I am a demon.

66
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,200
Senior, I...

67
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,559
Zhaoyan, I...

68
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:55,040
Senior Xian Qing, I brought you...

69
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,559
I'm sorry.

70
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,760
I'll put it here.

71
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,000
Go ahead.

72
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,760
You saved me anyway.

73
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,600
A hairpin as a token of gratitude
isn't too much, right?

74
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,480
In that case, I accept it.

75
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,000
You mean he looks exactly the same?

76
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,799
It's just that he has
a scar on his face.

77
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,760
The Didact of the Qiyuan Sect
looks so much like me.

78
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,200
Could it be that we are brothers?

79
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Then, wouldn't our investigation
into the Qiyuan Sect turn into a joke?

80
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,760
You're wrong. Although Physician Bian...

81
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,760
No, you're just you.
You are different from everyone else.

82
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,119
Your eyes are brighter than his.

83
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:51,480
You are also warmer than him.

84
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,680
What's wrong?

85
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,239
Qi, do you know
what's the deal with these scales?

86
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,839
Why did they grow out again?

87
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,696
Again?

88
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,280
They grew after I consumed
the Qiyuan Orb at the Fujin Hall before.

89
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,119
But they disappeared quickly,
so I didn't pay much attention.

90
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:36,200
So I wasn't wrong
about what I saw by the Yinma River.

91
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,720
They grew on me at that time too?

92
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,799
Qi, don't you think
these scales are quite pretty?

93
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,992
They are amazing.

94
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,399
So, don't worry.

95
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:00,280
You must remember

96
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:03,959
not to show the scales to others
or tell anyone about them.

97
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,559
Not even Zhaoyan?

98
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,000
Isn't she our good friend?

99
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,880
We can't let our good friends worry.

100
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,760
We'll tell them

101
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,760
after we find evidence, okay?

102
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:29,560
(Hundred-Foot Spring Platform,
Yujie Hub)

103
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,680
Do you realize your mistake?

104
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,519
It was my fault that I let
Yue Jinzhao knock off my mask,

105
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
but I don't regret it.

106
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,488
Luohuan!

107
00:11:16,604 --> 00:11:17,920
Huan.

108
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,399
Please, Huan did it to save Qi,
so that's why...

109
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,360
If you had left immediately
after rescuing her,

110
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,480
they wouldn't have seen your face.

111
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,560
According to the rules of our sect,

112
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,800
what punishment should one receive
for deliberate violation?

113
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,680
They shall be punished with thunder.

114
00:12:19,832 --> 00:12:20,959
Luohuan!

115
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,759
Xiaoyuan, don't.

116
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:26,280
It'll just make things worse.

117
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,199
Before, Qingfei concealed your breach
of oath in the Luori Village.

118
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:39,839
I turned a blind eye and let it pass

119
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,120
because you did not affect our plan.

120
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,079
But this time, you exposed your face.

121
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,519
Our plan may very well
be ruined because of it.

122
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,752
Xuwei,

123
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,999
it was I who broke the vow.
I admit all my faults.

124
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,240
You are all talking.
You don't admit in your heart at all.

125
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,839
Now the one who's intertwined
with Qi's fate is Yue Jinzhao. Not you.

126
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,759
Yue Jinzhao exists because of you.

127
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,839
For Qi,

128
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,160
you are the past. He is the future.

129
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,920
When will you understand?

130
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,079
I know it all along,

131
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,319
but I don't want to.

132
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,999
Luohuan!

133
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:04,079
Xiaoyuan, don't go over.

134
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,040
Xuwei, please, just spare Huan!

135
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:12,519
It's not that I refuse
to go easy on him.

136
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:15,600
It's that he won't go easy on himself.

137
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,199
Luohuan, I'm asking you again.

138
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,360
Do you recognize your mistake?

139
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,280
I made no mistake,
so how can I recognize it?

140
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,296
Huan.

141
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,888

Thanks, you're so kind.

155
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,199
By the way, how is Senior Xian Qing?

156
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,744
Didn't you agree we'd be buddies?
Why are you still calling me senior?

157
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,040
Okay, Xian Qing.

158
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,560
I'll call you by your name
from now on too.

159
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:44,360
Little Yue, you must
take revenge for me.

160
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,439
Of course. Jinzhao and I
have already made an arrangement.

161
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:49,120
This time, we must
eliminate the Qiyuan Sect.

162
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:58,959
Everyone, about that Bian Luohuan
who looks just like me...

163
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,959
Jinzhao, you are you and he is him.
We can tell the difference.

164
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,688
Thanks a lot.

165
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,160
But you and Bian Luohuan
look like twins.

166
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,399
We might not tell who's who
by the looks, but I...

167
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,839
But we know well

168
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:21,040
that you and Bian Luohuan
are fundamentally different.

169
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,160
Let's think about
what we should do next.

170
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:27,519
Previously, at the Fujin Hall,

171
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,879
the Qiyuan Sect said
the Didact wanted to capture us.

172
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:33,160
Later, at the Fengyan Inn, they
identified Bian Luohuan as the Didact.

173
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,680
I have always suspected Bian Luohuan
is plotting against me and Qi.

174
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,720
But I don't know his exact purpose yet.

175
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,480
We will continue
to investigate the Qiyuan Sect

176
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
and catch Bian Luohuan.

177
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,959
Right, now we only have
a clue about the crystal.

178
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,360
And the crystal is
in the mechanism box of the Qiyuan Sect.

179
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,999
Then it must be related to the sect.

180
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,879
He also appeared in the Wuyan Village,
where Qi and I woke up.

181
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,360
In addition, I bear
a strong resemblance to Bian Luohuan.

182
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,639
Let's just go back to the village

183
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:07,040
and ask Mrs. Shi.

184
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,519
Little Yue has really grown up.

185
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,720
How is Luohuan?

186
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,199
He has taken his medicine
and gone to sleep.

187
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,600
Actually, it hasn't been easy for him.

188
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,319
Back then, to keep Zhu Yu in check,

189
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,199
after those from the Sea
of Clear Skies entrusted Qi to us,

190
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,519
Huan accompanied her for over a decade.

191
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,040
He always took care of her
and taught her with patience.

192
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,560
That was because Qi only
wanted to be close to him.

193
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:18,879
Later, Qi disappeared,
and when she came back,

194
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:21,160
Yue Jinzhao was by her side.

195
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:27,920
You thought Qi had a far deeper bond
with Yue Jinzhao than with Huan,

196
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,399
so you let the two of them
stay in the Mortal Realm

197
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,439
and Huan was thus permanently replaced.

198
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,120
That still can't be a reason
for him to break his vow.

199
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,120
Huan is not one to wallow in self-pity.

200
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,160
He can accept this.

201
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:53,920
But he'd feel inevitably salty about it.

202
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:58,639
Please don't blame him.

203
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:14,719
You should know I never blame you guys.

204
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,800
No way.

205
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,960
Shifang, what are you looking at?

206
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,160
Shh.

207
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,192
What's wrong?

208
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,160
Didn't you say last time
that Zhaoyan and Xian Qing...?

209
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,239
Anyway, are they really...?

210
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,032
Yeah.

211
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,639
Do you not think that they're...?

212
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:18,648
Well-matched.

213
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,040
Wretched? We are
all good friends, Little Yue.

214
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,719
No need to diss them.

215
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,759
Shifang, it was "well-matched",
not "wretched".

216
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:33,816
Match...

217
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:50,599
Are you still hesitating

218
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,280
about whether to tell
everyone you're a woman?

219
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,680
I've gotten used to being seen as a man.

220
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,920
Spitting the truth about being a woman

221
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:05,479
feels somewhat difficult.

222
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,719
But we are thick-and-thin friends.

223
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,384
I shouldn't keep it a secret.

224
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:19,640
Let's go.

225
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,640
Miss Yue.

226
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
Miss Yue, Shifang.

227
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:34,639
Sorry, actually, I'm a girl.

228
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:37,479
Girls' clothes are so pretty. Zhaoyan,
you should wear them more often.

229
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,160
I mistook you and Xian Qing as...

230
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:51,080
But now it seems
I wasn't totally mistaken.

231
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,719
No, I was wrong.

232
00:21:56,879 --> 00:21:58,840
Was I wrong or not?

233
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:01,999
It's just that before, you...

234
00:22:01,999 --> 00:22:04,440
Shifang, let's go.
You really are verbose.

235
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,399
Wait, s-s-she really is a girl?

236
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:11,096
They already knew?

237
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,840
Whether you present yourself

238
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:18,359
as a man or a woman,
it's your own affair.

239
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:20,080
As long as you like it.

240
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:47,800
Jinzhao.

241
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,880
What's the matter?

242
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,999
What's wrong? Are you
still thinking about Bian Luohuan?

243
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,320
I'm wondering

244
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:01,080
if he is my twin brother or not.

245
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:06,160
Bian Luohuan, you and I.

246
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,960
What kind of relationship
do the three of us have?

247
00:23:18,712 --> 00:23:19,736
What are you doing?

248
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,840
Why think so much?

249
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,599
During the past three years,

250
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,599
haven't we been taking it
one day at a time?

251
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,320
What's wrong? Did I say something wrong?

252
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,399
You're particularly right.

253
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,976
We're in the Wuyan Village now.

254
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,999
Didn't we come here
the last time we visited the Pureness?

255
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,680
So the village is right below it.

256
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:09,800
Be careful.

257
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,359
Jinzhao, I never thought
we would come back.

258
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,200
Yes, it's just like a dream.

259
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,639
(Wuyan Village)
All houses have been renovated.

260
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:19,999
Life is much better than before.

261
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,440
This really is a place of peace.

262
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,759
Yes, and the people here
were really nice to us.

263
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,239
Miss Yue, you've returned.

264
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,040
Come on.

265
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,064
Isn't that...?

266
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,999
Go, hurry.

267
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:51,639
Shifang, what do you
want to eat in a bit?

268
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:57,239
I want to eat...

269
00:24:58,759 --> 00:24:59,768
Egg noodles.

270
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,960
Egg noodles.

271
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,160
Let's go back first.

272
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,960
Where is your house then?

273
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,840
The most dilapidated one.

274
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,856
Let's go.

275
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,399
3 years ago, Jinzhao
and I lived right here.

276
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:31,840
It seems life wasn't easy for you two.

277
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,239
Back then, Jinzhao
and I relied on each other.

278
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:38,040
There was only this house here,
so we lived together.

279
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,479
Back then, he was handsy.

280
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:53,999
What are you saying?

281
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:56,800
Why are you covering my mouth again?

282
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,119
Aren't you afraid I'll tell everyone
about how you were always taking my bed?

283
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,639
You made it sound a bit strange.
Do you realize that?

284
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:05,599
What's so strange?
You always took my bed back then.

285
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,119
Alright, let's talk business.

286
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,399
Then let's clean up this place.

287
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:14,080
Let's rest here tonight.

288
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,160
Okay.

289
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,879
Those three villagers earlier
were carrying this type of crystal.

290
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,840
Back then, Jinzhao used
this kind of crystal

291
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,680
to exchange for our travel expenses
out of the village.

292
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,800
It's quite valuable.

293
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:28,519
This crystal can also
make Dou Bao stronger.

294
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:34,359
This village used to be extremely poor.

295
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,479
But now, it's much better
than before we left.

296
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,759
It seems that the villagers
have been selling

297
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,200
crystals to the Qiyuan Sect in secret.

298
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,560
That's how they revived the village.

299
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,040
But the villagers all seem very kind.

300
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,160
How could they do such a thing?

301
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,280
Maybe they don't even know

302
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,879
what the Qiyuan Sect have done.

303
00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:00,800
Qi is right. This village
is located in a remote area.

304
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,719
They just want to improve their lives.

305
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:07,280
If the villagers
are in cahoots with the sect,

306
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,879
it would be difficult for us
to get any information out of them.

307
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:14,599
Rather than asking the villagers,

308
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,519
it's better to lure out
the person behind them.

309
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,960
Yes, we can do it with the crystals.

310
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,920
How do we do it?

311
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,080
Let's start with Mrs. Shi.

312
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,320
She's in charge
of the village's affairs.

313
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,560
If the village really has something
to do with the Qiyuan Sect,

314
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,639
she must be aware of it.

315
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:35,832
You're really clever.

316
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,192
- Mrs. Shi.
- Mrs. Shi.

317
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,840
Yue and Qi!

318
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,560
How come you're here?

319
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:58,519
Let me have a look.
You've grown more and more beautiful.

320
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:01,879
Mrs. Shi, we want to ask about
something from three years ago.

321
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:03,119
Something from three years ago?

322
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,639
Yes, three years ago,
did you see someone

323
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:07,879
who looked exactly like me?

324
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,680
Someone who looked exactly like you?

325
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:14,359
No, I haven't seen such a person.
Why do you ask?

326
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:20,280
What about Mr. Lin Yuan?
He was the one who found us in the mine

327
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,519
and brought us to the village.

328
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,680
I know. He stayed in this village

329
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,599
with you for a while.

330
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:31,680
But he left right after you did.

331
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,920
Right, it seems someone
spotted him near the mine.

332
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,680
You guys can go there to look for him.

333
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:42,719
There's one more thing, Mrs. Shi.

334
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:45,440
We came here to investigate
the Dragon Crystals in this village.

335
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,920
This crystal was found
at the stronghold of the Qiyuan Sect.

336
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:57,800
I-I-I don't know anything
about what you're saying.

337
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,920
Mrs. Shi, the Qiyuan Sect
has committed many evils.

338
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,776
You mustn't help them.

339
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,639
Mrs. Shi, please tell us.

340
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,680
I-I-I have no idea.

341
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,879
Don't inquire about this matter anymore.

342
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:16,239
Hurry and leave.

343
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:17,336
- Mrs. Shi.
- Mrs. Shi.

344
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,112
Come.

345
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:50,879
Judging from Mrs. Shi's reaction,

346
00:29:50,879 --> 00:29:52,920
the village must be
in collusion with the Qiyuan Sect.

347
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,239
And she refused to say anything.

348
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,328
Let's split up.

349
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:00,152
- Okay.
- Hmm.

350
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:04,440
Luo, Miss Ming, Shifang,
you guys go look over there.

351
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,440
Qi and I will take this side.

352
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:14,840
Is there really something fishy
about Mrs. Shi?

353
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:17,784
I'm not sure either.

354
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,080
It doesn't seem like it.

355
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,519
Senior Xian Qing?

356
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,320
Xian Qing,
you're top-notch in disguising.

357
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,359
I can't understand you, Xian Qing.
Can you speak human language?

358
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:49,040
He's probably saying...

359
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
Saying what?

360
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,064
He says,

361
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:56,759
why do you guys make the same mistake
as Zhaoyan, mistaking the wrong dog?

362
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,840
Speaking of surveillance,
I'll stay behind.

363
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,200
So, will you turn into
a dog to keep watch?

364
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:07,840
What? Xian Qing is a high-level demon.

365
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,239
How could he use such lowly tricks?

366
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,320
What is a high-level demon?

367
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,239
Don't ask so many questions.

368
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,608
Demonic aura.

369
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,440
Let's go take a look.

370
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:30,328
Stop!

371
00:31:38,552 --> 00:31:39,608
Mr. Lin.

372
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,200
You almost scared me to death.

373
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,040
Qi? Yue?

374
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:46,239
What are you doing here?

375
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:47,960
Mr. Lin, what are you doing here?

376
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:51,160
I-I-I was just passing by
the Wuyan Village

377
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,800
so I came in for a stroll
and bumped into you.

378
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,200
Then did you just notice

379
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,479
someone suspicious passing by?

380
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,759
Suspicious people? No.

381
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,359
We lost them.

382
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:05,359
Mr. Lin, I want to ask you something.

383
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,424
Go ahead.

384
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,320
When you found us three years ago,

385
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,560
were there other people around us?

386
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,999
Why do you suddenly ask this?

387
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,119
Mr. Lin, please think carefully.

388
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,999
This is very important for Jinzhao.

389
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:22,160
Was there someone
who looked exactly like me?

390
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:26,160
No, when I found you at the entrance
of the village three years ago,

391
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,160
you were just lying there.

392
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,280
I thought you were dead.
It gave me quite a fright.

393
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,160
But later on, I found out
you were all right,

394
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,399
so I brought you to the village.

395
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,040
Qi, how have you been these three years?

396
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,040
Over the years,
Jinzhao and I have been traveling.

397
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,999
We've been to many places
and eaten lots of delicious food.

398
00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:43,639
And we've made many good friends.

399
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:46,200
You've even made friends! That's great.

400
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,680
Yue, don't be so anxious.

401
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,359
You're always chasing after

402
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:54,719
things out of reach.

403
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:57,399
Smell the roses
and the people around you.

404
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:59,200
Cherish the present, right?

405
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,128
I've been staying nearby recently.
Come to me if you're in need.

406
00:33:03,128 --> 00:33:04,160
Goodbye, Mr. Lin.

407
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,759
Okay, I'm leaving.

408
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,616
Let's go.

409
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,119
I don't know why Yue and Qi returned.

410
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:30,999
Since three years ago, we started
gathering the Dragon Crystals,

411
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:33,440
I-I-I've always had it in my mind
not to let others

412
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,999
know what we're doing,
just like you said.

413
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,040
But now they've tracked it
all the way here.

414
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:59,040
Yue and Qi are innocent.

415
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,399
Please have mercy and let them go.

416
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,999
If you don't want everyone
in your village to die,

417
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,759
then do as I say.

418
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:21,999
Why hasn't Xian Qing returned yet?

419
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,680
Zhaoyan, are you worried about me?

420
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,944
I smell a demon.

421
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,960
Because we went to chase a demon.

422
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,119
No, you must have come
into contact with a demon

423
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,680
as it's such a strong demonic aura.

424
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,759
And it is similar to that of Shuo Xuan
we encountered in the Luori Village.

425
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,359
M-M-Miss Shuo Xuan?

426
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:57,200
Miss and Mr. Yue, you said
you ran into Lin Yuan

427
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,719
while going after a demon.

428
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:02,879
Could it be that Mr. Lin is a demon?

429
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,840
I've always considered him my savior.

430
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:16,840
Today, I saw he was wearing
a scale just like Shuo Xuan's.

431
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,560
Is he really in on it?

432
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,200
Doesn't that mean they saved us twice?

433
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,999
Once was when we woke up
in the Wuyan Village,

434
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,599
and another time by the Yinma River.

435
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,639
Why didn't they tell us?

436
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,119
I've always suspected
Shuo Xuan knows you.

437
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,800
If Mr. Lin and Shuo Xuan
are in it together,

438
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:40,800
he must know our origins,

439
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,719
but he watched us bustle about
without saying a word.

440
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:48,080
Why is he doing this to us?

441
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,040
Don't be so nervous.

442
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,320
How about I go capture Mr. Lin
and torture him to spill the truth

443
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,399
about our origins?

444
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,280
Torturing him? Can you really do it?

445
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,120
Seems like I can't.

446
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,400
Lin Yuan seems
to have been watching us in secret.

447
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:11,840
Let's see what he's really up to first.

448
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:16,880
And that person
behind Mrs. Shi has appeared.

449
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,840
They call this kind of rock
the Dragon Crystal.

450
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,320
They also planned
to lead us to the mine tomorrow.

451
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,080
Someone will be waiting for us there.

452
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:30,519
Alright, it seems
the mastermind is coming out.

453
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:34,040
Qi. Yue.

454
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:35,840
Mrs. Shi.

455
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,880
- Yue.
- Mrs. Shi.

456
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,944
Qi.

457
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,168
Please have a seat.

458
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,888
No, thanks.

459
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:55,280
The crystals are
at the location marked on this map.

460
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,880
The buyer will go to the mine tomorrow.

461
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:03,120
Come tomorrow.

462
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:14,400
Alright, since the Qiyuan Sect
has set a trap for us,

463
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,840
let's beat them at their own game.
