The people from the Hengdao Sect seem

00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,960
We will find her.

23
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,360
Is Luohuan settled in?

24
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,760
Xiaoyuan, you've made a mistake again.

25
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,696
I haven't.

26
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:11,199
You only care about the "people".

27
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,519
We mean nothing to you.

28
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:18,840
Xiaoyuan.

29
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,519
Go confine yourself

30
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,000
for three days!

31
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,799
Xuwei, Xiaoyuan is still young.
She doesn't understand.

32
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,970
How is Luohuan's injury?

33
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,491
The power
of Qi's Thought Sword is strong.

34
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,730
Huan is severely injured.

35
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:58,232
I got it.

36
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:04,810
Tomorrow is the day
of the transaction with Luo Maiming.

37
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,651
It is of top importance.

38
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,731
Once the transaction is complete,
bring Yue Jinzhao back.

39
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:16,024
Got it.

40
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,931
Qingfei, what's wrong?

41
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:33,976
It's all my fault.

42
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:39,128
If I had stopped Huan at the time,

43
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:40,216
he wouldn't have...

44
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:48,810
This has nothing to do with you.
It was his fate.

45
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,411
I'll go check on him.

46
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,970
Luohuan, I didn't protect you well.

47
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,810
You've been hurt so badly.

48
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,600
Come here.

49
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:59,291
Why is our little leader crying?

50
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,491
Don't worry.

51
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,771
I will be fine after some rest.

52
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,291
Really? You're not lying to me?

53
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:12,856
Of course not.
I'm a physician, after all.

54
00:06:13,451 --> 00:06:15,611
Could I not know my condition?

55
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,090
You must rest well.

56
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,331
Didn't Xuwei confine you
as a punishment?

57
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:30,690
Aren't you afraid he'll punish you
more heavily for sneaking out?

58
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,770
I just wanted to come see you.

59
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,810
Ying Xuwei is very bad.

60
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,530
Luohuan, I'll come see you again.

61
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,568
Run.

62
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:55,544
Xuwei.

63
00:07:20,011 --> 00:07:25,331
Xuwei, this confinement
is practically a joke.

64
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,090
Unexpectedly, Qi's powerful enough

65
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,090
to break my Resonance Spell.

66
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:56,051
Good. I can use this time

67
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,851
to improve my medical skills.

68
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:12,376
Luohuan.

69
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:16,184
Do you regret it?

70
00:08:21,731 --> 00:08:24,370
What is there to regret, Xuwei?

71
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:28,051
Didn't we know all this would happen?

72
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,210
Things might have taken
a different turn,

73
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:34,370
but isn't it still pretty much
what we expected?

74
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:06,136
Luohuan.

75
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,008
I'm sorry.

76
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,011
Xuwei, you've done nothing wrong.

77
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,530
If there is any wrong,
it's only to yourself.

78
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,731
Some missions
shouldn't be shouldered by you alone.

79
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:36,760
Xuwei.

00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,611

00:14:30,264 --> 00:14:32,010
Of course not.

00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,411
The weather is going to change.

115
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,371

Why hasn't my father returned yet?
I'll go pick him up.

117
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,931
Why does she look so much like Zhaoyan?

118
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,890
What relation is her of mine?

119
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:23,931
Back then, they sacrificed
me here to secure Rehai.

120
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:28,010
I walked onto the sacrificial altar
with a smile.

121
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:33,330
They exchanged my life
for peace for the many.

122
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,330
How grand it was.

123
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,970
(But it was only after my death
that I discovered)

124
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:44,770
(my soul was bound with Rehai
to the Luo family.)

125
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,530
(Decades later, the Luo family
had a pair of twins.)

126
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,491
(My soul then possessed one of them,)

127
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,171
(and the other's life force
continuously flowed to me.)

128
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,130
(But we were destined to die young.)

129
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:07,731
(Since then, I have been reborn
time and again as a twin.)

130
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:12,330
(My immortality and the premature death
of generations of Luo's twins)

131
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,224
(are the curse for defying heaven.)

132
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:19,371
As the guardian of Rehai,
I've been using it to benefit myself.

133
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,811
Now, I'm resolved to right my wrongs

134
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,570
by releasing Rehai.

135
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,240
Master?

136
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:39,064
Zhaoyan?

137
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:44,171
Why didn't Ying Xuwei stop her?

138
00:16:45,611 --> 00:16:49,010
Cang Feng, prepare
to welcome the Master.

139
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,010
Ensure the Master's safety at all costs.

140
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,656
Yes.

141
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:11,090
Zhaoyan, you have returned after all.

142
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,251
Did you tell the Hengdao Sect
about our trip

143
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:15,851
to the Mangwan Village?

144
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,130
Why did you do that, Maiming?

145
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,330
Do you still trust me?

146
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:27,890
Yes.

147
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,330
It's a long story.

148
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,624
I'm not interested in
why you cooperate with Bian Luohuan.

149
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:52,251
You're Zhaoyan's brother.
I don't want to give you a hard time.

150
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:53,611
I just want to know some things.

151
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,088
Tell me everything you know.

152
00:17:58,712 --> 00:17:59,800
Mr. Luo.

153
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,291
It seems to be a labyrinth spell.

154
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:13,090
Maiming, what are you going to do?

155
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,051
I will fulfill my long-cherished wish.

156
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:21,650
A long-cherished wish? You're gonna
undo the Bloodbinding of Rehai?

157
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:23,611
Have you found a way?

158
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,770
Is this the reason
you've been deceiving me?

159
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,811
I've been trapped here
for over 200 years.

160
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,691
I've finally found a way out.
How can I miss it?

161
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,392
Zhaoyan.

162
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,336
Maiming.

163
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,464
Maiming.

164
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:50,171
Is there a way to break this barrier?

165
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,051
Every barrier has its own flaws.

166
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:58,970
Flaws. Let's go find the flaws.

167
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,650
Our family is so renowned

168
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,211
in the Western Regions.

169
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:13,912
Even in the Central Plains,
we're a prestigious family.

170
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:14,931
Yes.

171
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:17,890
All thanks to Master Luo.

172
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:21,770
He's a good master. He eradicates
bandits, purges evil cults

173
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,931
and guards the peace here.

174
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:26,850
Our family has thus earned
its far-reaching reputation.

175
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,610
That's right. Drink up, come on.

176
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,648
Come on.

177
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,931
Who is that on the tower?

178
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,696
The weather is really nice today.

179
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,451
You've just married a local.
You might not know.

180
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:43,451
Only the Master
has the key to the Octagonal Tower.

181
00:19:43,451 --> 00:19:47,331
And this person is Master Luo Zhaoyan.

182
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:52,850
The ceremony must be starting soon
as the Master has ascended the tower.

183
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,250
Let's go to the bottom of the tower.

184
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,770
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go together.

185
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,824
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

186
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,216
What is this?

187
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,091
What's going on?

188
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:07,811
Is the Master over there?

189
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:11,650
Look.

190
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,664
What is it?

191
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:29,304
(Favorable Weather)

192
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:19,480
Father.

193
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:24,411
What took you so long?

194
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:25,730
The grand ceremony is about to start.

195
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,890
The Master has entrusted
the business to me.

196
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,832
We must not let him down.

197
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,392
The Yinghui Fort has been unsettled
these past two days.

198
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:37,770
Dealing with the business affairs
took a bit longer than expected.

199
00:22:39,211 --> 00:22:41,171
Then let's go. I'll take it.

200
00:22:43,224 --> 00:22:44,250
Murder!

201
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,610
They're killed! Run!

202
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:48,792
What happened?

203
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:51,171
Luo Zhaoyan has killed many people
in the mansion using evil magic.

204
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:52,184
You should run too!

205
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:56,890
Zhao... Zhaoyan. Father,
he wouldn't have.

206
00:22:57,464 --> 00:22:58,571
I'll go and see.

207
00:22:58,571 --> 00:22:59,691
I'll go too.

208
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:02,010
No, you stay here. Be good.

209
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,552
Strange.

210
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,850
The power sustaining
the barrier is weakening.

211
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,600
Zhaoyan.

212
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:27,928
That's not right.

213
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:28,971
What's wrong?

214
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:29,976
That's not right.

215
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:38,136
This painting...

216
00:23:40,411 --> 00:23:42,211
I think it's far inferior to that one.

217
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:51,610
I gave this painting to Maiming.

218
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:54,010
He wouldn't hang
the painting in his room.

219
00:23:55,571 --> 00:23:56,664
There's something wrong with it.

220
00:23:57,451 --> 00:23:58,451
I'll do it.

221
00:23:58,451 --> 00:23:59,480
Wait.

222
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,312
The barrier has been broken.

223
00:24:20,856 --> 00:24:21,890
Are you alright?

224
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,370
Yes. Let's look for Maiming.

225
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,370
Just a little longer.

226
00:24:53,971 --> 00:24:55,000
Maiming.

227
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,250
Maiming.

228
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,411
How can it be snowing
at this time of year?

229
00:25:00,971 --> 00:25:01,976
Maiming.

230
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:04,051
Be careful, Zhaoyan.

231
00:25:04,691 --> 00:25:06,490
Xian Qing, you stay with Zhaoyan.

232
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,571
I'll go look for Luo Maiming.

233
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,264
Master.

234
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:43,832
Don't come closer.

235
00:25:56,971 --> 00:25:58,691
Zhaoyan.

236
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,560
Are you okay?

237
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,051
That spell is absorbing
Zhaoyan's Vitality Energy.

238
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,576
Master.

239
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,811
How's Zhaoyan?

240
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,130
Master Luo is still alive.

241
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,650
It's been over 200 years.

242
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:08,291
200 years.

243
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,920
Get up.

244
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,530
The spell is slowly fading.

245
00:27:58,811 --> 00:27:59,864
Xian Qing.

246
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,072
Zhaoyan.

247
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:08,184
Up.

248
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,040
Madman.

249
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,600
Zhaoyan.

250
00:29:58,691 --> 00:29:59,704
Stop.

251
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:07,291
Move aside.

252
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:11,091
Only the Master can go upstairs.

253
00:30:11,931 --> 00:30:13,850
Don't you know your master has gone mad?

254
00:30:15,171 --> 00:30:16,216
I'll go upstairs myself.

255
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:20,056
Let her go.

256
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:15,291
Zhaoyan, I am finally free,

257
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,850
and I have finally destroyed
the Luo family.

258
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,370
Yes, you've done it.

259
00:31:41,811 --> 00:31:43,010
You want to kill me?

260
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:47,130
You killed so many innocent people.

261
00:31:48,451 --> 00:31:49,451
You must pay for it.

262
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:51,160
Innocent?

263
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:55,130
I was merely taking back everything
the Luo family owed me.

264
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,770
They were just ordinary people
who knew nothing.

265
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,010
So many lives.

266
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:04,370
You must pay for them.

267
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:20,291

their lives were nothing.

274
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,691
Compared to me?

275
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,890

the Luo family was doomed to this end.

00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,171
You shouldn't have hurt her like this.

286
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,010
I shouldn't have.
