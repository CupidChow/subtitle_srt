00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,880
Okay, just a second.

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,040
Come on.

24
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,159
Shifang, what do you want?

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,980
Shifang, which one do you want?

26
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,999
Still this one?

27
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,520
Sir, what would you like to eat?

28
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,280
I'll wait for the others.

29
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,368
Alright.

30
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,120
Zhaoyan, come sit.

31
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,744
What are you doing?

32
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,408
Enjoying the flowers.

33
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,919
Jinzhao, come eat.

34
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,159
Shopkeeper, we're ready to order.

35
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,248
Coming.

36
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,559
Would you like meat or vegetables?

37
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,119
Meat. He'll pay.

38
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,640
No need. Just bring us all of
your best specialties.

39
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,728
Okay.

40
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,680
Wait. Two shares of each.

41
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,760
Okay.

42
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:01,599
Shopkeeper, there are mosquitoes here.

43
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,839
Light some mugwort.

44
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,720
Yes, right away.

45
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,240
Little Yue.

46
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,839
(Design drawing)
You wanted Dou Bao to shoot flames.

47
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,319
I worked on the design
all night yesterday. Look.

48
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,319
You are in good mood
as a prisoner, Physician Bian.

49
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:27,384
This flower is called Yexiang.

50
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:29,679
When the flowers bloom,

51
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:31,800
its branches and leaves
have a calming effect.

52
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,440
Would you like to try, Xian Qing?

53
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,679
No, thank you.

54
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,632
Look.

55
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,839
(Dou Bao Flamer II, Charm)
Here, and here.

56
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:57,039
Excuse me, are you all
staying for the night?

57
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,399
No, we just eat…

58
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,039
Zhaoyan?

59
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,600
Zhaoyan, are you okay?

60
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,056
How are you?

61
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,839
It's nothing. I just need to rest a bit.

62
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,520
It's not good to be stubborn.

63
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:22,759
We should stay and rest.

64
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,039
We have only three rooms left.
You'll have to share.

65
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,859
Zhaoyan is not feeling well.

66
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:34,919
I'll take care of him.
We share one room.

67
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:35,399
Senior.

68
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,160
Come.

69
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,759
Senior…

70
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Please follow me.

71
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,688
It has nothing to do with me.

72
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,240
Your saying doesn't count.

73
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,280
Shifang, follow him.

74
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,080
Okay, let's go.

75
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,200
Zhaoyan suffers from an illness,

76
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,160
yet he was so strong on the journey.

77
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,720
He's worthy to be
the master of Luo family.

78
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,519
He was fine before,
but fell ill twice today.

79
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,399
Is it because he got too tired?

80
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,984
I can give you other flowers,
but not this one.

81
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,512
Senior.

82
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,408
I have something to discuss with you.
Let's talk outside.

83
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:20,320
Stay put here. Don't try any tricks.

84
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,920
Ju, care for some tea?

85
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:34,079
I will not accept an enemy's kindness.

86
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,839
Aren't you tired for
staring at me all the time?

87
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,720
Jinzhao gave me this task.

88
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,239
I cannot fail him.

89
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,232
Maiming.

90
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:19,896
Zhaoyan.

91
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,399
The curse acted up today.
You had to suffer with me.

92
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:29,304
It's alright.

93
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,160
Your days are numbered.

94
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,399
Aren't you looking to lift the curse?

95
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,480
You won't change your mind,
and neither will I.

96
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,504
Zhaoyan.

97
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:51,992
Let's talk later.

98
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,800
Zhaoyan?

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Zhaoyan?
You do call her quite affectionately.

100
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,536
Zhaoyan?

101
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,280
Senior, I am fine now.

102
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,399
I just need to rest for a bit.

103
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,679
Xiu is here, let her have a look.

104
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,839
Jinzhao, why can't we talk in the room

105
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,959
and have to go here?

106
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,760
There could be someone listening.

107
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,559
Bian Luohuan left this last night.

108
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,880
The same pattern as my hair cord.

109
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,720
I suspect he has something
to do with your background.

110
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,920
No wonder I feel that

111
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,440
he somewhat resembles
the master in my dreams.

112
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,559
Qi, how about we test him tonight?

113
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,879
You are physically weak
and just need to rest well.

114
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,008
Thank you, Miss Ming.

115
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,600
Take some rest then, Zhaoyan.

116
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,840
Thank you, Senior.

117
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,600
Xiu, it seemed you had more to say.

118
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,920
Luo Zhaoyan's vitality is
continuously diminishing,

119
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,959
like being devoured by something.

120
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,319
Rather than a chronic disease,
it's more like a curse.

121
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,920
Is the early demise of the Luo family's
twins related to a curse?

122
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,759
When I cast the spell on her,

123
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,839
I noticed you transferred
your energy to her again.

124
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,759
Uncle, do not forget

125
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,120
that you almost died
for her 20 years ago.

126
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,399
I've spent my centennial energy
on her and her brother.

127
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,920
I don't want to let her just die.

128
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:09,999
Is that all?

129
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,480
A thousand-year-old wolf demon
who claims to be without desires.

130
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,199
Why do you care so much
about Luo Zhaoyan?

131
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,519
A thousand years of having no desires
is exactly why one seeks fun.

132
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,360
This is your affair, not mine.

133
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,488
I'm just reminding you.

134
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,639
Don't get injured and
make my master worry.

135
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,639
You grew up with Hanjiang.

136
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,800
Why do you only talk about the master?

137
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,079
Ming Xiu, you came.

138
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,519
Senior Xian Qing, is Zhaoyan alright?

139
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,600
Yes, he just needs to rest well.

140
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:55,288
The thing you asked for.

141
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,399
Thank you.

142
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,424
What is this?

143
00:12:58,424 --> 00:13:00,720
Secret. Let's go.
We can switch shifts now.

144
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,064
See you.

145
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,040
Don't forget what I told you.

146
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,079
If anything happens, remember to use…

147
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:14,199
Mindlink.

148
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:16,999
Are you hungry? Want some egg noodles?

149
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,608
Go.

150
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:28,632
(Fengyan Inn)

151
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:39,040
Miss Yue, would you like to play?

152
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,240
Sure.

153
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,439
Your style of play is indeed unique.

154
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:34,079
Physician Bian,
did you leave this at the Luo's?

155
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,896
It's not mine.

156
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,720
You're lying.

157
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:45,319
Jinzhao said
he saw this straw-woven fish

158
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,839
falling from you.

159
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,040
Then why did you ask?

160
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,720
Because you resemble someone
I know from my dreams.

161
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,480
There's someone in my dreams
whose face I can't see.

162
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,519
He wears the same style
of clothing as yours.

163
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,759
But in my dreams, he's very good to me.

164
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,600
He teaches me swordsmanship and wisdom.

165
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,839
So I wonder if he could be my master.

166
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:34,480
Everyone has dreams.

167
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:37,800
If everyone took their dreams
as real like you,

168
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,759
it'd be in total disarray.

169
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:43,519
No. I'm certain I have a master.

170
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,439
This was given to me by my master.

171
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:49,439
It's woven just like
your straw-woven fish.

172
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,120
Is your master important to you?

173
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,024
The master in my dream

174
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:21,112
is very warm and kind.

175
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,720
He must be very important.

176
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,759
And more importantly,
as long as I find my master,

177
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,879
Jinzhao and I will be able to resolve…

178
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,600
Resolve…

179
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,480
Have you thought about this?

180
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,879
If your master comes looking for you,

181
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,360
will you go with him?

182
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:59,672
♪I'm destined
to brave all dangers for you♪

183
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:08,088

185
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,040
I'm hungry. Why isn't Jinzhao here yet?

186
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:27,360
It seems Yue is really good to you.

187
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,160
Good? Jinzhao is a real penny-pincher.

188
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,759
He always nags me for
spending too much money.

189
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,360
And he always calls me
a gluttonous fish.

190
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,759
Every time I have egg noodles,

191
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:44,319
he always snatches my eggs.

192
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:53,519
Jinzhao, why are you standing here?

193
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,199
Qi, let's go out to eat.

194
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,959
I haven't finished yet.

195
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,432
Physician Bian, tell me.

196
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:15,800
Where did you get this straw-woven fish?

197
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,720
Everyone in my hometown can make it.

198
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,160
The pattern is all the same.

199
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:36,439
Jinzhao.

200
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,960
Jinzhao, are you angry?

201
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,639
I was just joking.
There are a lot of "buts".

202
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:02,776
But what?

203
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,080
But Jinzhao is very smart.

204
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,800
He can solve all problems.

205
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,080
Jinzhao is very brave.

206
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,680
No matter what danger arises,

207
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,200
he is always the first to protect me.

208
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,040
Although Jinzhao is very stingy,

209
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,840
as long as he has one copper coin,

210
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,359
he will buy me egg noodles
and take me to see the flower sea

211
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,160
and the glowing butterflies.

212
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:42,719
Jinzhao, don't be angry, okay?

213
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:45,960
I'm not angry. Why should I?

214
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,320
You're lying. You are angry.

215
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,879
Well, I am not angry now.

216
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:02,040
How did your questioning go?

217
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,216
What?

218
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,280
Is Bian Luohuan your master or not?

219
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:14,280
I think he isn't.

220
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,560
You heard it too.

221
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,519
That straw-woven fish is common
in his hometown.

222
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,639
I should have asked him myself.

223
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,440
The straw-woven fish
doesn't prove anything.

224
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,544

What happened?

271
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,639
Jinzhao just asked me

272
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:19,280
if I'll go with the master in my dreams

273
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:21,239

How did you answer?

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,160
I don't know.

276
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,800
I've never thought about that.

277
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:37,560
Why would Jinzhao ask
such a strange question?

278
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:40,920
People become insecure

279
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,200

280
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,879

283
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:13,800

284
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,608
Really?

285
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,976
Yeah.

286
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:22,359
Bark and I'll give you
the spiciest chicken leg.

287
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,719
Why would a dog meow like a cat?

288
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,080
- Mother.
- Mother.

289
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,080
- Mother.
- Mother.

290
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,160
You are cruel, Xiu.

291
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,639
You know I hate spicy food.

292
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:48,800
Human younglings are such nuisances.

293
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:54,320
Right, humans can never be
as interesting as your Zhaoyan.

294
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:56,088
That's for sure.

00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,312
Morning.

00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,960
Zhaoyan, did you rest well last night?

300
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,599
He must do.

301
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,840
There was a watchdog last night

302
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,599
guarding at Master Luo's door.

303
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,719
Senior Xian Qing, where did you go
last night? You didn't come back.

304
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,968
Sorry, Senior.

305
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,320
You are always so courteous.

306
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,632
Alright, let's go.

307
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,696
Stop!

308
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,280
You think you can leave so easily?

309
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,800
How dare you lot kidnap Didact?

310
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,399
Release him now,

311
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,320
and I'll spare you three savages.

312
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,800
There are seven of them.

313
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,440
You seven savages.

314
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,680
My lord, Didact is among them too.

315
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,960
Didact as well.

316
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:30,999
Shut up.

317
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,800
We do have a dog here though.

318
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,759
Don't be naughty, Xiu.

319
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:38,359
Disappear, scram.

320
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,440
Didact, we are here to rescue you.

321
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,280
They call you Didact. Do you still
deny your ties with the Qiyuan Sect?

322
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,119
You lied. You are a bad person
from the Qiyuan Sect.

323
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,359
Miss Yue, can one really
tell good from bad?

324
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:01,879
You brat, that's dangerous.

325
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,399
Put your sword down.

326
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:05,999
If you release him, I might spare you.

327
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:09,479
Otherwise, I'll show you
you are playing with fire.

328
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,560
And asking for your death.

329
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,800
And asking for your death!

330
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,519
I told you to disappear.

331
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,239
Right.

332
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,479
Your death, you mean!

333
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,239
Why have you captured so many people?

334
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:23,239
Do you expect these
disciples to save you?

335
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,999
Physician Bian, why are you silent?

336
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,639
Is there something on your mind?

337
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:34,280
Let me guess. Are you wondering

338
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,999
how come the poison
on us hasn't acted yet?

339
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,680
You sprinkled Mingxin Fragrance
on the flowers' pistils, right?

340
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,528
Look at this flower.

341
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Bian Luohuan was holding
this very flower.

342
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,879
Is there something suspicious?

343
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:57,759
I compared this flower's
pistil with others.

344
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,399
This one has clearly more pollens.

345
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,759
Bian Luohuan is skilled in medicine.

346
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:09,080
Did he sprinkle these pollens?

347
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:13,320
I think so. Moreover, there are
no mosquitoes in this Inn,

348
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,800
but he asked the manager
to light up the mugwort.

349
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,040
I'll send a message to Xiu

350
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,599
and have her find out
what kind of poison

351
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:25,639
is related to the mugwort.

352
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:27,280
I'll ask her bring the antidote.

353
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,680
We should notify the others too.

354
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,999
Mingxin Fragrance combined with mugwort

355
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,479
will affect the person within a day.

356
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:43,040
Once one tries to use power,
it will temporarily sap one's strength.

357
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,960
It seems I have underestimated you.

358
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,879
Alright, have you said enough?

359
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:54,080
Put your sword down.

360
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,719
This is the last warning.

361
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:57,560
If you don't release Didact now,

362
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
you won't go back alive.

363
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,208
Qi.

364
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,840
Retreat! Tactical retreat!

365
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,519
A disorderly mob.

366
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:31,040
They overrated themselves.

367
00:34:37,944 --> 00:34:41,432
Everyone, please leave our brother.

368
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,160
Qingfei, Xiaoyuan.

369
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,728
So you were waiting for them?

370
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,519
Luo's sudden illness yesterday
was also your doing.

371
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,080
It was to buy time.

372
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,999
Mingxin Fragrance
mixed with Yexiang Flower

373
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:11,160
can cause the sickly to fall ill.

374
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,879
Thank you for the lesson.

375
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,160
I'll remember this for Zhaoyan.

376
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,239
Release my third brother!

377
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:35,560
Xiaoyuan, don't forget your mission.

378
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,600
Understood.

379
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,160
(How can she be so strong
at such a young age?)

380
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:09,720
Careful!

381
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,840
Zhaoyan, are you protecting me?

382
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,199
Senior, now is not the time for chatter.

383
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,800
We will live or die together.

384
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,920
Showy trick!

385
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,080
Huan, let's go.

386
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,456
Qi.

387
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,919
So annoying!

388
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,896
Senior.

389
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,360
Don't be stubborn. You can't defeat her.

390
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,679
I must fight her anyway.

391
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,479
Zhaoyan, I am a demon.

392
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,040
Qi!

393
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:34,008
Go!

394
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:38,520
