25
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:31,595
Jinzhao.

26
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:33,435
You finally woke up.

27
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:35,074
Wait for me.

28
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:35,875
Stay here.

29
00:03:42,995 --> 00:03:43,475
Jinzhao.

30
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:46,995
I made noodles with eggs for you.

31
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:47,954
Have some.

32
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,035
Only when I grow up
can I become stronger

33
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:00,275
and protect those I want to protect.

34
00:04:01,435 --> 00:04:02,114
Jinzhao.

35
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:04,514
I want to protect you too.

36
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:28,314
How is it?

37
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:34,194
It's alright.

38
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:38,114
Just alright?

39
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:43,715
Actually,

40
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:46,635
you've grasped some essence of noodles

41
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:52,794
I've decided

42
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:55,515
to give our noodles a name.

43
00:04:58,314 --> 00:04:59,155
Let's call it

44
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:01,075
Yue's Egg Noodles.

45
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:01,915
Sound good?

46
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,434
Jinzhao.

47
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:06,994
You

48
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:09,674
are terrible at picking names,

49
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,114
just like the noodles you make.

50
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:15,955
It's been three years.

51
00:05:16,155 --> 00:05:16,994
In your noodles,

52
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:19,554
there are always just
two greens and an egg.

53
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:21,395
What?

54
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:23,155
Any problem with that?

55
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:25,554
Yes, I'm telling the absolute truth.

56
00:05:25,794 --> 00:05:27,075
You can't tell the absolute truth.

57
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:28,475
But only partial truth.

58
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:30,515
Brother.

59
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,475
Why are you here?

60
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:36,874
Brother.

61
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:38,874
Didn't you promise to
make me a grass dragonfly?

62
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:40,354
When will you do it?

63
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:42,794
(Why does it feel odd?)

64
00:05:43,354 --> 00:05:45,475
(Feels like I'm living
someone else's life.)

65
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:47,674
(But Qi feels so familiar.)

66
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:48,715
Brother?

67
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:51,794
Come.

68
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:52,674
Let me.

69
00:06:01,075 --> 00:06:03,554
Why do you always cling to my brother?

70
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:05,794
Children should have manners.

71
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:06,635
Call me sister.

72
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:09,075
No, I already have a sister.

73
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:10,194
Really?

74
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:11,715
If you call me sister,

75
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:13,715
I can make noodles for you.

76
00:06:14,715 --> 00:06:15,475
You are so annoying.

77
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:26,075
Luohuan, have you finished?

78
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:26,955
Almost.

79
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:30,234
Done.

80
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:35,354
Luohuan, is this a dragonfly?

81
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:37,434
You used to do it so well.

82
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:39,275
Why is it so ugly?

83
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:41,515
That's right.

84
00:06:42,155 --> 00:06:44,155
Your brother has never been good at

85
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:46,234
drawing or knitting straw.

86
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:47,275
That's not true.

87
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:55,595
I mean, I can draw.

88
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:57,354
But I don't knit so well.

89
00:06:57,754 --> 00:06:59,155
I made one though, didn't I?

90
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:00,955
You doubt it?

91
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,715
I'll get the ones he made before.

92
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:10,475
You're good at drawing?

93
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:12,434
Of course.

94
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:18,155
Let's go for a walk.

95
00:07:18,674 --> 00:07:18,994
Okay.

96
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:27,994
Why didn't he wait for me

97
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:28,994
like he used to?

98
00:07:54,395 --> 00:07:55,075
Everyone says

99
00:07:56,674 --> 00:07:58,554
that Yujie Hub is my home,

100
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:02,314
but this place seems so strange to me.

101
00:08:04,475 --> 00:08:05,754
I'm only familiar with you,

102
00:08:07,515 --> 00:08:08,155
Shifang,

103
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:10,194
Xian Qing,

104
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:13,874
Zhaoyan, and Ming Xiu.

105
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:24,234
Me too.

106
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:26,994
I don't know why.

107
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:29,035
After returning from Guixu,

108
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:33,115
I have a new understanding

109
00:08:33,235 --> 00:08:34,594
regarding myself being a weapon.

110
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:35,794
Everyone

111
00:08:35,794 --> 00:08:37,714
has things beyond their control.

112
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:40,674
I'm not the only one suffering.

113
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:43,314
If Zhu Yu loses control,

114
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:45,434
the entire realm will be
plunged into misery.

115
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,395
I think I'm doing the right thing

116
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,834
by stopping her.

117
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:32,155
Sit.

118
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:42,834
Let's clear things up first.

119
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:44,714
Firstly,

120
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:46,674
in the past three years,

121
00:09:47,314 --> 00:09:48,954
Hengdao Sect is an enemy to me.

122
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:51,194
If you want me to do something,

123
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:53,275
please clarify it first.

124
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:55,155
If I agree,

125
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:56,954
I can do it for you.

126
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:13,035
I know

127
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:15,515
you have deep connections
with the Zhengwu Alliance.

128
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:18,954
I want you to represent the Hengdao Sect

129
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:22,674
and propose a collaboration
with Zuo Guanren.

130
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:24,714
Together we fight against Zhu Yu.

131
00:10:27,635 --> 00:10:28,714
Zhu Yu is in the sky.

132
00:10:29,474 --> 00:10:30,635
What can Zuo Guanren do?

133
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:35,755
I have already given her

134
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:38,875
the fake Rehai key ring.

135
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:41,674
Zhu Yu has long coveted
the power of Rehai.

136
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:44,515
She will surely bring
the Yu Clan to the earth.

137
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:47,155
By then, Zhengwu Alliance
will restrain the Yu Clan,

138
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:49,515
while we unbind Mist Soul and Zhu Yu.

139
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:51,115
Will Zhu Yu buy it?

140
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:55,714
She does not know the key ring is fake.

141
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:57,915
When she tries to open Rehai,

142
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,755
as long as Luo Zhaoyan can secretly

143
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:01,714
use the real key ring

144
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:02,875
to help her,

145
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:07,235
she will absorb the power of Rehai

146
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,954
and provoke the Mist Soul

147
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,594
to initiate the spell for unbinding.

148
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:16,115
After Zhu Yu loses
the power of Mist Soul,

149
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:17,915
her transformation will continue

150
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:18,834
and put her in agony.

151
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,355
She will return to the Mist Soul

152
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:23,314
to suppress her transformation.

153
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:25,714
That's when she's at her weakest,

154
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,794
and the best time to kill her.

155
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:31,235
At that time,

156
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:34,554
we will bombard her in Yujie Hub

157
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:36,915
to try to injure her

158
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:38,794
and buy you time.

159
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:44,235
I mean no disrespect.

160
00:11:45,594 --> 00:11:47,194
But your attacks

161
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:49,635
couldn't leave a scratch on her.

162
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:50,954
Not necessarily.

163
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:54,515
If we hit the weakest spot on her scale,

164
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:56,755
there would be a miracle.

165
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:04,275
You've planned everything.

166
00:12:05,355 --> 00:12:06,755
If I can't persuade
the Zhengwu Alliance,

167
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:08,554
none of it could happen.

168
00:12:11,674 --> 00:12:13,714
There have been
occurrences of petrification

169
00:12:14,115 --> 00:12:15,875
all over the land.

170
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:18,995
According to Zhu Yu's route,

171
00:12:19,395 --> 00:12:20,155
I'll say

172
00:12:20,995 --> 00:12:23,674
that her next destination is Jing'an.

173
00:12:28,554 --> 00:12:29,395
Why didn't you say so?

174
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:36,314
I understand now.

175
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:38,834
You're only saying it now

176
00:12:39,515 --> 00:12:41,954
because you want the Zhengwu Alliance
to get a taste of Zhu Yu's power

177
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:43,954
and force them to cooperate with you.

178
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:46,635
Is it not possible to tell the people

179
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,314
to leave the city and seek refuge?

180
00:12:49,074 --> 00:12:50,115
Will it cost you your lives?

181
00:13:06,474 --> 00:13:07,275
How strange.

182
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:10,515
I always feel that

183
00:13:11,995 --> 00:13:13,794
we should be close to him.

184
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:16,115
Is it an illusion?

185
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:24,915
It must be.

186
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:26,915
Qi.

187
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:28,474
Qi?

188
00:13:30,355 --> 00:13:31,995
Jinzhao, what is it?

189
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:33,434
We are setting off for Jing'an.

190
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:34,515
I'll explain it later.

191
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:36,115
Hurry and call the others.

192
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:36,714
Quick.

193
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:46,194
For the Hengdao Sect,

194
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:47,794
life is something that can be measured.

195
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:50,275
The lives of millions of people

196
00:13:50,714 --> 00:13:52,235
are insignificant compared
to the lives of all

197
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:53,074
in the Six Realms.

198
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:55,035
Let alone it's just

199
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,474
the lives of the civilians
in Jing'an City.

200
00:13:57,674 --> 00:13:59,355
They watch the world from above.

201
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:01,434
They must feel like god.

202
00:14:03,074 --> 00:14:05,875
They don't take people seriously at all.

203
00:14:06,915 --> 00:14:07,875
Not just the Hengdao Sect,

204
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:11,035
nor does Zhu Yu.

205
00:14:12,915 --> 00:14:13,434
Exactly.

206
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,674
No one should be given up.

207
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:19,635
Every life deserves respect.

208
00:14:21,074 --> 00:14:21,674
Qi is right.

209
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:24,594
Even the smallest life is unique,

210
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:26,194
and has the right to live.

211
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:29,594
Once we arrive in Jing'an,

212
00:14:29,794 --> 00:14:31,875
we must ask the Zhengwu Alliance
to convince the residents

213
00:14:32,074 --> 00:14:33,314
to flee as far away as possible.

214
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:35,594
Miss Ming,

215
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:38,515
why don't you and Qi

216
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:40,474
go see how far Jing'an is from here?

217
00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:57,194
You deliberately sent them away.

218
00:14:57,594 --> 00:14:59,194
Is there something you
want to discuss with me?

219
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:01,474
I suspect that Ying Xuwei

220
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:03,275
kept the method to undo the bindings

221
00:15:03,395 --> 00:15:04,755
from me.

222
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:06,635
Why would he?

223
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:09,474
They say opening Rehai

224
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:10,875
would free the Mist Soul.

225
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:12,194
But on that day,

226
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:16,035
Zhu Yu will lead
the Yu clan to the earth,

227
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:18,115
far away from the Mist Soul.

228
00:15:18,954 --> 00:15:20,635
How can we be sure
the Mist Soul will be freed

229
00:15:21,115 --> 00:15:22,915
just by absorbing the power of Rehai?

230
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:27,794
Perhaps he kept it from you

231
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:30,395
because he thought
you couldn't accept it.

232
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:32,115
So he avoided talking about it.

233
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,594
There's only one thing I can't accept.

234
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,594
That is to harm those I care about.

235
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:43,275
Look, the dark clouds over there.

236
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:50,155
It's Zhu Yu.

237
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:55,800
There's no time.

238
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:56,954
We must hurry down.

239
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:27,794
Slow down.

240
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:29,635
Are you okay?

241
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:30,714
Over here.

242
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:36,714
Miss Ming.

243
00:16:40,474 --> 00:16:40,954
What's wrong?

244
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,074
His leg.

245
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:42,954
Let me do it.

246
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:45,434
It's fine.

247
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:48,674
It'll be over soon.

248
00:17:24,915 --> 00:17:25,194
Come.

249
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:25,555
here.

250
00:17:26,075 --> 00:17:26,474
Here.

251
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,395
Have some water.

252
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:33,315
Thank you.

253
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:39,395
You haven't rested for a long time.

254
00:17:39,954 --> 00:17:40,595
Go rest.

255
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:42,514
I'm fine.

256
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:46,994
Yue and Miss Yue are having it harder

257
00:17:47,355 --> 00:17:48,795
in the Jing'an City.

258
00:18:08,034 --> 00:18:09,915
Jinzhao, I can absorb the Qiyuan Orb.

259
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:11,355
I want to save them.

260
00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:14,674
I'll help you.

261
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:16,514
Together.

Did Jinzhao and Yue succeed?

283
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:17,194
Let's take the people back to Jing'an

284
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:19,994
and then meet Mr. Yue and Miss Yue.

285
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:41,434
Qi.

286
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:43,595
Yue, are you okay?

287
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:47,555
Jinzhao.

288
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:49,714
I'll stay here.

289
00:20:50,355 --> 00:20:51,674
You guys go to the Zhengwu Alliance.

290
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:55,714
Okay.

291
00:20:58,234 --> 00:20:58,754
Miss Yue.

292
00:20:59,714 --> 00:21:00,696
Let's go together.

293
00:21:05,455 --> 00:21:07,951
(Zhengwu Alliance)

294
00:21:14,395 --> 00:21:14,795
Leader.

295
00:21:15,355 --> 00:21:15,992
What is it?

296
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:18,155
Quite a few members in the alliance

297
00:21:18,355 --> 00:21:19,555
also wear Qiyuan Orbs.

298
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:34,635
Lingyun.

299
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:39,274
Leader.

300
00:21:39,355 --> 00:21:40,568
- In the alliance...
- Mr. Zuo.

301
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:42,075
Mr. Zuo.

302
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:45,395
Mr. Yue.

303
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:47,635
Jing'an City has suffered
a great calamity.

304
00:21:48,595 --> 00:21:50,194
I must deal with it first.

305
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:52,875
You can do as you wish.

306
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:53,595
Come.

307
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,155
To the Jiqiao Hall.

308
00:21:59,155 --> 00:21:59,595
Okay.

309
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,075
Why are there victims of
the Qiyuan Orbs in the alliance?

310
00:22:06,635 --> 00:22:07,355
Find it out.

311
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:08,034
Yes.

312
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:12,994
In more than two hundred years,

313
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:15,234
Rehai, which should've moved
in a defined trajectory,

314
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,155
was bound to my family by Maiming.

315
00:22:17,994 --> 00:22:19,674
Now, the Bloodbinding has been lifted.

316
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:21,754
Naturally, it returns to its course.

317
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:28,075
This is a map of the Luo family.

318
00:22:28,075 --> 00:22:28,595
Look.

319
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:35,674
If we connect these places.

320
00:22:37,434 --> 00:22:38,875
The moving trajectory of Rehai.

321
00:22:41,034 --> 00:22:42,315
Rehai is the force of life.

322
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:44,234
Wherever it's been,

323
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:45,034
there'll form an oasis

324
00:22:45,274 --> 00:22:46,355
over a long period.

325
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:49,395
Even today, in places
like Zangfeng Plains,

326
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,514
one can still see traces
of its former lushness.

327
00:22:53,595 --> 00:22:54,714
The Yu Clan lived underwater.

328
00:22:55,514 --> 00:22:57,155
They are not suited
to act in arid places.

329
00:22:57,714 --> 00:22:58,795
Zhu Yu certainly won't

330
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,315
absorb Rehai in the desert.

331
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:02,355
A few days ago,

332
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:04,440
Rehai began to move
from my family's domain.

333
00:23:05,155 --> 00:23:07,595
A few days ago,
Zhu Yu obtained the key ring.

334
00:23:08,034 --> 00:23:08,315
Then...

335
00:23:13,795 --> 00:23:16,355
If Zhu Yu is to absorb
the power of Rehai,

336
00:23:17,034 --> 00:23:18,474
the next suitable location would be

337
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:19,555
the Zangfeng Plains.

338
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:22,714
The premise is

339
00:23:23,714 --> 00:23:25,635
they already know
the trajectory of Rehai.

340
00:23:28,514 --> 00:23:30,234
Perhaps Maiming has
already informed Zhu Yu.

341
00:23:31,514 --> 00:23:33,315
When Maiming lifted
the Bloodbinding of Rehai,

342
00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:35,315
both Leader Ge and
Shuo Xuan were present.

343
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,115
So they've been in touch for a while.

344
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:39,115
And Ying Xuwei not only knows

345
00:23:39,115 --> 00:23:40,754
I have the real key ring,

346
00:23:41,115 --> 00:23:42,555
he's also prepared
a fake one in advance.

347
00:23:43,994 --> 00:23:44,875
Could the Hengdao Sect

348
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,155
have already joined hands with Maiming

349
00:23:46,315 --> 00:23:47,234
to scheme against Zhu Yu.

350
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:51,514
Exactly.

351
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:53,555
If that's the case,

352
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:55,635
a lot of things can be explained.

353
00:23:56,555 --> 00:23:58,674
They handed the fake key ring to Zhu Yu

354
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,674
to get her and the Yu clan
down to the earth.

355
00:24:03,034 --> 00:24:05,555
Then the Zhengwu Alliance
would stall the Yu Clan

356
00:24:06,115 --> 00:24:07,555
while unbinding the Mist Soul

357
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:09,194
to weaken Zhu Yu.

358
00:24:09,994 --> 00:24:11,595
After that, the Hengdao Sect

359
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:13,754
would confront the remaining Yu Clan.

360
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:16,474
Jinzhao or Yue

361
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:17,994
would deliver the final blow.

362
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:22,915
Now the biggest issue is

363
00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:24,954
how to deliver the unbinding

364
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:26,714
to the Mist Soul inside Kun.

365
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:30,034
Jinzhao and I

366
00:24:30,355 --> 00:24:31,595
have already discussed this matter.

367
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:33,514
The Hengdao Sect

368
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,514
may achieve their goal
through our sacrifice.

369
00:24:36,395 --> 00:24:36,915
So, Zhaoyan,

370
00:24:37,714 --> 00:24:38,315
be careful,

371
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:39,635
no matter what.

372
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:40,194
Okay.

373
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:24,835
Because of Zhu Yu,

374
00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:26,795
Jing'an became like this.

375
00:25:35,155 --> 00:25:36,155
Wake up.

376
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:45,994
Dear.

377
00:25:48,194 --> 00:25:48,915
Father.

378
00:25:50,514 --> 00:25:51,034
Father.

379
00:25:53,714 --> 00:25:54,194
Father.

380
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:01,155
Wake up, dear.

381
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:06,635
Mrs. Ji.

382
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:08,474
Mr. Ji.

383
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:15,234
Mrs. Ji.

384
00:26:16,915 --> 00:26:17,954
Miss.

385
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:22,915
I never thought

386
00:26:24,754 --> 00:26:26,474
that the last words I said to him

387
00:26:27,355 --> 00:26:28,635
was scolding him

388
00:26:30,434 --> 00:26:32,714
for buying such expensive
things for the child.

389
00:26:40,075 --> 00:26:41,395
Calm down, Mrs.

390
00:26:42,395 --> 00:26:44,274
Your child is very unstable now.

391
00:26:52,714 --> 00:26:54,155
They are all such good people.

392
00:26:55,635 --> 00:26:56,635
It's all my fault.

393
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:58,754
If I had come earlier,

394
00:26:59,115 --> 00:27:00,315
Mr. Ji wouldn't...

395
00:27:00,315 --> 00:27:01,155
This is not your fault.

396
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:03,514
Moreover,

397
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:06,194
you've already done your best.

398
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:09,355
Mrs. Ji.

399
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:11,194
Are you better now?

400
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:15,395
Thank you.

401
00:27:17,155 --> 00:27:18,155
If it weren't for you,

402
00:27:19,315 --> 00:27:20,555
I fear this child...

403
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:22,274
Don't say that, Mrs. Ji.

404
00:27:22,915 --> 00:27:24,674
The child will grow up safe and sound

405
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:25,835
and live a long life.

406
00:27:29,034 --> 00:27:29,635
Mrs. Ji.

407
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:31,115
Why don't you come with us?

408
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:32,555
We will take care of you.

409
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:38,595
We must keep the family business going.

410
00:27:40,555 --> 00:27:42,474
Even if God does not want us to live,

411
00:27:44,674 --> 00:27:48,514
we will fight to survive no matter what

412
00:27:50,915 --> 00:27:52,395
and carry on

413
00:27:53,754 --> 00:27:54,994
his father's legacy.

414
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:13,234
Zhu Yu, do you see?

415
00:28:13,795 --> 00:28:16,034
You see them as insignificant,

416
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:20,474
but even when their homes are destroyed
and loved ones gone,

417
00:28:21,115 --> 00:28:22,835
they still strive to live.

418
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:43,194
Grandpa.

419
00:28:44,674 --> 00:28:45,555
Ming Xiu.

420
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:48,315
She is so sad.

421
00:28:50,835 --> 00:28:51,555
After crying,

422
00:28:52,075 --> 00:28:53,474
one can have the strength to carry on.

423
00:28:54,395 --> 00:28:56,754
Ming Xiu, let's help them.

424
00:28:58,714 --> 00:29:00,034
So many are suffering.

425
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:02,795
How do we help them all?

426
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:05,274
Grandpa.

427
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:09,795
Some mountains are hard to climb

428
00:29:11,194 --> 00:29:12,674
because the person you value

429
00:29:12,674 --> 00:29:13,595
is your mountain.

430
00:29:15,194 --> 00:29:16,194
But for that person,

431
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,234
even if we get injured all over,

432
00:29:20,714 --> 00:29:21,555
we must

433
00:29:22,155 --> 00:29:23,194
climb over that mountain.

434
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,234
Ming Xiu.

435
00:29:29,075 --> 00:29:29,754
I understand.

436
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,595
Let's return to the Zhengwu Alliance.

437
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,555
I have many things to do.

438
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:42,274
Okay.

439
00:29:52,994 --> 00:29:54,595
The Cold Marrow Garrison
once prophesied,

440
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:56,474
among the six of you,

441
00:29:56,954 --> 00:29:59,034
two will soon pass away.

442
00:30:01,514 --> 00:30:01,954
Remember.

443
00:30:03,474 --> 00:30:04,635
In the near future,

444
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:06,674
your life

445
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:08,754
will come to an end.

446
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:14,234
Without me around,

447
00:30:16,155 --> 00:30:17,395
will Qi be okay?

448
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:33,395
I never imagined

449
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:35,635
the people of Jing'an City

450
00:30:36,474 --> 00:30:38,155
would suffer such heavy casualties.

451
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:40,954
Such a massive beast.

452
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:42,875
In her eyes,

453
00:30:43,714 --> 00:30:44,875
those who lost their lives

454
00:30:46,034 --> 00:30:47,714
must be no different from ants.

455
00:30:48,595 --> 00:30:49,034
Leader.

456
00:30:49,635 --> 00:30:50,635
No matter what she is

457
00:30:50,954 --> 00:30:51,954
or how she sees us,

458
00:30:52,595 --> 00:30:53,754
she has harmed my kin,

459
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,954
and we cannot just sit by
and await death.

460
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:01,714
Shifang.

461
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:04,434
According to what you just said,

462
00:31:05,034 --> 00:31:07,034
the Hengdao Sect manipulates Qiyuan Sect

463
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:09,234
in order to restrain Kun.

464
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:15,474
Regardless of whether
the Hengdao Sect is evil,

465
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:17,474
they hardly stand a chance

466
00:31:18,115 --> 00:31:20,194
against Kun.

467
00:31:21,034 --> 00:31:21,514
Leader.

468
00:31:27,915 --> 00:31:28,355
Leader.

469
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:30,075
Chen Qianjun.

470
00:31:31,194 --> 00:31:32,514
Members of the alliance said

471
00:31:33,115 --> 00:31:34,795
it was you who spread the Qiyuan Orbs.

472
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:37,234
Yes.

473
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,194
Why did you harm your own brothers?

474
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,915
Are you from the Qiyuan Sect too?

475
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:44,994
I am not.

476
00:31:47,075 --> 00:31:47,754
Earlier,

477
00:31:49,754 --> 00:31:50,395
Xu and I

478
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,714
lost in a contest to
Yue Jinzhao and Ju Shifang.

479
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:53,944
I couldn't accept it

480
00:31:54,194 --> 00:31:55,315
and wanted to regain face.

481
00:31:56,674 --> 00:31:58,115
Later, when attacking Langyin Pavilion,

482
00:31:58,674 --> 00:31:59,795
I took some orbs.

483
00:32:00,395 --> 00:32:01,234
When wearing the orb,

484
00:32:01,915 --> 00:32:03,754
I felt that my training
progressed faster.

485
00:32:04,635 --> 00:32:05,155
So,

486
00:32:06,754 --> 00:32:08,194
I shared the orbs with the brothers.

487
00:32:08,434 --> 00:32:08,954
You fool!

488
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:18,234
Jinzhao.

489
00:32:19,115 --> 00:32:19,954
You're waiting for us?

490
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:22,835
I thought you should be back soon.

491
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:26,315
I'll head back first.

492
00:32:34,315 --> 00:32:34,954
What's wrong, Qi?

493
00:32:35,994 --> 00:32:36,635
Jinzhao.

494
00:32:37,674 --> 00:32:38,875
Mr. Ji died.

495
00:32:44,514 --> 00:32:46,034
The common folk are innocent.

496
00:32:47,075 --> 00:32:48,915
We must do something.

497
00:32:53,994 --> 00:32:54,434
Definitely.

498
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,555
When we attacked Qiyuan Sect,

499
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:06,994
I only then realized that it was bad.

500
00:33:07,474 --> 00:33:08,355
I wanted to take it off,

501
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:10,355
but it had grown into the flesh.

502
00:33:11,395 --> 00:33:12,514
I have also asked doctors.

503
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:14,075
But the doctors all say

504
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:15,595
that it's now connected to the heart

505
00:33:16,115 --> 00:33:16,915
and can't be removed.

506
00:33:22,155 --> 00:33:23,034
Did you two

507
00:33:23,915 --> 00:33:25,355
also wear the Qiyuan Orbs?

508
00:33:27,315 --> 00:33:28,714
Fools.

509
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:30,875
Fine.

510
00:33:31,714 --> 00:33:32,555
Fine.

511
00:33:33,115 --> 00:33:33,635
Leader.

512
00:33:34,355 --> 00:33:35,754
Just now, they were not in Jing'an

513
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:36,835
and avoided this calamity.

514
00:33:37,635 --> 00:33:38,355
Besides them,

515
00:33:38,635 --> 00:33:40,034
some people wearing the orbs

516
00:33:40,034 --> 00:33:41,155
are out on missions.

517
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:43,714
Chen Qianjun is guilty.

518
00:33:44,115 --> 00:33:44,835
But first,

519
00:33:44,835 --> 00:33:46,835
we must find a way to
remove the orbs and save them.

520
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:49,315
Let me try.

521
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:55,194
Miss Yue.

522
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:56,355
Leader.

523
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:58,674
When attacking
Qiyuan Sect's headquarters,

524
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:00,795
Yue had also saved their disciples.

525
00:34:01,194 --> 00:34:02,474
Just now, she saved many.

526
00:34:02,714 --> 00:34:03,795
Let her have a try.

527
00:34:50,474 --> 00:34:50,994
Miss Yue.

528
00:34:52,554 --> 00:34:55,114
If the orb has been fused
with the body for a long time,

529
00:34:55,514 --> 00:34:57,915
forcibly removing it will
only cost one's life.

530
00:35:06,915 --> 00:35:07,634
Regardless,

531
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,755
thank you for saving my two brothers

532
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:12,395
and lessening my sins.

533
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:15,034
Sorry for my offense earlier.

534
00:35:15,235 --> 00:35:16,034
I apologize.

535
00:35:16,795 --> 00:35:17,634
It's alright.

536
00:35:20,715 --> 00:35:21,275
Mr. Zuo.

537
00:35:22,755 --> 00:35:24,715
I represent the Hengdao Sect
to negotiate with you,

538
00:35:25,315 --> 00:35:27,034
hoping to join forces against Zhu Yu.

539
00:35:29,634 --> 00:35:31,034
You represent the Hengdao Sect?

540
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:33,034
What is your relationship with them?

541
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:37,275
I am

542
00:35:39,434 --> 00:35:40,875
one of the leaders of the Hengdao Sect.
