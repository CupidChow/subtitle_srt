21
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,959
Jinzhao told me

22
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,120
there should be no secrets
between friends.

23
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,240
Since we are friends now,

24
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,920
I want to tell you something.

25
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,239
Okay, please.

26
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,359
I found

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,376
Physician Bian

28
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,599
so approachable

29
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,320
the first time I saw him.

30
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,919
I think he resembles Jinzhao.

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,999
Physician Bian resembles Yue?

32
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes,

33
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,439
but not exactly.

34
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,696
Just like...

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,800
Just like the difference
between a vegetable bun and a meat bun.

36
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,079
Although they are all buns,

37
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,640
the fillings are different.

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,680
Yue is unruly and perceptive,

39
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,759
while Physician Bian...

40
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,759
Anyway, in my opinion,

41
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,280
they are completely different.

42
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,960
Maybe you've seen

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,599
Physician Bian before.

44
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,479
I don't think so.

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,519
Miss Yue.

46
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:15,256
Have you ever heard of Rehai before?

47
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,760
(The matter of Rehai is confidential.)

48
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,320
(Don't tell anyone.)

49
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,720
Then, Miss Yue,

50
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,119
is there anything special about you?

51
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,919
I'm specially smart and clever.

52
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,400
Anything else?

53
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,879
No, then.

54
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,400
Trust among friends.

55
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:52,720
This is the last time.

56
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,080
But I have one more favor to ask.

57
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,760
Can you not tell anyone

58
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,839
that I asked you questions?

59
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,680
Why?

60
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,040
This matters to me.

61
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,759
Please keep it a secret

62
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,959
and do not tell anyone.

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,800
Alright, deal.

64
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,399
Zhaoyan, you've been good to us.

65
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:12,479
I won't tell Jinzhao if he doesn't ask.

66
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,440
But if Yue asks,

67
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,080
do not tell him, either.

68
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:19,759
Is that okay?

69
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
No way.

70
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,720
If Jinzhao asks me,

71
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,199
I would definitely tell.

72
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,640
Well...

73
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,559
Sorry.

74
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,199
I got held up

75
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,280
by the villagers.

76
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
Is the wounded one okay?

77
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,720
Yes.

78
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:46,679
Zhaoyan, what's wrong with you?

79
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,119
Let me check.

80
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,080
Don't bother, Physician Bian.

81
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,119
Just an old illness.

82
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,119
Don't you trust my medical skills?

83
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,080
Zhaoyan.

84
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,360
You should let
Physician Bian check on you.

85
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,080
Then please, Physician Bian.

86
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,800
You seem to be in a condition

87
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,880
I've never seen before.

88
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,199
It's okay.

89
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,080
I just need a rest.

90
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:22,959
Thank you.

91
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,959
I'm fine.

92
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,919
(There are no physical abnormalities,)

93
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,360
(yet the life force
is flowing out of the body.)

94
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,479
(Is it the curse)

95
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,520
(of the Twilight Luo family's
twins dying young?)

96
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,640
No more nagging.

97
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,160
I'm telling you. You all heard it.

98
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
Physician Bian said

99
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,600
everything will all be clear

100
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,800
when these patients wake up.

101
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,919
Don't be timid all the time.

102
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,000
Even if you don't trust him,

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,240
you have to trust me, right?

104
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,160
Yes.

105
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,319
With me here,

106
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,360
nothing to worry about.

107
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,319
Everything's ready. We just need
to wait for the fish to bite.

108
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,880
Jinzhao, will this really work?

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,759
Of course.

110
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,000
The wounded man

111
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,240
attracted their attention.

112
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
To cover up the crime,

113
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,639
they'll take action.

114
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:17,920
Miss Ming.

115
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,200
Senior Xian Qing.

116
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:20,920
Did you take a stroll?

117
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,239
Yes.

118
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,559
I'm getting old. Taking a stroll
could help the digestion.

119
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,519
We've already found a place to stay.

120
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,959
Let's pick up Luo and Qi.

121
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,399
Look,

122
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,280
I drew a map of the whole village.

123
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,239
What's this?

124
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,920
This triangle

125
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,679
represents a house.

126
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,679
This circle represents a cave.

127
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,000
So where are we now?

128
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,799
This is our current location.

129
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,440
This is Physician Bian's cottage, right?

130
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Yes, correct.

131
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,639
Shifang, your map
is really easy to understand.

132
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,799
Okay, then

133
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,040
we'll hide near Bian Luohuan's house.

134
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,359
Wait until they take action,

135
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,760
and we can surround them.

136
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,160
Yue, I wouldn't recommend
catching them in the village.

137
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,880
It's dangerous.

138
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,880
I'm afraid it'd hurt villagers.

139
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,119
Then let's drive them to Linyang Road.

140
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,959
Luo, Shifang, and Senior Xian Qing,

141
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,280
you would be waiting there.

142
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:29,160
Qi, me, and Miss Ming,

143
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
we'll be guarding
near Bian Luohuan's house.

144
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,160
Okay.

145
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll stay to protect Physician Bian.

146
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,160
No way.

147
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,360
Well, I mean...

148
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,559
Are you sure?

149
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:45,880
Yes.

150
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,720
Jinzhao.

151
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,720
You don't want me

152
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,320
to stay and protect
Physician Bian, do you?

153
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,200
Not at all.

154
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,359
I just wonder if you can do it.

155
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,280
If I can't, can you?

156
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,079
Now that it's all set up,

157
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,799
let's go back and get some rest.

158
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,160
Okay.

159
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,720
Physician Bian,
did we know each other before?

160
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:00,119
Maybe.

161
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,920
Thinking of Qi is enough,

162
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,160
but why is this Bian Luohuan
getting into my head too?

163
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,280
It's quite weird.

164
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,184
Jinzhao, do you have water?

165
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,839
I'm in a medicated bath.

166
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,200
Close your eyes.

167
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,160
Then why didn't you shut the door?

168
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,480
Then why didn't you knock?

169
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,679
Don't open your eyes.

You look like a young lady.

187
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,096
Indeed.

188
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:53,519
You look exactly like those young ladies

189
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,280
I read in storybooks

190
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,800
when they are seen bathing.

191
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,280
When they are seen,

192
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,600
they are either outraged

193
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,480
or embarrassed.

194
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,959
Look at you, so embarrassed, right?

195
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:10,399
♪I've been looking for you♪

196
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,120
Jinzhao.

197
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,639
You got me wet.

198
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,008
I'm not playing with you anymore.

199
00:11:15,704 --> 00:11:17,176
♪Among the vast sea of people♪

200
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,388
♪I engrave your name♪

201
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:25,688
♪Believe me, you're the only one♪

202
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,360
Qi.

203
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,248
Would you

204
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,120
wipe someone else's head like this?

205
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,104
No.

206
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,879
Why?

207
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,839
Because Zhaoyan has a younger sister,

208
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,199
Shifang has Dou Bao,

209
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,160
and Ming Xiu has Xian Qing.

210
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,280
You're pathetic

211
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,959
to be alone. So there's only me.

212
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:02,600
I am not pathetic at all.

213
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:04,800
I still have myself.

214
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,360
What a young lady.

215
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,920
Shut up.

216
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,600
Here's the water. Drink it.

217
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,639
Nice.

218
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,759
Come on.

219
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,439
Qi, why do you love
drinking water so much?

220
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,280
Jinzhao, can you make
a straw-woven butterfly?

221
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,280
No.

222
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,720
Why do you ask?

223
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:39,439
In Physician Bian's cottage,

224
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,240
there are many beautiful
straw-woven butterflies.

225
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,759
I want one too.

226
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,120
No men would like things

227
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,680
that only girls would make.

228
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,959
Then I'll ask Physician Bian for one.

229
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Since when are you so close
to Physician Bian?

230
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,160
Didn't I tell you many times

231
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,199
not to talk to strangers?

232
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,319
I have been close to him all the time.

233
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:04,439
I think Physician Bian

234
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,560
feels very much like
what you made me feel.

235
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,439
So I find him approachable.

236
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,336
Are you alright, Jinzhao?

237
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:21,519
Nothing.

238
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,199
By the way,

239
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,120
when you were guarding
Physician Bian's house,

240
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,680
did you notice anything weird?

241
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:31,519
Do you mean Physician Bian or Zhaoyan?

242
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,319
Physician Bian.

243
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:34,600
What about Zhaoyan?

244
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,560
Yes.

245
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,280
What is it?

246
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:39,999
He apologized to me.

247
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,399
He said "we are friends now".

248
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:48,560
Then he is quite clever,

249
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,160
much better than his younger sister.

250
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,999
He also asked me if I knew about Rehai.

251
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,439
Rehai?

252
00:13:58,744 --> 00:14:00,472
(Rehai)

253
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,480
What did you answer?

254
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,839
You told me to keep it a secret,

255
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,560
so I said I didn't know.

256
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,984
However,

257
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,879
Zhaoyan also told me
to keep it a secret.

258
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,999
Zhaoyan asked you to keep it a secret.

259
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,480
Why did you tell me?

260
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,079
I promised him

261
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,680
I wouldn't tell you if you don't ask.

262
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:21,839
Since you've asked,

263
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,399
I can't lie to you.

264
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,959
Good.

265
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:26,999
Here, have some water.

266
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:37,800
Are you enjoying the beautiful scenery?

267
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:39,480
Senior.

268
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:42,560
Not really.

269
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,360
So you are concerned
about tonight's operation.

270
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,096
We have limited manpower.

271
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,079
If tonight's operation fails,

272
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,240
Physician Bian and that patient

273
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,439
might both be in danger.

274
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:03,519
Didn't you agree

275
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,360
on this plan?

276
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,759
For something you've decided,

277
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,800
if you hesitate halfway...

278
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,079
Zhaoyan,

279
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,120
this is what a hypocrite would do.

280
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:20,959
What you said

281
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,639
is very similar to
what one of my family said.

282
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:25,720
Perhaps

283
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:28,079
as he said,

284
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,999
I am a hypocrite.

285
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,800
It's been a long time since
I've seen someone so innocent.

286
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,240
You are funny and adorable.

287
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,360
A-Adorable?

288
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:46,680
Senior.

289
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:49,879
Adorable is not a word for me.

290
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,759
We must not lose

291
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,240
against Qiyuan Sect today.

292
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,560
Of course.

293
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:18,920
Let's go.

294
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,399
(Luo,)

295
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:42,999
(I'm going to need you)

296
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:44,759
(to wait with me tonight.)

297
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,920
(Miss Ming, Senior, and Shifang,)

298
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,920
(you guys ambush at Linyang Road.)

299
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,920
(After Luo and I lure them over,)

300
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,480
(you'd come out to fight.)

301
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,319
(Qi, you'd keep an eye on Bian Luohuan)

302
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,999
(and come to us if you get a chance.)

303
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,399
(If you encounter
a strong opponent on the way,)

304
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,800
(don't try to be brave.)

305
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:04,839
(Run if you can't win.)

306
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,280
We've been waiting for you.

307
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:16,759
Surround them.

308
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:20,920
It's a trap. Retreat.

309
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:22,879
Qi.

310
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,344
I'll protect this place.

311
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,680
(Why am I suddenly so sleepy?)

312
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,328
(Why can't I open my eyes?)

313
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,399
Jinzhao, stealing my eggs again.

314
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,440
Demon!

315
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:14,599
How dare you run wild here.

316
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:21,519
Miss Ming, no.

317
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,080
Mr. Ju, do you know this demon?

318
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,239
Why did you help her?

319
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,719
Shuo Xuan is a demon?

320
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,599
Keep running.

321
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,359
Where's Shifang?

322
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,560
Shifang has been captured by a demon.

323
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,200
I'll take a look.

324
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,840
Wait.

325
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:07,599
Shuo Xuan.

326
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,080
Are you

327
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,080
a good demon or a bad one?

328
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,440
Junk doesn't deserve to know.

329
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:15,759
I'm not junk.

330
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:18,999
I just don't want to fight you.

331
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:24,479
Shuo Xuan.

332
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:26,479
Do you want to kill me?

333
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
I don't need

334
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,160
to kill you myself.

335
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,999
D-Do you

336
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:36,759
really have something to do
with Qiyuan Sect?

337
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,920
Qiyuan Sect is just a small sect.

338
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,200
I really don't care.

339
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:43,440
You have been tricked
into harming others

340
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,080
by the Qiyuan Sect.

341
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,119
Just drop your weapon

342
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,239
and tell us who's behind it,

343
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,680
so you'd make amends.

344
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,080
Harming others?

345
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,759
How dare you
ruin the reputation of Qiyuan Sect!

346
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,080
Stubborn.

347
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,680
Bros, attack!

348
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,879
It's you.

349
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:21,840
Shuo Xuan.

350
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,239
If one day,

351
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,999
you and I become enemies,

352
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,639
I-I will definitely beat you

353
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:31,080
and lead you onto the right path.

354
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,200
You are such a dreamer.

355
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:39,440
How could you beat me

356
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,639
with those shoddy gadgets?

357
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:44,280
Do you deserve it?

358
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:45,639
One more thing,

359
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,840
what is the right path?

360
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:52,200
You and I are not of the same kind.

361
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,759
From now on,

362
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,119
stay away from me.

363
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:04,280
Shifang.

364
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,320
How are you doing? Are you okay?

365
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,280
I'm okay.

366
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,759
Shuo Xuan did not hurt me.

367
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,840
Shuo Xuan?

368
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,599
She's a demon?

369
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:21,879
She's already gone.

370
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,280
Last time,
she paid special attention to Qi.

371
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:27,560
It's her again.

372
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,879
Next time I see her,

373
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,359
I have to ask her.

374
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:32,719
Let's go find Luo.

375
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,759
Oh no. We've been exposed.

376
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,280
That person will kill us.

377
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:40,599
Let's just be honest.

378
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,119
Leave him alive.

379
00:22:58,479 --> 00:22:59,879
May Lord Ming bless us.

380
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,879
I am responsible for keeping
an eye on Qi and Yue Jinzhao,

381
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,040
not you.

382
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:34,280
Do you think I'm willing to do that?

383
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,639
You exposed yourself at Jincui Oasis,

384
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:41,040
which aroused Yue Jinzhao
to suspect you.

385
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,200
If you interfere again,

386
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:46,359
I won't show any mercy.

387
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:25,960
Why did I fall asleep?

388
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:30,759
Physician Bian.

389
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:32,320
Physician Bian.

390
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,399
Let me check.

391
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,840
Are you okay?

392
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:40,920
Good then.

393
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:42,680
What about him?

394
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:44,999
He'll wake up soon.

395
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,320
What about Jinzhao?

396
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,719
Why aren't they back yet?

397
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:55,960
Are they in some kind of danger?

398
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,160
As expected, he can't do it
without my protection.

399
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,599
What an idiot.

400
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:04,519
Pathetic.

401
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,239
Why is someone dead?

402
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,080
What happened?

403
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,639
Jinzhao, are you okay?

404
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,399
How could I get injured so easily?

405
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:15,999
Come on.

406
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,280
Zhuo.

407
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,200
Zhuo.

408
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,879
My son!

409
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:34,879
Shifang, you don't look so well.

410
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:35,999
Are you injured?

411
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,200
No.

412
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,800
I saw a lot of people dead.

413
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,999
I just wanted to catch them,

414
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:46,999
but I didn't expect
I would drive them to death.

415
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,840
I caused them to die.

416
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,960
Mr. Ju.

417
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,639
As the head of Zhengwu Alliance,

418
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,239
you should kill demons and evils.

419
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,280
Still afraid of these?

420
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:56,759
I'm not.

421
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,119
But...

422
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:00,999
They were all living beings.

423
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,999
It's you who caused them to die.

424
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,800
It's them. Definitely them.

425
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,960
Right, it must be them.

426
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:11,759
I knew it. It's them.

427
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,200
- It's them.
- It's them.

428
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:13,999
- It's them.
- It's them.

429
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:17,160
You wicked people!

430
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,359
They had it coming.

431
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:21,759
You dare to blame us?

432
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,280
Aren't you meant

433
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,080
to hurt us here?

434
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,639
- Exactly.
- They are here to hurt us.

435
00:26:29,144 --> 00:26:29,879
- It's you.
- It's you.

436
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,719
Sir, please hear me out.

437
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,040
We came here

438
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,719
because we knew this might
be the stronghold of Qiyuan Sect.

439
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,800
And the people who died

440
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,999
were the people of Qiyuan Sect.

441
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,560
So they deserve to die?

442
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:42,560
No, we were trying to lure them out

443
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:43,399
and capture them,

444
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:45,359
but unexpectedly,
they all killed themselves.

445
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,680
Perhaps we should
go check their houses together

446
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:48,920
to look for any clues.

447
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,599
Yue, there's no need to explain.

448
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,239
This is caused by me.

449
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,359
It's my fault I didn't stop them

450
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:56,479
from killing themselves.

451
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,479
Everyone,

452
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:59,320
I'm willing to bear all your grief

453
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:00,960
and anger.

454
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:04,200
You bear it?

455
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:06,200
Can you bring them back to life?

456
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,320
Yes, can you bring them back to life?

457
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:11,160
Can you bring them back to life?

458
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:13,639
- Right.
- He's a man of words.

459
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,560
Zhaoyan, no need
to talk to them anymore.

460
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:20,040
Everyone,

461
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:25,999
I suppose you are the heroes
who saved me.

462
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,960
Why are you out?

463
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:30,160
Are you okay?

464
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:32,119
I am much better now.

465
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,359
If you don't clarify the situation,

466
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,160
the heroes will be in danger.

467
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,960
Everyone, listen to me.

468
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:41,280
My name is Lang Mo.

469
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,719
I am a businessman who came
from Mangwan Village to Yinghui Fort.

470
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,239
People of Qiyuan Sect knocked me out

471
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:52,119
and then locked me up.

472
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,759
There were a lot of other people

473
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,479
locked up with me.

474
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
It's them.

475
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,399
Impossible.

476
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,759
Impossible.

477
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,432
I wonder what happened to them.

478
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,479
Heroes,

479
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,800
please go save them.

480
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,479
Are you telling the truth?

481
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:16,759
I'll bet my life on it.

482
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,680
It seems to be true.

483
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:22,800
It seems to be true.

484
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,840
Fine, so be it.

485
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,479
I'll let you take a look at Zhuo's room.

486
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,080
Let's go.

487
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:37,160
- Go, take a look.
- Let's take a look.

488
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,639
We can tell the truth then.

489
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,399
Just take a look.

490
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:41,560
Are you okay?

491
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,879
Lang Mo, I'll take you to the cottage.

492
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,759
I can go back myself.

493
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,759
Master Luo, you go ahead.

494
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:26,280
Oh my. There's a chamber.

495
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,440
Jinzhao.

496
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:47,759
Do you think there might
be a Qiyuan Orb here?

497
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,239
Xiu, what is this?

498
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,119
This is the Enchanting Herb.

499
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,719
It can be used
to refine enchanting drug.

500
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:21,759
I remember we found

501
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,719
this herb in the Fujin Hall.

502
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,239
It seems that Qiyuan Sect's
enchanting drug

503
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:28,119
is made from this herb.

504
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,960
Although the scent is weak,

505
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,719
Bian Luohuan's house

506
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,479
does have this scent.

507
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,399
You mean...

508
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:37,999
It won't leave the scent on someone

509
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,479
if he doesn't touch it.

510
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,680
And I've never heard

511
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,119
such herbs grow in the Western Regions.

512
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:48,440
Qi, was there anything wrong

513
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:49,680
with Bian Luohuan last night?

514
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,999
Last night,

515
00:30:56,999 --> 00:30:59,599
I fell asleep
in Physician Bian's cottage.

516
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,440
So you wouldn't know

517
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,440
what he did.

518
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:07,800
Do you think

519
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,879
Bian Luohuan deliberately
let Miss Yue fall asleep?

520
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:13,719
Little Yue, come up.

521
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:26,479
Little Yue had been in the cottage
for too long.

522
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,879
There're dozens of scents on her.

523
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:30,280
I can't tell the specific one.

524
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:33,920
Well,

525
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,320
maybe we think too much.

526
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,639
Maybe Little Yue was just too tired.

527
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,759
I don't think Physician Bian
is a bad person.

528
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:43,840
He even helped us save Lang Mo.

529
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,160
Those disciples said something
very interesting before they died.

530
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
"That person will kill us."

531
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,960
It means the one behind them

532
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,359
is in Luori Village right now.

533
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,879
And Bian Luohuan is really suspicious.

534
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:57,920
We can never be too careful.

535
00:31:58,599 --> 00:31:59,879
Just pretend we don't know anything

536
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,960
and observe.

537
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,639
Go get Physician Bian.

538
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,200
Now!

539
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:38,119
Are they still alive?

540
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,399
Let's get them out of here first.

541
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,320
Let's split up.

542
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,320
You carry them out.

543
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:44,759
Qi, me and Shifang,

544
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,160
we stay here to search.

545
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,280
There's a box here.

546
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,080
It looks quite special.

547
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:18,239
This is a gadget box.

548
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:19,200
I'll give it a try.

549
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:19,960
Watch out.

550
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,519
Step back.

551
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,119
Watch out.

552
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,800
Qi!

553
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:05,759
Qi.

554
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:06,320
Little Yue.

555
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:20,160
Jinzhao, let Physician Bian
check on Little Yue.

556
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,144
Qi.

557
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,639
Give her the antidote.

558
00:34:33,176 --> 00:34:34,606
It can suppress the poison for now.

559
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:40,080
Any more hesitation and she'll be dead.

560
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,879
Shifang.

561
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,999
Here.

562
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:48,920
Qi.

563
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,680
Physician Bian, how is she?

564
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:17,840
Her condition is stable for now.

565
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,440
What do you mean "for now"?

566
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,639
If it wasn't for you breaking in,

567
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,599
Qi wouldn't have passed out.

568
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,840
If something happens to her,

569
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,920
I will never let you off.

570
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:35,879
I want nothing to happen to her too.

571
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:44,320
Qi.

572
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,119
Qi.

573
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,680
I want some water.

574
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,719
You'd take a rest.

575
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,920
I'll take care of Qi.

576
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:57,800
T-Then we'll leave.

577
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,920
Qi.

578
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,840
Water.

579
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,479
Water.

580
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,679
Here, water.

581
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,759
Mr. Yue.

582
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,999
Is she really your sister?

583
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,360
You're not

584
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,519
acting like an elder brother.

585
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,999
These two seem to be in a pair.

586
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,759
(I am not acting like an elder brother?)

587
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,239
Why is Physician Bian so upset?

588
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,360
Physicians are kind.

589
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,479
Miss Yue is seriously injured.

590
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,759
As a physician, he could do nothing.

591
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,080
This kind of feeling

592
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:36,759
should be like us

593
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,040
watching the disciples commit suicide,

594
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,239
yet we could do nothing.

595
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,679
I don't think so.

596
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:52,759
Senior Xian Qing.

597
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,919
Why didn't I see you earlier?

598
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:57,479
I've put the box in the cottage.

599
00:37:57,759 --> 00:37:58,880
Do you want to see it?

600
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,400
Preoccupied with Miss Yue's injury,

601
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:02,479
we forgot about it.

602
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:03,959
Let's go together.

603
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,600
You go first
and I'll be right behind you.

604
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:07,919
Let's go.

605
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,919
Physician Bian, are you
worried about Little Yue's injuries?

606
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,679
As a physician,

607
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,159
I failed to detoxify Miss Yue.

608
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,919
I'm bound to get a little frustrated.

609
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,360
If those disciples hadn't died,

610
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,080
Zhaoyan could follow the clue,

611
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,800
find out who's behind this
and get the antidote.

612
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,439
This way, Little Yue
wouldn't have to suffer this.

613
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,040
Physician Bian, do you think so?

614
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,159
You seem to be implying something.
