(Ningzheng Hall)

22
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:13,359
Who's there?

23
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,159
Mr. Zuo.

24
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,759
I am Luo Zhaoyan.

25
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,519
We came abruptly

26
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,400
for something urgent.

27
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,568
Jinzhao, will this really work?

28
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:25,508
Rest assured.

29
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,029
It's definitely going to work.

30
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,028
Come on, repeat what I told you.

31
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:30,228
Yeah.

32
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:32,548
I will defeat you fair and square.

33
00:02:32,908 --> 00:02:34,109
And make you beg me for mercy.

34
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:36,989
I will defeat you fair and square.

35
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:40,989
Go ahead.

36
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:43,269
Gentlemen.

37
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:44,509
Well,

38
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:46,388
I'm here to do justice to my buddy.

39
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:48,269
Who's making a scene?

40
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:53,949
Isn't it Mr. Ju who got kicked out?

41
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:54,789
I will defeat you...

42
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,149
Are you here

43
00:02:57,388 --> 00:02:59,388
to beg for your position back?

44
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,429
Defeat you fair and square.

45
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:00,909
Shifang.

46
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:04,909
I will beg you for mercy.

47
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:10,308
No, wait.

48
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:11,109
That was wrong.

49
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,869
I will defeat you fair and square

50
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,708
and make you beg me for mercy.

51
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:17,268
You can't even speak.

52
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:18,589
And you wish to win?

53
00:03:20,748 --> 00:03:21,668
Come on, guys.

54
00:03:22,028 --> 00:03:23,308
I'm sure you know it.

55
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:24,668
My buddy

56
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:27,028
is the head of the Jiqiao Hall
in the Zhengwu Alliance.

57
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:28,628
He's highly capable.

58
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:30,268
Unfortunately,

59
00:03:30,388 --> 00:03:33,068
his fellow people were bullying him.

60
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:34,348
Today,

61
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,028
I'm going to do him justice...

62
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:36,628
Defeat them.

63
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:38,909
And show you what he's capable of.

64
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:40,268
Shifang.

65
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:43,909
Yeah, I'm going to fight you.

66
00:03:43,988 --> 00:03:44,728
- Alright!
- Alright!

67
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:45,668
- Alright!
- Alright!

68
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,224
- Alright!
- How are you going to fight?

69
00:03:50,988 --> 00:03:51,469
Alright.

70
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:53,308
Let's fight

71
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:54,628
two on two.

72
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:55,948
If we win,

73
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:57,668
you will do something for us.

74
00:03:58,068 --> 00:03:58,988
If we lose,

75
00:03:59,109 --> 00:03:59,668
then

76
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:01,909
we will do something for you.

77
00:04:02,388 --> 00:04:02,829
Okay?

78
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:04,388
Deal.

79
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:07,672
It's okay if you lose.

80
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:09,348
Mr. Ju, all we want

81
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:11,589
is to have fun
with your bear for a few days.

82
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,468
In your dreams.

83
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:19,949
- There.
- There.

84
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:21,188
There.

85
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:22,029
They're starting.

86
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:37,869
- Nice!
- Nice!

87
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:39,828
- Not bad!
- Alright!

88
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:46,429
- Nice!
- Nice!

89
00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:57,548
- Great!
- Great!

90
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:01,828
I won.

91
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:02,789
Jinzhao, I won!

92
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:07,149
How are you? Are you okay?

93
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:09,628
You lost.

94
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:13,309
We accept our defeat.

95
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:13,948
So,

96
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:15,309
what do you want?

97
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:20,309
Thirty taels?

98
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:22,069
Are they beggars?

99
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,189
T-Three hundred taels?

100
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,548
Qianjun, 300 taels.

101
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:33,909
Do we have the money?

102
00:06:34,388 --> 00:06:35,069
Of course not.

103
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:35,988
What do we do?

104
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:42,309
T-Three thousand taels?

105
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:44,749
Just kill me...

106
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:48,228
Bark three times.

107
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:50,589
You bad guy!

108
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:53,469
Jinzhao, forget it.

109
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:56,228
This is too much.

110
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:58,268
See, Mr. Ju is a reasonable man.

111
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:00,548
Yeah.

112
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:01,548
The way I see it,

113
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:04,069
barking once is enough.

114
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,228
What was I telling you?

115
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:10,909
Right.

116
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:12,029
Right.

117
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:15,149
Well, we're here

118
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:17,268
to propose

119
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:18,948
that we join hands

120
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:20,909
to eradicate the Qiyuan Sect.

121
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:22,189
Qiyuan Sect.

122
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,029
Qiyuan Sect.

123
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:23,788
Qiyuan Sect.

124
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:28,069
Qianjun, Qiming.

125
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:31,788
You lost because

126
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:33,189
you haven't mastered the moves.

127
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:35,309
Practice harder.

128
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:36,708
- Yes.
- Yes.

129
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:38,469
People of the Yongwu Hall

130
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:40,469
should keep our word.

131
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:43,228
Qianjun, apologize to Mr. Ju.

132
00:07:46,268 --> 00:07:48,108
Mr. Ju, I'm sorry.

133
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,429
We've done you wrong.

134
00:07:50,828 --> 00:07:52,828
Please forgive us.

135
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:56,069
I-It's okay.

136
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:58,149
Mr. Ju is truly magnanimous.

137
00:07:58,508 --> 00:07:59,189
I admire you.

138
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:01,548
Master Yue,

139
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:03,788
the Alliance Leader invites you inside

140
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:07,668
to discuss about
the attack on the Qiyuan Sect.

141
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:09,029
The Qiyuan Sect?

142
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:11,228
- Great!
- Great!

143
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:11,788
Let's go.

144
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:18,108
What a show you put up out there.

145
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:20,069
You think you can manipulate me?

146
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,749
We dare not.

147
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:24,668
It's just
that we've had some misunderstanding.

148
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:25,869
I was worried

149
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:28,469
that you wouldn't see us
without a proper cause.

150
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:30,869
Master Yue,

151
00:08:32,189 --> 00:08:34,548
you had it all planned
and played it out well.

152
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:36,108
What a great team.

153
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:39,029
I truly admire you.

154
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:40,508
We came up with this idea

155
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:41,629
only to meet you

156
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:43,548
and discuss our plan against

157
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:44,629
the Qiyuan Sect.

158
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,069
Please don't mind us.

159
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:49,784
Where is that wolf demon friend

160
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:52,029
of yours?

161
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:52,948
Leader.

162
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:55,069
Senior Xian Qing is a decent man.

163
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,869
I mean, decent demon.

164
00:08:58,228 --> 00:08:59,388
You treated him

165
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:00,668
so poorly.

166
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:02,948
Xian Qing

167
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,788
managed to win your trust.

168
00:09:06,268 --> 00:09:07,349
Therefore, I believe

169
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:09,708
he can't be an evil creature.

170
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:10,629
Leader,

171
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:12,429
you agreed to work with us?

172
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:16,388
I'm not a stubborn or irrational man.

173
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,388
I can tell right from wrong.

174
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:21,749
The Zhengwu Alliance
will join hands with you

175
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:23,108
against our enemies.

176
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:32,589
I have a letter from an old friend.

177
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:36,349
I'm basically roasted.

178
00:09:36,988 --> 00:09:37,629
Miss Ming.

179
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,429
(The Letter from Senior Gu)

180
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:44,668
It's Master's handwriting.

181
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:47,708
Miss Ming. What did Senior Gu write?

182
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:57,268
Straight to the point. Polite but harsh.

183
00:09:57,869 --> 00:09:59,349
That's Senior Gu's style.

184
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:03,668
I bet Xian Qing

185
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:06,548
told Senior Gu about what was going on.

186
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:10,268
You said that
the stronghold of the Qiyuan Sect

187
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:11,469
is at the Yinma River.

188
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:12,708
Are you sure about it?

189
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:13,388
Absolutely.

190
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:17,548
Alright, to keep it a secret,

191
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:20,508
you'd better go there
as soon as possible.

192
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:21,988
That's our plan.

193
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:23,508
This time,

194
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:26,228
I'm going to assign you some

195
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:27,388
of my top disciples.

196
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:30,108
They've dealt with
the Qiyuan Sect before.

197
00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:31,148
I believe they'll

198
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:34,709
help you destroy
the stronghold of the Qiyuan Sect.

199
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:37,348
Thank you.

200
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:53,908
Shifang.

201
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:56,629
Are you upset

202
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:58,040
because of how Mr. Zuo treated you?

203
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:00,949
You can tell?

204
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:05,588
I bet he's very disappointed in me.

205
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:09,309
Master Luo and I saw something

206
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,389
different.

207
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:11,629
Leader.

208
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,869
Leader.

209
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:15,949
Mr. Ju won!

210
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:24,468
You mean

211
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,429
Mr. Zuo was happy

212
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:27,389
that I won the fight?

213
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:31,148
He had high expectations for you.

214
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:33,148
I thought

215
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:35,548
he was mad because of Senior Xian Qing.

216
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:37,189
He was happy
that you helped your friend.

217
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:38,548
That's right.

218
00:11:41,548 --> 00:11:42,108
Shifang.

219
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:44,148
Yang.

220
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:45,269
Shifang.

221
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:47,788
Our leader sent me to accommodate you.

222
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:48,908
You're staying

223
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,108
in the Jiqiao Hall.

224
00:11:51,148 --> 00:11:52,148
Jiqiao Hall?

225
00:11:53,228 --> 00:11:54,269
He never said anything

226
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:55,988
about demoting you.

227
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,629
Shifang, you won

228
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:02,429
Chen Qianjun and Xu Qiming.

229
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:03,668
Many people have

230
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:05,148
changed their opinions about you.

231
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:07,468
When destroying the stronghold
at the Yinma River.

232
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:08,908
you should show them

233
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,028
what you've really got.

234
00:12:10,348 --> 00:12:11,509
You'll remain

235
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,588
as the head of the Jiqiao Hall.

236
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,189
I promise

237
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,709
I won't let any of you down.

238
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,588
Alright, I'll leave you to rest.

239
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:32,629
Alright, stop dazing off.

240
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:33,468
Tomorrow,

241
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:34,949
there's a tough battle to fight.

242
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:39,668
Shifang, what did we tell you?

243
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,028
How do I find a way
to remove the Husheng Spell?

244
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:16,629
They left you this.

245
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:36,309
A paper crane.

246
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:40,548
It's obviously from Ming Xiu.

247
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:42,709
I thought she would ignore me.

248
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:50,629
(Little Yue.)

249
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:53,148
(This kaleidoscope
is full of pretty patterns.)

250
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:55,108
(Take a look whenever you miss us.)

251
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:05,108
(Miss Yue.)

252
00:14:05,468 --> 00:14:06,108
(Keep this dagger)

253
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:07,908
(for self-defense.)

254
00:14:17,228 --> 00:14:18,509
Wolf-fur duster.

255
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,108
I bet it's from Xian Qing.

256
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:25,468
So handy.

257
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:00,629
Miss Shuo Xuan,

258
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:03,108
I'm leaving
the Sea of Clear Skies today.

259
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:05,908
This is for you.

260
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:09,709
I'm not interested in these things.

261
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:23,189
Who'd want your gift?

262
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:49,468
Come, Jinzhao.

263
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:50,829
Candied hawthorn.

264
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:52,869
Qi.

265
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:55,269
Candied hawthorn.

266
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:16,908
Visit again.

267
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:17,548
Thank you.

268
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:20,108
Mr. Yue.

269
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,108
Some pastries?

270
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:27,389
The same ones?

271
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,348
Alright.

272
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,189
Alright.

273
00:16:30,348 --> 00:16:31,629
Why are you alone today?

274
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:33,108
Where is your wife?

275
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:35,269
At her maiden home.

276
00:16:36,588 --> 00:16:37,509
You should

277
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,588
get her back as soon as possible.

278
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:45,189
Here.

279
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:47,509
One extra plum blossom pancake for her.

280
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:48,548
Here.

281
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,629
Thank you.

282
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:50,749

we will always be together anyway.

I will be your Husheng.

302
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:29,624
I will protect you.

00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,469
Thinking about Little Yue?

306
00:19:06,668 --> 00:19:08,189
I wonder how she's doing

307
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,232
at the Sea of Clear Skies.

308
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,229
She's the young lord of the Yu Clan.

309
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,829
I bet she's doing well.

310
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:19,309
Yeah.

311
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:22,429
She's the young lord now.

312
00:19:24,268 --> 00:19:26,268
She must be doing well.

313
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:40,309
Honestly, I totally get it.

314
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:41,069
It's like...

315
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:42,829
It's like Dou Bao and I.

316
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:44,429
If Dou Bao leaves me

317
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:45,829
out of the blue,

318
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:48,429
I'd be in pain for ages just like you.

319
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:50,709
You and Little Yue have been together

320
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:51,748
for so long.

321
00:19:52,028 --> 00:19:54,868
It's normal for you to miss her.

322
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:57,628
Is it really that Miss Yue
can't live without you

323
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,548
or you can't live without Miss Yue?

324
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:32,309
Well,

325
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:35,989
did I say something wrong again?

326
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:40,109
No.

327
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:48,508
You're right.

328
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:53,028
It is always me.

329
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,309
It has always been me
who can't live without her.

330
00:21:03,268 --> 00:21:04,628

Please forget about our past grudges.

00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:54,949

368

that I shall gather all the directors

369
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:54,189
and take the matured Qiyuan Orb

370
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,349

371
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:56,069

00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:09,949
for you to show up

379
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:12,189
in front of all our fellow disciples

380
00:24:12,548 --> 00:24:14,429
before making you

381
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:16,469
the next sect leader.

382
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:18,508
It is urgent.

383
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:21,069
I'd better get ready

384
00:24:21,189 --> 00:24:22,268
and head to the headquarters.

385
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:26,548
Master.

386
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:32,788
You're about to be made the sect leader.

387
00:24:32,908 --> 00:24:34,268
The Langyin Pavilion...

388
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,304
Enough.

389
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:40,748
I'll make you the director here.

390
00:24:41,989 --> 00:24:44,109
- Take great care of it.
- Alright.

391
00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:45,388
- You hear me?
- Yes.

392
00:25:09,668 --> 00:25:11,709
The entrance must be nearby.

393
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:13,668
Why don't we split up?

394
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:14,949
It's a difficult terrain.

395
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:16,109
We should stay close.

396
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:17,668
Let's go in pairs.

397
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:18,309
Keep in touch.

398
00:25:18,748 --> 00:25:19,349
Alright.

399
00:25:20,028 --> 00:25:20,548
Let's go.

400
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:25,429
Shifang, let's go.

401
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:26,628
Alright.

402
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:32,628
Xu.

403
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:35,748
I don't get it. Why did Mr. Wen send

404
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:36,829
two untrustworthy guys

405
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:37,908
with us as scouts

406
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:38,748
and stay on standby

407
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:41,028
with Master Luo and Miss Ming

408
00:25:41,469 --> 00:25:42,589
under the mountain?

409
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:46,229
I believe there is a good reason.

410
00:26:31,028 --> 00:26:31,829
Footprints.

411
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:38,868
Watch out!

412
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:51,989
Thank you for saving my life.

413
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:55,069
How did you know it was a trap?

414
00:26:58,349 --> 00:26:59,949
The footprints looked artificial.

415
00:26:59,949 --> 00:27:00,989
I knew it was fishy.

416
00:27:01,668 --> 00:27:02,788
You're truly observant.

417
00:27:02,949 --> 00:27:03,748
I admire you.

418
00:27:03,949 --> 00:27:05,548
It's nothing. Stay alert.

419
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:06,628
Yes.

420
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:07,829
If there's a trap here,

421
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:09,548
then the entrance to the Qiyuan Sect

422
00:27:09,668 --> 00:27:10,628
must be close by.

423
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:11,429
Yeah.

424
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:13,229
Are you okay, Xu?

425
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:13,908
I'm fine.

426
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:15,868
Master Yue saved me.

427
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:16,989
Jinzhao.

428
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:19,628
Jinzhao, I heard something

429
00:27:19,748 --> 00:27:20,709
from the stone wall.

430
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:21,469
I think

431
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:23,069
the stronghold is behind there.

432
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:24,229
Let's go take a look.

433
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:24,868
Alright.

434
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:41,868
Captives.

435
00:27:56,069 --> 00:27:57,709
I didn't expect this stronghold

436
00:27:57,868 --> 00:27:58,908
to be so heavily guarded.

437
00:27:59,028 --> 00:28:00,429
It's going to be a tough battle.

438
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:02,949
Let's get down the mountain

439
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:04,229
and inform Mr. Wen first.

440
00:28:04,469 --> 00:28:04,829
Alright.

441
00:28:04,989 --> 00:28:05,469
Wait.

442
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,628
It's just the Langyin Pavilion.

443
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,469
Shifang and I can handle it.

444
00:28:14,949 --> 00:28:16,589
Someone really knows how to bluff.

445
00:28:17,189 --> 00:28:18,829
Qianjun, let's wait

446
00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:22,388
and see what Master Yue is up to.

447
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,268
Jinzhao,

448
00:28:26,508 --> 00:28:28,229
so that's why you told me

449
00:28:28,349 --> 00:28:29,349
to make the masks?

450
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:30,469
Chances

451
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:32,628
favor those who are prepared.

452
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:49,268
Who are you?

453
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:51,989
Get your director here.

454
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:53,788
How dare you

455
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,508
ask to see Director Meng?

456
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:57,109
Are you suicidal?

457
00:28:58,349 --> 00:28:58,908
Guards.

458
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:04,868
Let me see who's so bold.

459
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:08,189
How dare you ask to see me?

460
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:12,628
Didact.

461
00:29:13,148 --> 00:29:14,349
Please forgive me.

462
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:17,668
How dare you!

463
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,148
Didact is here.

464
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:20,189
Where are your manners?

465
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:21,229
Get lost!

466
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:24,028
Get lost. Hurry up.

467
00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:29,069
Master Yue is really smart.

468
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:31,908
And you are...

469
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:32,829
Me?

470
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:36,229
I am the Didact's bodyguard.

471
00:29:37,148 --> 00:29:38,028
Nice to meet you, sir.

472
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:40,788
Didact, may I ask

473
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,189
what brought you here?

474
00:29:48,148 --> 00:29:49,229
W-What does it mean?

475
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:51,868
You don't do your job well.

476
00:29:52,868 --> 00:29:54,709
Didact works all day and got sick.

477
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:55,788
He can't talk now.

478
00:29:57,388 --> 00:29:58,429
You've been made director.

479
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:00,229
How come you don't get what he wants?

480
00:30:00,908 --> 00:30:02,548
Yeah, you're right.

481
00:30:09,868 --> 00:30:11,229
Didact means

482
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:14,829
our strongholds are getting eradicated

483
00:30:14,949 --> 00:30:16,148
one after another.

484
00:30:16,908 --> 00:30:19,109
Only you guys are doing well.

485
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:20,668
Let's try to barge in later.

486
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:23,628
Exactly.

487
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:26,429
The stronghold here is heavily guarded.

488
00:30:31,189 --> 00:30:32,628
Are you going to...

489
00:30:33,908 --> 00:30:34,548
reward me?

490
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:37,868
Punish me.

491
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:39,709
I'm sorry.

492
00:30:40,028 --> 00:30:40,628
My apologies.

493
00:30:43,069 --> 00:30:44,709
Didact means

494
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:47,388
that you've done a great job.

495
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:49,229
You deserve some rewards,

496
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,908
so he's taking you somewhere.

497
00:30:53,148 --> 00:30:54,709
Thank you, Didact.

498
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:08,908
Go!

499
00:31:15,989 --> 00:31:17,868
You're disguising as me?

500
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,668
Yue Jinzhao,
you've learned a trick or two.

501
00:31:25,908 --> 00:31:28,109
Meng Cheng, it's been so long.

502
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:30,028
Who are you?

503
00:31:34,388 --> 00:31:35,788
So it's you.

504
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:38,388
You look so much like Didact
with the mask on.

505
00:31:38,508 --> 00:31:39,628
Where is the headquarters?

506
00:31:40,388 --> 00:31:41,469
I'm loyal to Lord Ming.

507
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:42,989
I won't tell you where it is.

508
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:45,028
Alright.

509
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:48,748
D-Don't kill me.

510
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:50,748
Tell me exactly

511
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,268
where your headquarters is.

512
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:53,268
Fine.

513
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:55,189
I'll tell you.

514
00:32:01,148 --> 00:32:01,868
Excuse me.

515
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:04,349
Have you heard of the Husheng Spell?

516
00:32:04,469 --> 00:32:05,028
Husheng Spell?

517
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:08,229
It's a spell

518
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:11,109
that removes one's memories
and personality.

519
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:13,069
Remember what I told you?

520
00:32:13,949 --> 00:32:14,668
It's at his place.

521
00:32:17,432 --> 00:32:18,148
Excuse me.

522
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:20,028
Have you heard of the Husheng Spell?

523
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:21,229
Husheng Spell?

524
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:22,189
Have you?

525
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:25,229
We've never heard of it

526
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:26,148
as we were born.

527
00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:27,069
Right.

528
00:32:27,548 --> 00:32:28,920
- Never heard of it.
- Never heard of it.

529
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:33,189
Grandpa.

530
00:32:37,548 --> 00:32:40,388
Do you know about the Husheng Spell?

531
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:41,949
What spell?

532
00:32:42,349 --> 00:32:43,508
Husheng Spell.

533
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:44,949
What spell?

534
00:32:45,628 --> 00:32:47,069
Husheng Spell.

535
00:32:49,229 --> 00:32:49,989
Young lord.

536
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:52,109
If you want to learn spells,

537
00:32:52,508 --> 00:32:53,589
read the books in the hall.

538
00:32:55,628 --> 00:32:58,829
I've never
learned any spells in my life.

539
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:00,388
I'm not reading books.

540
00:33:02,908 --> 00:33:03,628
Read books?

541
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:44,908
Meditation Spell.

542
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:48,469
Meditation Spell.

543
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:56,388
It allows people to enter
the sea of awareness of any creature.

544
00:33:57,589 --> 00:33:59,868
If I enter Zhu Yu's sea of awareness,

545
00:34:00,349 --> 00:34:01,229
then I'll find a way

546
00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:03,268
to remove the Husheng Spell.

547
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,069
Whose sea of awareness is it?

548
00:34:26,868 --> 00:34:30,268
Life is so hard.

549
00:34:46,788 --> 00:34:47,949
You're the lantern.

550
00:34:50,508 --> 00:34:51,589
So you're alive.

551
00:34:51,748 --> 00:34:53,069
I've been a lantern for ages.

552
00:34:53,229 --> 00:34:56,268
I forgot that I'm a living fish.

553
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,908
Why do I lead such a miserable life?

554
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:02,069
Why do I have to work so hard?

555
00:35:02,296 --> 00:35:03,388
Work?

556
00:35:04,856 --> 00:35:05,949
What do you do?

557
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:12,788
I emit light and heat

558
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:15,829
to light up
the street for the Yu people.

559
00:35:16,189 --> 00:35:19,148
Why do we have to work?

560
00:35:19,748 --> 00:35:23,148
Why can't I lie back and do nothing?

561
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:26,628
I've been working for 300 years.

562
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:30,268
When is it ever going to end?

563
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:34,548
Life is so hard.

564
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:50,388
The Meditation Spell worked.

565
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:15,987
♪Looking back♪

566
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,722
