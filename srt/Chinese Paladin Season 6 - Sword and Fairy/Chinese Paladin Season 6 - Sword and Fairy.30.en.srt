21
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,200
Ying Xuwei, they've entered
the Mist Soul. Where is the key ring?

22
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,599
Sorry for keeping you waiting,
Miss Shuo Xuan.

23
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,919
General Lin Yuan, Zhu Yu tried
to take the Rehai key ring by force.

24
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:08,280
I wonder, in your opinion,

25
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,919
how the contractual relationship
between us should proceed.

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,960
When we meet again another day
after our parting today,

27
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,400
we should rely on what we each have.

28
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,424
Guixu

29
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:43,040
is the final resting place
of all memories in the world.

30
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,119
Even the most thrilling
and poignant memories

31
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,728
will be like

32
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,559
the most ordinary flowing water
in Guixu.

33
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,120
What did you see?

34
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,039
I saw a lot of things
that I had already forgotten.

35
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,039
Upon reflection,
my life hasn't been wasted.

36
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,240
When I returned last time,
this dragon horn was missing a piece.

37
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
Now it's complete.

38
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,039
It seems that during these three years,

39
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:57,520
not only us but others
have also come to the Dragon Pool.

40
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,679
It was taken by Xuwei.

41
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,520
Why do you need this dragon horn?

42
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,520
To forge a fake Rehai key ring.

43
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,880
The real one
is in your possession, isn't it?

44
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:16,679
The Rehai key ring was originally
crafted from dragon bones.

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,919
The divine power lingering on the bones
can confound Zhu Yu,

46
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,119
making her believe that the key ring
we surrendered is real.

47
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,640
Why did you do that?

48
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,392
It's a long story.

49
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,520
You should ask Xuwei after you get out.

50
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Qingfei!

51
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,959
Qingfei, you're finally back.

52
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,319
Where did you go
without taking me along?

53
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,440
I want to know
when Luohuan will be back.

54
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,080
Qingfei, why won't any of you tell me
where Luohuan has actually gone?

55
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,280
Is it because that place
is very far away

56
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,520
and he has to go for a long time?

57
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,320
What if Luohuan never comes back?

58
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,040
Is Luohuan going
to a very dangerous place?

59
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,880
He's been injured.

60
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,519
Qingfei, quickly tell me
where Luohuan is,

61
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,664
so I can go protect him.

62
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,640
Silly you.

63
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,720
Do you think Xuwei and I
don't care about Luohuan's safety?

64
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,160
Rest assured.
He... He's just gone to heal.

65
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,224
When he returns,

66
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,600
he'll certainly
be lively and safe again.

67
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,040
Really?

68
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,800
Yes.

69
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:51,920
He had me worried for nothing.

70
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,839
When he comes back,

71
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,600
I'll make him make 100 grass dragonflies
for me personally,

72
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,559
and each one has to be different.

73
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,079
Are you trying to torture him?

74
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,216
Yes, that's right.

75
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,359
Qingfei, what's wrong?
Are your eyes bothering you?

76
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,559
Yes, a big grain of sand got in my eye.

77
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:39,359
In this long stream of memories,

78
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,880
why can't I find your memories?

79
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,920
We come from three years later.

80
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,816
Three years later?

81
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,920
I need to seek information
in your memory.

82
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,119
I'm already aware of your identities
and your intentions.

83
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,839
I cannot create, but only exchange.

84
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,639
Your existence will totally disappear
as a price.

85
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,359
From now on, no one in this world
will remember you.

86
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,880
Even I will not be an exception.

87
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,320
Are you ready?

88
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,720
To be honest, no.

89
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,799
I have been forgotten before.

90
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,000
That kind of fear and despair still

91
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,079
feels suffocating upon recollection,
even after many years.

92
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,480
And now,

93
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,399
Xuwei, Qingfei, Xiaoyuan,

94
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,760
and all the other people I cherish
will forget me.

95
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,679
No matter how much more time
I am given to prepare,

96
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,848
I simply cannot accept it.

97
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,799
But only I can make the exchange
for Yue Jinzhao, right?

98
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:47,079
The mark of Qi is engraved on your soul.

99
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
This isn't something
owned by life itself.

100
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,799
I also cannot create it.

101
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:57,079
Since you have a wish in your heart,
come forward then.

102
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,440
Willing to sacrifice his life
for someone completely unrelated...

103
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,744
These humans...

104
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,320
I actually view the Hengdao Sect
with renewed respect.

105
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,160
If it were me,
I would make the exchange too.

106
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,776
I will.

107
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,072
Thank you.

108
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,439
It is I who should thank you.

109
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,040
There are many things I can't do,
but you can.

110
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,824
Yue Jinzhao,

111
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,999
I also have a gift for the reborn you.

112
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,560
What is it?

113
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:57,040
I've been secretly watching you
for a long time.

114
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,079
I have witnessed
most of what you have experienced.

115
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:14,639
I will seal some of my memories
into your left eye.

116
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,839
Consider it
my final compensation to you.

117
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,680
So every time,
the images my left eye sees

118
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,064
are those you have seen.

119
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,959
Bian Luohuan, take care.

120
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,600

we would have such a strong connection.

It's rare that you are so moved.

176
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,280
Alright, it's time to go. We have to
take them to Wuyan Village.

177
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,952

I will send you back.

179
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,439
Yue Jinzhao, do you believe in fate?

180
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
Someone once told me

181
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:58,160
that fate is just a possibility
that can be changed.

182
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,056
It makes a lot of sense.

183
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,040
The previous Guardian of Pureness
said that, right?

184
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:09,920
But do you still remember
when the Cold Marrow Garrison prophesied

185
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:14,519
that two out of the six of you
would soon pass away?

186
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,176
Yes, I do.

187
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,439
In the near future,

188
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,439
your life will come to an end.

189
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,879
I have my sword and my companions.

190
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,079
I will let fate take the path it should.

191
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:08,719
Later on, the people from Hengdao Sect
will come looking for us.

192
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,519
The Yunlai Stone is glowing.

193
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:30,552
The Yunlai Stone is approaching.

194
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:36,519
Master once came to check
because of the anomaly of Pureness.

195
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:43,440
Ming Xiu, if you want
to find Mr. Gu, just go.

196
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,960
Go on. See him once more.

197
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,840
Master, I'll first go to the den
and defeat the demon beasts.

198
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:53,320
And then, after I return,

199
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:57,359
could you pin a hibiscus flower
in my hair for me?

200
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,920
I don't care. That's a deal, then.

201
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,064
Who is it?

202
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Master.

203
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,560
Xiu.

204
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,560
Xiu, are you from the future?

205
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,639
Has something happened in the future?

206
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,200
Have you suffered a lot?

207
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,280
Alright, Xiu, you still have me here.

208
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,999
When did you inherit the position
of Guardian of Pureness?

209
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:13,368
Three years later.

210
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,960
Three years...

211
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,119
So, I can only be with you
for three more years.

212
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:27,960
Master,

213
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,119
could you pin a hibiscus flower
in my hair for me?

214
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:16,719
Indeed, this hibiscus
is a worthy match for you.

I saw the flowers here
bloom quite beautifully,

240
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,160

(Master, this time, it's truly goodbye.)

245
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:08,879
Have you said farewell to Hanjiang?

246
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,680
I've always wanted to know

247
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:21,999
what exactly happened
on July 14th, three years ago.

248
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:28,759
But I never expected it to be me.

249
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
Do you regret seeing him?

250
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,040
Perhaps. But I saw him one last time

251
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:48,879
and let him personally adorn me
with this hibiscus.

252
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,639
And Master ultimately granted my wish.

253
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:00,639
Although Master was gentle as a person,

254
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,879
he truly was more stringent than others
as a master.

255
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,759
This time, I went to see him at the risk
of disturbing the stream of time.

256
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,599
Under normal circumstances,
he might have expelled me.

257
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:22,840
You are Xiu,
whom he has raised since childhood.

258
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,536
How could he bear to do that?

259
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,848
Let's go.

260
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:37,359
(The departed have long been gone.
The living will harbor peace forever.)

261
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,040
Miss Ming, how is Mr. Gu doing?

262
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,400
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

263
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:57,920
Being able to see the one cherished
in one's heart again

264
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,599
is truly a fortunate thing.

265
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,280
Qi, are you afraid that after we go in,

266
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:37,639
we will no longer remember Bian Luohuan?

267
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,680
Once we return to the future,

268
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,040
the path of heaven
will erase everything about him.

269
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:47,999
It will be as if he never existed.

270
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:52,399
But can the trace of one's existence

271
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,960
really be quietly erased completely?

272
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,239
As long as his faith and mission
are in our hearts,

273
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,519
even if we no longer remember him,

274
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:11,999
he is still alive.

275
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,464
