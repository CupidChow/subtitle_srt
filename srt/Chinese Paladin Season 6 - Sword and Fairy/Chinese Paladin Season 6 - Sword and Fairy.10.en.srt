=Episode 10=

21
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:03,256
(Yujie Hub)

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,616
(Hundred-Foot Spring Platform)

23
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,800
I am finally home.

24
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,480
What?

25
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:43,879
Do you know why you were punished?

26
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,320
Copy the book.

27
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
He bullied Luohuan.

28
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,239
Because you got mad,

29
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:53,280
so you beat him so hard?

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,599
No.

31
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,039
If I'd known that cliff is unstable,

32
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,000
of course I wouldn't
have beat him that hard.

33
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,440
If you'd known?

34
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,839
You'd never know everything.

35
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,960
Some things

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,640
are better not knowing.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,760
I don't understand.

38
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
You're always hiding things
from me anyway.

39
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,519
So Qingfei,

40
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:21,280
what is the relationship
between Yue Jinzhao and Luohuan?

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,640
Why do they look exactly alike?

42
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,400
What's your progress?

43
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,479
The beginning.

44
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,559
Then you better hurry up.

45
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,320
You're not eating until you finish.

46
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,960
What?

47
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,680
What what?

48
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,199
I didn't say that.

49
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,680
The eldest brother said it.

50
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:54,519
Brother.

51
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,040
I'm back.

52
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,760
How are Qi and Yue Jinzhao doing?

53
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:04,919
Brother.

54
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,679
I've been away for so long,

55
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,399
and all you talk about is Jinzhao.

56
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,759
You don't even care about me.

57
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:14,919
Take a seat properly.

58
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,080
Seeing you so carefree,

59
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,280
I knew

60
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:24,559
they are fine.

61
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,640
Yes, they are out of danger now

62
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,319
and taken away by those of Mount Yuqing.

63
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,399
Alright.

64
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,520
Over these three years,

65
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,440
the progress of Qi
and Jinzhao's Resonance Spell

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,679
has been slow.

67
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,039
But this time,

68
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,640
they've increased
dramatically in strength.

69
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,399
I can't believe
they could kill the Zhenyao fish.

70
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,280
It's because of the Qiyuan Orb.

71
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,160
Previously in the Fujin Hall,

72
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,160
Qi accidentally ate many Qiyuan Orbs.

73
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,280
The Qiyuan Orb contains
the power of human life force.

74
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,559
So,

75
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,479
it could be the key for Qi
obtaining her power this time.

76
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,240
And Qi has also grown scales.

77
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,959
Has her mythical beast power awakened?

78
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,080
Yes.

79
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,360
Brother.

80
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,720
Did you take the medicine I gave you?

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,039
Your analysis

82
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,640
makes sense.

83
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,839
It is just that the Qiyuan Orb

84
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,720
contains all kinds of dark emotions

85
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,919
before dying.

86
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,199
Has Qi's temper changed
after absorbing the Qiyuan Orbs?

87
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,720
Nothing changed.

88
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:43,800
She can eat and drink,

89
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:45,959
and is as happy as always.

90
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,399
After absorbing the Qiyuan Orbs,
Qi's strength has greatly increased

91
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,000
and her sanity hasn't been affected.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,119
This is beneficial for us.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,399
Right.

94
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:06,080
This is Rehai Water

95
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,319
that Luo Maiming gave us
for contacting him.

96
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,880
What did Luo Maiming say?

97
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,359
He did bind Rehai with blood,

98
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,440
but also intends
to undo the Bloodbinding.

99
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,280
No rush.

100
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,160
As soon as we're done with Qiyuan Sect,

101
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,799
I will personally meet him.

102
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:26,959
Okay.

103
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,000
So everything's all right.

104
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,448
I'll go check on Xiaoyuan.

105
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:32,040
OK.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,320
Wait.

107
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,119
She's currently being punished
by copying scriptures.

108
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,079
Don't copy for her.

109
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:43,880
I won't.

110
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,480
She's getting headstrong.

111
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,799
It's all because you spoil her.

112
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,760
Not just me, so is Qingfei.

113
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:54,959
Get lost.

114
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
I'll get out.

115
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:00,559
Brother.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,359
You really need
to take care of yourself.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,559
Otherwise, we four

118
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,880
will be one short.

119
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,768
(Mount Yuqing)

120
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,320
Jinzhao, I don't want to lose...

121
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,519
I don't want to lose...

122
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,639
What don't you want to lose?

123
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,600
Jinzhao.

124
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,600
You've hit my wound.

125
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,679
It hurts.

126
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,239
Really? Let me see.

127
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,359
Qi.

128
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,920
Do you remember anything unusual

129
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,600
about you when you saved me?

130
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:36,639
Unusual?

131
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,040
What kind of unusual?

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,839
I must've seen it wrong.

133
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:47,679
Where is this?

134
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,399
Mount Yuqing.

135
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,720
It's Ming Xiu and Mr. Gu

136
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,440
who picked us up from the cliff.

137
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:02,799
Senior Xian Qing, Mr. Gu.

138
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,079
Mr. Gu, thank you for saving my life.

139
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,239
The first thing

140
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,559
you should thank is your own efforts.

141
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:14,480
Jinzhao.

142
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,799
Jinzhao.

143
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,600
Jinzhao, you are awake.

144
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
You look much better now.

145
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,200
Master's medicine certainly works.

146
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,639
It's not that my medicine works.

147
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,839
Mr. Yue.

148
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:34,040
In fact, when I found you and Miss Yue,

149
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:35,839
Miss Yue was almost healed,

150
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,760
and your wound was obviously treated.

151
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,519
And the demonic aura on you

152
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:43,160
was the same as that

153
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,480
on Miss Shuo Xuan
we met in Luori Village.

154
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,799
Shuo Xuan?

155
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,880
Why did she save us?

156
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,600
Does she have anything to do
with Bian Luohuan too?

157
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,040
Jinzhao, don't worry.

158
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,399
With my strength,

159
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,320
next time I see her,

160
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,760
I will definitely catch her and ask her.

161
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,320
N-No, it's not me.

162
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,559
Sorry, it's me. I'm hungry.

163
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,399
Jinzhao, I'll go cook for you.

164
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:17,359
Wait for me.

165
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:30,480
Mr. Gu.

166
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,399
Sorry for the bother.

167
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,079
I may take my leave.

168
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:38,839
Leave?

169
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,680
Luo, do you have something to do?

170
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,920
I just learned
Zhengwu Alliance wiped out

171
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,480
Qiyuan Sect's stronghold in Jiangning.

172
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,360
There might be some new clues

173
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,920
that can help Yue.

174
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,240
Won't you say goodbye to others?

175
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,959
This is urgent...

176
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:00,879
Then,

177
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:02,999
Zhaoyan, you go ahead.

178
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,280
Thank you.

179
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,040
It's a long way to Jingan.

180
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:12,839
Please let Xiu send you off.

181
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,519
Then thank you, Miss Ming.

182
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:19,759
Farewell.

183
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,920
I think

184
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,519
she's in an urgency to avoid me.

185
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:46,040
There's a lot of weird and
interesting things going on today.

186
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,040
Well,

187
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:48,920
one more round?

188
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,759
You might lose one more game.

189
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,759
That's quite arrogant.

190
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,560
Luohuan, you're back.

191
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,439
Let me see.

192
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,959
You have no improvement
in writing at all.

193
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,280
I want to go play in the snow.

194
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,800
I don't want to write.

195
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,199
Do you want to play in the snow?

196
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,280
Go ahead.

197
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,600
But I'm not done yet.

198
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:35,120
Easy-peasy.

199
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,839
Same old rules, I will copy it for you.

200
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,160
Qingfei, I'm going to play in the snow.

201
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,920
Qingfei.

202
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,199
It's best to be home.

203
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:49,879
I can't even drink your wine outside.

204
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,199
Did brother blame you?

205
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,160
No.

206
00:12:58,439 --> 00:12:59,079
But...

207
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,280
Qingfei,

208
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,120
he had another seizure today.

209
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,800
However,

210
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,360
don't worry too much.

211
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,199
He has a heavy mind

212
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,360
and his emotions fluctuate greatly.

213
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,560
Did you make him angry again?

214
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,839
No way.

215
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,879
I am still better than Xiaoyuan.

216
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,399
Then why is he so agitated?

217
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,079
Because the mythical beast power
of our fish

218
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,040
has finally awakened.

219
00:13:31,439 --> 00:13:32,240
He's overjoyed.

220
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,399
You're the only one

221
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,639
who dares to do that in front of him.

222
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:40,759
I think

223
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:42,720
he is too tired.

224
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:45,920
I hope him to be a bit relaxed

225
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,959
and happier.

226
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,280
(Qi has awakened her power
by absorbing the Qiyuan Orbs,)

227
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,959
(but it must hurt too.)

228
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,480
(She never used to cry before,)

229
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,240
(yet, she shed tears in the Fujin Hall.)

230
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:02,959
Qingfei.

231
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:04,639
I'm going for a walk.

232
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,920
Just leave like that.

233
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,160
That's quite decisive.

234
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,999
Do you want me to divine

235
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:31,680
your future with Master Luo?

236
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,560
No need.

237
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,160
If we divine everything in the future,

238
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,040
what's the point of living?

239
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,519
Xian Qing.

240
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,280
Speaking of the future,

241
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,040
what are your expectations
for the future?

242
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,839
A demon lives for a long time.

243
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,240
I've been doing
whatever I want for a thousand years.

244
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,079
I have nothing to expect.

245
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,480
As a demon, you've been
doing whatever you want,

246
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:17,560
so why bother to find troubles
in relationship like humans?

247
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,240
Do you need me to give you some advice?

248
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,240
We are all novices facing relationship.

249
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,519
Someone

250
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,999
can't even accept his own disciple.

251
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,519
Don't pretend to be cool.

252
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,120
Someone regains
his half of demonic power back,

253
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,999
yet can't even keep
the one he cares about.

254
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:43,720
How dare he said that to me!

255
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,800
You cheated again.

256
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,079
I quit.

257
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:05,600
Someone is a cheater,

258
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,999
yet looks gentle,

259
00:16:08,439 --> 00:16:09,752
confusing the people.

260
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:15,720
I won again.

261
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,600
Three years ago,

262
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,040
the memories erased
when Qi left the Yujie Hub

263
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:47,079
have become the star curtain
over the Hundred-Foot Spring Platform.

264
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:49,759
I thought

265
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,519
you would never open them again.

266
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:54,120
This is different.

267
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,240
Qingfei, look, she's so adorable.

268
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,399
I still remember that day

269
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,959
when Qi was just born,

270
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,639
you and brother

271
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,519
brought her back from
the Sea of Clear Skies to Yujie Hub.

272
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:15,311
♪The deep feelings are hidden
behind the mask♪

273
00:17:18,552 --> 00:17:19,608
Master.

274
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,711
♪Who can see them clearly♪

275
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:30,439
♪I'm destined
to brave all dangers for you♪

276
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:31,160
I found

277
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,879
you've become completely
different this time.

278
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,360
Did something happen?

279
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,319
I've been following them
for three years.

280
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,839
I thought

281
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,639
I've already accepted everything.

282
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:49,040
But

283
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:50,959
(in the Fujin Hall,)

284
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,984
(when Qi cried after she
accidentally ate the Qiyuan Orbs,)

285
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:55,120
(I would still feel bad.)

286
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,959
(When she protected me subconsciously
in Luori Village,)

287
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,600
(I would still be moved.)

288
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,280
(Seeing her risking her life
to protect Yue Jinzhao at Yinma River,)

289
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:09,560
(I would even get jealous.)

290
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,040
Perhaps

291
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,360
I still can't let go.

292
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:16,360
Huan.

293
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,160
You once swore to the Chastisement Stone

294
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,759
that you would never
use the Resonance Spell on Qi,

295
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,519
or expose your identity.

296
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,920
Otherwise,

297
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,240
brother won't let you go
watch over Qi and Yue Jinzhao.

298
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,568
- You can't...
- Qingfei.

299
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,800
I'm just kidding.

300
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,079
Don't be nervous.

301
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:34,720
You brat.

302
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,280
Don't ever play jokes
like that on me again.

303
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,160
Rest assured.

304
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,639
I know what I have to do.

305
00:18:42,439 --> 00:18:43,759
I am still Qi's master.

306
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,759
I will

307
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,519
guide Qi and Yue Jinzhao

308
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:49,839
to become the sharpest sword.

309
00:18:54,072 --> 00:19:01,455
♪Leaving behind proof of my love♪

310
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:05,879
Qi, are you ready?

311
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,359
Jinzhao, just a moment.

312
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,639
It's almost done.

313
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,320
Qi!

314
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:15,599
Jinzhao.

315
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:15,999
Qi.

316
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:16,840
Jinzhao.

317
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,200
Qi, what's wrong?

318
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,800
I just wanted
to make you a bowl of noodles.

319
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,160
So how is it?

320
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,519
Have a taste.

321
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,920
It looks good.

322
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,960
Of course.

323
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,359
The broth is an herbal soup
that I simmered.

324
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:44,479
It could dispel cold.

325
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,359
Have a try.

326
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,639
How's it? Is it delicious?

327
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,239
Yes.

328
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,680
This is the best noodles

329
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
I've ever had.

330
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,519
Really? I'll have a taste too.

331
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,560
You're lying.

332
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,560
I'm not.

333
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,399
Everyone has different tastes.

334
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,040
It's really delicious.

335
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,840
Why do you suddenly
want to cook me noodles?

336
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,879
I used to cook them for you before.

337
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:30,759
I also want to do something.

338
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,999
Why do you say so?

339
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,680
When you were unconscious,

340
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:36,960
Mr. Gu told me

341
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,519
we have to grow up.

342
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,999
We need to think about

343
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,359
what we want to do and what we can do,

344
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,719
and we can't always listen to others.

345
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,768
You want to grow up that much?

346
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:51,239
Yes. Only when I grow up
can I become stronger

347
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,320
and protect those who I want to protect.

348
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,239
You used to protect me all the time.

349
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,879
Jinzhao, I also want to
protect you from now on.

350
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
It seems our Qi has really grown up.

351
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,599
Okay, you protect me.

352
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,160
Alright.

353
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,239
I cooked it wrong,

354
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,560
and I'll make you another bowl.

355
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:23,759
(If you learn to make noodles,)

356
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
(then you won't need me)

357
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,479
(to cook for you anymore.)

358
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:42,519
Miss Yue can resonate with the key ring.

359
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,960
It seems that she has

360
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,599
a deep connection with the Nine Springs.

361
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,840
Senior.

362
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,479
Senior, do you know divination?

363
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,200
Mr. Yue, do you believe in divination?

364
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,879
Then could you please

365
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,320
do a divination for me and Qi?

366
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:09,800
I want to know more about our origins.

367
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,599
Sure.

368
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,920
Mr. Yue, just tell me the birthdates

369
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,040
of you and Miss Yue.

370
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:17,080
Birthdates?

371
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:25,119
But senior,

372
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,719
Qi and I have no memory of what happened

373
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:29,519
three years ago,

374
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:32,119
and we don't know our birthdates.

375
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,599
Well...

376
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,519
Do you have any memorable date
that could serve as birthdates?

377
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,759
Maybe we could try.

378
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:40,599
July 14th.

379
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:43,160
July

380
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:45,200
14th?

381
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,479
What's wrong?

382
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:52,119
Three years ago on this day,

383
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,320
I once encountered
a strange event in some place.

384
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,399
I thought it might have something
to do with you and Miss Yue,

385
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,776
so I paid special attention.

386
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,759
What is it?

387
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,440
Where?

388
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,320
This place might have something
to do with your birthdates.

389
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,479
Would you like to go with me?

390
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:09,200
Yes, of course.

391
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,599
Thank you.

392
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,280
Xiu, you are back.

393
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:28,519
Master, are you going to take Mr. Yue
and the others to the Spring Vein?

394
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,719
How could you let them enter

395
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,920
such an important place?

396
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
It seems

397
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,639
you still have some sense
of guarding the hole of spring.

398
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,920
I was just stating the fact.

399
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:48,280
Mr. Yue and Miss Yue might have

400
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,160
a deep connection with the Nine Springs.

401
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:51,920
I had a divination last night.

402
00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:55,399
There may be some anomalies
in the Spring Vein.

403
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,119
It'd be nice
to take some precautions in advance.

404
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,239
Divination is just asking for trouble.

405
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,479
Isn't it sadder to know the future

406
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,239
yet could do nothing?

407
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:11,960
The hole of Pureness
can foresee the future.

408
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,239
Whoever holds the key ring

409
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,320
may see a vision of the future

410
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,519
in the hole of spring.

411
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:22,599
Is that why

412
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,920
you've been reluctant
to be the guardian of Pureness?

413
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:32,479
The future may not be certain.

414
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,080
Master, you are too optimistic.

415
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,192
Since it has not yet happened,

416
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:40,632
how could it be predestined?

417
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,200
You should go along.

418
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,599
Never mind.

419
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,519
Since you don't want to go,

420
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,440
then I won't force you.

421
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,599
Master.

422
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,800
Master, we've arrived.

423
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,239
What is this?

424
00:25:21,999 --> 00:25:23,096
The entrance to the Pureness.

425
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,560
This is the Pureness,
one of the Shennong Nine Springs.

426
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,719
Mr. Yue, you know
about the Nine Springs?

427
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,080
I-I saw a mural once.

428
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:37,304
Shennong Nine Springs?

429
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:39,040
What are you talking about?

430
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:42,399
Mr. Ju, you'd know it if you go in.

431
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,399
The Pureness can foresee the future.

432
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,680
I am the guardian of Pureness.

433
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:49,440
The bracelet in my hand

434
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:51,160
is the key ring
that unlocks the Pureness.

435
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:56,920
Mr. Gu,
were your ancestors guardians too?

436
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,840
The key ring
is not passed down through generations,

437
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,320
but given to the chosen successor
by the previous guardian.

438
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:08,800
If the guardians fail
to give out the key rings and die,

439
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,080
the key ring will become
like an ordinary bracelet

440
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,999
until it meets the next destined one.

441
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:18,239
Senior Gu, does the strange event
three years ago have something

442
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,200
to do with it?

443
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:21,639
Exactly.

444
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:36,920
So this is
what the Nine Springs looks like.

445
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,160
I've heard about it,
but this is my first time seeing it.

446
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,999
Nine Springs have various shapes.

447
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,440
And the holes of springs also vary.

448
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,080
Everyone, come with me
into the Pureness.

449
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,368
(Wangchen Region)

450
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,719
Where is this?

451
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,599
It's so quiet
that makes me feel a little nervous.

452
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,479
This place is near the Netherworld.
Indeed it's tranquil.

453
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,200
N-N-Netherworld?

454
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,359
Just near it.

455
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,399
This place is called Wangchen Region.

456
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,216
At the end of this path
is the hole of spring Cold Marrow.

457
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:19,160
Isn't the hole of spring
called Pureness?

458
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:21,840
The Spring Veins are connected.

459
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:23,399
Since we have the Pureness key ring,

460
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,080
we can use it to enter the Spring Vein,

461
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,599
and then go to other holes.

462
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:28,639
But each hole has its own garrison.

463
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,399
If we approach
without the appropriate key ring,

464
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,040
we may be attacked by the garrison.

465
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,040
You should be careful.

466
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,040
You mean...

467
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,960
When you pass through this dark place

468
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
and reach the Cold Marrow,

469
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:43,680
I will tell you about the event
happened three years ago.

470
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,119
Is this a test?

471
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,160
Alright, deal.

472
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,479
Let's go.

473
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:52,999
Mr. Gu, aren't you coming with us?

474
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,160
You are not the guardians
of Cold Marrow, leave now.

475
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,639
W-We came with a guardian.

476
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,719
Without guardians,
the hole can't be opened.

477
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,176
It is the duty
of the Nine Springs garrison.

478
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:33,208
Are you the garrison of the Cold Marrow?

479
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,560
(Wangchen Siming)
I am Wangchen Siming.

480
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,800
Siming? Quite arrogant.

481
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,599
Among you,

482
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,599
two will die soon.

483
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,960
W-What do you mean?

484
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,320
Don't scare us.

485
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:49,080
This is what the Cold Marrow indicates.

486
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:50,840
Your days are counting down.

487
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,399
Better leave now.

488
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:54,519
Make yourself clear.

489
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,680
She could be deliberately deceiving

490
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,719
to scare us off.

491
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,960
Don't talk nonsense. We are not scared.

492
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,879
You'll be punished by heaven

493
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,080
if you don't leave.

494
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,399
You get angry when questioned.

495
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:09,320
Is that a garrison
of hole of spring all about?

496
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,639
Are you really not afraid of death?

497
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,560
Jinzhao, maybe we should listen to her

498
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,200
and leave now.

499
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:19,359
No, we have to move forward.

500
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,160
I'm with you.

501
00:29:22,872 --> 00:29:23,736
Interesting.

502
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,280
I wonder what lies ahead.

503
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,280
Master?

504
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,320
Zhaoyan.

505
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,399
Qi.

506
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:18,440
Qi.

507
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,920
Qi.

508
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,800
Jinzhao.

509
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,119
Qi.

510
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:23,800
I am here.

511
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,639
Jinzhao, what's wrong?

512
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,840
Qi.

513
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:27,800
Jinzhao!

514
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,560
Senior!

515
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,479
Ming Xiu.

516
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,320
Shifang?

517
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,840
What's wrong with them?

518
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,040
Why am I the only one who's fine?

519
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,920
What did you do to them?

520
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:18,479
Qi!

521
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:21,680
Bian Luohuan.

522
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,599
Bian Luohuan.

523
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,519
Stop.

524
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:31,680
Qi?

525
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,560
Master, take me away now.

526
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,359
Qi.

527
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:36,680
Qi.

528
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,960
Let me go.

529
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:38,920
Qi!

530
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,440
I'm getting tired of the Mindlink.

531
00:31:51,512 --> 00:31:52,160
Qi!

532
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,920
Jinzhao.

533
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,759
Jinzhao, I am right here.

534
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,599
Mindlink.

535
00:32:19,448 --> 00:32:21,239
(Jinzhao, wake up.)

536
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,960
Jinzhao, wake up.

537
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,440
(Jinzhao!)

538
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,160
(Wake up.)

539
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,688
You can't go with him.

540
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,160
You can't go with him.

541
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,272
I'm not going anywhere.

542
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,879
Jinzhao, it seems
everyone is trapped by spell.

543
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,119
Let's help them.

544
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:16,280
Miss Shuo Xuan.

545
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,599
Miss Shuo Xuan.

546
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,840
Miss Shuo Xuan, I am sorry.

547
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:29,719
I didn't mean to see you bathing

548
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,800
that time.

549
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,359
E-Ever since Luori Village,

550
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,200
I've...

551
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,359
I've been wanting

552
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:52,879
to see you again.

553
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:54,104
You coward!

554
00:33:55,064 --> 00:33:57,261
Miss Shuo Xuan, I am not a coward.

555
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,639
I've told you, if you come
within ten steps of me

556
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,519
and I'd tear you apart.

557
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,479
Miss Shuo Xuan.

558
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,200
Miss Shuo Xuan, let go of me.

559
00:34:10,392 --> 00:34:11,576
Master, don't!

560
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:13,752
Don't cut down that Bodhi tree!

561
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:32,800
Your eyes.

562
00:34:36,536 --> 00:34:37,528
Zhaoyan.

563
00:34:56,359 --> 00:34:56,999
Zhaoyan.

564
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:00,440
Why do you have to do so?

565
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:05,960
We clear our debt.

566
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,639
From now on, we don't owe each other

567
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,920
anything.

568
00:35:17,016 --> 00:35:17,557
Master.

569
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,399
Let go of me. Let...

570
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:21,639
Shifang.

571
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Miss Ming Xiu.

572
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,200
Let go of me.

573
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,759
Shifang.

574
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,119
Miss Shuo Xuan.

575
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,359
Let go of me.

576
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:27,879
Senior.

577
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:28,800
Let go of me.

578
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,920
Qi, no.

579
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,239
We have to find a way
to get them out of there.

580
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,320
I've already tried.

581
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,879
Let go of me.

582
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:37,200
Try using Mindlink.

583
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,519
Let go of me.

584
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,440
Let go of me.

585
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,880
Senior.

586
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,199
Miss Ming Xiu.

587
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,040
This isn't some new illusion, right?

588
00:36:30,759 --> 00:36:32,568
Congratulations on
breaking through your inner demons.

589
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,239
What I am about to tell you

590
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,800
is related to this Cold Marrow.

591
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,400
Among Nine Springs,
the Pureness can foresee the future,

592
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,199
while the Cold Marrow can tell
life and death in the world.

593
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,239
Life and death?

594
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,959
Is it similar to Book of Life and Death
from the Netherworld?

595
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,719
That's just a projection
of the Cold Marrow in the Netherworld.

596
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,159
Three years ago, I sensed

597
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,400
someone coming in and out
of the Pureness through the key ring.

598
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,759
Surprised, I hurried
to the hole of spring

599
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,959
only to find a turmoil
in the Spiritual Vein.

600
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,280
Following the turmoil,

601
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,800
I traced down here.

602
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:07,519
This lotus tree
is the hole of spring Cold Marrow.

603
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,999
On the Cold Marrow,

604
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,239
each Lotus corresponds to a life.

605
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,959
Flowers bloom and wither all the time,

606
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,759
just like life is born and fades away.

607
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:21,400
Each lotus corresponds
to the fate of each person.

608
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:23,000
This is the secret of Heaven,

609
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,840
not something
the mortals could see through.

610
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,400
It's really you.

611
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,640
I came here three years ago.

612
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,880
This twin lotus resonated
with the Pureness key ring,

613
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,080
appeared in front of me

614
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,479
and bloomed.

615
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:35,880
The fate of you two is connected.

616
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:41,159
The ordinary lotus should
grow from bud to bloom,

617
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:41,999
and then fade away.

618
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,679
Just like the life of a mortal.

619
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,759
Yet this twin lotus
appeared out of nowhere.

620
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,679
I can't tell its origin.

621
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,400
Mr. Yue, Miss Yue.

622
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,999
You two might have
a deep connection with the Nine Springs.

623
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:56,199
Mr. Gu, why is that?

624
00:37:56,919 --> 00:37:58,640
Miss Yue, please give me your hand.

625
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,199
The key ring is glowing.

626
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:07,560
The key ring I hold

627
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,040
resonates with you.

628
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:11,280
So you have a deep connection
with the spiritual vein.

629
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:14,080
And the fate of you and Mr. Yue

630
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,159
is closely connected.

631
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,136
The spiritual vein's been unstable
in recent years.

632
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,040
There might be some unforeseen events

633
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,519
that would involve you.

634
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,880
Mr. Yue, Miss Yue.

635
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,600
No matter what happens in the future,

636
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,679
I hope you remain cautious and fearless,

637
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:28,999
and never give up.

638
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:32,040
Never give up?

639
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,199
What do you mean?

640
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,120
You just said,

641
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,040
the Pureness could tell the future.

642
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,360
Do you know something?

643
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,759
Will we have a disaster in the future?

644
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,959
Besides,

645
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,519
you just said,

646
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,239
two of us

647
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:56,320
will die soon.

648
00:38:56,759 --> 00:38:58,199
You were just lying, right?

649
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,120
This is what the Cold Marrow indicates.

650
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,679
T-Then who are they?

651
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,719
The ones fated to die, of course.

652
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,919
Lady!

653
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,544
In my view,

654
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,239
decades are but a moment.

655
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,159
The garrison
has existed for millions of years.

656
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:26,719
She could be

657
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,560
talking about years away.

658
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:31,719
That's true.

659
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,872
Alright, let's head back.

660
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,776
