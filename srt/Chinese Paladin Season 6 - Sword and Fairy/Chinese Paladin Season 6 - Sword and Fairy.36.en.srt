=Episode 36=

21
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:05,907
You…

22
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:06,827
You have betrayed Her Lordship.

23
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,188
and the Yu clan.

24
00:02:08,547 --> 00:02:09,547
Why do you come here?

25
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:10,628
Do you intend

26
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,027
to wipe out the entire Yu clan?

27
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:18,027
I came to find Shuo Xuan.

28
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:19,827
Keep her name out of your mouth!

29
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,068
I do not want to harm you.

30
00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:26,867
You are not allowed

31
00:02:27,707 --> 00:02:28,747
to trespass the Sea of Clear Skies.

32
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:29,827
Young Lord.

33
00:02:38,987 --> 00:02:40,108
Young Lord, please follow me.

34
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:56,388
What is going on?

35
00:03:11,948 --> 00:03:12,788
Shuo Xuan.

36
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:13,668
You…

37
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:17,027
After Her Lordship's true form
fell into a deep sleep,

38
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:19,908
Shuo Xuan used Meditation Spell

39
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:21,987
to replace Kun's consciousness

40
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:24,867
and control her body.

41
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:26,747
Yue Qi.

42
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:28,468
You have finally come.

43
00:03:28,948 --> 00:03:30,188
Why do you want Rehai?

44
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:31,547
Why?

45
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:34,147
The reason lies above you.

46
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:56,228
Many of our people
were injured in this battle

47
00:03:57,188 --> 00:03:58,508
and are recuperating here.

48
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:06,668
I cannot make decisions regarding Rehai.

49
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:08,908
But I will consult with Zhaoyan.

50
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:10,707
You must not.

51
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:19,348
Ying Xuwei.

52
00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:20,987
What are you here for?

53
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:23,108
This has nothing to do with you.

54
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:25,228
You shall not lay your hands on Rehai.

55
00:04:25,828 --> 00:04:28,268
Then I will send Kun to the human world.

56
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:30,028
Don't.

57
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:30,947
Shuo Xuan,

58
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:33,627
let's just tell them

59
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:36,947
the real reason.

60
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,387
Her Lordship's consciousness
has fallen into slumber.

61
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:43,867
Kun's body instinctively needs energy

62
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:46,108
to heal the wounds from the battle.

63
00:04:49,507 --> 00:04:50,828
Repressing this instinct alone

64
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:54,028
has already exhausted Shuo Xuan.

65
00:04:56,387 --> 00:04:57,627
Without the power of Rehai,

66
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:00,547
eventually, she won't
be able to hold on.

67
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:03,547
So you want the power of Rehai

68
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,747
to cure Zhu Yu.

69
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,788
Rehai can only provide temporary relief.

70
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:12,268
If Kun

71
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:15,108
cannot complete the transformation,

72
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:17,028
your Yu Clan,

73
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:18,507
including Zhu Yu,

74
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:21,627
must enter the time stasis.

75
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:23,148
Ying Xuwei.

76
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:25,828
Do you want to see a catastrophe
in the human world again?

77
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:31,268
I have an idea.

78
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:33,427
Let's hear it.

79
00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:36,228
I possess the bloodline of Kun.

80
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:39,148
I can provide my spiritual
power to Zhu Yu

81
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:40,547
to calm her instincts.

82
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:42,547
In this way,

83
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:44,828
it will not affect the human world.

84
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:47,028
Have you thought it through?

85
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:50,387
Zhu Yu has been sleeping
for ten thousand years.

86
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:52,867
Providing her with your spiritual power

87
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:55,148
could be fatal to you.

88
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:57,668
Not a bad way to make up.

89
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:01,468
But I have a condition.

90
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:03,148
The sleeping Yu Clan

91
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:05,348
will enter the time stasis
together with Zhu Yu.

92
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:07,468
The awakened Yu Clan

93
00:06:08,348 --> 00:06:09,268
may return to the sea.

94
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:10,627
Yue Qi.

95
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:12,507
- How dare you?
- Shuo Xuan.

96
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:15,468
To seize Rehai to treat the Yu Clan,

97
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:17,867
we harmed innocent humans.

98
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:20,067
We cannot make the same mistake again.

99
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:24,708
Even if we lose,

100
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,067
our Yu Clan

101
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:32,507
mustn't lose our dignity.

102
00:06:40,307 --> 00:06:40,987
Young Lord.

103
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:47,028
Young Lord.

104
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:54,788
I'm counting on you.

105
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,268
I'm also responsible for the Yu Clan.

106
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:09,187
Shuo Xuan.

107
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:12,507
I didn't fulfill my duty
as the daughter.

108
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:14,987
After this is settled,

109
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:18,307
you should take over as the Young Lord.

110
00:07:18,947 --> 00:07:19,507
Yue Qi.

111
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:20,708
What do you mean?

112
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,028
Apologizing to the Yu Clan?

113
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:23,588
Or did you realize

114
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:25,028
they're your burden now?

115
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:25,908
Shuo Xuan.

116
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,348
I am Zhu Yu's daughter,

117
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:32,668
but I've never lived among the Yu Clan.

118
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:36,947
Shuo Xuan understands and
cares for them more than I do.

119
00:07:37,828 --> 00:07:38,987
She is more suitable for the role.

120
00:07:42,987 --> 00:07:43,588
Mr. Ying.

121
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:45,348
What do you think of it?

122
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:54,187
I agree.

123
00:07:58,747 --> 00:07:59,828
Then, we must trouble you

124
00:08:01,028 --> 00:08:02,507
to open the Mist Soul afterward.

125
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:41,548
Young Lord!

126
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:44,747
Thank you.

127
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:54,507
Ying Xuwei.

128
00:09:23,468 --> 00:09:25,787
I will follow Her Lordship
into the time stasis.

129
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:29,387
Shuo Xuan.

130
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:35,267
Entering the time stasis

131
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:38,267
equals eternal imprisonment.

132
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:43,147
You are young.

133
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,267
If we migrate to the sea,

134
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,907
we can start over again.

135
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,667
Her Lordship is our savior.

136
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:00,267
I should stay by her side.

137
00:10:02,147 --> 00:10:03,787
I'm also doing you a favor

138
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:05,708
by accompanying Her Lordship.

139
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:07,828
From now on, we are even.

140
00:10:12,948 --> 00:10:14,228
I am willing to follow Her Lordship

141
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:16,907
to the time stasis.

142
00:10:18,228 --> 00:10:20,108
I am willing to follow Her Lordship

143
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:22,708
to the time stasis.

144
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:24,228
You…

145
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:34,068
I knew it.

146
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:37,828
We Yu Clan are all fearless warriors.

147
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:49,708
Shuo Xuan.

148
00:10:53,507 --> 00:10:54,308
Please take care of her.

149
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,027
She is also my mother.

150
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:48,147
Mother.

151
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:13,627
Xiaoyuan.

152
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:16,507
Go back to rest.

153
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:13,147
Now,

154
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:15,108
everything

155
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:18,468
is finally over.

156
00:13:22,027 --> 00:13:23,828
At the grand ceremony,
the drums will sound.

157
00:13:25,987 --> 00:13:27,747
The flower will pass on.
The dancer will be found.

158
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:30,867
Beautiful women will
sing harmonious songs.

159
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:35,428
Spring orchids and autumn chrysanthemums

160
00:13:36,907 --> 00:13:38,387
shall never cease

161
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:42,108
through the ages.

162
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:35,867
Qingfei.

163
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:39,267
Your left hand is about to rust.

164
00:14:57,907 --> 00:14:58,747
Qingfei.

165
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:01,027
If you don't wake up,

166
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,828
mushrooms will grow on you.

167
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:09,027
Qingfei.

168
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:11,468
Do you want to go bask in the sun?

169
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:14,188
I'll take you out in a moment.

170
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,787
It's finally over.

171
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:43,387
Yes.

172
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:45,867
The Yu clan has entered the time stasis.

173
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:47,987
No disasters in the human world.

174
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:50,588
This is the best possible ending.

175
00:15:57,627 --> 00:15:58,948
You have been greatly weakened.

176
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:00,828
You must rest well.

177
00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:08,387
We've arrived at the wasteland.

178
00:16:17,147 --> 00:16:18,308
Do you remember, Xiu?

179
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,428
This is where we met

180
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:23,667
Zhaoyan and Little Yue.

181
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:27,667
Back then,

182
00:16:29,027 --> 00:16:30,068
they were all with us.

183
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:43,027
Everyone,

184
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:45,027
thank you.

185
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:48,348
Let's part ways from here.

186
00:16:53,468 --> 00:16:54,027
Miss Yue.

187
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:55,588
Where are you going?

188
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:02,667
Will you do something foolish?

189
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:06,108
Of course not.

190
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:14,627
People meet and part like duckweed.

Little Yue.

193
00:17:21,028 --> 00:17:21,828
Take care.

194
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:24,467

195
00:17:26,308 --> 00:17:26,907

196

197
00:17:34,508 --> 00:17:35,627
You take care as well.

198
00:17:37,147 --> 00:17:37,828
You too.

199
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:34,988
And you?

200
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:40,627
I…

201
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:46,707
I want to seek the art of eternal life.

202
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:52,508
Maiming borrowed my life before.

203
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:55,227
Although the curse has been lifted,

204
00:18:56,147 --> 00:18:57,627
the lifespan he took from me

205
00:18:58,548 --> 00:18:59,308
has not been returned.

206
00:19:00,268 --> 00:19:01,387
The time I have left

207
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:02,788
is not much.

208
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:06,348
If I were to die like this,

209
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:08,588
even if fate allows us to meet again,

210
00:19:10,988 --> 00:19:12,308
I certainly would not remember

211
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:14,268
the time I had with you.

212
00:19:17,427 --> 00:19:18,387
I will not accept that.

213
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:22,907
I will go with you.

214
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:38,947
And you, Xiu?

215
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:42,108
I'll return to Mount Yuqing.

216
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,187
You can have the Yunlai Stone.

217
00:19:51,788 --> 00:19:52,268
Xiu.

218
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:54,788
Take care of yourself.

219
00:19:56,508 --> 00:19:57,707
Mind your own business.

220
00:19:58,988 --> 00:19:59,788
Miss Ming, take care.

221
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:01,907
Goodbye.

222
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:20,548
If we miss Miss Ming,

223
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:23,508
we can go see her at Mount Yuqing.

224
00:20:25,427 --> 00:20:26,427
But Miss Yue…

225
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:33,147
We'll meet again if fate allows.

226
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:38,508
We have witnessed

227
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:39,988

We should be near
the place in the legend now.

283
00:25:20,403 --> 00:25:23,244
This art of eternity
truly left no trace.

284
00:25:23,643 --> 00:25:24,964
We've been searching for days,

285
00:25:25,203 --> 00:25:26,123
but without success.

286
00:25:27,044 --> 00:25:28,883
I'm afraid we've started
this journey in vain.

287
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,244
The world is vast.

288
00:25:33,203 --> 00:25:34,244
We will find it eventually.

289
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,284
But I don't want anymore.

290
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:46,163
Since it cannot be found,

291
00:25:46,643 --> 00:25:48,524
I will cultivate alongside you

292
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:50,084
to seek immortality.

293
00:25:50,363 --> 00:25:50,724
How about it?

294
00:25:52,123 --> 00:25:53,403
Are you sure about this?

295
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,843
Although this place is secluded,

296
00:26:02,203 --> 00:26:03,724
there are countless creatures here.

297
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:07,284
These plants also seem especially lush.

298
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:09,683
Is this the nimbus you spoke of?

299
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:14,564
This is indeed a good
place for recuperating.

300
00:26:14,804 --> 00:26:15,203
Good.

301
00:26:15,883 --> 00:26:17,044
Then let's cultivate here.

302
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:23,764
But I have no strength left now.

303
00:26:25,203 --> 00:26:27,044
I'm afraid I'll need you to help me up.

304
00:26:34,123 --> 00:26:35,843
You've lost all your strength.

305
00:26:37,564 --> 00:26:40,764
I guess you can't help me
with my hairpin anymore.

306
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:44,843
Of course I can.

307
00:26:47,163 --> 00:26:48,324
But do you really understand

312
00:28:28,443 --> 00:28:29,643
from the stream of memories.

313
00:28:30,683 --> 00:28:32,044

318
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:43,163

00:28:43,683 --> 00:28:46,964

to save the common folk,

408
00:34:33,524 --> 00:34:37,044

The one most worthy of mention

413
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:48,884
is the man who risked his own life

414
00:34:49,044 --> 00:34:50,564
