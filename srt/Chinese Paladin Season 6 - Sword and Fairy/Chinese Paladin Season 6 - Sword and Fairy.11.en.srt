21
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,399
The spiritual vein
has been unstable in recent years.

22
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,599
Something bad may occur and involve you.

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,439
Mr. Yue and Miss Yue,
no matter what happens in the future,

24
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,599
I hope you remain cautious
and brave and never give up.

25
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,919
Never give up?

26
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,040
What do you mean?

27
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:25,640
You just mentioned the hole of spring
Pureness could tell the future.

28
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,200
Do you know something?

29
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,719
Will we have a disaster in the future?

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,000
And you just said

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,800
two of us would die soon.

32
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,759
You're just lying, right?

33
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,800
This is what the Cold Marrow indicates.

34
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,120
T-Then who are they?

35
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,239
The ones fated to die, of course.

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,480
Lady.

37
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,640
In my view, decades are but a moment.

38
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,704
The hole of spring Garrison
has existed for millions of years.

39
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,080
She could be talking about years away.

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,088
That's right.

41
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,320
Alright, let's go back.

42
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,032
Let's go.

43
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,239
Shifang, you seem unhappy.

44
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,320
I'm truly worried about
the words of Wangchen Siming.

45
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,360
She is a Siming,
holding human destiny in her grip.

46
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,960
Don't overthink it.

47
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,559
The two people she mentioned
could be me and Jinzhao.

48
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,759
What nonsense?

49
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,119
Shifang, if one's life
is truly predestined

50
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:12,600
and cannot be changed,

51
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,800
how absurd and boring that would be?

52
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,280
I'd rather believe

53
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,199
that there's simply no such thing
as fate in this world.

54
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520
Unchangeable.

55
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,240
That is not the fate I understand.

56
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,664
Mr. Gu.

57
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,759
Look, what do you think
the fate of this tree is?

58
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,520
It may be dying soon, right?

59
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:38,319
What if I move it to a place
with plentiful water and fertile land

60
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,919
and regularly prune it?

61
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,839
Then perhaps being saved
by you is its fate.

62
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,559
What if I change my mind
after hearing your words?

63
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:51,360
In my view, the future
holds countless possibilities,

64
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,319
and among them, there is one that seems
to be most likely to come true.

65
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,800
People call it "fate".

66
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,640
But if someone with enough conviction
and strength to defy the path of heaven,

67
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,280
it's not impossible
to take another path.

68
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,720
Simply put, it's like this tree.

69
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:14,880
If left to its own, it would surely die.

70
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,679
But if someone saves it
and it fights for its own survival,

71
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,736
there may be a way out.

72
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,800
Even the slightest change
will alter Pureness's prophecy.

73
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,360
Is that so, Mr. Gu?

74
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,640
You're so clever.

75
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,784
It's good there's still hope.

76
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,880
Shifang, let's go back then.

77
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:42,680
Okay.

78
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,399
Everyone has left,
and you're still here.

79
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,839
Is there something you can't figure out?

80
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,512
Mr. Gu.

81
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,800
Don't force things.

82
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,000
When the time comes,
answers will come out.

83
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,039
Yes, you're right.

84
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,160
You and Miss Yue
are not biological siblings, are you?

85
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,679
No.

86
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:21,239
Xian Qing told me you and Miss Yue
were practicing a spell called...

87
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:25,600
Omnipotent

88
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,920
Mindlink.

89
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,679
Omnipotent. How interesting.

90
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:32,959
May I ask where you learned this skill?

91
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,200
Qi and I knew it as soon as we woke up
in the Wuyan Village.

92
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,280
It really is magical.

93
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,160
Since the spell exists with you two,

94
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,880
it seems the secret
may lie in the feelings.

95
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,320
The longer the two of you are together
and the deeper the feelings,

96
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,679
the more powerful the spell becomes.

97
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,959
The deeper the feelings,
the stronger the power.

98
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:05,679
By the way, may I ask something?

99
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:06,808
Okay, please.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,600
Why did you tell Qi to think for herself

101
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,920
and stop always listening to others?

102
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,519
Isn't this the way it should be?

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,239
Qi is naive, kind and easily deceived.

104
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,839
We have depended on each other
for these three years.

105
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,959
I'm not some random person.

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,399
Besides, didn't you say
the deeper our bond,

107
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,600
the stronger Mindlink would be?

108
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,000
Miss Yue's being independent

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,040
doesn't conflict
with your bond's deepening.

110
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,600
From what I've seen these past few days,

111
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Miss Yue is innocent,
but she's not foolish.

112
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,000
One day she'll understand

113
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,839
that her world does not only
consist of the two of you.

114
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,119
Overprotection, in the end, is improper.

115
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,160
No, she can't live without me.

116
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,480
Is it really that Miss Yue
can't live without you

117
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,119
or you can't live without Miss Yue?

118
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,160
As you have seen,

119
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,799
Qi and I are destined
to be together forever.

120
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,639
Does the question matter?

121
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,519
I'll take my leave.

122
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,056
Jinzhao,

123
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:48,200
still thinking about
what Wangchen Siming said?

124
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,559
Didn't Mr. Gu say fate could be changed?

125
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,320
Qi, we came into this world together.

126
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,480
Have you ever thought about
what exactly our relationship is?

127
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,160
Regardless of what our relationship is,

128
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
we will always be together anyway.

129
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,839
What difference does it make
to know or not?

130
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,200
But this world is much bigger
than we imagine.

131
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,239
Are you sure
we can really be together forever?

132
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:28,000
Certainly. I'll take you
with me wherever I go,

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,519
because I'm going to protect you.

134
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,239
(Never mind. I've already decided
to be your lifelong support.)

135
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,519
(Forget about defining
our relationship.)

136
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,680
Follow me.

137
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,920
Let's go.

138
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:09,799
Qi, Mr. Gu said the deeper our bond,

139
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,119
the more powerful Mindlink would be.

140
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,399
Shall we try to deepen our bond further?

141
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,136
How do we try?

142
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:26,920
The ancients said the night

143
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,439
was the best time
to deepen the relationship.

144
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,999
Just through watching the moon?

145
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:37,600
Of course not.
There should be poems as well.

146
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,832
What poems?

147
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,016
Let me give it a try.

148
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,040
Listen. Night after night, I yearn
for you. Even the moon seems dimmed.

149
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,464
What do you think?

150
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:01,560
How's it?

151
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,616
What does it mean?

152
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:09,464
Jinzhao, look.

153
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:20,759
They are called Tideng.

154
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,160
Mr. Gu said every year in spring,

155
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,280
they would migrate from the clouds.

156
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,839
They may temporarily
bring back lost spells.

157
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,360
Lost spells?

158
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,480
Can we catch one and carry it with us?

159
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,160
They are spirits. You can't catch them.

160
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:52,920
What are you doing?

161
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:56,480
Haven't you always wanted
to try sword flying?

162
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,519
Let's give it a try.

163
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,160
Is your Thought Sword okay?

164
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,600
Just give it a try.

00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:10,264
♪Among the vast sea of people♪

182
00:13:10,264 --> 00:13:12,216
♪I engrave your name♪

183
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:19,128
♪Believe me, you're the only one♪

184
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,959
Jinzhao, have we bonded by doing this?

185
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,360
Perhaps, maybe, I suppose.

186
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,768
Then let's try again.

187
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
How do we try?

188
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:46,519
You close your eyes first.

189
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,176
Yue Qi.

190
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,999
This is how you try?

191
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,360
Then you do it.

192
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,656
Come on.

193
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,592
Look, Jinzhao.

194
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,472
What?

195
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,160
Jinzhao, y-y-your lips are so soft.

196
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,600
Qi, do you have any idea...?

197
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,639
Forget it, it's late. Let's go back.

198
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,656
You're blushing.

199
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,560
You saw it wrong.

200
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,720
It's true. You're blushing.
I didn't see it wrong.

201
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,208
Let me look.

202
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,560
It seems that Xian Qing and Xiu

203
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,920
will have profound entanglements
with Mr. Yue and Miss Yue in the future.

204
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,560
Seeing the light on in the study,
I knew you were still working.

205
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,800
Do you have something to tell me?

206
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,879
Today in the illusion,

207
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,040
I saw you cut down
the hibiscus tree in the yard.

208
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,959
The first year I came to Mount Yuqing,

209
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,959
you planted that hibiscus tree for me.

210
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,480
But three years ago, I followed you
to the Spring Vein for the first time,

211
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,280
and after we came back,
you cut down the hibiscus tree

212
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,600
and planted a pear tree instead.

213
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,280
You also weren't as close
to me as before.

214
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:18,360
To this day,
you still haven't told me the reason.

215
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,839
And you keep trying to urge me
to take over as Pureness's guardian.

216
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,759
But who would want to inherit
a place that brought them heartache?

217
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,439
I told you I cut down the tree
to prevent you from being distracted

218
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:38,936
so that you could focus on
your cultivation.

219
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,600
You've grown up and should start
your own adventure and make friends

220
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,879
to complete your training sooner.

221
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,280
I can't take care of you forever.

222
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,920
It's late at night.
Go back and rest early.

223
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,519
Then let me take care of you forever.

224
00:17:04,152 --> 00:17:09,016
♪Why do I see tears
shimmering in your eyes♪

225
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:14,520
♪What I thought would be evergreen
withers between my fingers♪

226
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:20,024
♪Even our hug feels unnatural♪

227
00:17:20,696 --> 00:17:25,208
♪If it's all fate♪

228
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,480
Let go of those thoughts.

229
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,624
It's impossible.

230
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:38,959
I'm a stubborn person,

231
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,280
and you've never beaten me
at being stubborn.

232
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,920
You could cut down the hibiscus tree
in this courtyard,

233
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,519
but you can never cut down

234
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:55,959
the one in my heart.

235
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:26,879
Why am I so hot?

236
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:49,912
This isn't right.

237
00:18:58,399 --> 00:18:59,416
Nor is this.

238
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,040
Why can't I find that feeling
from just now anymore?

239
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,239
(So this is the feeling.)

240
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:03,672
(Zhengwu Alliance)

241
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:12,160
Could it be the Zhengwu Alliance?

242
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,080
Shifang.

243
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,224
Jinzhao.

244
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:40,119
Shifang, I've never heard you mention
anything about the Zhengwu Alliance.

245
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,040
Why are you suddenly asking this?

246
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,519
Isn't my injury healed?

247
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,800
According to our previous agreement,
it's time to go to Luo.

248
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,239
Doesn't it mean
I'm going to your alliance?

249
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,519
Tell me a bit so I have an idea.

250
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,440
For example, what does your leader
look like? Is he strict with people?

251
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:10,200
Alright. Our leader wears black clothes
all year round and has a beard.

252
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,840
He gives off a feeling
of both boldness and authority.

253
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:15,759
Everyone respects him greatly.

254
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:21,080
(So the person I saw last night
must have been Zuo Guanren.)

255
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,320
When do you plan to leave, Jinzhao?

256
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,040
No time like the present.

257
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,928
I'll inform Mr. Gu
and we will set off tomorrow.

258
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:38,519
(Now there's no reason to keep
dragging my feet and not go back.)

259
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:05,759
Xiu, how much longer
are you going to dawdle?

260
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:09,200
Yue and the others
are waiting for you to set off together.

261
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,280
Master, let me stay with you
for a few more days.

262
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,719
It's good to go down the mountain
and experience life when you're young.

263
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:24,719
There's not much good in it.

264
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:27,080
Master, the spells you taught me
come from the Taoist school.

265
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,759
Taoists value serenity and natural action.

266
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Isn't our seclusion here
in line with their principles?

267
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,000
Why should I go down the mountain?

268
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,320
How can one speak of transcendence
without experiencing life?

269
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,759
Only after trials can you understand
the path you truly want to take.

270
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,639
But don't I often go down the mountain
to exorcise demons?

271
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:47,896
And I've joined the Zhengwu Alliance.

272
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,479
You were an obedient
and cute little girl.

273
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,280
Now you've become
so solitary and oblique.

274
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:03,239
It's all my fault.

275
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,519
I knew full well
that I didn't know how to raise a child

276
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,960
and that Xian Qing could only
teach you things about demons,

277
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,800
but I never had the heart
to have you adopted by a normal family.

278
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,080
I really shouldn't have.

279
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:17,016
So it's on me?

280
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:23,399
No, it's all my fault.

281
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,680
Master, no need to say more. I'll go.

282
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,040
Your master's acting is bad.

283
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:45,200
A gentleman does not speak ill
of others behind their backs.

284
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,359
That's why I haven't tried
to hide it, have I?

285
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:52,280
Why don't you accompany Xiu
on her trip as a light punishment?

286
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:54,936
I knew it.

287
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,080
It just so happens
that you want to go to Jing'an, right?

288
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,200
You should set off before it's late.

289
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,359
Master, I don't want
that answer anymore.

290
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,800
Could you let me stay to accompany you?

291
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:22,399
Xiu, take good care of yourself
when you're away from home.

292
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:24,759
And try to care more about others.

293
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,280
I just need you.

294
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,399
Xiu wants to stay by your side.

295
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,160
Why are you pushing her away?

296
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,280
She's already 18.
She should have a better future.

297
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,440
The stubbornness of humans.

298
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,119
Xian Qing, please
take good care of Xiu for me.

299
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:07,639
No need to say more. I'll go.

300
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,216
Take care.

301
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:37,551
(Jing'an)

302
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,119
Last time, I mentioned
the beginning of the world.

303
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,519
Five steamers of Xiaolongbao. Enjoy.

304
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,320
Shifang, the baozi are here.

305
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:04,560
Come on, let's eat baozi.

306
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,160
To know what happens next,
come here next time.

307
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,080
Shifang, are you still
thinking about that prophecy?

308
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,320
Mr. Gu said it might change.
Don't worry too much.

309
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:23,999
I'm not thinking about that.
I'm thinking...

310
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,160
Is it the Bian Luohuan affair
that you're worried about?

311
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,320
I was going to capture a didact
of the Qiyuan Sect to prove myself,

312
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:36,359
but that person ran away.

313
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:39,040
Did we destroy the Fujin Hall?

314
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:42,680
Yes.

315
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,704
I'll count it on you.

316
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:47,519
Really?

317
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,960
And also everything
at the Luori Village is on you.

318
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:53,960
Jinzhao, I toast to you.

319
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,680
Xiu and I were at the Luori Village too.
How come you don't toast to us?

320
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,119
Yes, a toast to all.

321
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:04,519
Let me toast with soup.

322
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:07,359
Don't mention it.

323
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,639
I hear there's trouble
at the entrance of the Zhengwu Alliance.

324
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:10,960
It seems to be the Qiyuan Sect.

325
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,200
- Let's go take a look.
- Let's go.

326
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,624
I'll go back to the alliance to check.

327
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,344
Shifang, let's go together.

328
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:17,432
Let's go.

329
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,759
Please wrap these up.
We'll come back to pick them up later.

330
00:27:35,928 --> 00:27:38,776
(Zhengwu Alliance, the top martial faction)
Step back. Did you hear that?

331
00:27:38,776 --> 00:27:40,879
All of you move back.

332
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:42,519
You all, move back.

333
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,040
If anyone takes one more step forward,
I'll kill my daughter.

334
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:52,599
Aren't they Lv Dazhi
and his daughter Lv Fei'er?

335
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:53,656
You know them?

336
00:27:53,656 --> 00:27:56,320
He's my neighbor.
He joined the Qiyuan Sect last year.

337
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,768
He donated all his family property
and caused his wife's death in anger.

338
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,280
You lackeys should have died long ago.

339
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,800
Where's Zuo Guanren? Call him out!

340
00:28:38,872 --> 00:28:39,960
I can't see either.

341
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,359
Get down. What are you looking at?

342
00:28:48,999 --> 00:28:50,040
What are you looking at?

343
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,399
Stop deceiving the common people.

344
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:57,960
Call Zuo Guanren out!

345
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,960
My lord, how far
has the drama progressed?

346
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,840
Zuo Guanren, if you don't come out,

347
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,239
I'll kill my daughter!

348
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:11,359
How is Lv Dazhi's performance?

349
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,440
Not bad.

350
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:14,712
I got him.

351
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,352
Zuo Guanren!

352
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,720
(Zhengwu Alliance)

353
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,399
It's Leader Zuo.
Leader Zuo has come out.

354
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,480
Leader Zuo has come out.

355
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,600
It's Leader Zuo.

356
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,119
This is Leader Zuo.

357
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,639
Why are those crazy ones here?

358
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:32,800
- What?
- Don't move.

359
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:44,479
Don't move.

360
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:46,119
My lord, I need to verify something.

361
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,999
Laying hands on a child?

362
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:50,072
Yeah.

363
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,192
(Zuo Guanren, Zhengwu Alliance Leader)
I am Zuo Guanren.

364
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,040
Zuo Guanren, you finally show up.

365
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,560
Everyone take a good look.
This is Zuo Guanren.

366
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,960
He slaughtered our sect leader
and persecuted our buddies.

367
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,320
He obstructs the great rise of our sect.

368
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,599
You have done all the evil you could.

369
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,680
Stop talking nonsense.

370
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,888
The Qiyuan Sect has committed
numerous evils.

371
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:17,160
They bewitch people and destroy
families, provoking great wrath.

372
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:22,552
If we turn a blind eye,
wouldn't that dishearten the people?

373
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:23,608
- Right.
- Yes.

374
00:30:23,608 --> 00:30:24,792
- Well said.
- Yeah.

375
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:28,952
Shut up.

376
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,519
Zuo Guanren, you're talking nonsense.
Today I'm going to tell you.

377
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:36,359
From now on, you're not allowed
to sabotage our sect. Do you hear me?

378
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:38,840
We never let go of evildoers.

379
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:43,599
If you have a shred of humanity left,
let go of your daughter.

380
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:46,399
Just agree to him first
to save that young girl.

381
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,759
No, that will only
encourage the Qiyuan Sect

382
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:50,320
to capture more people to threaten them.

383
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:52,568
We must save the person.

384
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,639
Doing this sort of thing.

385
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:57,359
Is there such a father?

386
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,424
Really.

387
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,040
Don't you feel pity?

388
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,680
How will this child face things
when she grows up?

389
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,359
Wen Yang, quick!

390
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,368
Yes.

391
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,639
Don't move. Don't come. Do you hear me?

392
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,560
To eliminate dissenters,
you even don't care about a life.

393
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,040
You forced me into this.

394
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,479
Today, I will ascend with my daughter,
using blood as our libation.

395
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:23,040
Wait. Wait.

396
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,119
Maybe Jinzhao has some way.

397
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,399
Jinzhao has a brilliant plan.

398
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,040
Wait.

399
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,359
Stop right there.

400
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:33,599
Bro, I'm friendly.

401
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,879
To be honest, I've been displeased
with the Zhengwu Alliance for so long.

402
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:39,519
Under the guise of eliminating the sect,

403
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,920
they're seeking fame and fortune.

404
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,920
How dare you offend Lord Ming?
You're unforgivable. You are dead.

405
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:49,719
Yeah.

406
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:53,840
Bro, congratulations
on your successful ascension, but...

407
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,608
But what?

408
00:31:57,719 --> 00:32:01,359
But people die
every moment in the world.

409
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:06,359
How will Lord Ming know you die
for the great cause of the sect?

410
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,479
Any loyal disciple

411
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,479
receives Lord Ming's token.

412
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,639
What did he take out?

413
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:25,599
- Flying.
- It's flying.

414
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:29,759
It's Lord Ming.
Lord Ming is summoning me.

415
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:35,680
(I must not let the orb harm Qi.)

416
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,080
I got the token.

417
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,800
I got the token. I have the token.

418
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,200
I got the token.

419
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,320
I'm going to ascend.

420
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,800
I'm going to ascend to serve Lord Ming.

421
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,512
I'm going to ascend.

422
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,320
I'm going to ascend.

423
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:57,800
This child must be delirious.

424
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:10,680
The Zhengwu Alliance
really lives up to its reputation.

425
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,280
Yeah, look,
the one using a hidden weapon

426
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,280
(Wen Yang, Yongwu Hall Head)
is Wen Yang, Yongwu Hall Head.

427
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,680
(Qiu Lingyun, Cloud Hall Head)
And that lady is Qiu Lingyun.

428
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,759
She's the head of the Cloud Hall.
She can move very swiftly and lightly.

429
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,599
It's really a place full of talent.
You're a head, so you are powerful too.

430
00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:33,200
Director Gao,

431
00:33:34,999 --> 00:33:36,399
I'm sorry.

432
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,320
I'm sorry.

433
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:42,320
My apologies. I was just too astonished.

434
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,560
I was stupid.
I shouldn't have trusted you.

435
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,560
Quick, pooh.

436
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,759
How can you call yourself stupid?

437
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:52,960
You are the next one
of our sect who will ascend.

438
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,639
How can you say that? Wasn't I just...?

439
00:33:55,639 --> 00:34:00,080
Didn't you say that Lv
had very good eloquence?

440
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,080
Didn't you say he could tarnish
the reputation of the Zhengwu Alliance?

441
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,840
How would I know
there would be six buzzkills?

442
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,519
But then again,
those people are always around.

443
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,879
Who can say otherwise?

444
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,800
Thankfully you're our leader.

445
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,560
Every time, you manage to lead
a strategic retreat successfully.

446
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:26,639
These people really
are like gum on a shoe.

447
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,920
You can't shake them off at all.

448
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,128
Do you understand what I mean?

449
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:35,800
Do you mean to say we are shoes?

450
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,680
You're a shoe.

451
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,759
Yes.

452
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:44,080
What I mean to say is

453
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,599
we can't do anything about those guys.

454
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,879
Then let the Zhengwu Alliance
deal with them.

455
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,479
Wouldn't it be easier
if you just said it directly?

456
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
Continue.

457
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:03,080
This time, stay down for me.

458
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,216
Alright.

459
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,599
If you move again, I'll beat you up.

460
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,160
Amazing.

461
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,280
- Good.
- Good.

462
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
Are you okay?

463
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,600
Are you okay?

464
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,119
You're fit to be a father?

465
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,576
Leader.

466
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,448
The Qiyuan Sect
can even manage to bewitch people

467
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,200
to commit such unconscionable acts.

468
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,999
It fully shows their evil nature.

469
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:06,479
I've long sworn to lead the removal
of the sect for the peace of the people.

470
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:07,959
- Good.
- Good.

471
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:15,719
- Wipe out the Qiyuan Sect.
- Wipe out the Qiyuan Sect.

472
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:18,360
We need to deal with the aftermath.

473
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,519
Please, everyone, disperse.

474
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:31,480
Lingyun, take good care
of this little girl.

475
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,568
Yes.

476
00:36:32,568 --> 00:36:33,656
- Wen Yang.
- Yes.

477
00:36:33,656 --> 00:36:36,400
Lock the person up
and immediately investigate his home.

478
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,439
Yes.

479
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:39,320
- Take him away.
- Get up. Go.

480
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,959
Thank you all for your assistance.

481
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:44,080
Come with me to the hall to talk.

482
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:47,480
Let's all go inside as well.

483
00:36:50,759 --> 00:36:55,352
It's okay, girl.

484
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:02,040
Ming Xiu is so gentle.
She seems different.

485
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,439
Xiu must have thought of her childhood.

486
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,159
Childhood? What is that?

487
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,120
There's no need to talk about the past.

488
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,479
Fei'er, be good. You will go
with that lady in a while.

489
00:37:40,056 --> 00:37:42,256
Little girl, stop crying.

490
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,120
I've killed the demon.

491
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,759
But my mother...

492
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,560
Mother!

493
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:15,439
