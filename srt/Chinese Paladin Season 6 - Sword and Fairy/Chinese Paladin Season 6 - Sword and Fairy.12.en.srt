21
00:02:01,084 --> 00:02:03,036
(Zhengwu Alliance)

22
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,840
Qiyuan Sect is really wicked.

23
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
The ones who got fooled
are also foolish.

24
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,640
They're so naive to think
worshiping could get things easy.

25
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:21,496
(Yongwu Hall disciples)
Qiming,

26
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:23,200
(Xu Qiming, Chen Qianjun)
Head Ju has come back.

27
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,040
I saw him, Qianjun.
Among the Zhengwu Alliance's Heads,

28
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,480
he's the only one
who hasn't fought and won.

29
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,759
Right, he doesn't deserve
to be the Head.

30
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,599
I thought Jiqiao Hall is long gone.

31
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,640
Qianjun, Qiming.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,176
Shifang is our fellow and the Head.
Don't be rude.

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,239
Yes, Head Wen.

34
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:44,312
Get lost.

35
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,360
Shifang.

36
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,424
Yang.

37
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:55,680
It has been a long time.
I need to visit Lv Dazhi now.

38
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,439
You take good care of the guests.

39
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,840
I'll buy you drinks when I get back.

40
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:01,400
I'd take my leave.

41
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:05,560
Shifang.

42
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,760
This man seems
quite generous and righteous.

43
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:11,599
As Yongwu Hall's Head, Yang is friendly,

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,080
and he is also my best friend
in Zhengwu Alliance.

45
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,479
Xu Qiming and Chen Qianjun
are from his hall.

46
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,440
Shifang, how many people
are there in your Jiqiao Hall?

47
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,479
I'm the only one right now.

48
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,720
That means few people are
good at making mechanism these days.

49
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Shifang, I think you're amazing.

50
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,720
Thank you, Little Yue.

51
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,879
Let's go.

52
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,992
Let's go.

53
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,159
Your Zhengwu Alliance seems...

54
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,464
How's it? It's pretty good.

55
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:46,479
Pretty good.

56
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,608
Over there, up ahead.

57
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:48,664
Up ahead?

58
00:03:48,664 --> 00:03:49,752
Hurry up.

59
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,479
Zhaoyan, it has been a long time.
We miss you so much.

60
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,264
So do I.

61
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,919
It seems Zhaoyan doesn't miss us.

62
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,520
Senior, you still like to joke.

63
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,280
Luo, why weren't you there?

64
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,000
I heard the disturbance outside earlier,

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,759
but I'm not a member
of the Zhengwu Alliance,

66
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,959
so I waited here.

67
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,520
I didn't expect such a thing to happen.

68
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
We must eliminate
Qiyuan Sect right away.

69
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,360
Welcome to the Zhengwu Alliance.

70
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,440
Ming Xiu, how's your master?

71
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,919
Thank you for your concern,
he is all well.

72
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,759
Alliance Leader, they are my friends
I mentioned in the letter.

73
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,199
Little Yue, Jinzhao,
and Senior Xian Qing.

74
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,759
I have known you three
from the letters of Shifang.

75
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,479
Recently, I've also heard
of your heroic deeds from Master Luo.

76
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,039
It's an honor to meet you today.

77
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,528
You flatter us.

78
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,696
Shifang.

79
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,000
You've been gone for so long
and just sent only two letters.

80
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,160
I'm sorry, Alliance Leader.

81
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,520
Alliance Leader Zuo, Shifang
has been helping us on this journey.

82
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,479
Right. We destroyed stronghold
of Qiyuan Sect in Luori Village.

83
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,039
Shifang has indeed
made a great contribution.

84
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,880
Really?

85
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,720
It seems Shifang has made great progress
on this journey.

86
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,559
Please try the iced plum soup,
which is a specialty in Jing'an

87
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:38,520
and perfect for relieving the heat.
Please enjoy.

88
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:42,880
Refreshing.

89
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,928
Take it slow.

90
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,360
Miss Yue,
if you like it, you can have...

91
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,432
Another bowl.

92
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,440
You're being impolite.

93
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,328
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

94
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,399
I haven't been back for a long time.

95
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,600
I really miss this flavor.

96
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,080
In that case,
you should stay here a little longer.

97
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,399
I mean... Hey, I want another bowl too.

98
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:14,639
I learned from Shifang's letter
you are also investigating Qiyuan Sect.

99
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,839
Alliance Leader Zuo, Qiyuan Sect
has committed many evil deeds.

100
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,000
It's our job to get rid of them.

101
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,679
Yue, I have informed Alliance Leader Zuo
about the matter of Bian Luohuan.

102
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,720
Zhengwu Alliance and Qiyuan Sect
have been fighting for a long time,

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,600
but we've never had a clue
about their Didact.

104
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,920
Yue, don't get discouraged.

105
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:39,559
We've been receiving

106
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:42,720
a lot of anonymous information
from heroes in recent days.

107
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,359
With these clues,

108
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:48,239
we wiped out the stronghold
of Jiangning branch of Qiyuan Sect.

109
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,639
The sect leader of Qiyuan Sect was
inspecting there, so we killed him too.

110
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,720
Besides, I have a crystal

111
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:02,959
found by the Master Luo
from Luori Village's stronghold.

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,639
Unfortunately, we don't know its origin.

113
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,480
Do any of you might have a clue?

114
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,880
(Isn't it the crystal
from Wuyan Village?)

115
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,679
(How did it end up in Luori Village?)

116
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,000
(I might trade the information
about the crystal for a favor,)

117
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:18,839
(so I could ask the Zhengwu Alliance
to help us investigate our origins.)

118
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,280
Qi, doesn't this crystal look like
the one we saw in Wuyan Village?

119
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,040
Right. I remember when I woke up,

120
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,200
I think I've seen this crystal.

121
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,280
Alliance Leader Zuo, we've lived
in Wuyan Village for a while.

122
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:35,679
Since this crystal
is related to Wuyan Village,

123
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:39,959
if you don't mind,
we could go to investigate it.

124
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,519
Luo, do you think so?

125
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,192
Of course.

126
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:48,639
Good, then I shall await the good news.

127
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,079
Since you have come to Jing'an,

128
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,320
if you need anything, just tell Shifang.

129
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:57,144
Yes.

130
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,639
Come in, this is my Jiqiao Hall.

131
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,720
Shifang, your Jiqiao Hall looks so nice.

132
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,559
Shifang, what is this?

133
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,000
It's for measuring the wind power.

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,200
What's the use of it?

135
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,040
Of course, it is of great use.

136
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,839
Measuring the wind power would be useful

137
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,720
in war and farming.

138
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,920
Zhaoyan, you are amazing.

139
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,040
Right, I have a lot of
useful stuff in my room.

140
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,079
I'll show you.

141
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,160
Let's go. Here.

142
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,600
This is my room. Feel free to visit.

143
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,399
I've never seen a room like this.

144
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,480
Don't touch it!
This is my defense mechanism.

145
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,519
Don't touch it recklessly.

146
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,040
The rest is free to visit.

147
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,600
Shifang is really
passionate about mechanisms.

148
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,920
More than that,

149
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,239
he even wants to take
these wooden mechanisms as food.

150
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,600
The mechanism
comes from inner inspiration.

151
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,399
One day I will show the world
the benefits of them.

152
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,480
Yes, you have to promote them.

153
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,679
Thank you, Jinzhao.

154
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,720
Senior.

155
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,824
Thank you.

156
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,480
Zhaoyan, have some tea.

157
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,632
Thank you, Senior.

158
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,559
You've been in Jing'an for days.

159
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,799
Do you have any good scenes
to recommend?

160
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,839
I've been here these days
and didn't go sightseeing.

161
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:48,839
Senior, you might as well ask Shifang.

162
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:51,880
Yes, Senior Xian Qing.

163
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,000
If there's anything
you want to know about Jing'an,

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,192
you can just ask me.

165
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:59,399
Everyone, I am a bit tired
and want to take some rest.

166
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,136
Thank you, Shifang.

167
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,160
But now it is hot, I'll take a nap.

168
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,519
Jinzhao, why do Senior Xian Qing
and Zhaoyan seem a bit weird?

169
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,800
Can't you see
that Senior Xian Qing likes Zhaoyan?

170
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,519
Luo and Senior Xian Qing are both men.

171
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:41,519
It's impossible.

172
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:45,800
So does Senior Xian Qing like Luo?

173
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:48,344
Of course.

174
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:53,519
This is how Zhaoyan sees Xian Qing.

175
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:01,720
And this is
how Senior Xian Qing sees Zhaoyan.

176
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,920
So it's the unrequited love
described in the storybooks?

177
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:22,800
W-W-Well, this is terrible.

178
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Nothing terrible.

179
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,079
Are you hungry?
I'll take you for some snacks.

180
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:29,360
I'll take you.

181
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,456
You take care of the mechanisms.

182
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,504
- Let's go.
- Go to have snacks.

183
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:35,040
Right, then you take Little Yue
for some delicious food.

184
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,000
(Jing'an)

185
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:39,960
- Here, miss.
- Thank you.

186
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,959
Owner, I would like
water-chestnut cake, osmanthus cake,

187
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,399
sesame candy, chestnut pastry,
and cherry blossom custard.

188
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,439
Miss, eating too many sweets
would harm you.

189
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:49,999
But I want to eat them all.

190
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,664
I'll have one of each.

191
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,519
Jinzhao, I also want
to drink that plum soup.

192
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,639
Do you think we still have money?

193
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,128
Yes.

194
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,199
Miss, please wait,
I'll get some wrap paper.

195
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,528
Zhu.

196
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,496
Zhu, I've finally found you, Zhu.

197
00:12:17,496 --> 00:12:18,552
Who are you?

198
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,639
Let's go. I'll make you
something delicious.

199
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,240
- Who are you?
- Take care.

200
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,480
I don't know you.

201
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,839
- Qi.
- Come on, Zhu.

202
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:25,999
What's the matter?

203
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,040
She grabbed me.

204
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,592
Sorry, both of you, I'm sorry.

205
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:30,839
- This is my wife.
- Zhu.

206
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,160
Because we just lost
our daughter a while ago,

207
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,639
my wife couldn't withstand the shock
and lost her mind.

208
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,800
So upon seeing a girl at her age,
she would mistake her for Zhu.

209
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,240
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:43,079
Zhu.

211
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,879
Yaofang, that's not Zhu,
you have got the wrong person.

212
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,936
(Pastry Shop)
That's Zhu.

213
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,879
Zhu, look at me. Zhu.

214
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,519
Don't you recognize your mother anymore?

215
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:58,720
Yaofang, no. That's not Zhu.

216
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,800
Zhu.

217
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,639
Honey glazed lotus root, steamed buns,

218
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:10,759
and your favorite tofu pudding.

219
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,839
Don't worry. I won't leave.

220
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,112
Good then.

221
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,319
Jixing, bring the bowl to Zhu.

222
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,680
What do you call me?

223
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,800
Jixing.

224
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:40,079
Okay, here. The bowl.

225
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:42,680
Why are you so careless?

226
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,560
You forgot Zhu's favorite bowl.

227
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,519
Wait for me, I'll go get it.
I'll go get it now.

228
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,639
Your father is always careless.

229
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,800
Here, it's your mother
who cherishes you the most.

230
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,399
Zhu likes using this bowl the most.

231
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,199
Your mother remembers it.

232
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,720
It's getting late.
Why don't you go back now?

233
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,040
If you want to visit us next time,
we are always welcome.

234
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,160
What are you talking about?
Where do you want Zhu to go?

235
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:25,319
Yaofang, you forgot it again.
Zhu has already married.

236
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:27,600
S-She can't always come back.

237
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,720
Married?

238
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,519
Look at your mouth.

239
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,959
What if I'm not around?

240
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:45,920
She has married?

241
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,480
- She has married.
- Good.

242
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,040
Right, it's good she's married.

243
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,879
Candied hawthorn.

244
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,040
Jinzhao,
this pastry doesn't look delicious,

245
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,560
but it just tastes really good.

246
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,879
Is it the taste of mother's cooking?

247
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:08,024
Perhaps.

248
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,639
Shall we come back again?

249
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,240
Don't do this.

250
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,399
Senior, there are so many people here.

251
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,680
Senior, please behave.

252
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,199
Behave, Senior.

253
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,999
Are you asking me to behave?

254
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:43,879
Guest, I'm sorry, truly sorry.

255
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:47,759
Well, this dog ran over from the back.

256
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,319
But don't worry.
I'll handle this right away.

257
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,888
Go away.

258
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:02,079
Didn't you say you are tired
and need to rest? Why are you here

259
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:04,800
and playing with a dog?

260
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,120
I had enough rest,
so I came out for a stroll.

261
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,480
Since we're here,
let's have a cup of tea.

262
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,399
Sure, after you, Senior.

263
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,240
Why don't you even tell the difference
between a dog and a wolf?

264
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,999
Jinzhao, Jing'an is so beautiful,
with so many delicious foods.

265
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,800
Why do people still
believe in Qiyuan Sect?

266
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,720
Maybe they feel empty inside.

267
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,616
Empty?

268
00:16:54,616 --> 00:16:57,519
Yes, just like
when you woke up three years ago,

269
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,480
everything seemed to be behind a veil,

270
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,528
and had nothing to do with me.

271
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,999
But I've never felt that way.

272
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:09,319
Because back then you were a fool.

273
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,759
You're the fool.

274
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:13,839
I haven't finished.

275
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,319
But it's a good thing

276
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,800
I have a fool like you around.

277
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,959
I'm just starting to feel good
about having you around.

278
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:24,040
Because I don't have time to overthink

279
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,759
while taking care of you every day.

280
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,240
Otherwise, I'd have to believe in
something to fill the emptiness.

281
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,280
Alright, I'll give you this
for complimenting me.

282
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:39,879
Aren't you hungry?

283
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:42,600
This is the sweetest piece
I saved for you.

284
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,959
I can't believe you gave me
something delicious.

285
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,439
What?

286
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,720
There's something stuck on your lip.

287
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,079
Didn't you always wipe it off for me?

288
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,280
Is that Luo and Xian Qing?

289
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,439
It seems to be.

290
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,160
Zhaoyan, you don't have
to feel like you owe me.

291
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:52,800
After all, I had your demonic power
for over twenty years.

292
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,639
I even got you seriously hurt.

293
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,879
I am willing to do it for you.

294
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,759
And I promised you
I wouldn't put my life at risk again.

295
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,399
I have listened to what you said.

296
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:27,840
Jinzhao, I think it's not appropriate
to peek at them.

297
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,080
We are just doing so
for our friends. Look.

298
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:41,759
I have things to attend to.
I'd take my leave.

299
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,344
Senior.

300
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,359
Zhaoyan, are you avoiding me?

301
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,599
I thought we've made ourselves clear.

302
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,519
No, I'm not avoiding you.

303
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,200
Then why are you in such a hurry
to leave at the Jiqiao Hall?

304
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:07,160
Or don't you consider me as a friend?

305
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,359
No way. You are my friend, of course.

306
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,879
Making friends with a demon.

307
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:19,320
Aren't you afraid of damaging
the Luo family's reputation?

308
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,160
Senior, there's no need
to care about it as we are friends.

309
00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:34,639
I guess I can't invite you
to enjoy the sunset.

310
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,648
I'd leave.

311
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,040
They're leaving. Let's follow them.

312
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,479
You follow Xian Qing,
and I follow Zhaoyan.

313
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:01,840
Okay, just don't get lost.

314
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:05,239
It doesn't matter,
as you'll always find me.

315
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,664
Let's go.

316
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,200
Hairpins! Brand new hairpins!

317
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,096
Senior Xian Qing.

318
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,879
Jinzhao, why aren't you with Little Yue?

319
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,960
Aren't you afraid Little Yue

320
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:29,479
would get lost?

321
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,999
Qi and I have Mindlink.

322
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,479
I could always find her
no matter where she goes.

323
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,879
However, if you don't invite her
to enjoy the sunset in advance,

324
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:41,479
she would never know.

325
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,680
You were eavesdropping
on my conversation with Zhaoyan?

326
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,200
No. I was just passing by.

327
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,080
Zhaoyan, what a coincidence.

328
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,399
Right, Miss Yue.

329
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:06,520
Why are you here?

330
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,560
I felt it was too stuffy
in the Zhengwu Alliance,

331
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,599
so I came here.

332
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,800
Miss Yue, why aren't you with Yue?

333
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,920
I don't have to be with him
all the time, right?

334
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,840
Miss Yue, have some tea.

335
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:32,760
S-Sorry.

336
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,599
It's okay, d-d-don't worry.

337
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,080
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

338
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,879
You wait here.

339
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,328
Zhaoyan.

340
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,119
If I'm not mistaken,
Luo is actually a lady, right?

341
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,800
How did you figure it out?

342
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,759
We have traveled together
with Luo until now.

343
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:02,320
Except for that time at Fengyan Inn,

344
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,800
Luo insisted on spending
more money to stay in a single room,

345
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,519
and never bathed with us.

346
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,800
Also, when playing with the dog,
she completely behaved like a lady.

347
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,519
Senior, you have a crush on Luo.

348
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:20,239
You can't hide the affection
in your eyes.

349
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,880
You also can't hide your affection
to Little Yue.

350
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:29,119
Senior, could it be that you...

351
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,119
Little Yue is so curious,

352
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,280
so she learns it from you.

353
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:36,639
Hurry up!

354
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,879
Speak of the devil.

355
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:42,960
What do you want to do?

356
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,399
Jinzhao, Senior Xian Qing,
something has happened.

357
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,320
What's wrong?

358
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,560
Did something happen to Zhaoyan?

359
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,200
Zhaoyan is a lady.

360
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,879
Okay. How did you know that?

361
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,599
Zhaoyan is not quite like you,

362
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,280
but seems similar to me.

363
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,840
There are some parts you can't touch.

364
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,080
I didn't mean to do it.

365
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,936
Let's go.

366
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:34,200
Why does Zhaoyan pretend to be a man?

367
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,759
How would I know? Ask her yourself.

368
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,119
Does Miss Ming Xiu know it?

369
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,192
What do you think?

370
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,239
So it's only me and Shifang
who didn't know.

371
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,720
Jinzhao, I can't believe it. You liar.

372
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:53,759
Director, I have arranged everything.

373
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,759
I have investigated them.

374
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:04,639
Jinzhao, why didn't you tell me
that Zhaoyan is a lady?

375
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
You too, Senior Xian Qing.

376
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:09,840
I just knew it.
It's all Senior Xian Qing's fault.

377
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,192
What does it have to do with me?

378
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,320
Wait. Fortunately, Zhaoyan is a lady.

379
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,656
Otherwise, Senior Xian Qing,
we would think you are into...

380
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:20,759
Enough. Okay?

381
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:23,239
Don't talk nonsense. Stop.

382
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,384
Let's go. Hold on.

383
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:33,784
Senior.

384
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,639
Huanxing incense.

385
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:38,840
Wolf demon!
Someone, there's a wolf demon!

386
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,960
Let's go, we'd take him away.

387
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,056
Qi, let's go.

388
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,096
Qiyuan Sect.

389
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,560
Huanxing incense. Terrible!

390
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,519
- Right over there!
- Hurry up!

391
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:09,680
A wolf demon.

392
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,776
Stop them!

393
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:37,800
Alliance Leader Zuo, is this
how you treat your guests?

394
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,080
The Zhengwu Alliance never
associates with demons.

395
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:45,528
A wolf demon

396
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:49,599
is not a guest of the Zhengwu Alliance.

397
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,560
Alliance Leader, they are harboring
a demon. Let's take them down.

398
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,720
Go!

399
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,616
Uncle.

400
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,119
Qi, how are you? Are you okay?

401
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,360
Senior Xian Qing.

402
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:24,519
Master Luo, Miss Ming.

403
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:29,200
Do you also want to make enemies
of the Zhengwu Alliance

404
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,840
and side with the wolf demon?

405
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:34,920
Master Luo, Miss Ming,
kill this wolf demon.

406
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,359
I knew Master Luo is a righteous person.

407
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,399
I will never allow anyone to hurt him.

408
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:16,599
Alliance Leader, save the words.
Everyone, let's take them down!

409
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,399
Qi, find a chance to get away.

410
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,920
Stop! Stop fighting!

411
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,216
Stop! Stop fighting!
Jinzhao, stop fighting!

412
00:30:32,879 --> 00:30:34,280
Stop fighting!

413
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,080
Alliance Leader, though
Senior Xian Qing is a demon,

414
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,239
he has been helping us
track down the Qiyuan Sect all along,

415
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,519
and saved us from danger.

416
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:46,280
Alliance Leader, Senior Xian Qing
is a good demon.

417
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,960
Shifang, move aside.

418
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:55,560
Alliance Leader Zuo, since Zhengwu
Alliance doesn't associate with demons,

419
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,599
we could just leave.
Why do you have to kill him?

420
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,200
If he's a demon, don't even
think about leaving here today.

421
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:05,160
I don't allow anyone
to hurt Senior Xian Qing.

422
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,264
Take them all down.

423
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,920
Jinzhao.

424
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,960
Qi.

425
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,000
Jinzhao.

426
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,119
Take Senior Xian Qing away.

427
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:51,768
Go.

428
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:57,200
No. I can't run anymore.

429
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,560
I can't run anymore.

430
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,239
Jinzhao, Zhaoyan,
sorry to drag you down.

431
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:07,200
Don't talk like that to friends.

432
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,960
I'll go ahead and buy us some time.

433
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,776
Please protect Xian Qing.

434
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,999
Then I'll go too,
so you could take Xian Qing away.

435
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,999
Would you like
to be friends with a demon?

436
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,040
You still have the strength
to say such things now.

437
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,200
Shifang told us who you are long ago.

438
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,840
So you've been my friend all along.
Let's go.

439
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:30,280
Put me down. Just go find Little Yue.

440
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,840
Go ahead, Yue. I'm here.

441
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,488
Come on.

442
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,464
Here you are. Just go.

443
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,768
Then you guys should be careful.

444
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:47,320
Zhaoyan, sorry to make you worried.

445
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,479
Don't say so, senior.

446
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,879
(Someone released the Huaxing Powder,)

447
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:15,000
(you would get hurt
if I arrived any later.)

448
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,000
Master, I don't allow anyone
to hurt Senior Xian Qing.

449
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:37,528
Bian Luohuan.

450
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:42,968
