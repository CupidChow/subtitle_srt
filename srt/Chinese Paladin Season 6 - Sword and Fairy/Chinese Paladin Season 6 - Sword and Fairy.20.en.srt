I hope you'll stay with me

24
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:23,996
Jinzhao, I will stay with you forever.

25
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,680
Xuwei, am I not a joke,
not giving up despite knowing

26
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:44,888
how it might end?

27
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,080
Before, you were going to interrupt
the Resonance Spell between me and Qi.

28
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,280
but you didn't.

29
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,239
Thank you for letting me
indulge once more.

30
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,880
No need to thank me.
I just wanted you to see clearly.

31
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,759
Yue Jinzhao is more skilled
in the Resonance Spell than you.

32
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,399
Yeah, 13 years' effort
can't compare to three years' effort.

33
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,800
He is extraordinarily gifted.

34
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,119
I should be happy for him, shouldn't I?

35
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,768
Xuwei, you can't drink alcohol
with your condition.

36
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,280
Xuwei.

37
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,880
I will do my best to keep you
in a stable condition.

38
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,399
Organ decay is incurable.

39
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,199
How much longer can I last?

40
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:14,424
No more than a year.

41
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,504
A year is enough.

42
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,080
The Qiyuan Sect has been annihilated.

43
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,321
Next, the Sea of Clear Skies
must be dealt with within a year.

44
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:55,161
You seem to have
an exceptionally good appetite today.

45
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,241
I don't know why,
but I've been unable to get full lately.

46
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,321
You've never been full before either.

47
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,120
Could it be that you expended
too much effort yesterday?

48
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,736
That makes sense.

49
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:10,720
But why did so many soul fish

50
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:13,120
suddenly appear yesterday
at their headquarters?

51
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:17,201
It must be related to Bian Luohuan.

52
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,680
You really had a hard time.
Come on, eat a lot.

53
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:24,728
Here.

54
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,881
Thanks. You guys are so kind to me.

55
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,881
Why do they want Miss Yue
to absorb so many Qiyuan Orbs?

56
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:37,752
Once at the Fujin Hall,
and then again at their headquarters.

57
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:40,321
Doesn't that mean
they already set you up twice?

58
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,648
That's too much.

59
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:48,120
But every time
after I absorbed some Qiyuan Orbs,

60
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,361
I found me stronger, and...

61
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,112
I can eat even more.

62
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,520
Can't you spit it out at once?

63
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:11,704
Mr. Zuo.

64
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,456
Leader.

65
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:18,840
I must apologize to you
for what happened today.

66
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,176
It's alright.

67
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,728
I wonder what brings you here.

68
00:07:24,728 --> 00:07:26,000
I have come for the Hengdao Sect.

69
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:28,161
One of their disciples has confessed

70
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,000
they distributed many Qiyuan Orbs
to their believers.

71
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:34,081
The calamity
of the Qiyuan Orbs is far from over.

72
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,481
The people can never have peace
unless the Hengdao Sect is dealt with.

73
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:42,240
Yes, the urgent matter now
is to locate their whereabouts.

74
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,881
I have come this time
to bury the hatchet

75
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,201
and join hands with you against them.

76
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:53,680
Mr. Zuo, don't worry.
We are still in pursuit.

77
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,321
If we come across
any leads in the future,

78
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:58,081
we will definitely share them with you.

79
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,560
Thank you very much. I'll take my leave.

80
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:06,968
I will see Mr. Zuo out.

81
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:11,081
(Ruyi Inn)

82
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:12,152
Mr. Zuo.

83
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,504
Mr. Yue.

84
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,800
Please select someone else
to inherit the Silver Shadow.

85
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:25,400
Do you still remember
the extraordinary sight

86
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,152
when I gave you the sword?

87
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,000
In fact, it was the sword
that chose you.

88
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:55,280
Having lived for decades,
I have never misjudged a person.

89
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,296
Jinzhao.

90
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,728
Mr. Zuo still lets you keep the sword.

91
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:13,752
Yes.

92
00:09:16,601 --> 00:09:19,032
Since it's been given to you,
you must perform well.

93
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:22,161
Cheer up and do not let us down.

94
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,800
Yes, boss.

95
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,720
Qi, there is something
I have to tell you.

96
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,601
I witnessed it with my own eyes
at their headquarters.

97
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:37,161
Bian Luohuan could cast Mindlink on you.

98
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:49,000
(Bian Luohuan can resonate with Qi?)

99
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,761
And even the runes were the same.

100
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:01,120
Considering this, if the Hengdao Sect
has close ties with us,

101
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:04,800
I bet they have connections
with the Sea of Clear Skies too.

102
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:09,336
Jinzhao, once Mr. Gu recovers,

103
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:11,321
we'll go to the Sea of Clear Skies
to make it clear.

104
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,328
Alright.

105
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,401
Don't you want to spend
your last moments with Xiu?

106
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:34,761
Do you think she doesn't know

107
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,920
that I extended your life
for half a day?

108
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,881
I've been protecting countless lives,

109
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:42,680
but I only fear she'd die.

110
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,800
She is so stubborn.

111
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,360
I'm afraid she might
do something stupid.

112
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:52,952
I will be taking care of her.

113
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,920
I care about her too.

114
00:10:56,961 --> 00:11:00,800
From now on, I entrust her to you.

115
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,000
Xian Qing,
you've helped me a lot these years.

116
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:18,281
Thank you. Take good care of yourself.

117
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:22,881
The world is large.

118
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:26,160
It's rare to meet someone you like.
Don't miss her out.

119
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,064
Nagging.

120
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,040
Let's go find Xiu.

121
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,800
She didn't come with you.

122
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,480
She must be hiding somewhere again,
feeling down alone.

123
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:55,448
Follow me.

124
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:07,721
(Kid, don't cry.)

125
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm not crying.

126
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,560
Missy, where is your home?

127
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,401
Why are you here alone?

128
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,000
I am from the village
at the foot of the mountain.

129
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,321
The village chief sent me here.

130
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,281
He sent me to be the bride
of the Mountain God.

131
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,281
The Mountain God's bride?

132
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,201
The Mountain God
is the most powerful in the world.

133
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,120
It wants a lot of things
to eat and many brides.

134
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,360
Without food and a bride,

135
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,321
it will go down
the mountain to eat people.

136
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,841
Offering children to a demon
in exchange for the village's peace?

137
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,016
How pathetic.

138
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:04,248
I don't want
to be the Mountain God's bride.

139
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:06,680
Neither does my mother want this.

140
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,480
Little girl, let me take you home, okay?

141
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,672
Come.

142
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,721
I finally found you, Xiu.

143
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:05,360
I haven't had a good talk
with you for a long time.

144
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:12,521
When I adopted you,

145
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:15,321
you would often hide away and cry.

146
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,641
I always had to look for you.

147
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,896
Don't do this anymore.

148
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:23,721
When you are unhappy,
talk to your friends.

149
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,641
At least, Xian Qing would be around.

150
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:34,800
I don't need anyone else.

151
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:41,441
Master, I only want you.

152
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:43,416
I don't want anyone else.

153
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:53,240
Silly, I will definitely die before you.

154
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:57,961
Do you think I can live
as long as Xian Qing, that demon?

155
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:01,944
No.

156
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,560
In the cycle of life and death,
death gives way to life.

157
00:15:12,641 --> 00:15:17,081
Without death, how can life be precious?

158
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:32,160
The key rings only recognize one owner.

159
00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:36,081
Unless their owners
willingly hand them over or pass away,

160
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,441
they will not swap owners.

161
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:44,680
From now on, I entrust Xian Qing
with the role of guardian.

162
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,160
Master, let me succeed you.

163
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,240
Xiu.

164
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:00,841
It is your key ring.
I won't give it to anyone else.

165
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,401
Xiu, the guardian position
is no child's play.

166
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:15,240
I only hate seeing the future
and being unable to change it.

167
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,680
It's not that I think
your guardianship is meaningless.

168
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:25,560
Xiu, you once asked me
why I came to Jing'an.

169
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,240
In Pureness, I saw the Zhengwu Alliance
would suffer heavy casualties before.

170
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,160
But this time,
they have won a great victory.

171
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,761
Didn't I always tell you

172
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,560
that the future is not unchangeable?

173
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,401
With the chance to foresee the future,

174
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:21,081
guide it towards the path you hope for

175
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:23,680
to protect those you want to protect.

176
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,641
I believe that being the guardian
of Pureness is a fortunate thing.

177
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:37,120
Just sacrificing one's own happiness
for that of others.

178
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
How is that fortunate?

179
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,841
Silly, you'll understand in the future.

180
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:04,761
But at this moment, I somewhat hope

181
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,401
that you'll never have to understand.

182
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:16,281
Do you still remember
the day we first met?

183
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,961
You were crying so sadly.

184
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,441
It made my heart ache.

185
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:33,920
Thinking that I wouldn't
let you feel that sad again.

186
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,201
Xiu, I'm sorry.

187
00:18:55,201 --> 00:19:02,040
I broke my promise.

It's all my fault.

210
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,680
So it turns out
Mr. Gu was revived temporarily

211
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:33,321
through Xian Qing's demonic orb.

212
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,481
My fault.

213
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:42,560
My fault.

214
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
It's all my fault.

215
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,864
Xian Qing.

216
00:22:15,441 --> 00:22:16,536
I'm going out for a walk.

217
00:22:40,321 --> 00:22:41,336
Ming Xiu.

218
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,272
(Each of the Nine Springs
has its own power.)

219
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,880
(Maybe there's a way
to bring the dead back to life.)

220
00:23:42,241 --> 00:23:45,880
The person is gone.
Do not grieve too much.

221
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,321
The person is gone.

222
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,601
No one will invite me
to play chess together anymore.

223
00:24:16,841 --> 00:24:20,880
Zhaoyan, do you know?

224
00:24:23,321 --> 00:24:24,400
Over these thousands of years,

225
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:28,560
I have been watching
others' joy and sorrow

226
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,961
from afar.

227
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,481
After keeping to myself for so long,

228
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:44,001
even making a few good friends

229
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,481
feels like a stroke of good fortune.

230
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,800
If you want to cry, then cry it out.

231
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,081
Are you saying I want to cry?

232
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:28,721
Over the years, I have...

233
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,520
It's not good to be stubborn.

234
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,841
That's what you told me.

235
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,841
If the past me saw me now,

236
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,601
I'd probably laugh at myself.

237
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Not at all.

238
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,920
Your tears just now are not ridiculous.
They are very precious.

239
00:26:27,721 --> 00:26:30,841
Excuse me, what is needed
when a family passes away?

240
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,081
A pair of white candles
to light the way ahead.

241
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:36,160
A set of new clothes to brave the cold.

242
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,760
A stack of paper money
to live a good life.

243
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,408
We'll take them all.

244
00:26:40,408 --> 00:26:41,496
Alright.

245
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:46,001
Do these things really work?

246
00:26:46,001 --> 00:26:49,800
Miss, these are the living's thoughts.

247
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,840
Thoughts.

248
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,841
We get married, raise children,
and make friends.

249
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,920
Isn't it all to have someone
think of us after we die?

250
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:03,680
Here, six coins in total.

251
00:27:04,481 --> 00:27:05,560
Alright.

252
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:10,241
Okay, thank you.

253
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,001
So this is how it feels
when someone passes away.

254
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,160
It's like a cut in the heart.

255
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:29,520
We care about Mr. Gu,
so we feel the pain.

256
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:35,321
This is the "thoughts" that
the stall owner was talking about?

257
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:37,400
Yes.

258
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:41,001
Mr. Gu saved my life and taught me.

259
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:44,121
To me, he was like
a teacher and a father.

260
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,321
Before he died, he specifically told me

261
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:49,481
our origins are still not clear,

262
00:27:50,241 --> 00:27:51,920
so we should never
let the guilt weigh us down.

263
00:27:53,592 --> 00:27:58,081
Jinzhao, we must not let him down.

264
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:04,601
Qi, after we're done
with his funeral affairs,

265
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,081
we head to the Sea of Clear Skies.

266
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,576
Let's go.

267
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:20,216
Ming Xiu.

268
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:24,728
Ming Xiu?

269
00:28:24,728 --> 00:28:25,841
What's the matter?

270
00:28:25,841 --> 00:28:27,841
Ming Xiu and Mr. Gu's body
have both disappeared.

271
00:28:33,321 --> 00:28:34,840
She must've gone to Mount Yuqing.

272
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,361
Then let's hurry and find her.

273
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:40,121
Without the Yunlai Stone, it would
take at least a dozen days to get there.

274
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,001
Shifang, do you have a way?

275
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:49,321
Our alliance seized
a flying ship from the Qiyuan Sect.

276
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:50,721
I will go get it.

277
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:53,481
Okay, Qi, notify Xian Qing
and Zhaoyan. Let's go.

278
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:55,064
Let's go.

279
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,008
(Zhaoyan)

280
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,640
Master, the Zhengwu Alliance
wiped out the Qiyuan Sect.

281
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,601
And there seems a sect
behind the Qiyuan Sect called Hengdao.

282
00:29:40,241 --> 00:29:41,880
No one knows where it is.

283
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,920
Zhaoyan has accomplished
another great feat.

284
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:52,121
(Zhaoyan)
But she hasn't contacted me yet.

285
00:29:55,321 --> 00:29:57,721
Gu Hanjiang is gravely injured
and may not live longer.

286
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:04,481
Zhaoyan must be heartbroken
for someone else again.

287
00:30:06,081 --> 00:30:07,704
Bian Luohuan is probably
from the Hengdao Sect,

288
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,441
but the sect's location is unknown.

289
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:11,000
What should we do next?

290
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,841
We must push that person.

291
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,361
Notify the businesses
in the Yinghui Fort

292
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,520
to auction gemstones from Rehai
and create a bidding frenzy.

293
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,528
Yes.

294
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,121
When Rehai emerges,

295
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:40,560
the interested will act
upon hearing the news.

296
00:30:55,961 --> 00:31:00,640
Your Lordship, Ying Xuwei annihilated
the Qiyuan Sect by his own hand.

297
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,800
They've been annihilated?

298
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:05,760
Then wouldn't there be
no supply of the Qiyuan Orbs?

299
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,721
Are there any more clues about Rehai?

300
00:31:11,241 --> 00:31:12,560
Not yet.

301
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,712
I have already dispatched more people,

302
00:31:14,712 --> 00:31:17,640
but there really isn't enough time.

303
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,688
Ying Xuwei annihilated the Qiyuan Sect.

304
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:24,601
That means he wouldn't supply us
with the Qiyuan Orbs.

305
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,552
If that's the case,

306
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:29,880
Rehai is our only hope.

307
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:40,321
Dispatch more people
and search with all efforts.

308
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:42,392
Yes.

309
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,640
Your Lordship, if...

310
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:56,601
If we can't find Rehai...

311
00:31:56,601 --> 00:31:57,640
We will definitely find it.

312
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,776
We must find it.

313
00:32:21,201 --> 00:32:22,400
Miss Ming is not here.

314
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:24,121
But Mr. Gu is here.

315
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:27,640
They aren't together?

316
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,880
She wouldn't do
anything stupid, would she?

317
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,920
These are all records
about the Nine Springs.

318
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,201
Is Miss Ming looking for something?

319
00:32:49,852 --> 00:32:51,096
(Entrance of Pureness)

320
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,800
I have already succeeded
as the guardian.

321
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,321
Why can't I enter the Dragon Pool?

322
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:05,400
I will do it anyway.

323
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,520
In the Nine Springs, energy gathers.

324
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,920
In Pureness, one can foresee the future.

325
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,400
(Shennong Nine Springs)
And the Dragon Pool...

326
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:50,800
The Dragon Pool is located in Guixu.

327
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,081
Legend has it
that it can bring back the dead.

328
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:57,361
(Shennong Nine Springs)
Does Ming Xiu want to bring Mr. Gu back?

329
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,361
The Nine Springs are interconnected.

330
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,560
Xiu has just taken over
as the guardian of Pureness.

331
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:06,481
The Yunlai Stone is back.

332
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,944
Ming Xiu has returned.

333
00:34:23,081 --> 00:34:24,120
You went to Pureness?

334
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,721
Miss Ming,
why put yourself through that?

335
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:37,361
Miss Ming, it's no easy feat
to bring the dead back to life.

336
00:34:38,441 --> 00:34:41,800
It seems you can't enter
the Dragon Pool from Pureness.

337
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:49,321
As long as there's a glimmer
of chance, I will try it.

338
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,400
Ming Xiu, you can't even
enter Pureness now.

339
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,760
How can you enter the Dragon Pool then?

340
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,912
You just took over as guardian.

341
00:34:58,481 --> 00:34:59,880
You don't know much about what's inside.

342
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,800
There's no need to say
these words of persuasion anymore.

343
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:06,040
Xiu.

344
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,160
Ming Xiu, we will join you.

345
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,961
Together, we will surely find a way.

346
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Yes.

347
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,121
Perhaps Maiming knows about it.

348
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,721
In fact, Rehai is right
at our family's place,

349
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:31,280
and Maiming is its guardian.

350
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,920
Sorry for keeping it
from you all this time.

351
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,001
But I think Maiming has been
a guardian for a longer time.

352
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,721
Perhaps he knows more than we do.

353
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:44,001
We can go to him for help.

354
00:35:45,121 --> 00:35:48,560
It's late, and Xiu
has suffered internal injuries.

355
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:52,520
Let's sleep and set off tomorrow.

356
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,361
Yes, Ming Xiu, have a good rest tonight.

357
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,241
Tomorrow we will
accompany you to the Luo's.

358
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:26,041
It's late. Why aren't you sleeping yet?

359
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:28,521
I dreamt of the past.

360
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:35,120
Do you still remember

361
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,241
the hibiscus tree
that was here three years ago?

362
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:46,761
Yes, that was
a well-grown hibiscus tree.

363
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,241
I still remember
how you loved hibiscus most.

364
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,241
(3 years ago, there was
a disturbance in the Spring Vein.)

365
00:37:00,561 --> 00:37:01,961
(Master took me to investigate.)

366
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:05,400
(At that time, I had reached
the age for training,)

367
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,961
(so he asked me to practice
on the demon beasts in the den there.)

368
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,241
Master, I will go defeat
the demons in that den.

369
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,360
When I come out,

370
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:21,640
could you pin a hibiscus flower
in my hair for me?

371
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:29,281
That's the deal, anyway.

372
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:38,360
(But when I came out from the den...)

373
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:44,400
Master,

374
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:47,521
I have dealt with all the demons inside.

375
00:37:55,241 --> 00:37:58,680
Master, the flower I asked for...

376
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:03,761
The flowers here bloom very well,

377
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,400
so I couldn't bear to pluck them.

378
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,120
I understand, Master.

379
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:27,801
After returning from the Spring Vein,

380
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:32,120
Master sat
under the hibiscus tree all night.

381
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:35,320
When I woke up the next day,

382
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:39,961
I found he had chopped down
the hibiscus tree.

383
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,521
In its place, there was
this cloud pear tree.

384
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:51,680
The pear signifies parting.

385
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,481
Did something happen
when Hanjiang was alone

386
00:38:55,761 --> 00:38:57,041
outside the den?

387
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,880
I don't know.

388
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:06,521
But it was from that day on,

389
00:39:08,521 --> 00:39:13,241
many things seemed
to have changed imperceptibly.

390
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,801
