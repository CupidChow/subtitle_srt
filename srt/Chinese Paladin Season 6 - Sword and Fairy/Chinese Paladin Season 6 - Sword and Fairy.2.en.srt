Only the true Lord Ming

can make these soul fish ascend.

00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:08,599
She is the omnipotent

25
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,880
and omniscient Lord Ming.

26
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,919
Shut up.

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,040

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,999
Where did it come from?

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,759
It is from human sacrifices...

31
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,400
Lord Ming.

32
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:28,360
Don't try to hurt Qi.

33
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,480
They called her Lord Ming.

34
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,800
Didn't you hear it?

35
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,879
She is not Lord Ming.

36
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,079
Seeing is believing.

37
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,759
You're refusing to face the truth.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,960
Out of my way.
I don't harm the innocent.

39
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,480
She is innocent.

40
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,559
Is she?

41
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,160
The Qiyuan Sect harms the civilians.

42
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:44,199
Is she innocent then?

43
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:47,879
Sir.

44
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:48,919
Let's go.

45
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,879
But Lord Ming…

46
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,320
Inform Shengxuan of this. Go.

47
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:51,840
Shengxuan?

48
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:52,719
- Move.
- Okay.

49
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,360
Inform him of this.

50
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,320
Yue Jinzhao, if you don't stop,

51
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,239
I will not give you mercy.

52
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,119
My family will never associate
with evil people.

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,839
If you try to harm Qi,

54
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,239
you'll have to kill me first.

55
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,040
Move aside. I don't want to kill you.

56
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:33,919
You claim to be righteous.

57
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:35,960
Then prove that she is the Lord Ming.

58
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,000
She has consumed those evil beings.
Isn't that a proof?

59
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:40,400
Do you have any evidence
against my judgment?

60
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,400
If she were Lord Ming,

61
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:44,960
how could she take action
against the Qiyuan Sect?

62
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,040
Let me save her.

63
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,199
Thank you.

64
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,440

The girl called Qi…

131
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,959

00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,480

00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:55,959

00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,160
I am not.

144

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000

00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,160
Well,

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,160
she is unharmed.

154
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,839
And she's energetic and in good health.

155
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,519
How is that possible? She's unconscious.

156
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,600
Clearly, she has fallen asleep.

157
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,680
What?

158
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:45,639
She has fallen asleep?

159
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,240
Egg noodles.

160
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,439
Jinzhao, don't snatch my egg noodles.

161
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,639
I'll tell someone to cook it.

162
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,240
Wait.

163
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:06,999
I've been keeping my word

164
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,600
all the way.

165
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,360
So…

166
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,720
You're indeed a man of your word.

167
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:14,759
So?

168
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,480
So, five bowls of egg noodles.

169
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:28,759
No problem.

170
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,280
Wait, Yue.

171
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,800
I hear
you two are figuring out your origins.

172
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,199
Yes.

173
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,959
We woke up
in Wuyan Village three years ago.

174
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,160
We remembered nothing

175
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:43,999
but our names.

176
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:45,720
At first, we thought

177
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,199
we were no different from others.

178
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,680
But later we discovered

179
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,639
that we were born with martial skills.

180
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,999
So, we want to find out who we are.

181
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,639
Even if she is Lord Ming,

182
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:59,999
it's better than not knowing

183
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:00,879
where one comes from.

184
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,519
What was the magic you used on Miss Yue

185
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:08,079
today at the Fujin Hall?

186
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,639
Over the past few years,

187
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,280
we've been traveling.

188
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:16,360
To earn some money,

189
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,040
we have to work on that.

190
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,439
I happened to discover

191
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,519
we can communicate with our minds

192
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:24,879
and transfer thoughts.

193
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,480
What's this magic?

194
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,319
I haven't really thought about it.

195
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,199
I have an idea.

196
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,959
How about I call it

197
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,240
omnipotent telepathy?

198
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,199
Where is she?

199
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,600
She's so rude.

200
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,399
I haven't finished yet.

201
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,280
If they act properly,

202
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,519
they will be my guests.

203
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:55,399
Take care of them.

204
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,480
Yes.

205
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:12,999
Sit.

206
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,240
Well,

207
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,399
are you really feeling well?

208
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,680
Yes.

209
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:26,600
No.

210
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,280
I feel I've become more powerful.

211
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:35,120
Can you finish speaking in one go?

212
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,040
I know you're worried about me.

213
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,759
I'm not.

214
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,040
Do you know that you cried today?

215
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,680
You never shed tears before.

216
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:53,759
I cried?

217
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,519
Did you see something?

218
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,040
Well,

219
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,280
I was trapped in a cave.

220
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,680
When I heard voices saying

221
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:07,519
that you had abandoned me,

222
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:09,160
you showed up,

223
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,800
and I was protected.

224
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,560
Jinzhao?

225
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,079
You…

226
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,240
Why are you crying again?

227
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,360
I am hungry. I want to eat egg noodles.

228
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:00,759
Can you give them all to me?

229
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,240
Here are the egg noodles.

230
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:07,439
Okay.

231
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,040
It's all yours.

232
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:19,439
(Turns out tears are this useful.)

233
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,079
Maiming.

234
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,240
It seems you have good news
to share with me.

235
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,240
Today we destroyed the branch

236
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:04,399
of Qiyuan Sect in Yinghui Fort.

237
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,600
And we eliminated spoils.

238
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,720
Other treasures

239
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,079
will be returned tomorrow.

240
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,360
I need you to check the account books

241
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,160
to find out more clues.

242
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:17,999
As you wish,

243
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,519
the reputation
of your family can be spread.

244
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,160
However, I'm not the only one

245
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,199
who destroyed Fujin Hall.

246
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,519
Two more people helped.

247
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,319
Jinzhao.

248
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,639
why could I consume the Qiyuan Orb?

249
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
And why did I see the past?

250
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,720
Where did the strange voice come from?

251
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,240
Alright.

252
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,680
One day, we will figure it out.

253
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,720
Am I really Lord Ming?

254
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:00,160
Of course not.

255
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,839
Along the way,

256
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,720
we haven't done many good deeds,

257
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,920
but we haven't done anything bad.

258
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:07,959
Don't be silly.

259
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,720
If you were Lord Ming,

260
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,560
my name would be Zhaojin.

261
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,959
Jinzhao? Zhaojin?

262
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,879
Sounds like you're rich.

263
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,480
But I think Jinzhao is better.

264
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:25,800
If I meet those Qiyuan disciples

265
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,439
again,

266
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,560
will they bow and kneel to me?

267
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:32,079
That's great.

268
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,280
You must not give it away.

269
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:35,560
You need to order them

270
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,999
to give their treasures

271
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:38,040
to us.

272
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,720
Good idea. We'll get rich.

273
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,160
Once we become rich,

274
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,280
we will have noodles

275
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,480
with ten eggs.

276
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,199
Good for you.

277
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:48,879
So,

278
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:50,999
can you give me the money you got

279
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,280
in Fujin Hall in advance?

280
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,680
I'm not that stupid.

281
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,199
Let's talk business.

282
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,040
Alright.

283
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,959
We've been searching for our origins.

284
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,999
We found such a clear clue
for the first time.

285
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:06,720
Yes.

286
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,199
So I'm very flustered now.

287
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:10,759
It means

288
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,360
my left eye's premonition was accurate.

289
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:16,240
As long as we follow Luo Zhaoyan,

290
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:17,800
we will definitely find more clues.

291
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,240
Exactly. We will follow him from now on.

292
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
No matter where he goes,

293
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,839
keep a close eye on him.

294
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,720
Good.

295
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:29,759
So you're saying

296
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,360
Yue Qi is suspected to be Lord Ming.

297
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,920
And she behaved differently from others.

298
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,800
Zhaoyan.

299
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,560
Their experiences are strange.

300
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,720
Why not let them go back with you

301
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,199
and investigate them?

302
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:47,319
Okay.

303
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,280
Then I will take them back with me.

304
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,959
Maiming, have an early rest.

305
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:54,600
Zhaoyan.

306
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,600
Anything else?

307
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:01,119
I'm well.

308
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:02,080
Don't worry.

309
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:05,879
Cang Feng.

310
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,280
Before Zhaoyan returns,

311
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,680
I want to know all
about the siblings' past.

312
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,080
Yes.

313
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,719
- Jinzhao.
- Qi.

314
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,119
I have something important

315
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,080
to tell you.

316
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,320
What is it?

317
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,359
In another hour,

318
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,680
our birthday will be over.

319
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:35,160
This is…

320
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,719
Your birthday gift.

321
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:38,879
Well…

322
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,479
You bought this white one.

323
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,160
Wait.

324
00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:51,440
What's wrong?

325
00:19:57,639 --> 00:19:58,680
You already bought one?

326
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,280
Give it back to me.

327
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,920
You have given it to me.

328
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,519
You can't take it back.

329
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:06,920
As for this,

330
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,840
originally I bought it for myself.

331
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,599
Seeing that you saved me,

332
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:13,239
I'll give it to you as a birthday gift.

333
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:16,160
What a surprise.

334
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:18,639
I used to give you birthday presents.

335
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:21,080
This is your first time.

336
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,239
Since when did you learn
to care for others?

337
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:25,719
If you don't want it, give it back.

338
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,440
You have given it to me.

339
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,320
Don't ask for it back.

340
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,960
Give it to me.

341
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,280
Wait, look.

342
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,399
These two seem to be a pair.

343
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:57,999
Right?

344
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,519
Jinzhao.

345
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,599
He lied to me about my birthday gift.

346
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,759
Will he expect me

347
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,920
to give all the tasty food to him?

348
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:37,759
Anyway,

349
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,719
he got me a birthday gift.

350
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,639
I'm okay with that.

351
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,599
What is this?

352
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:01,840
(Is it an illusion?)

353
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,440
Alright, move it away.

354
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,239
Yes.

355
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:34,239
Luo, what is this?

356
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,519
You two,

357
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,960
this is Mr. Luo,
the steward of my trade house.

358
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:43,080
I'm having him

359
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:45,359
return the treasures seized
from Fujin Hall

360
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:46,280
to their owners.

361
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,200
What?

362
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,759
Jinzhao, yesterday at Fujin Hall,

363
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,479
you picked up bank notes.

364
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,440
Are they stolen goods?

365
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,800
I almost forgot.

366
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,160
Thank you for reminding me.

367
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:12,960
It's what I got yesterday.

368
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,440
You're a man of integrity.

369
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,160
A great man.

370
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,920
Thank you, Master.

371
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,639
Thank you, young man.

372
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,560
Master, no worries.

373
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,040
I will do a good job.

374
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,200
I shall take my leave.

375
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,719
Good.

376
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,160
Let's go.

377
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,680
Are you taking us to your home?

378
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:55,119
Yes.

379
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,399
That's great.

380
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,920
I've heard it's a picturesque place.

381
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:02,560
I've always wanted to visit it.

382
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
Please wait a moment.

383
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:05,759
The carriage will be here shortly.

384
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,560
Guests.

385
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,519
Sorry to interrupt.

386
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,680
Here's your bill.

387
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,920
Impossible.
The bill was settled yesterday.

388
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:14,560
But this morning, you ordered fried eggs

389
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,519
and tofu pudding.

390
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:16,759
Look.

391
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:17,879
And last night,

392
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,239
you took two steamed buns.

393
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:21,280
How could that be?

394
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,680
It must be you,

395
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,359
a silly, gluttonous fish.

396
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,479
Who is silly?

397
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,719
The one who ate them.

398
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:38,719
You settle the bill yourself.

399
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,519
Do you know why?

400
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,599
Let me tell you.

401
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:42,519
Because all my money is stolen goods.

402
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,440
Miser!

403
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,040
Put it to my account.

404
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:48,080
Alright.

405
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,200
You're so generous.

406
00:25:00,764 --> 00:25:01,944
(Yunlai Inn)

407
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,239
Miss Yue.

408
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,276
(Yunlai Inn)

409
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,160
Stop, you two.

410
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,440
I know you two are close.

411
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,999
But how about letting me go first?

412
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,920
No way.

413
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,840
(You're so strange today.)

414
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:29,639
(Wasn't it you who wanted me)

415
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:30,759
(to get closer to Zhaoyan?)

416
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,639
(Plans have changed. Just listen to me.)

417
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,719
(I don't want to.)

418
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,239
You hungry?

419
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,960
Yes, I am.

420
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,440
Delicious.

421
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,080
(The sister is naive,)

422
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,999
(but the brother is witty.)

423
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,800
(I should be wary of Yue Jinzhao.)

424
00:25:58,399 --> 00:25:59,879
(Their identities are unclear.)

425
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:02,080
(I need to investigate them carefully.)

426
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:02,680
Let's go.

427
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,280
Zhaoyan, does your home have tasty food?

428
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:23,920
Yes.

429
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,960
When we arrive,

430
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:27,359
I'll have them make you egg noodles.

431
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,680
Zhaoyan,

432
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,960
how did you know I love egg noodles?

433
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,960
I know.

434
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,080
Zhaoyan, you must like me.

435
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,560
The storybook says
if you blush while staring at someone,

436
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,519
it means you like that guy.

437
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,479
Miss Yue, don't mock me.

438
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,719
Luo.

439
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:47,519
Don't take it seriously.

440
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:50,960
Luo.

441
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:54,999
Do you know about the Qiyuan Orb?

442
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,560
I've been tracking them.

443
00:26:57,999 --> 00:26:58,680
I do know about it.

444
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:02,320
Can you tell us about it?

445
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,359
When disciples join the Qiyuan sect,

446
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,800
the directors in various places,
in the name of Lord Ming,

447
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,440
will distribute Qiyuan Orbs to them.

448
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:12,359
They cast spells

449
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,800
to implant Qiyuan Orbs
into the bodies of the new disciples.

450
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,160
At first,

451
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,399
these disciples are strong and healthy,

452
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,719
but over time,

453
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:21,879
Qiyuan Orbs begin

454
00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:23,440
to absorb the force from their bodies.

455
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,999
The soul fish is formed

456
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:26,440
and stored within the Qiyuan Orbs.

457
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,200
When the soul fish flies
out of the Qiyuan Orb,

458
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,119
those disciples
will turn into stone statues.

459
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,040
The Qiyuan Sect claims
they have ascended.

460
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,999
So every Qiyuan Orb

461
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:41,519
represents a human life.

462
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,320
(I thought
the Qiyuan Sect just scammed money.)

463
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,560
(I never expected it to kill men.)

464
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,680
(I can't let it happen.)

465
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,160
Moreover, I always feel

466
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,999
that Qi and I

467
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,239
were deliberately led to the Fujin Hall.

468
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,759
Really?

469
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,639
If Qi is the Lord Ming,

470
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:09,920
how dare they hurt her?

471
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,920
If the two of you are innocent,

472
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,599
my family will not wrongly accuse you.

473
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,759
You're a good Master of the Luo family.

474
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,999
You're so righteous.

475
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:24,680
A flatterer.

476
00:28:28,412 --> 00:28:29,784
(Jincui Oasis)

477
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:49,879
Who is it?

478
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,288
(Shuo Xuan, the princess of the Yu Clan)

479
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:57,960
I'll kill you.

480
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:01,960
Help.

481
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:03,920
Help.

482
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,680
Someone is calling for help.

483
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,560
I will kill you.

484
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,399
Don't.

485
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,759
No.

486
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:25,239
Miss, please believe me.

487
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,519
I really didn't see anything.

488
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:27,040
Shut up.

489
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,519
How dare you.

490
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,960
I will take out your eyes.

491
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:30,759
I really…

492
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,239
Miss, please stop.

493
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:32,999
Help.

494
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:36,560
Shifang, what happened?

495
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,399
Master Luo.

496
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,519
Zhaoyan, do you know him?

497
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,119
Is that Qi?

498
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,800
Master Luo, help!

499
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,119
Out of here.

500
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,080
Stay out of this,
or I will slaughter you all.

501
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,479
Qi, pull him up first.

502
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:00,160
Are you okay?

503
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,399
Thank you for saving my life.

504
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:09,040
(Yue Qi, you fool. Back off.)

505
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,879
I must shoot you dead.

506
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,879
(She seems to be hostile towards Qi.)

507
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,160
(I need to test her.)

508
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:20,399
You made this lady so mad.

509
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,040
Because of you, Qi and I are blamed.

510
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,399
Don't try to play dumb.

511
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:27,759
(She is indeed sensitive to Qi.)

512
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,280
(Does she know Qi?)

513
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:31,200
So, what do you want?

514
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:32,920
I must scratch his eyes out.

515
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,639
Miss.

516
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:37,119
Shifang made a mistake.

517
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,119
He should suffer some pain.

518
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,879
But there's no need to be so cruel

519
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,560
Alright, you outnumber me.

520
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,879
I'll spare your eyes for now.

521
00:31:52,479 --> 00:31:52,920
Hold on.

522
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,800
Well…

523
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:58,239
Well…

524
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:00,359
I'm sorry.

525
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,239
If you come within ten steps of me,

526
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,960
I will make you disintegrate into ashes.

527
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,359
She tried to hurt your eyes.

528
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,280
You can't see her leave?

529
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,960
You really fancy her?

530
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,239
I don't.

531
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:21,359
I don't.

532
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,320
You're blushing.

533
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,040
Shifang.

534
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,560
You're not deceiving us, are you?

535
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:30,599
I only saw a figure
in the middle of the river.

536
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:44,119
Strange.

537
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:47,200
I heard the iron poplar wood is nearby.

538
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,599
Why haven't I seen it?

539
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,560
Who is she?

540
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,639
Is she a demon?

541
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,840
Who is it?

542
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:26,200
I swear

543
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,239
I really didn't see anything.

544
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,239
It's said in the storybook.

545
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:31,239
You're blushing,
which means you like her.

546
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,800
Do you like her?

547
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,479
She's just joking with you.

548
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,920
Let's go, Qi.

549
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,519
Are you alright?

550
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,320
I'm fine.

551
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:45,840
Let's go.

552
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,280
I was so scared just now.

553
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:53,800
Shuo Xuan.

554
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:56,519
How is Qi after she ate the Qiyuan Orb?

555
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,320
His Lord is very concerned.

556
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,119
Rest assured, she's doing well.

557
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,599
She helped others deal with me.

558
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:05,719
Calm down.

559
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,680
I know when you came to check on Qi,

560
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,960
the drought happened.

561
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:10,840
You long for water.

562
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,599
It's understandable to expose yourself.

563
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,119
But His Lord gave you this mission.

564
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,160
Be careful.

565
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,280
It's all that fool's fault.

566
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:19,999
Because of him,

567
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,920
I am exposed so early.

568
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,200
From now on, you follow Qi.

569
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,800
You should be more careful.

570
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,200
Don't get exposed again.

571
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,119
I don't need your advice.

572
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:42,359
Smells good.

573
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:46,040
Jinzhao, is it done?

574
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,479
Almost.

575
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,280
Oh, right, allow me to introduce you.

576
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,320
This is YYue Jinzhao.

577
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,639
She's Yue Qi.

578
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,840
(Ju Shifang, the head of Jiqiao Hall of the Zhengwu Alliance)
He's Ju Shifang

579
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,999
from the Zhengwu Alliance.

580
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,239
Zhengwu Alliance?

581
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,599
Zhengwu Alliance works

582
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:06,200
on eliminating demons and monsters.

583
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,599
Though it's formed by various factions,

584
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,800
each faction has its own system.

585
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,440
In times of crisis,
the Alliance leader will give orders

586
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:18,879
to fight against enemies together.

587
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:22,639
Miss Yue is really familiar with us.

588
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:23,160
Yes.

589
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,800
I often hear of you from storytellers.

590
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,719
I also know

591
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,280
the Alliance includes Yongwu Hall,
Cloud Hall, and Jiqiao Hall.

592
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,440
Which hall are you from?

593
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:39,759
I am the head

594
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:42,040
of the Jiqiao Hall.

595
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:43,879
Really?

596
00:35:43,879 --> 00:35:44,999
So, you're a leader.

597
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,680
No big deal.

598
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:49,639
Thank you for your help again.

599
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,560
You two share the surname Yue.

600
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:57,040
I guess you are siblings.

601
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:58,800
We just…

602
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,680
It is done.

603
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,159
Shifang,

604
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,120
Jincui Oasis is far
from Zhengwu Alliance.

605
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,800
Why are you here?

606
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,479
I came to find the iron poplar wood.

607
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,320
Jinzhao, here.

608
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,640
I wanted to try my luck
at the Luo Mansion.

609
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,320
The 50-year-old dried iron poplar wood

610
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:19,840
is even lighter than a feather
and as tough as iron,

611
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:22,560
making it more suitable
for creating mechanical contrivances.

612
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:24,880
Oh,

613
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,959
look.

614
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,439
This iron poplar wood
is coarsely grained.

615
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:39,400
It requires 20 percent of Yuqi Tree sap

616
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,759
and 80 percent of the iron solution

617
00:36:40,919 --> 00:36:41,880
to be coated on it.

618
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,800
It might be a bit difficult

619
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,040
for you to understand.

620
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,560
So, please take a look.

621
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,759
So cute!

622
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:03,679
It can move.

623
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,400
It is quite cute.

624
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,280
Its name is Dou Bao,
and it can even fight.

625
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,640
Did you make it?

626
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,080
My mother gave it to me
before she passed away,

627
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,840
But I know mechanics too.

628
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:20,120
But I'm not highly skilled yet.

629
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,600
(Miss Yue looks so forthright.)

630
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,719
(Is she related to the Qiyuan Sect?)

631
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,512
(The Luo Mansion, famous protector)

632
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,592
(Mist Soul)

633
00:37:33,592 --> 00:37:34,680
(Pureness)

634
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:39,479
Pureness, Cold Marrow,
Mist Soul, Dragon Pool,

635
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,679
Mirror, Flame Wave,
Poison Miasma, Chunzi,

636
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,239
(Rehai)
and Rehai.

637
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,519
(Luo Maiming, the guardian of Rehai)
Shennong feared that the Nine Springs

638
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,280
would be misused,
so he made nine key rings

639
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:00,239
and gave them to nine guardians

640
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,959
to guard the Nine Springs.

641
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,840
But has he ever considered the price

642
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:11,840
that the guardians would have to pay?
