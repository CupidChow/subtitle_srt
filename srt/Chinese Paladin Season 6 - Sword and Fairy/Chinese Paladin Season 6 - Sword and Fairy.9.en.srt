Qi, let's go.

62
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,080
Time to go to the Fengyan Hotel

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,800

00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,080
Wait.

65
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:08,568

00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,280

67
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,959
How unlucky we are.

68
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,679
So it's you two.

69
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,639

00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,040
You two were lucky to escape just now.

72
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,880
Now your good luck has run out.

73
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:39,040
The ones who fled
in a panic last time weren't us.

74
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:40,320
Let me tell you.

75
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,920
The lake is

76
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,399
where I breed Zhenyao fish.

77
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,959
You can't be arrogant today.

78
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,519
What sorcery is this?

79
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,799
Qi.

80
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,280
Jinzhao.

81
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,359
Jinzhao, are you okay?

82
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:53,959
Yes.

83
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,359
Find a chance to run
and get Luo for help.

84
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,399
But...

85
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,079
Go.

86
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,480
Are you okay?

87
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:10,200
Go.

92
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:42,320
Demon. This lady is a demon.

93
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,359
Stay calm.

94
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,000
Stay calm.

95
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,399
W-W-We should show them some mercy
and don't go overboard,

96
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,799
right?

97
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,799
Let's retreat for now.

98
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,799
Go!

99
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,119
Go.

100
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,880
Let's go.

101
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,280
Jinzhao.

102
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,216
Jinzhao, wake up.

103

110
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,560
Master, don't be hasty to test me.

111
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,600
Xian Qing is injured.

112
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,304
(Mount Yuqing's leader, Gu Hanjiang)

113
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,519
Xian Qing is injured again?

114
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:53,439

115
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,439

116
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,079
Master Luo, I'll escort you back.

117
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,199
Okay, I'll just wait at the door.

118
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,040
We're now at Mount Yuqing.

119
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,040

120
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,079

Master.

128
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,999
He's exhausted his energy.

129
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
He probably won't wake up soon.

131
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,120

someone with half of his energy.

171
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,519

173

174

to exchange his life
for half of Xian Qing's energy.

00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:05,680

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,040
Later, when Xian Qing was weak,

178
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,800
he was attacked by a beast

179
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,800

180
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,560

181
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,800

00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,639
I'm a bit sleepy.

189
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:20,080
Don't sleep, Jinzhao.

190
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,224
You can't sleep.

191
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,599
If you fall asleep,

192
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,160
I'll take away all your money.

193
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,960
And the little fish jade pendant.

194
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,200
I'll pawn it off.

195
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:34,999
Don't leave me alone.

196
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,119

that someone would return his energy.

You're really lucky.

Let's handle it.

246
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,080

Now, Qi and Yue Jinzhao
are under our care.

252
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:18,280
Why do you keep following them?

253
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,639
May I ask your intention?

254
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,119
This is how you take care of them?

255
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,832
They are badly injured.

256
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,359
No wonder His Lordship
doesn't trust you.

257
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,040
Please go back and tell him.

258
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,759
Right now, Qi and Yue Jinzhao
are undergoing trials.

259
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,920
Everything is under our control.

260
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,119
There's no need to worry.

261
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,160
Someone's coming.

262
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,239
Huan, let's go.

263
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:52,440
Let's go.

264
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,999
Master, they're over there.

265
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:16,040
Sorry.

266
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,680

267
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,080
(my energy.)

268
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,080
Zhaoyan.

269
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,680
You've returned my energy to me.

270
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,320
How will you sustain yourself?

271
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,160
Your energy

272
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,328
can only make me stronger

273
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:36,200
but can't extend my life.

274
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:38,879
For you,

275
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
it can be of more use.

276
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:50,800
Zhaoyan,

277
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,200
what on earth do you want?

278
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,200
Today, I coincidentally learned

279
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:12,960
20 years ago,

280
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,680
my father once had a deal with you.

281
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,080
It turns out that when I was young,

282
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,840
I had already received your kindness.

283
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,879
But my father failed
to fulfill his promise.

284
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,840
I should return

285
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,440
this half of the energy to you.

286
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:41,560
For thousands of years,

287
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,160
countless people have asked me
for my energy.

288
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,040
I don't care if they can return it.

289
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,879
You are the first one
to return my energy to me.

Zhaoyan,

291
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,479

do you know losing the demonic power

335
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,560
will make your body even weaker?

Alright.

341
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,359
I'll say something you'd like to hear.

342
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,479
The Zhengwu Alliance has annihilated
the Qiyuan Sect's Jiangning stronghold.

343
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,639
I'm also very concerned
about Bian Luohuan's escape.

344
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,719
I will go to
the Zhengwu Alliance immediately

345
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,519
to check for any further clues.

346
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,999
Is it very funny?

347
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:03,080
As expected of you.

348
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,359
Once I mention the Qiyuan Sect,
you immediately perk up.

349
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,359
Since you've already returned
the demonic power,

350
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:13,200
be sure to take care of yourself.

351
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:26,080
Zhaoyan.

352
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,840
You're so eager to establish

353
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,840
achievement and career.

354
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,999
This time, you got drained a lot,

355
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,999
so I got you some medicine to replenish

356
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,280
your energy.

357
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,840
Thank you.

Before you went down
the mountain to travel with Xiu,

359
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,200
I divined a fortune for you.

360
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:06,679
The divination showed
that you'd face a love tribulation.

361
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,424
A love tribulation?

362
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,759
Whether it is a calamity
or fate is not yet certain.

363
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,199
It seems you are serious this time.

364
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,719
For thousands of years,
you have not been serious.

365

I've never seen
you take someone so seriously.

00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,640
It might be

367
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,759
