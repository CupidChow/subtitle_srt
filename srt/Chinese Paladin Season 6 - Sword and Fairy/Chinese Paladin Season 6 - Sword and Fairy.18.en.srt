21
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,319
I bet you've upset Her Lordship again.

22
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,999
Go apologize to her.

23
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,120
Shuo Xuan, ever since I met you
in the Jincui Oasis,

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,719
you've been treating me badly.

25
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,040
Do I owe you money

26
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,839
or have I done something to you?

27
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,679
You took away my mother.

28
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,519
You are Zhu Yu's daughter too?

29
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,680
My mother was Ling Ye,
the former queen of our clan.

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,280
The body that Zhu Yu is using now

31
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,120
is my mother's.

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,559
Hundreds of years ago, the Yu Clan
resided at the bottom of the North Sea.

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,840
Our Queen Ling Ye,

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,960
my mother,

35
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,320
found a nice and warm habitat
at the North Sea

36
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,079
and migrated the entire clan there.

37
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,960
Hundreds of years later,
the Sea of Clear Skies prospered

38
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,680
and became the Pearl of the North Sea.

39
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:11,879
And then? How did Ling Ye pass away?

40
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,599
How did Zhu Yu become
the Lord of the Yu Clan?

41
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,799
Nobody knew

42
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,000
the Sea of Clear Skies
was built on the back of Kun.

43
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,000
Kun was born from the sea.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,320
It sleeps for hundreds of centuries
to gather strength,

45
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,360
waiting to jump out
of the sea and ascend.

46
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,072
You're right.

47
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:49,720
On the day of its ascension,

48
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,919
the Sea of Clear Skies on its back

49
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,119
almost collapsed into ruins.

50
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,280
My mother Ling Ye drained her power

51
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,360
to reach Kun's awareness
via the Meditation Spell

52
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,679
and stopped the ascension.

53
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,000
So Kun was Zhu Yu?

54
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,199
Her Lordship stopped ascending.

55
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,888
She took over Ling Ye's body

56
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,119
and started saving the Yu Clan.

57
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,240
She housed all the survivors here

58
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,839
and treated them with her life power.

59
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,319
Years later, those who were
less injured or had greater energy

60
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,280
could finally move around.

61
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:48,119
All the survivors of the Yu Clan you see

62
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,600
are cured by Her Lordship
with her life power.

63
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,399
She was drained and about to die.

64
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,559
But thanks to Qiyuan...

65
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,440
Since you're back to Her Lordship now

66
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,600
and become the young lord,

67
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,304
you should appreciate
her sacrifice for the clan.

68
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,319
She ended up like this

69
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,456
because of us.

70
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,399
Zhu Yu.

71
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,880
I thought you were gone.

72
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,360
Zhu Yu, Shuo Xuan told me
what happened back then.

73
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,880
I didn't know you had suffered.

74
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,199
So will you stay
at the Sea of Clear Skies?

75
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,559
I'm willing to offer you anything
as long as you stay.

76
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:07,160
You're still mad at me as I lied to you?

77
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,240
No, it doesn't matter anymore.

78
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,320
Zhu Yu, Shuo Xuan would make
a better young lord than me.

79
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,839
There's nothing I can do here right now.

80
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:25,440
I don't feel the responsibilities
she mentioned.

81
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,359
I want to go out there
and gain strength.

82
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,239
Only then can I be helpful
to you one day.

83
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,399
My daughter is a big girl now.

84
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,040
I often recall the days
when I was carrying you.

85
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,320
I was amazed.

86
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,679
You were such a tiny creature.

87
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,959
Yet your heart pounded louder
than anything in the world.

88
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,720
I said you were free

89
00:07:19,992 --> 00:07:21,080
to stay or leave.

90
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,839
The Sea of Clear Skies moves.

91
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,920
Take it with you
and you'll sense my location.

92
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,200
Next time I come back,

93
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,839
I'll bring you
my favorite Ji's pastries.

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,016
Go.

95
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,544
Mr. Gu.

96
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,936
You're finally here.

97
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:34,519
It looks like someone has told you

98
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,600
I'd come by today.

99
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:40,839
Miss Ming wouldn't eat or come out.

100
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,040
Is she fine in there?

101
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,448
There is a reason. Xiu hates to
meet people on her birthday.

102
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,480
I apologize on her behalf.

103
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,760
Please don't say that.

104
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,920
Mr. Ju, do you own this property?

105
00:08:57,239 --> 00:09:00,399
Well... I guess.

106
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,880
Senior, what...

107
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,920
He lost it without any sign.

108
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,920
Like "master", like "disciple".

109
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,880
Master.

110
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,280
I rarely come to Jing'an.

111
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,799
I heard that the river view
in the city is amazing,

112
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,200
especially at night.

113
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,959
Xiu, come with me for a walk.

114
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:39,864
Join us at the port for fine wine.

115
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,519
I'll go get Jinzhao.

116
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,280
Here. Come on.

117
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,399
Welcome. Pick whatever you like.

118
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,720
Look, the lanterns are also
local specialty.

119
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,600
Look around. Pick anything you like.

120
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,119
This one? Alright.

121
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,799
It's a pretty lantern.
Thank you, Shifang.

122
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,808
Don't mention it.

123
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,600
And for Mr. Gu. Here.

124
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,920
Get him the same one as yours.
What do you say?

125
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,680
Thank you. Such a delicate lantern
brings out the deepest nostalgia.

126
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,672
Jinzhao, check this out.

127
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
If Little Yue was here,

128
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,360
- See you at the port.
- she'd love it.

129
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,160
Look. So lively.

130
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,152
Yeah.

131
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,416
Over there.

132
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,736
Xiu is here.

133
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,560
Please get to the shore.

134
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,608
Alright.

135
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,552
How many are there left?

136
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:45,464
- Five.
- Qi.

137
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:47,096
You are...?

138
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,800
I'm sorry.

139
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,240
Zhaoyan, why is your lantern
different from Xiu's?

140
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,240
It was a random pick.

141
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,839
You picked a wolf?

142
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,800
A wolf? It's obviously a dog.

143
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,600
The meat smells great.

144
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,944

Yeah. Time is pressing.

174
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,519
I made a gadget for Miss Ming.

00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,120
It's not an important day.

185
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,360
I find it important.

186
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:36,560
Ming Xiu, birthday matters.
But I didn't...

187
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,639
Didn't what?

188
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:40,664
- Here. It's from both of us.
- Thank you.

189
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:42,136
- Thank you.
- When did you get it?

190
00:16:42,136 --> 00:16:43,832
How do you know I'd be back?

191
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:44,856
I just do.

192
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,360
Miss Ming, I heard
in the Western Regions,

193
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,720
if someone makes a birthday wish,

194
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,560
Heaven will make it come true.

195
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:57,079
Really? Miss Ming, come on. Make a wish.

196
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,439
My master knows my wishes.

197
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,280
I've aged.

198
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,120
I only hope that someone can
fulfill your wish soon.

199
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,360
Some wishes
can't be fulfilled by random people.

200
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,639
Little Yue, what do you wish for?

201
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:31,120
Endless delicacies, I guess.

202
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,639
I wish I could live happily

203
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,240
and peacefully with Jinzhao forever.

204
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,240
So I matter more than food.

205
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,040
Of course. You'll get me delicacies
when we're together, anyway.

206
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,256
It's killing two birds with one stone.

207
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:48,920
Thank you.

208
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,199
We know what Jinzhao wants.

209
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:53,784
And you, Luo?

210
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,839
It's still the same.

211
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:00,600
I want the people
to remember the Luo family

212
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,688
and me.

213
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,480
Master Luo is truly ambitious.

214
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:07,439
Xian Qing, what do you wish for?

215
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,680
I have no obsession, hence, no wishes.

216
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,879
Xian Qing, don't be so resolute.

217
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:17,759
Hanjiang, let go of your obsession.

218
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,632
What about you, Shifang?

219
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,199
M-My wish is to

220
00:18:29,439 --> 00:18:31,959
become a great gadget technician
like my mother

221
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,720
and to gather for birthdays

222
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,839
like we're doing right now.

223
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,616
We will.

224
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,519
So we can make two wishes.
I lost my chance.

225
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,079
Come on, cheers.

226
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,999
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

227
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,759
Ming Xiu, happy birthday!

228
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,280
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

229
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:00,920
Jinzhao, look. River lanterns.

230
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:03,896
Come with me.

231
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:04,984
Alright.

232
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,752
Flow far far away, my little lantern.

233
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,280

Mr. Ju can't drink at all.

00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:23,599
Master, your eyes...

257
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,200
It's fine. Maybe I drank too much.

258
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:39,160
I just remembered.

259
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,399
You used to imitate Xian Qing and me
drinking when you were a kid.

260
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,719
But you fell asleep after a few sips,

261
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,560
and I had to carry you to your room.

262
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:51,200
Time flies and you're a big girl now.

263
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,519
Master, has it ever

264
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,320
crossed your mind that I was only...

265
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,239
You drank a lot. Take a nap.

266
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,359
Will you run away when I'm asleep?

267
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,576
Run away?

268
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:28,040
I'm not leaving.

269
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:04,200
Xiu, I am really worried about you.

270
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:13,040
Mother, is it true
that I'm not gifted as a technician?

271
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,200
I want to be like you

272
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,359
and make fabulous gadgets like Dou Bao.

273
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:29,519
Also, I swear I will protect Dou Bao.

274
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,960
That's the only thing you left me.

275
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,516
The view is truly breathtaking.

276
00:24:09,564 --> 00:24:12,056
You're heading to the Zhengwu Alliance.

277
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,990
I won't go with you.

278
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:17,624
Take care.

279
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,504
Be very careful when you try
to take their headquarters.

280
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,904
Alright.

281
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:32,696
Xian Qing.

282
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,590
Where are you going?

283
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:43,671
Why? Are you reluctant to leave me?

284
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:51,311
Next time we meet, we'll enjoy

285
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:54,911
the river view during the day.
What do you say?

286
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,112
I'd love to.

287
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:04,760
It's a deal.

288
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:10,296
Deal.

289
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:37,592
(Zhengwu Alliance)
Guanren, the trigrams show

290
00:25:38,191 --> 00:25:39,710
the alliance will be in grave danger.

291
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:42,151
I'm worried that it's about

292
00:25:42,151 --> 00:25:44,070
your attack on the Qiyuan Sect.

293
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,710
I finally found out
where their headquarters is.

294
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,976
It's a rare chance.

295
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:55,031
It will be hard to take them down
if we miss this chance.

296
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:59,448
Hanjiang, you're a great man,
wise and brave.

297
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,791
But you are slightly obsessed
with fortune-telling.

298
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:08,950
Fine. But I'll come with you.

299
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:11,431
That would be great.

300
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:16,151
Mr. Zuo, Mr. Gu.

301
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,911
Here's the map Meng Cheng provided.

302
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,791
It shows the headquarters
of the Qiyuan Sect.

303
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,271
They have a front and a rear gate.

304
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:31,271
Judging from the terrace,
we will break in from the front.

305
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,191
As for the rear gate...

306
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:35,288
We got this.

307
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,070
Alright, you are highly skilled.

308
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,870
They won't be able
to handle our attack on both fronts.

309
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:46,870
It would be great if we could

310
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,710
wipe them out at once.

311
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:51,192
Time is pressing. I'll inform everyone.

312
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:52,792
Alright.

313
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,408
Master.

314
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,311
Master, why didn't you come back
with Xian Qing yesterday?

315
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:16,590
And what happened to your eyes?

316
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:23,151
You have so many questions.

317
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:26,191
Which one should I answer first?

318
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,230
I had a glimpse of the future
at Pureness some days ago.

319
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:35,911
I took a few glances and hurt my eyes.

320
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:44,110
Are you joining them on the attack
because of what you saw?

321
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,470
Xiu, I will go with Mr. Zuo.

322
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,311
You will go with Mr. Yue.

323
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:53,528
Be careful.

324
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,950
Aren't you going to protect me?

325
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,911
You're a big girl now.

326
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:07,710
You don't need my protection.

327
00:28:22,631 --> 00:28:27,110
Master, I've never let you down.

328
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,031
But you don't mind letting me down.

329
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:56,191
(I saw a huge casualty
of the Zhengwu Alliance at Pureness.)

330
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,350
(But I don't know whether)

331
00:28:59,191 --> 00:29:01,271
(it will happen during this attack.)

332
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:17,431
(It's less worrying to have Xian Qing
protect Xiu in the dark.)

333
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,911
(Other than that, I have to)

334
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,031
(change what I've seen
even if it costs me my life.)

335
00:29:42,391 --> 00:29:45,590
Over the past two decades, our alliance

336
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:48,870
has annihilated

337
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:51,191
countless evil creatures

338
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:54,031
to guard our nation.

339
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:57,710
(Ningzheng Hall)
Right now, the nation is at risk.

340
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,911
People are tormented by the Qiyuan Sect.

341
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,230
We must bring justice to the world.

342
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:10,511
- Bring justice to the world.
- Bring justice to the world.

343
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:12,070
- Bring justice to the world.
- Bring justice to the world.

00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,791
Yue Jinzhao.

345
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,136
(Ningzheng Hall)
Mr. Zuo.

346
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,671
This blade is the Silver Shadow,

347
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:44,070
a collection of the Sword Sage
on Shushan Mount.

348
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,350
It was passed on
to the Demon Lord's son.

349
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:54,031
I will give this blade to you today.

for giving me this blade.

358

361
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:38,151
Good. Men shouldn't seek fame
from the weapons they hold.

00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,031
Our weapons should be known
because of us.

363
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:43,830
Mr. Yue, try it.

(Headquarters of the Qiyuan Sect)

369
00:32:26,631 --> 00:32:27,870
Our great Lord Ming.

370
00:32:29,311 --> 00:32:31,830
All mighty Lord Ming.

371
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:38,830
I, Gao Xiao, pledge to you
as the sect leader of Qiyuan.

372
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,870
We shall serve you
with the greatest loyalty

373
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:49,230
and make your glorious glow
shine upon the world.

374
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:52,391
May Lord Ming bless us.

375
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,870

381
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,231
The map says it's the rear passage
to the headquarters.

382
00:34:43,736 --> 00:34:47,270
Jinzhao, we must destroy the Qiyuan Sect

383
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,312
ruthlessly.

384
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:54,350
Jinzhao, how come you're always so calm

385
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,991
like you can see the future?

386
00:34:58,391 --> 00:34:59,416
To the left.

387
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,790
Jinzhao, are you alright?

388
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:09,951
Don't worry. It's always like that.

389
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:14,911
I can see the future indeed.

390
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:17,711
So pull yourself together.

391
00:35:18,231 --> 00:35:20,070
I'm here so we won't lose.

392
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:27,110
Mr. Yue, Mr. Ju, let's enter.

393
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:37,350
My master came along this time

394
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:40,471
and I have the feeling
that he's hiding something.

395
00:35:42,911 --> 00:35:43,951
Don't worry, Miss Ming.

396
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,550
There are so many alliance disciples.

397
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,991
And Mr. Gu is a great fighter.

398
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:49,191
Nobody will be in danger.

399
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,608
Let's go.

400
00:36:19,951 --> 00:36:21,431
Why so hesitant? Hurry up.

401
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,110
Qianjun, no rush.

402
00:36:23,951 --> 00:36:27,151
The ground seems dug
on both sides. It's fishy.

403
00:36:29,391 --> 00:36:30,550
Let's talk first.

404
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,631
Mr. Yue, what do you say?

405
00:36:32,631 --> 00:36:33,656
To the left.

406
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,310
Do as he says. To the left.

407
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,000
Xu. Can we count on him?

408
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:50,350
Of course. Remember
what he did at the Langyin Pavilion...

409
00:36:53,951 --> 00:36:55,032
