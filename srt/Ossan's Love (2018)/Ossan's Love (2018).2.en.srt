00:22:57,654 --> 00:23:00,987
my bag with the sales contract was snatched.

361
00:23:00,987 --> 00:23:04,044
We chased after the robber.

362
00:23:04,044 --> 00:23:06,120
Stop right there!

363
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,010
I got you, you bastard.

364
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,500
Haruta. No... ouch.

365
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,587
Chief Kurosawa?

366
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:20,587
You were injured.

367
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,220
And what happened after that?

368
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,812
- That's all I remember.
- There was more to the story.

369
00:23:28,812 --> 00:23:31,779
- The fatal moment.
- Fatal moment?

370
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:35,029
Come on!

371
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:37,940
Ouch. It hurts.

372
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,154
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- No problem.

373
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:42,512
There are no drugstores nearby.

374
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:44,644
Sorry about this.

375
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:46,554
- It's cold.
- Are you all right?

376
00:23:46,554 --> 00:23:48,096
But it's nice and cold.

377
00:23:48,096 --> 00:23:49,828
That's great.

378
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,644
We should head back.

379
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,844
At that moment,

380
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,863
you made me your Cinderella.

381
00:24:14,863 --> 00:24:17,244
- No way!
- Don't worry.

382
00:24:17,244 --> 00:24:20,262
I've asked my wife for a divorce.

383
00:24:20,262 --> 00:24:22,721
Give me time, just a little longer.

384
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:25,387
- Director, we really need to clarify this.
- Haru-tan.

385
00:24:25,387 --> 00:24:27,229
Haruta!

386
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,354
I just came to say hello to you all.

387
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:38,540
- Madam, you're super sick.
- Excuse me?

388
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,721
You're freaking beautiful.

389
00:24:40,721 --> 00:24:45,212
I have no problem dating you. It's definitely a yes for me.

390
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,844
Is he from outer space?

391
00:24:47,844 --> 00:24:50,262
Don't mind him.

392
00:24:50,262 --> 00:24:52,362
Get lost!

393
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,179
It's a smaller branch, but thanks to the Director,

394
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:03,237
we're the top-selling branch in the company.

395
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:06,754
We're all very close like family.

396
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,244
Is this everyone from the branch staff?

397
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:14,712
Let me see...

398
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:18,379
We have two salesmen out on calls.

399
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,721
So you're Ms. Aki Miyajima?

400
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:23,887
Who do you love?

401
00:25:23,887 --> 00:25:25,944
Haru-tan.

402
00:25:25,944 --> 00:25:28,544
What's your nickname?

403
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:31,580
- Akkie.
- Akkie?

404
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,412
Ms. Maika Segawa, what's your nickname?

405
00:25:34,412 --> 00:25:36,521
It's Maimai.

406
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:39,470
It can't be her.

407
00:25:40,144 --> 00:25:41,995
Maki?

408
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,404
- Director Kurosawa.
- Yes?

409
00:25:51,404 --> 00:25:56,944
During the working hours, please put personal affairs aside.

410
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,621
What do you mean?

411
00:25:58,621 --> 00:26:01,212
Can't you see you made him feel uncomfortable?

412
00:26:01,212 --> 00:26:02,863
What's with you, Maki?

413
00:26:02,863 --> 00:26:04,212
Forget it.

414
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:09,440
I know I shouldn't say this to my direct superior.

415
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:13,612
But stop chasing after Haruta.

416
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,220
I have no idea what you mean.

417
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,412
You pressured him with the home-made lunch.

418
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:19,851
Is that right, Haruta?

419
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:21,537
No, not really...

420
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:24,844
Do you think he can be honest with his boss?

421
00:26:24,844 --> 00:26:26,095
Maki, that's enough.

422
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:28,663
Director, you can't possibly protect him.

423
00:26:28,663 --> 00:26:30,154
Don't tell me, you...

424
00:26:30,154 --> 00:26:32,337
That's right.

425
00:26:32,337 --> 00:26:34,237
I'm head-over-heels for Haruta.

426
00:26:34,237 --> 00:26:37,137
I know you're my boss, but I won't let you have him, by all means.

427
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,104
No, no.

428
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,845
You said you were joking.

429
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:56,395
Shut your mouth!

430
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:59,570
It's me who fill his tummy with my home cooked meal every day.

431
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,570
- What?
- That's right.

432
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,012
You didn't know we live together?

433
00:27:02,012 --> 00:27:05,044
- Live-in lovers?
- No, room-share.

434
00:27:05,044 --> 00:27:08,262
I've spent a decade working with him.

435
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:11,245
So what? Relationships are all about depth, not duration.

436
00:27:11,245 --> 00:27:13,870
I made him what he is today.

437
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,404
Stop fighting!

438
00:27:15,404 --> 00:27:18,621
Fine. Can you list Haru-tan's ten best qualities?

439
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:21,262
Do you even know his ten worst qualities?

440
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:25,387
Well... he's far too cute.

441
00:27:25,387 --> 00:27:27,479
His existence is a sin.

442
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,644
He's pure and overwhelmingly cute.

443
00:27:30,644 --> 00:27:33,663
He's indecisive, wakes up in a bad mood, leaves his clothes everywhere,

444
00:27:33,663 --> 00:27:36,179
is too picky, leaves shoes everywhere, doesn't wash the dishes,

445
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:39,037
picks food off my plate, get caught in a ticket-gate, has no sense of direction,

446
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:40,463
and sleeps on his stomach.

447
00:27:40,463 --> 00:27:42,196
- Am I that bad?
- You didn't know that, did you?

448
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:44,329
Don't speak badly of Haru-tan.

449
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,504
- Get lost, you old fart!
- How dare you!

450
00:27:47,504 --> 00:27:49,954
Don't you get it? You made him squirm!

451
00:27:49,954 --> 00:27:53,854
- True love has no age limits.
- You two!

452
00:27:53,854 --> 00:27:56,620
- Butt out, you jerk!
- You punk. Little brat!

453
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,960
- Spoiled little brat!
- You old geezer.

454
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,887
You two, stop fighting!

455
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,904
Stop fighting over me!

456
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,844
It's 1 p.m. Let's get back to work.

457
00:28:16,844 --> 00:28:18,944
We shall.

458
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,087
Quick, over here.

459
00:28:28,087 --> 00:28:29,512
They're delicious. Have one.

460
00:28:29,512 --> 00:28:33,212
Thank you. I will.

461
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,580
Hello, this is Tenku Real Estate.

462
00:28:44,163 --> 00:28:45,844
Is that you, Kazu?

463
00:28:45,844 --> 00:28:48,495
I'm sorry, Haruta.

464
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:51,044
We won't be needing a house now.

465
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:52,596
What happened?

466
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:57,621
I can't overlook her flaws.

467
00:28:57,621 --> 00:28:59,704
Our standards are too different, so we can't live together.

468
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,721
Hold on a second.

469
00:29:01,721 --> 00:29:07,144
I'll be your mediator. Let's view one more property tomorrow.

470
00:29:07,144 --> 00:29:10,144
- Yes, but...
- I beg you.

471
00:29:10,144 --> 00:29:12,087
Okay then.

472
00:29:12,087 --> 00:29:15,304
But I don't think we can get past this.

473
00:29:15,304 --> 00:29:17,821
Kazu, listen...

474
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:20,312
Hello?

475
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,660
Geez.

476
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,844
Good evening.

477
00:29:41,844 --> 00:29:44,045
Hi there.

478
00:29:45,621 --> 00:29:48,854
How come he's here?

479
00:29:52,663 --> 00:29:56,512
Why are you so awkward around him?

480
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:02,220
I know! You spilled soy sauce on a freshly laundered shirt.

481
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,071
Wrong.

482
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:10,044
- Tell me what happened.
- Nothing.

483
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:13,254
It's far from nothing!

484
00:30:13,254 --> 00:30:15,945
Explain what happened earlier?

485
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:19,521
Do you have any idea what you did to our boss?

486
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,012
You told him that you love me.

487
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:29,095
I had enough of your stupid jokes.

488
00:30:30,844 --> 00:30:35,837
- I wasn't joking at all. You're so dull-witted.
- What?

489
00:30:35,837 --> 00:30:38,340
I'm in love with you!

490
00:30:39,154 --> 00:30:41,521
Did you get that?

491
00:30:41,521 --> 00:30:44,644
I'm head-over-heels for you, Haruta!

492
00:30:46,704 --> 00:30:50,844
I don't care if my biggest rival is our boss!

493
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:56,028
What? I don't get it.

494
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:57,704
Are you seriously saying that?

495
00:30:57,704 --> 00:30:59,804
I am!

496
00:31:02,721 --> 00:31:05,763
That's not why I asked you to move in!

497
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,345
I knew that from the very beginning!

498
00:31:08,345 --> 00:31:10,821
Haruta.

499
00:31:10,844 --> 00:31:13,812
Wait a second. What's going on here?

500
00:31:13,812 --> 00:31:18,437
Aren't we... just co-workers at the same company?

501
00:31:18,437 --> 00:31:22,320
Did you plan all this from the start?

502
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,463
All that cooking and cleaning was to demonstrate your love?

503
00:31:28,944 --> 00:31:32,162
I feel like I've been betrayed!

504
00:31:34,345 --> 00:31:36,245
You're right.

505
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:41,812
Sorry about that. My bill, please.

506
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:46,404
Don't leave. I'm not done talking!

507
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,844
- It hurts.
- What a jerk!

508
00:31:56,844 --> 00:32:01,244
It was you who asked him to move in with you, wasn't it?

509
00:32:01,244 --> 00:32:05,844
You took advantage of him, and now you're playing the victim.

510
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:12,404
A man like you, who has no consideration toward others, doesn't deserve a house mate.

511
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,040
[Ossan's Love]

512
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:38,521
I'll be late tonight, so heat up the curry in the fridge.

513
00:33:00,554 --> 00:33:02,879
Damn it.

514
00:33:04,945 --> 00:33:07,944
This is super-delicious.

515
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:13,254
A man like you, who has no consideration toward others, doesn't deserve a house mate.

516
00:33:23,621 --> 00:33:26,704
Why am I running? Why?

517
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,644
I'm Ryota Maki. Pleased to meet you.

518
00:33:37,117 --> 00:33:40,387
- Idiot!
- Sorry.

519
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:44,744
No mistake, living with Maki was fun.

520
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,429
If he was a girl...

521
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:54,179
I like you.

522
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:58,044
that confession would have made me happy.

523
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:03,187
Maki?

524
00:34:05,554 --> 00:34:07,454
Sorry about that.

525
00:34:07,454 --> 00:34:11,663
Did I reject him just because he's a guy?

526
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:14,644
I'm head-over-heels for you, Haruta.

527
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:20,387
I... I...

528
00:34:20,387 --> 00:34:28,279
I love young ladies with big boobs! Damn it!

529
00:34:52,854 --> 00:34:57,328
Sorry... about earlier.

530
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,004
- You stink.
- Shut up!

531
00:35:07,412 --> 00:35:09,837
What the heck are you doing out here?

532
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:12,937
I'm star-gazing.

533
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,071
I don't see any stars.

534
00:35:18,844 --> 00:35:24,371
That's because you're blind, Haruta.

535
00:35:29,563 --> 00:35:31,845
I'll go stay at my friend's place.

536
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:33,871
Maki.

537
00:35:35,704 --> 00:35:37,554
- Let go.
- Listen to me.

538
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:41,744
If there's no chance for me, don't play with me.

539
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,704
I shouldn't have moved in.

540
00:35:44,704 --> 00:35:47,104
- Listen!
- I'll leave!

541
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:50,596
- Forget all about me.
- I don't want to.

542
00:35:55,012 --> 00:36:00,012
We're way too incompatible, so we can no longer live together.

543
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:04,563
I don't think so!

544
00:36:05,804 --> 00:36:08,529
Let me explain.

545
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:12,004
I think... how should I say this?

546
00:36:13,154 --> 00:36:15,844
I need you.

547
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:23,128
- What does that mean?
- Well, you know...

548
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,928
I enjoy being with you.

549
00:36:29,844 --> 00:36:33,154
I can work on my shortcomings.

550
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:37,454
I mean, can't we...

551
00:36:37,454 --> 00:36:42,663
live together as friends like before?

552
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:52,054
Seriously. Haruta, you're being unfair.

553
00:37:12,245 --> 00:37:14,844
We can never go back.

554
00:37:18,012 --> 00:37:20,329
Wait, Maki!

555
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:36,180
♫ Summer still remains in the blue sky at the end of September ♫

556
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:40,329
♫ It brings back so many memories ♫

557
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:43,744
Soichi Haruta?

558
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:51,320
♫ After a rain shower passed, you said, "it looks like ice cream" ♫

559
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,600
Is it much further?

560
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,270
We're almost there.

561
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:02,150
This is it.

562
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,700
Huh?

563
00:38:06,012 --> 00:38:07,804
I'm sorry.

564
00:38:09,095 --> 00:38:13,630
No place seemed to meet your requirements.

565
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,980
Wait...

566
00:38:14,987 --> 00:38:17,895
Then why did you drag us out here?

567
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:20,512
Kazu and Hina,

568
00:38:20,512 --> 00:38:25,028
- can you imagine ideal home from scratch?
- From scratch?

569
00:38:25,028 --> 00:38:32,070
We've looked for homes with your individual needs.

570
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:38,744
But now, I need you to tell me your necessary conditions,

571
00:38:38,763 --> 00:38:43,844
for the two of you to live together.

572
00:38:43,844 --> 00:38:45,721
For the both of us?

573
00:38:45,721 --> 00:38:48,950
Exactly, a home for the two of you.

574
00:38:56,112 --> 00:39:01,080
I'd like to have children eventually.

575
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:06,837
Then we'll need a room to place a kid's bed.

576
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,637
It'd be nice to have a daycare center nearby.

577
00:39:09,637 --> 00:39:13,012
I'd love to have five kids.

578
00:39:13,012 --> 00:39:15,844
You've never mentioned that before.

579
00:39:15,844 --> 00:39:18,804
I've always wanted a big family.

580
00:39:18,804 --> 00:39:21,744
Then you'll need to earn more money.

581
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:24,329
Don't be so pushy!

582
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:26,170
We'll both need to try harder.

583
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,940
Naturally, I'll do my best.

584
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,070
♫ The festival music, blasting fireworks, ♫

585
00:39:34,554 --> 00:39:37,544
Excuse me.

586
00:39:39,304 --> 00:39:41,529
Welcome, Ma'am.

587
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:46,371
You must be Soichi Haruta,

588
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:49,090
aren't you?

589
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:51,154
That's me.

590
00:39:51,154 --> 00:39:56,344
There's something I need to ask you.

591
00:39:56,344 --> 00:39:58,544
Can we talk?

592
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,570
Sure.

593
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,550
