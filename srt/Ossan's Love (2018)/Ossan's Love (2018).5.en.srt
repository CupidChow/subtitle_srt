About four years ago.

181
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,276
What? Before he joined the company?

182
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,470
When he was a student, he visited me, his alumni, as a part of his job hunting.

183
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:31,935
Why choose real estate?

184
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:35,662
No particular reason.

185
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:38,578
It's not like it's my chosen career.

186
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:45,306
What do you see yourself doing here?

187
00:13:45,306 --> 00:13:46,990
Well...

188
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:52,053
His indecisiveness really got my hackles up.

189
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:54,178
Listen carefully.

190
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:58,802
I'm wasting valuable time being here to mentor you.

191
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:00,976
Aren't you being rude?

192
00:14:03,835 --> 00:14:07,919
If you're so reluctant, give up on job hunting. Beat it.

193
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:10,972
I flat-out told him off.

194
00:14:10,972 --> 00:14:14,935
I can emphasize with that.

195
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:16,735
Right?

196
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:20,803
Then, I ran into him again when I was handing out flyers.

197
00:14:20,803 --> 00:14:23,507
There are single-family homes for sale.

198

Oh, it's you.

201
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:33,691
What a nuisance. Go away.

202
00:14:33,691 --> 00:14:35,410
Let me do that.

203
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,040
What?

204
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,835
Hey.

205
00:14:41,835 --> 00:14:43,503
Please.

No stranger has ever scolded me as severely as you did.

209
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:00,761
- Are you from Generation X?
- No, I'm a Millennial.

210
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:02,711
That's the same thing.

211
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,570
Here.

212
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:15,670
All my classmates have found their ideal careers,

213
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:18,560
but I've got nothing.

214
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,835
However, I read your company introductory essay,

215
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:25,203
and it really inspired me.

216
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:28,449
Is that why you paid me an alumni visit to my company?

217
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:29,903
Yes.

218
00:15:29,903 --> 00:15:32,122
Sorry, but I don't remember what I wrote.

219
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:34,734
You wrote, "it's not about doing the job you love,

He fell for me, and applied to our company.

223
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:50,135
But you two split up, didn't you?

224
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:55,228
He worked at the headquarters, and I worked at a branch.

225
00:15:55,228 --> 00:15:58,095
Our different lifestyles have driven us apart.

226
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:04,835
But I'll never make the same mistake twice.

He wants a reconciliation, so I have to leave Maki?

235

I don't want to do that.

Did you go to Dreamland with Maro?

242
00:17:11,815 --> 00:17:15,743
No, something came up at work and I had to cancel.

243
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,253
Is that right?

244
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:20,928
I feel bad for him. I must make up for it.

245
00:17:20,928 --> 00:17:23,299
No need, don't overthink it.

- No, it's for you.

How about we go to the aquarium?

00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:31,900
One time, back in high school,

Haruta was attacked by a seal at the aquarium.

You're the one who's being rude.

- This whole time you've only talked about Haruta.

I'm sorry.

00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:14,900
Let me give you a piece of advice.

00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,659
Haruta is too thick-headed.

00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:21,999

Why is a civil servant so unfriendly?

355
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:55,718
It was a major event in life, he should have said something.

00:25:05,866 --> 00:25:10,609
You said the exact same thing when we got married.

359
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:14,384
You complained the clerk didn't offer congratulations.

360
00:25:14,384 --> 00:25:16,600
- Did I?
- Yes.

361
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,542
It's been so long. I forgot.

362
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:23,359
I know. Let's go there.

363
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,685
Where?

364
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:26,342
This way.

365
00:25:26,342 --> 00:25:29,020
- What?
- Come on!

367
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,234
Haruta!

368
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,790
Hi, there.

369
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:46,718
- Why the seaside?
- Sorry. The ocean seems furious.

370
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:48,661
By the way, where's Maro?

371
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:51,089
He left.

372
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,378
Did he dump you already?

373
00:25:54,378 --> 00:25:55,900
Will you shut up!

374
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,192
What's with these weird clothes, anyway?

375
00:25:59,192 --> 00:26:02,899
Maki chose them. If you don't like them, tell him.

376
00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:04,400
Where is Maki?

377
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,442
He had urgent work.

378
00:26:12,692 --> 00:26:17,759
We used to come here with Teppei in summer, remember?

379
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,493
I built that sandcastle and you destroyed it.

380
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:23,899
I was furious.

381
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:26,567
I remember that.

382
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,330
Go.

383
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:39,012
Haruta is too thick-headed.

384
00:26:39,012 --> 00:26:42,238
He'll never get it, unless you tell him.

385
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:47,712
- Listen, Haru—
- Chizu.

386
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,836
Sorry. You go ahead.

387
00:26:52,836 --> 00:26:55,371
No, you first.

388
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,536
You see...

389
00:27:11,234 --> 00:27:15,400
Maki and I are dating now.

390
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,000
What?

391
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:24,499
He asked me and I said yes.

392
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,004
But nothing has actually changed between us.

393
00:27:30,004 --> 00:27:34,178
I just thought I should tell you.

394
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:37,599
I see.

395
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:40,060
That's great.

396
00:27:40,776 --> 00:27:44,367
You're the first person I've told about it.

397
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:46,259
Really?

398
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,584
You know...

399
00:27:51,584 --> 00:27:58,820
I, for one, don't want anyone to know about it.

400
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:04,567
And that seemed to really upset Maki.

401
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,499
I see.

402
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:10,999
So you're a couple now?

403
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:13,309
Do you love him?

404
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:15,876
Well, I...

Right. Chizu, what did you

408
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:36,251
want to tell me?

409
00:28:36,251 --> 00:28:39,109
Wait. What was it?

410
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:42,367
I've completely forgotten what I wanted to say.

411
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,267
How is that possible?

412
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:46,925
Stop that! It's cold.

- Take this.
- It's cold.

00:28:56,442 --> 00:28:58,883
Wait a second.

Do you remember this place?

It's where you proposed to me.

420
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:33,126
Of course, I do.

- Sorry about this.
- What's the problem?

Actually, we have been dating.

438

Yes, we figured that much.

Honestly, I don't care if the words get out.

Let's not sneak around.

441
00:31:29,585 --> 00:31:32,966
But that would ruin my career.

442
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:35,192
This would cause great inconvenience to many people.

443
00:31:35,192 --> 00:31:37,792
Not if I explain it to them.

444
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:40,790
Why would we be criticized for loving someone?

445
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,130
We're not committing adultery.

446
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,766
Let's be open about it.

447
00:31:44,766 --> 00:31:47,950
That may work for you, but it'll destroy my career.

You're right.

A secret love can never last.

451
00:31:56,592 --> 00:31:59,966
Then we should break up.

00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,259

00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:20,866

00:32:20,866 --> 00:32:24,699
Yes, so...

460

Considering your career, I fully understand you want to keep it a secret.

00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,310
At the same time,

462
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,317
I also understand your wish to be open.

463
00:32:38,442 --> 00:32:40,766
People will always talk.

00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:23,100
What an unusual duo.

472
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:29,409
Why aren't I good enough for her?

473
00:33:30,818 --> 00:33:35,760
I am not inferior to him in any way.

474
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:40,217
I'm better looking, and have a better personality.

475
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:43,199
I have a gorgeous face.

476
00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:47,067
Cheer up, kiddo.

477
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:49,532
Thanks.

478
00:33:49,532 --> 00:33:54,099
I prepared the bacon-wrapped durian for you.

479
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:57,526
What's this? We didn't order it.

480
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:09,967
You know, I...

481
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:13,090
wanted to show him my mature side,

482
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,400
so I offered him a divorce.

483
00:34:27,551 --> 00:34:29,820
However...

484
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,510
here I am, over 50 years old.

485
00:34:35,125 --> 00:34:38,892
And I'm not even close to maturing.

486
00:34:40,234 --> 00:34:43,392
Why doesn't he love me?

487
00:34:43,392 --> 00:34:45,984
Every time I see him,

488
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,030
it's the only thing

489
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,600
I can think of.

490
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,076
I'll go wash up.

491
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,850
What are you doing?

492
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:02,800
Good girl. You did your best.

493
00:35:03,749 --> 00:35:06,657
- What?
- Stay still.

494
00:35:06,657 --> 00:35:10,700
When you hear the heartbeat,

495
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,670
don't you feel comforted?

496
00:35:16,584 --> 00:35:19,034
Don't tease an old lady.

497
00:35:20,442 --> 00:35:24,317
You just told me you're not mature.

498
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:28,342
Are you crazy?

499
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:53,050
Damn it! Damn it!

500
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:56,109

501
00:35:56,109 --> 00:35:58,525
Damn it!

506
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,367
I don't mind it. I feel apologetic because...

00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:32,899
Take it at your own pace.

I'm not at all ashamed of being with you.

Big news, everyone!

514
00:37:19,034 --> 00:37:22,326
A joint press conference is starting!

515
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:25,392
Come watch it.

516
00:37:25,392 --> 00:37:28,999
I, Tatsumi Kenzaki,

517
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:33,420
have been in a relationship with Miss Lemon Murokawa

518
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,986
with marriage in mind.

519
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:39,412
- He said it.
- He sure did.

520
00:37:39,412 --> 00:37:43,292
Wasn't it supposed to be top secret?

521
00:37:44,364 --> 00:37:45,800
With that said,

522
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,330
we no longer want to live our lives

523
00:37:49,331 --> 00:37:53,119
hiding ourselves in lies.

524
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:57,866
To all my fans and staffs

525
00:37:57,866 --> 00:38:01,020
who have been supporting me,

526
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,460
I apologize for all the troubles and concerns I have caused.

527
00:38:07,025 --> 00:38:11,970
But I am in love with Mr. Kenzaki.

528
00:38:12,759 --> 00:38:18,520
I'll work harder to earn your further support.

529
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:24,692
What prompted you to reveal your relationship now?

530
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:30,559
The reason we decided to make this public announcement,

531
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,643
is because we recently met a lovely couple.

532
00:38:33,643 --> 00:38:36,790
Actually, it's a couple of two men.

533
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,700
- But...
- Stop right there.

534
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,066
- Why did you do that?
- You!

535
00:38:41,066 --> 00:38:44,000
- That was the highlight.
- How dare you!

536
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,759
Everyone, clients will be here. Back to work.

537
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:58,699
Why would we be criticized for loving someone. We should be open about it.

538
00:38:58,699 --> 00:39:01,484
You can take it at your own pace, Haruta.

539
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:03,750
To not be a lover in name only,

540
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,400
I'll work harder to win your heart.

541
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:16,067
Everyone, I have an announcement.

542
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:21,392
I don't know how should I say this, but...

543
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:25,370
we're in a relationship.

544
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,975
- Huh?
- Say what?

545
00:39:27,975 --> 00:39:29,699
With whom?

546
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:41,025
Maki and I are dating.

547
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:48,426
Hold on a second!

548
00:39:57,526 --> 00:39:59,514
