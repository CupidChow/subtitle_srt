184
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,444
I wonder if Haruta will ever be happy,

185
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:25,186
if he stays with me.

186
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:27,001
Is that your excuse?

187
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:34,286
Do you value his happiness over your own?

188
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,320
I'm leaving.

189
00:11:42,428 --> 00:11:44,528
Take care.

190
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:54,844
It's spectacular!

191
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:58,701
How come Maki gets the luxurious properties?

192
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:04,377
Welcome home, Dear.

193
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:08,544
I'm kidding.

194
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,679
You're early.

195
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:16,594
I wanted to check the place out beforehand.

196
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:19,594
I knew you would, Haru-tan.

197
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:22,944
It's your first visit here, isn't it?

198
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:25,969
Let me show you around. Come in.

199
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:30,285
Come inside. Come on in.

200
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:32,253
Awesome!

201
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:37,701
- We need a strategy.
- A strategy?

202
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:41,027
First, what is your strong point?

203
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,601
S-Strong?

204
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:45,801
Your ability or forte.

205
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:48,844
Well, let me think.

206
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:52,575
Let's list them. First, you’re a man of action.

207
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:54,420
That's true.

208
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:57,402
And you're broad-minded.

209
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:01,477
Broad-minded. I know! You're financially well-off.

210
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:05,201
- Yes, not too bad.
- I'll put down "wealthy".

211
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,761
I know.

212
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:08,720
[A Family Man]

213
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,985
I'm a family man.

214
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:19,136
Normally, island kitchens retain steam during the cooking process.

215
00:13:19,136 --> 00:13:25,177
But in here, it's minimized by the latest, hi-tech range-hood.

216
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:27,177
I see.

217
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:31,344
Do you cook at home, Haru-tan?

218
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,628
No, not at all.

219
00:13:33,628 --> 00:13:35,294
Really?

220
00:13:39,044 --> 00:13:43,101
I, Musashi Kurosawa, will peel an apple.

221
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:07,501
Sex appeal of a mature man.

222
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:16,302
What's this? How does it work?

223
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:19,236
- Marvelous, isn't it?
- It's very impressive.

224
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:23,801
The bathtub is large enough for two adults.

225
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:26,428
You're right, and it's beautiful.

226
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:30,044
Why don't we try it out?

227
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:31,428
- To test it.
- To test it?

228
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:32,801
It's a simulation.

229
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:34,774
- Simulation for what?
- Just a simulation.

230
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:38,327
- That would be weird.
- It's only a simulation.

231
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:42,252
- No, that's weird, Director.
- Just get in.

232
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:48,069
That's not funny.

233
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,152
See? Like peas in a pod.

234
00:14:58,302 --> 00:15:00,078
You see...

235
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,161
I don't understand

236
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:09,601
why you chose Maki over me.

237
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,127
Director...

238
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,761
When you rejected me, I wanted to give up on you.

239
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:19,944
I told myself that your heart cannot be attained.

240
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:27,202
But then, you chose Maki out of all people.

241
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:29,801
He's a man!

242
00:15:29,801 --> 00:15:35,177
It reignited the fire in my heart.

243
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,326
I don't mind being your second.

244
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:41,911
- No, that won't happen.
- I'll wait for you.

245
00:15:41,911 --> 00:15:44,419
Don't waste your time on me.

246
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,885
- I can wait.
- Don't do this.

247
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:48,985
I shall wait.

248
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:53,269
That must be the client. I'll be right back.

249
00:15:56,101 --> 00:15:58,480
Director, your apron.

250
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,410
Thank you.

251
00:16:08,152 --> 00:16:10,701
Is that you, Maki?

252
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,800
Hi.

253
00:16:12,801 --> 00:16:14,801
Did you catch a cold?

254
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:16,801
Are you okay walking around outside?

255
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:19,144
I have to make dinner.

256
00:16:20,801 --> 00:16:23,052
Let Haruta do that, at least for today.

257
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:26,453
I'm fine. My fever is down.

258
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,801
You're perfect, Maki.

259
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:35,161
That's an overstatement. I do have many flaws.

260
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:39,450
Listen, Maki.

261
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,530
Yes?

262
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:43,240
Do you mind it...

263
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,000
if I confess my love to Haruta?

264
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,428
Don't worry, I know you're a couple now.

265
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,801
I have no intention of coming between you.

266
00:16:55,985 --> 00:17:00,128
It's for my personal satisfaction.

268
00:17:01,594 --> 00:17:04,594
I need to get it off my chest.

269
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:08,701
That's all I ask, nothing more.

270
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:14,969
Sure.

271
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:18,244
That's fine with me.

272
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,391
You really are perfect.

273
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,997

Thanks for your help today.

00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,744
Here I go.

286
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,470
Haru-tan!

287
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,160
Yes?

288
00:18:45,554 --> 00:18:52,521
- Goodbye?
- No, it's "I-Love-You".

289
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:05,304
Here is your hot sake.

290
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:08,728
"He didn't get my signal of I love you."

291
00:19:08,728 --> 00:19:11,920
- What's wrong with Haruta?
- Choko.

292
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,195
It's shocking to me.

293
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,137
- Hello?
- Yes?

294
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:22,112
Your divorce has been finalized, right?

295
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:24,300
It has.

296
00:19:25,704 --> 00:19:28,679
He couldn't initiate the action, so I did.

297
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:37,487
- What must I do to make you notice me?
- Pardon?

298
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:38,844
I'm seriously in love with you.

299
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,844
The word ”serious" refers to true feelings.

300
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:43,795
Shut it!

301
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,020
Sorry.

302
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:56,945
Look. I have no interest in little boys.

But you cried in my arms that night.

304
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,087
Yes, but I was drunk.

305
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:15,671
You still cling to the man who divorced you.

306
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:17,920
You even help him with his new love.

307
00:20:18,554 --> 00:20:21,112
Isn't that pure misery?

308
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:25,721
What would you know?

309
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:39,104
I can make you forget him.

310
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,660
- Hey.
- Give me that.

311
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,744
Give it back.

312
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:48,821
Stop it. You're indeed acting like a child.

- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

316
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:09,987
You should have stayed in bed.

317
00:21:09,987 --> 00:21:12,637
You shouldn't have made dinner.

318
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:17,304
If I didn't, you'd whine, "Maki, where's my dinner?"

319
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:20,821
I'm not a child. Was that supposed to be me?

320
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,154
There's chicken salad in the fridge.

321
00:21:23,154 --> 00:21:25,262
Thank you.

322
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:44,487
I'm hungry. I'll join you.

00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:46,737
Did anyone come today?

324
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:49,028
- The fridge is full.
- Right.

325
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:50,744
Who? Chizu?

326
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:53,195
No, I went shopping.

327
00:21:53,195 --> 00:21:56,529
So much? Normally, you wouldn't buy this much.

328
00:21:59,262 --> 00:22:01,137
What's gotten into you?

329
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:04,144
I wanted to shut you up.

330
00:22:07,345 --> 00:22:08,496
What if I catch your cold?

331
00:22:08,496 --> 00:22:11,871
Then I'll heal faster.

332
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:14,090
What are you saying?

333
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:18,330
I don't get you at all.

334
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,621
The sesame dressing is for salad.

335
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,900
Oh, okay.

336
00:22:35,744 --> 00:22:38,195
Sorry about the kiss.

337
00:22:38,744 --> 00:22:41,796
Don't be. It's fine.

338
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:43,744
I don't mind.

339
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,604
Guess what.

340
00:22:48,504 --> 00:22:51,644
The Director started hitting on me again.

341
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,344
Is it because he knows I'm your lover?

342
00:22:56,344 --> 00:22:59,828
Same here. Takekawa refuses to give up.

343
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:03,545
Is it because I'm your lover?

344
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:08,112
Maybe I shouldn't have told them.

345
00:23:12,844 --> 00:23:16,895
Haruta, am I really the lover you want?

346
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,804
What do you mean?

347
00:23:18,804 --> 00:23:20,804
I'm a guy.

348
00:23:24,512 --> 00:23:27,779
I'm okay with you being my lover.

349
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,237
Okay. Can you meet my parents on our next day off?

350
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:42,621
That's too sudden. Why now?

351
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:47,160
Why? It's natural to meet your lover's family.

352
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,770
What?

353
00:23:49,454 --> 00:23:53,744
Hold on. Let me ask you this. How will you introduce me?

354
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:55,844
Am I asking them for permission to marry their son?

355
00:23:55,844 --> 00:23:59,544
Are you an idiot?

356
00:24:00,254 --> 00:24:04,429
But won't your folks freak out when they find out you're with a guy?

357
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:08,944
Don't worry. You're not my first.

358
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,890
Whatever.

359
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,430
What?

360
00:24:21,304 --> 00:24:23,345
Are you jealous?

361
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,621
- Why would I be?
- I bet you are.

362
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:31,945
Are you insane?

363
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:37,554
It's totally different from what you told me. He's furious.

364
00:24:37,554 --> 00:24:40,454
Soichi Haruta and I are in a serious relationship.

365
00:24:40,454 --> 00:24:43,028
Please give us your blessing, Dad.

366
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:44,695
I beg you!

367
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:46,744
I'll never accept this!

368
00:24:46,744 --> 00:24:49,445
Who is this unreliable weakling?

369
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:51,420
More importantly, why are you with a man?

370
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,170
I've never told you this before, Dad.

371
00:24:56,012 --> 00:25:00,244
But I have always been attracted to men.

372
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,660
Now?

373
00:25:02,663 --> 00:25:05,237
Is he just now coming out?

374
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:08,637
You're my precious son.

375
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:12,045
What have you done to him? What are you up to?

376
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:13,929
Dad, he's done nothing wrong.

377
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:18,320
I felt strange at first, but his charms won me over.

378
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,245
I had enough!

379
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:24,404
I can't take this anymore...

380
00:25:24,404 --> 00:25:25,763
Are you okay, Father-in-law?

381
00:25:25,763 --> 00:25:28,563
I'm not your father!

382
00:25:34,496 --> 00:25:38,944
Sorry about that. Thank you for coming all this way.

383
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:43,037
Don't mind him. He's just a little surprised.

384
00:25:43,037 --> 00:25:45,937
I think he was shocked more than a little.

385
00:25:45,937 --> 00:25:49,028
Will you stay for dinner?

386
00:25:49,028 --> 00:25:52,371
Ma'am, do you not understand the current situation we're in?

387
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:54,271
- Sure, Mom.
- What?

388
00:25:56,345 --> 00:25:58,770
- Thank you for the meal.
- Let's dig in.

389
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,504
Delicious!

390
00:26:00,504 --> 00:26:02,396
- Is it?
- It's scrumptious.

391
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,637
I'm so glad.

392
00:26:04,637 --> 00:26:06,744
Your latest boyfriend is very handsome.

393
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:08,744
Don't say, "Your latest."

394
00:26:08,744 --> 00:26:10,596
I'm sorry. I'm Sora.

395
00:26:10,596 --> 00:26:12,844
Nice to meet you.

396
00:26:12,844 --> 00:26:15,237
I didn't know you had such a pretty younger sister.

397
00:26:15,237 --> 00:26:16,744
She's a complete air-head.

398
00:26:16,744 --> 00:26:19,203
- You suck.
- Big time.

399
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:26,445
When I heard about the shared house, I was a little concerned at first.

400
00:26:26,445 --> 00:26:29,287
Now, I'm pleased to see you two so happy.

401
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:33,844
I never imagined we'd end up being a couple.

402
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:36,462
- But you seem serious this time.
- What?

403
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:41,044
He's the first lover you've introduced to Dad.

404
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:43,787
Now you mention it, it's true.

405
00:26:45,629 --> 00:26:47,179
Seriously?

406
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:50,579
But it's too sudden. You should've warned Dad.

407
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:52,970
Some things need to be unfolded slowly.

408
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,804
My words exactly.

409
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,890
Why are you so close?

410
00:27:03,028 --> 00:27:06,044
- Sorry.
- Haruta, seize your chance.

411
00:27:06,044 --> 00:27:09,287
- What chance?
- Dad's in the bath. Go wash his back.

412
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:11,944
No, he hasn't warmed up to me yet. He was extremely mad earlier.

413
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:13,487
I think it might work.

414
00:27:13,487 --> 00:27:18,044
Two men bathe together and have a man-to-man talk.

415
00:27:18,044 --> 00:27:20,037
No, I don't think so.

416
00:27:20,037 --> 00:27:22,130
- What a splendid idea.
- It's not.

417
00:27:22,137 --> 00:27:25,162
Dad is a sucker for passionate young fellows.

418
00:27:25,162 --> 00:27:26,412
Really?

419
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:27,845
Here's your towel.

420
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:29,304
You don't mean now, do you?

421
00:27:29,304 --> 00:27:30,744
It's the perfect timing.

422
00:27:30,744 --> 00:27:32,730
- Now?
- Yes, go on.

423
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,490
Now?

424
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,320
Excuse me, Father. Please allow me to wash your back.

425
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:46,020
Bugger off, you stupid bastard!

426
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:50,545
It's hot. Way too hot. I'm leaving.

427
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:53,744
Sorry about that.

428
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:55,460
It's fine.

429
00:27:56,044 --> 00:27:58,644
But dinner was really delicious.

430
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:03,779
I was surprised that your mom's food tastes exactly like yours.

431
00:28:06,137 --> 00:28:10,429
I feel like I used you to get it off my chest.

432
00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:12,387
I said, it's okay.

433
00:28:12,387 --> 00:28:17,237
And I also wanted to know more about your family.

434
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:25,028
By the way, Sora is adorable with those big...

435
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:27,571
I could fall for her.

436
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:30,371
That hurt. I was just kidding.

437
00:28:30,371 --> 00:28:32,195
You're such a prick.

438
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:35,763
How dare you kick my knee. You could break it.

439
00:28:35,763 --> 00:28:37,945
- Not my problem.
- Wait a second.

440
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:40,845
It's from Chizu. Hold on.

441
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:44,044
Hello? What's up, Chizu?

442
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:48,342
What? Right now?

443
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,870
Okay. Fine.

444
00:28:53,844 --> 00:28:56,945
She invited me to Wonderful. Are you coming?

445
00:28:58,644 --> 00:29:01,279
No, I'm still recovering.

446
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,050
Okay. I won't be out too long.

447
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,810
- See you.
- Bye.

448
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:26,710
[Haruta]

449
00:29:29,195 --> 00:29:30,695
It's open.

450
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,890
Who...?

451
00:29:45,512 --> 00:29:47,620
- A burglar?
- A burglar?

452
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,840
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

453
00:29:49,844 --> 00:29:52,720
- I'm Maki.
- I'm a mother.

454
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,820
Mother?

455
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,544
Haruta's mother?

456
00:29:58,544 --> 00:30:02,763
I'm so sorry. Pleased to meet you.

457
00:30:02,763 --> 00:30:06,444
I'm living in your house with your son.

458
00:30:06,444 --> 00:30:09,944
Are you? That's a relief.

459
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:11,537
I need my stamp urgently.
(T/N: name stamps are used to sign important documents)

460
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:13,354
Yes, of course.

461
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:20,804
- Good evening.
- Sorry, we're closed.

462
00:30:20,804 --> 00:30:22,212
I called him here.

463
00:30:22,212 --> 00:30:23,712
Did you?

464
00:30:23,712 --> 00:30:26,544
Give me a beer at least.

465
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:31,345
Why are you all dressed up?

466
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:33,245
It's nothing.

467
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:43,145
I'm out of konnyaku. Can you go buy some?
(T/N: plant used for Japanese food)

468
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:44,479
But you said the bar was closed.

469
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:47,237
I thought you might want konnyaku butter sandwich.

470
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:48,654
No, I'm good.

471
00:30:48,654 --> 00:30:52,745
I insist. Chizu, go with him to buy some.

472
00:30:52,745 --> 00:30:55,287
Ten konnyaku.

473
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:59,744
Well, if you insist. But ten of them?

474
00:30:59,744 --> 00:31:01,820
Ten konnyaku?

475
00:31:05,844 --> 00:31:09,095
I found it. Now I can take care of my business.

476
00:31:09,095 --> 00:31:10,844
Sorry for disturbing you.

477
00:31:10,844 --> 00:31:13,220
Haruta should be back any minute.

478
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,028
I'd rather not see him. We're fighting.

479
00:31:16,028 --> 00:31:20,345
Rather, I'm very angry because he's so lazy.

480
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:23,887
He's an only son, so I might have spoiled him too much.

481
00:31:23,887 --> 00:31:27,744
If he keeps this up, he'll never get married. Don't you think?

482
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,554
You're probably right.

483
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:35,479
I won't live forever. I want to see my grandchildren.

484
00:31:36,054 --> 00:31:38,844
I wish he'd hurry up and marry Chizu.

485
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:42,887
He's adored her since he was little.

486
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:45,137
Have you met Chizu?

487
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,704
Yes, she's a wonderful lady.

488
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,944
I know, right?

489
00:31:49,844 --> 00:31:51,887
- Is your name Maki?
- Yes, it is.

490
00:31:51,887 --> 00:31:54,220
I'm so relieved he's with you.

491
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,621
Please be Soichi's friend forever.

492
00:31:59,354 --> 00:32:01,721
- I will.
- I'll be leaving now.

493
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:03,444
Good night.

494
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,470
[Ossan's Love]

495
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:35,121
I don't think Teppei really needs ten bags of konnyaku.

496
00:32:38,763 --> 00:32:41,112
Chizu, do you have something to tell me?

497
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:44,721
I mean, you called me out of the blue.

498
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:48,844
I'm debating whether I should tell you, or not.

499
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:51,179
I feel irritated after seeing your face.

500
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,928
Why is that?

501
00:32:52,928 --> 00:32:58,028
It's frustrating, because I feel like I've lost.

502
00:32:58,887 --> 00:33:00,754
What do you mean?

503
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:10,244
I'm in love.

504
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,760
What?

505
00:33:13,637 --> 00:33:15,844
I said

506
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:18,544
I'm in love with you, Haruta.

507
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,804
I'm a little confused,

508
00:33:23,804 --> 00:33:26,704
because you're not my ideal type at all.

509
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:31,337
Most of the time, I don't even like you.

510
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:35,071
But I guess I've been in love with you.

511
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:42,945
Seriously?

512
00:33:42,945 --> 00:33:47,479
Look, I'm not asking you to be my boyfriend or anything.

513
00:33:48,254 --> 00:33:51,229
I just wanted to get it off my chest.

514
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,600
What?

515
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:08,012
Since when?

516
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:10,754
It doesn't matter.

517
00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:12,654
But you've never...

518
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:22,262
- After hearing that, I...
- It's enough.

519
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:25,179
Go back to your love nest, you dull little boy.

520
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,095
Maki's waiting for you. Bye.

521
00:34:28,095 --> 00:34:31,104
Hey, Chizu. Wait!

522
00:34:33,845 --> 00:34:37,421
Gosh, my pollen allergy is killing me.

♫ Vacillating, vacillating, two hearts are vacillating again ♫

00:34:52,490 --> 00:35:02,510

♫ But unintentionally, I try to evade the truth by sealing
up my memories and my existence ♫

526
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,096
I'm home.

527
00:35:16,654 --> 00:35:18,604
Sorry, I'm late.

528
00:35:20,154 --> 00:35:21,379
I'll go take a bath.

529
00:35:21,379 --> 00:35:23,828
Haruta.

530
00:35:23,828 --> 00:35:25,844
Do you want to go first?

531
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:31,837
Don't mix colored laundry with whites.

00:35:31,837 --> 00:35:34,663
Did I do that again? Sorry.

533
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:38,795
And turn the fan on after a bath, otherwise it gets moldy.

534
00:35:38,795 --> 00:35:40,844
You should know these things by now.

535
00:35:40,844 --> 00:35:44,728
And Tuesday is a collection day for kitchen waste.

Why are you angry? Is it because I went to Wonderful?

No, it's not.

539
00:36:02,512 --> 00:36:05,837
Then what? I wouldn't know, unless you tell me.

540
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,387
To be honest,

541
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:17,944
I'm not happy now.

542
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,860
What?

543
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:25,444
Being with you

544
00:36:26,844 --> 00:36:29,244
gives me nothing but pain.

545
00:36:33,596 --> 00:36:35,679
For a very long time...

546
00:36:37,704 --> 00:36:39,679
I've been agonizing.

547
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,630
Why?

548
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:45,221
What's happened?

549
00:36:46,596 --> 00:36:49,137
What's wrong, Maki?

550
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,096
Let's split up.

551
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,990
What?

552
00:37:06,621 --> 00:37:09,339
Why must we break up?

553
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:11,812
Listen.

554
00:37:13,387 --> 00:37:17,062
I don't love you anymore.

555
00:37:18,744 --> 00:37:22,844
Why so suddenly? I don't get it.

556
00:37:30,487 --> 00:37:36,504
I'll help out with the housework, I promise.

557
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:42,687
I'll try harder to be accepted by your dad.

558
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:44,244
Please?

559
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:50,321
Just forget... about me.

560
00:37:51,137 --> 00:37:52,954
Pretend it never happened.

561
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:57,145
I don't understand at all. Why?

562
00:37:57,744 --> 00:37:59,428
Like I said,

563
00:38:05,028 --> 00:38:08,045
I don't love you, Haruta.

564
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:32,171
Thank you...

565
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:37,537
for everything.

566
00:38:48,012 --> 00:38:54,795
The very next day, Maki packed up and left.

567
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:01,379
One year has passed since then.
[One Year Later]

568
00:39:05,028 --> 00:39:08,271
Oh, no! I overslept.

569
00:39:39,362 --> 00:39:41,912
Morning, Haru-tan.

570
00:39:42,637 --> 00:39:46,304
Somehow, I find myself shacking up with the Director.

571
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:51,845
