182
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:30,103
Maki.

183
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,778
Teppei, can I place an order?

184
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:33,061
- Sure.
- What kind of curry is that?

185
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:36,554
It's sour curry. I added lemon, pickled plums, and vinegar.

186
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:40,735
It's a carnival of spiciness and sourness in your mouth.

187
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:43,119
Okay, I'll have chitterlings stew and spicy cod innards.

188
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,919
Got it.

189
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,835
There we go again. You're showing off how exhausted you are.

190
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,303
I'm not.

191
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:54,611
The Director's wife came to the office today.

192
00:09:54,611 --> 00:09:56,128
Did she find out about you and Director?

193
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:59,870
No, he asked for a divorce, but she doesn't know the reason.

194
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,495
Well, he can't spill all the beans.

195
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:05,386
- Meaning?
- Because...

196
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:10,653
telling her means he's coming out of the closet.

197
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:11,735
Right.

198
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:15,595
- That's far more devastating than an ordinary adultery.
- Indeed.

199
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:19,554
Moreover, he's in love with you. That's devastating, all right.

200
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:21,135
Don't rub it in.

201
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:24,261
She would be devastating, for sure.

202
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:26,378
Say something.

203
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:38,595
Why can't you answer me?

204
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:45,128
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:51,935
All I want is the reason for our divorce.

206
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:54,308
What did I do wrong?

207
00:10:55,562 --> 00:10:57,286
It's not your fault.

208
00:10:57,286 --> 00:10:59,250
Then why?

209
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:05,072
You're in love with another woman?

210
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:09,270
No, it's not a woman.

211
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,835
It has to be!

212
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:13,335
No, it's not.

213
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:24,335
Then what do you make of our 30 years of marriage?

214
00:11:25,835 --> 00:11:30,912
I have always believed a married couple could tell each other everything,

215
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:37,735
but if you refuse to tell me the truth,

216
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:42,387
I'll have no choice but to hire a private detective.

217
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,019
Choko, don't do that.

218
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:51,412
You expect me to agree to a divorce without any explanation?

219
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:57,110
I'm not that naive.

220
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:01,395
We'll need to divide up all our assets.

221
00:12:02,362 --> 00:12:04,535
I...

222
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:08,561
Even I...

223
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:12,053
have my pride.

224
00:12:20,712 --> 00:12:22,154
The thing is...

225
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:25,770
I...

226
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:30,535
To be honest...

227
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,270
I...

228
00:12:40,353 --> 00:12:42,735
Sorry for the wait.

229
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:44,462
Thank you.

230
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:45,986
Looks good.

231
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:47,966
Haruta, clear the empty glasses.

232
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:49,949
Don't boss me around. I'm a customer.

233
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:51,958
Are you two dating?

234
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,603
No, we're just childhood friends.

235
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:56,835
You'll end up together.

236
00:12:56,835 --> 00:12:59,735
Not a chance. I'm into young girls with big boobs.

237
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:00,736
So you say.

238
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:04,320
But in the end, you'll marry your childhood friend.

239
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,612
That will never happen.

240
00:13:06,612 --> 00:13:08,735
Well, then.

241
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:13,135
- Do you mind if I make a move on you?
- What?

242
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:14,835
I have to say,

243
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,436
your face is my ideal type.

244
00:13:17,436 --> 00:13:21,128
Thanks. I thrive on praise.

245
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:24,935
Okay then, can we exchange our contact information?

246
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:26,487
- For real?
- Yes.

247
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:28,095
Sure.

248
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:30,411
- Just shake your phone.
- Shake? Like this?

249
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:33,545
- Where's Maki?
- He went outside with Takekawa earlier.

250
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:35,990
Do you think he's getting a scolding?

251
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,640
- Did you get it?
- Not yet.

252
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,536
That all it was.

253
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:47,253
That's not a good enough explanation!

254
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,135
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:50,735 --> 00:13:52,986
Do you think that's acceptable?

256
00:13:52,986 --> 00:13:54,295
I mean...

257
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:55,895
Speak up.

258
00:13:57,935 --> 00:13:59,735
You can take a bath first.

259
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:01,728
Okay, thanks.

260
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:07,861
What was that about earlier?

261
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:09,445
What do you mean?

262
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:12,554
Takekawa was grilling you outside.

263
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,119
No big deal.

264
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,936
What's the matter?

265
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:19,919
We're close friends. You can talk to me.

266
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,320
Thanks, but I'm good.

267
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,687
But still... you could ask for my advice.

268
00:14:34,236 --> 00:14:39,253
Let's discuss sales strategies after work tomorrow. Kurosawa

269
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,070
"Sales strategies"?

270
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:53,162
Roger that, Sir.

271
00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:00,612
This looks so lame.

272
00:15:00,612 --> 00:15:03,695
This is a so-called a sandwich man.

273
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,836
It'll be a real tragedy, if my friends see me wearing this.

274
00:15:05,836 --> 00:15:07,760
Okay, off you go.

275
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:10,853
Don't take it off, okay?

276
00:15:12,103 --> 00:15:14,735
Keep it on. Don't even try.

277
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,460
Leave it on.

278
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:20,254
What's his problem?

279
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:29,735
I need your advice on an apartment. Can we meet outside?

280
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:33,120
It's the Director's wife again.

281
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:37,445
This is so depressing.

282
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:44,735
Shall I go with you?

283
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,445
Really? Can you?

284
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,487
Sure.

285
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:50,136
- Maki.
- Maki!

286
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:52,535
What sort of report is this?

287
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:56,161
Staple on the right for vertical texts and on the left for horizontals.

288
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:57,711
Redo it right now.

289
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:01,378
It's okay. I'll go by myself.

290
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,045
Sorry.

291
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,936
I'm sorry for the wait.

292
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:26,554
S-Sorry about this.

293
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:32,003
Is something the matter?

294
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:35,978
Excuse me.

295
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:41,050
Because I trust you, I need your advice.

296
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,520
Advice?

297
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:50,519
Even though I'm ashamed to even bring it up...

298
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:56,111
To be honest, my husband's asked for a divorce.

299
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:58,086
I knew that.

300
00:16:58,086 --> 00:17:01,228
I'm certain that he has a mistress,

301
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,760
but he refuses to admit it.

302
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:09,735
I bet it's the girl named Haruka I mentioned before.

303
00:17:09,735 --> 00:17:12,170
No, it's me.

304
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,303
He's never lied to me all these years.

305
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:24,654
So I'll never forgive Haruka for turning him into a different man.

306
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,880
I'll find Haruka by all means, and destroy her.

307
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,930
D-Destroy?

308
00:17:34,061 --> 00:17:37,735
I need your help to track her down.

309
00:17:37,735 --> 00:17:41,886
If you help me, I'll buy that property.

310
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:44,286
Deal?

311
00:17:44,286 --> 00:17:45,878
I beg you.

312
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:49,235
Excuse me.

313
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,119
Meet me at 8 p.m. tonight.

314
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:56,835
I'll wait for you at the same bar where we had the party in April.

315
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:58,661
Something wrong?

316
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,535
Not at all.

317
00:18:02,195 --> 00:18:04,145
I understand.

318
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:07,603
Thank you.

319
00:18:11,961 --> 00:18:15,535
Helping her find Haruka?

320
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,735
Shouldn't I tell her that Haruka is me?

321
00:18:19,735 --> 00:18:24,019
But in fact, I'm not dating the Director or anything.

322
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:28,735
And it's not my place to disclose this to her on his behalf.

323
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:33,262
I'm stuck right in the middle between them.

324
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,400
[Ossan's Love]

325
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:15,709
- Shall I give you a hand?
- I'm fine.

326
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:17,244
Let me do half of it.

327
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:19,177
No, thanks.

328
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:25,709
- It's a lot of work to handle alone.
- I said, no!

329
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:37,809
Mr. Takekawa.

330
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,985
I hate it when they're not in alphabetical order.

331
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:43,402
What do you want?

332
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:45,077
It's about Maki.

333
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:48,119
Is he having problems?

334
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,793
It looks like he's under pressure.

335
00:19:52,577 --> 00:19:54,902
Did he say that?

336
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,369
No, not in so many words.

337
00:19:58,052 --> 00:20:01,519
Perhaps, I didn't support him enough.

338
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:03,628
No, he's doing a great job.

339
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:06,210
By the way, any progress with your client?

340
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,819
I'm assisting her in a polite manner.

341
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:15,452
Although the circumstances are complicated, she's still a valued client.

342
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:17,819
Find her an ideal home.

343
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,509
Yes, Sir.

344
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,244
Have I misunderstood something?

345
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:32,952
- Haruta, a call from Mrs. Kurosawa.
- Thanks.

346
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:36,644
Hello.

347
00:20:36,644 --> 00:20:39,135
I'm requesting your help.

348
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:41,952
My help? What can I do for you?

349
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:45,802
I want you to follow my husband.

350
00:20:45,802 --> 00:20:48,202
Follow him? Why?

351
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:51,052
He left his schedule book at home.

352
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:53,935
He's meeting someone at 8 p.m. tonight.

353
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:56,010
Meet me at 8 p.m. tonight.

354
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,802
That's...

355
00:20:57,802 --> 00:20:59,809
It says, he has a date.

356
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:01,102
[8 p.m. Date 🧡]

357
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:03,394
A date?

358
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:05,809
Meet me in front of headquarters at 7 p.m., okay?

359
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:07,844
H-Hold on...

360
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,036
Did he call it a date?

361
00:21:14,135 --> 00:21:15,869

543
00:35:22,529 --> 00:35:28,437
But I still think you should tell him your true feelings.

544
00:35:28,437 --> 00:35:33,937
You're a couple that has been together for 30 years.

545
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,980
The Director is...

546
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:47,100
not a coward who runs away from reality.

547
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,554
You...

548
00:35:55,554 --> 00:36:00,562
You really are... kind-hearted.

549
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,937
You're wrong.

550
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,503
I...

551
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:14,470
I'm not kind-hearted or a good man.

552
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,295
Why are you crying?

553
00:36:22,295 --> 00:36:26,310
[Azeriya]

554
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,620
[Azeriya]

555
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,170
Choko.

556
00:36:42,103 --> 00:36:43,970
Choko!

557
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,987
Director?

558
00:36:47,987 --> 00:36:51,820
Why is he here, Choko?

559
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,861
He was giving me advices on my new apartment.

560
00:36:54,861 --> 00:36:57,850
So late at night?

561
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,820
You're crying.

562
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,561
- Did you upset her?
- No, not me.

563
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:05,304
There's something I must tell you.

564
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,887
Me, too.

565
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,578
All right then. I'll get going.

566
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:15,288
- Don't go.
- No, you stay.

567
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:25,270
I need to know the reason of our divorce.

568
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,003
Have you grown to hate me?

569
00:37:27,003 --> 00:37:29,312
That's not it.

570
00:37:29,312 --> 00:37:31,770
You're still very precious to me.

571
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:36,077
That hasn't changed in 30 years. But...

572
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,487
I'm in love with someone else now.

573
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,377
I'm sorry.

574
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:51,204
You love Haru-tan, right?

575
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,645
Who is she?

576
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,777
Let me grab a salad...

577
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:07,828
- from the salad bar.
- No, stay put.

578
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,378
Stay put.

579
00:38:09,378 --> 00:38:13,729
Listen, can't you break up with Haruka?

580
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,920
It's not Haruka, but Haru-tan.

581
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,504
Who cares about that?

582
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:21,020
Let's stop here, Director and Mrs. Kurosawa.

583
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,395
What kind of woman is she?

584
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,603
It's not a woman.

585
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,629
Haru-tan isn't a woman.

586
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,120
What?

587
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,677
Haru-tan is...

588
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,777
a man.

589
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,760
Wait...

590
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,877
I don't understand.

591
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:02,162
I didn't have the courage to tell you this.

592
00:39:02,162 --> 00:39:04,353
I'm sorry.

593
00:39:04,353 --> 00:39:08,720
What? You love a man?

594
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,020
You're very precious to me,

595
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:18,220
that's why I want you to know the real me.

596
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,837
The person I'm in love with is...

597
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,053
him.

598
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,037
No way!

599
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:49,477
What's your name?

600
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,328
I'm Haru-tan.

601
00:40:02,337 --> 00:40:04,550
[Ossan's Love]
