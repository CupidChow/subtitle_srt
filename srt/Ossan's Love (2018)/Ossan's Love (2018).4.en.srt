Really, there's nothing going on between us. Not yet, anyway.

No, no. That's not how I see it.

When I think of your wife, it breaks my heart.

Is there any chance that you'll reconsider divorcing her?

I need Maki's advice, but he's still angry with me.

That doesn't sound like a compliment. Anyway, you should thank Maki.

535
00:37:20,246 --> 00:37:23,720
You're right. I'll move out right away.

536
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,288
No rush. The pub is still in a mess, isn't it?

537
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,238
Well, yes.

538
00:37:31,238 --> 00:37:35,447
Don't be so polite. We're old friends, after all.

539
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,447
Haruta, thank you.

540
00:37:42,447 --> 00:37:45,355
I said, forget it.

541
00:37:45,355 --> 00:37:48,547
What? Okay.

542
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,063
I'm home.

543
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,059
Welcome back.

544
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:17,460
♫ Summer still remains in the blue sky at the end of September ♫

545
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:23,310
♫ It brings back so many memories along with the blazing sun ♫

546
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,250
Good lord.

547
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:29,170
It's so delicious.

548
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,022
Maki, how about we order sushi tonight?

549
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:48,030
Or maybe pizza.

550
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:52,155
I'm moving out.

551
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:55,120
What? At this hour?

552
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,563
I'm staying at Takekawa's.

553
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,580
Huh? Why his place?

554
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,797
No reason in particular. Just for a change.

555
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,780
Why Takekawa?

556
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,590
Maki!

557
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,280
He's my ex-lover.

558
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,590
Say what?

559
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:30,020
- What was that?
- I hope you and Chizu will be happy together.

560
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,720
Don't go!

561
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,790
Why?

562
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,240
What was that?

563
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,196
I'm back.

564
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,500
Dear God, what the hell have I done now?

565
00:40:02,472 --> 00:40:04,492
