- Not at all.
- Yes, you are.

What's the reason? Tell me.

539
00:37:33,934 --> 00:37:38,993
If dreams and support aren't mutual, it's tough.

540
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:46,942
Listen.

541
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:50,067
I'll bring you somewhere.

542
00:37:58,768 --> 00:38:01,726
I think I've still got flour in my ears.

543
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:03,851
Let me take a look.

544
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:05,573
You see it?

545
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,470
What the hell was that? Don't act like an idiot.

546
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:14,840
What the hell?

547
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:21,923
Hey, you got strange when you saw that family photograph at the udon restaurant.

548
00:38:21,923 --> 00:38:24,009
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

549
00:38:24,009 --> 00:38:25,720
You can tell me.

550
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,297
I'm getting really hot.

551
00:38:28,297 --> 00:38:30,121
I'll go out.

552
00:38:32,267 --> 00:38:34,751
He's not a good liar.

553
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:40,251
Maybe I should get out, too.

554
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:42,510
Hi, Director.

555
00:38:45,102 --> 00:38:46,894
Sorry to make you wait.

556
00:38:46,894 --> 00:38:50,135
No, I'm just thinking of leaving now.

557
00:38:50,935 --> 00:38:52,635
Come here.

558
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:20,127
It's not easy.

559
00:39:20,977 --> 00:39:23,568
Negotiations can be tough.

560
00:39:24,102 --> 00:39:25,702
Yes, Sir.

561
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:34,410
It's very difficult to convey your true feelings to another person.

562
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,810
Yes.

563
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:38,935
What's the best approach?

564
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:42,144
Well, basically...

565
00:39:42,144 --> 00:39:47,560
It's best to be honest. No tricks or subterfuges.

566
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,277
Really? I love you.

567
00:39:53,643 --> 00:39:55,510
Haru-pon.

568
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,110
Haru-pon?

569
00:40:00,077 --> 00:40:01,477
Look...

570
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:04,158
I'm in love with you.

571
00:40:06,677 --> 00:40:10,251
Ah, Director!

572
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:16,190
- The very first time I laid eyes on you...
- Director...

573
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:20,660
- Well, I mean, technically, we did know each other before.
- Yes, that's right.

574
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,719
But I felt that we clicked.

575
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,977
- Haru-pon, what do you think?
- Haru-pon?

576
00:40:30,977 --> 00:40:36,060
At the moment, I'm in a relationship.

577
00:40:40,935 --> 00:40:45,635
Don't tell me it's him? Justice?

578
00:40:45,635 --> 00:40:47,793
- Justice?
- Justice.
- No, you're wrong.

579
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:51,810
- Justice.
- No.

580
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:56,435
Why would he only forget Haruta?

581
00:40:57,318 --> 00:41:02,355
I reckon it's because Haruta broke his heart.

582
00:41:03,102 --> 00:41:07,732
I feel so sorry for the director.

583
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:10,454
And whoever pushed him down the stairs...

584
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:13,605
I can never forgive that.

585
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:19,343
No, it was an accident. He fell down the stairs by himself.

586
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:23,147
He's always been rather careless.

587
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,768
- No, he must have been pushed.
- No, it's an accident.

588
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:26,435
- It's not an accident.
- Yes, it was.

589
00:41:26,435 --> 00:41:28,370
- He said that he slipped.
- No way.

590
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,579
Hello? You want to believe that?

591
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:32,577
Listen.

592
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:39,028
The Director remembered you, didn't he?

593
00:41:39,028 --> 00:41:42,561
But he seems to have forgotten that we divorced.

594
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:45,844
That's the worst scenario of all!

595
00:41:45,844 --> 00:41:52,561
- If he learns the real reason we divorced...
- No, no.

596
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:56,128
You have to tell him the truth.

597
00:41:57,728 --> 00:42:02,995
Choko, don't tell me you still love the Director?

598
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:05,187
- Of course not.
- Seriously?

599
00:42:05,187 --> 00:42:06,545
I swear.

600
00:42:06,545 --> 00:42:08,645
My darling, Choko!

601
00:42:08,645 --> 00:42:10,554
No, not here! Believe in me!

602
00:42:10,554 --> 00:42:12,212
The Chief has boomeranged?

603
00:42:12,212 --> 00:42:14,278
Then, who are you going steady with?

604
00:42:14,278 --> 00:42:15,688
- Listen to me...
- Tell me.

605
00:42:15,688 --> 00:42:18,479
- It's Ma...
- Tell me.

606
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,312
- Maki!
- What's this?

607
00:42:21,312 --> 00:42:22,561
That should be my line. Why are you here?

608
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:24,187
Haru-pon?

609
00:42:24,187 --> 00:42:27,354
No, don't get it wrong.

610
00:42:27,354 --> 00:42:31,187
What? I thought you had given up on him.

611
00:42:31,187 --> 00:42:34,237
What are you saying? We've just begun.

612
00:42:34,237 --> 00:42:36,653
- Director, we didn't start anything.
- What do you mean?

613
00:42:36,653 --> 00:42:43,229
After the accident, the Director has lost a little of his memory.

614
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:46,561
No way! That's just an excuse.

615
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:47,753
But it's true.

616
00:42:47,753 --> 00:42:51,924
Are you Haru-pon's steady?

617
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,603
Yes, so what?

618
00:42:53,603 --> 00:42:55,728
- So, you are the one.
- Wait, wait.

619
00:42:55,728 --> 00:42:58,161
- I see.
- Such a guy...

620
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,978
- So what?
- I'm far better than you.

621
00:43:02,895 --> 00:43:05,120
Sorry I'm late, Maki.

622
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,020
Well, well, well, look who's here.

623
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,962
So, Director Kurosawa is here, too.

624
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:12,812
It's such a coincidence.

625
00:43:12,812 --> 00:43:14,461
And why are you here, Mamiana?

626
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:16,478
It's my regular sauna.

627
00:43:16,478 --> 00:43:19,778
And today, Maki is my guest.

628
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,478
We're having an intimate all-guys meeting.

629
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:26,020
So that's why you're always so busy?

630
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,962
What are you suggesting?

631
00:43:27,962 --> 00:43:31,253
That's why you moved out?

632
00:43:31,253 --> 00:43:32,853
Excuse me.

633
00:43:32,853 --> 00:43:35,212
Don't be ridiculous.

634
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,961
Listen up.

635
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:41,337
What's that for?

636
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:47,528
Well, well! Aren't you the fickle one, Ryota Maki?

637
00:43:49,354 --> 00:43:53,812
Who are you calling "fickle"?

638
00:43:53,812 --> 00:43:56,396
You're just a nobody.

639
00:43:56,396 --> 00:43:58,250
Don't you start.

640
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:02,610
Don't do it!

641
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,470
I'm not stopping! Get off!

642
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:05,478
That's cold.

643
00:44:05,478 --> 00:44:10,104
If this is how you spend your time, get back to work!

644
00:44:10,104 --> 00:44:13,603
Real work is done on the ground, not in the conference room!

645
00:44:13,603 --> 00:44:16,895
What are you saying?!

646
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,687
So, is this what Director Kurosawa taught you?

647
00:44:22,354 --> 00:44:28,020
A real leader can reel off ten good things about a subordinate.

648
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,478
Ten? I can give 20 or 30.

649
00:44:30,478 --> 00:44:33,645
Can you even see your staff's problems, Director Kurosawa?

650
00:44:33,645 --> 00:44:35,561
Of course, I can.

651
00:44:35,561 --> 00:44:41,062
Haru-pon has a terrible bed-head. And tooth decay.

652
00:44:41,062 --> 00:44:44,329
His feet stink. His favorite food is belly meat during barbecue.

653
00:44:44,329 --> 00:44:47,012
I even know his favorite actor, Takumi Saito.

654
00:44:47,012 --> 00:44:50,896
- These are not problems, because he has such a sexy body!
- Don't get it wrong.

655
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,520
Hands off him.

656
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,687
Don't interfere.

657
00:44:53,687 --> 00:44:55,110
You're showing your true self!

658
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,470
I knew it!

659
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,220
That hurt!

660
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,687
Which side are you on?

661
00:45:04,562 --> 00:45:07,996
Haruta, your pecs are rock-hard. Sweet!

662
00:45:08,813 --> 00:45:14,647
Isn't this a perfect example of the intimacy in Japanese relationships?

663
00:45:14,647 --> 00:45:17,064
- What's that?
- I'm getting so excited!

664
00:45:17,064 --> 00:45:18,856
Who is he?

665
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:21,950
- Who the hell is he?
- What are you doing?

00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,280

No, no. I can't do that.

00:49:07,856 --> 00:49:11,648
<i>What the hell can I do to fix it?</i>

717
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:14,998
That hurts! Ouch, ouch!

718
00:49:14,998 --> 00:49:18,273
Haruta, let's shoot some hoops.

719
00:49:18,273 --> 00:49:19,315
What?

720
00:49:19,315 --> 00:49:22,540
I bet I can beat you hands down.

721
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:27,218
Not a chance. You were also only a substitute.

722
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,882
Watch and learn, kid.

723
00:49:32,732 --> 00:49:34,699
Bring it on.

724
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,315
<i>Building a new town is harder than I thought.</i>

725
00:49:42,315 --> 00:49:44,266
<i>It sure is.</i>

726
00:49:44,266 --> 00:49:48,691
<i>Their land and their homes mean everything to them.</i>

727
00:49:48,691 --> 00:49:52,658
<i>Justice, why did you come to work for us?</i>

728
00:49:53,899 --> 00:49:59,858
<i>I wanted a job where I could bring happiness to families.</i>

729
00:49:59,858 --> 00:50:02,899
<i>I get that. Totally.</i>

730
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:06,190
<i>Justice, you have a happy aura.</i>

731
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:08,172
<i>You only just noticed?</i>

732
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,987
Are you going to the fireworks tonight?

733
00:50:12,987 --> 00:50:14,707
No.

734
00:50:14,707 --> 00:50:16,323
Cheat.

735
00:50:16,323 --> 00:50:18,174
I got you.

736
00:50:31,673 --> 00:50:36,816
<i>[Haru]
[Pon]</i>

737
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:38,816
<i>- Hold me tighter.
- Okay.</i>

738
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:41,175
<i>What's that old building?
[Haru Pon]</i>

739
00:50:41,175 --> 00:50:43,808
<i>It's called the Bird's Nest.</i>

740
00:50:44,424 --> 00:50:48,149
<i>Careful! Watch the road.</i>

741
00:50:48,691 --> 00:50:50,416
<i>Don't do that.</i>

742
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:56,530
<i>Haru-pon, Haru-pon. Are you okay?</i>

743
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,500
<i>Hello.</i>

744
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:01,174
<i>C'mon, Haru-pon! Haru-pon!</i>

745
00:51:01,174 --> 00:51:05,107
Haru-pon, Haru-pon, my darling.

746
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:06,733
Yes?

747
00:51:06,733 --> 00:51:09,725
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

748
00:51:09,725 --> 00:51:11,948
The document needs your approval.

749
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:18,341
- Director.
- Yes?

750
00:51:19,341 --> 00:51:21,041
Well...

751
00:51:23,817 --> 00:51:25,400
Tonight.

752
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:30,158
It's the annual fireworks festival.

753
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:32,691
Yes.

754
00:51:33,608 --> 00:51:35,308
It is indeed.

755
00:51:39,316 --> 00:51:42,400
Sorry to call such an urgent meeting.

756
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:50,400
But our partnership with your Phoenix Mountain Resort Group will be terminated.

757
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,808
You mean dissolve the partnership?

758
00:51:58,808 --> 00:52:01,366
What does that mean?

759
00:52:03,149 --> 00:52:09,275
There is a serious contractual error.

760
00:52:11,066 --> 00:52:15,125
As of today, the Genius 7 will be disbanded.

761
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:17,450
I refuse to accept that!

762
00:52:18,733 --> 00:52:21,985
Is Chairman Hayami aware of this?

763
00:52:21,985 --> 00:52:24,167
Thank you for everything.

764
00:52:25,233 --> 00:52:26,933
Goodbye.

765
00:52:37,566 --> 00:52:41,197
Hello there, Maki's mother.

766
00:52:42,441 --> 00:52:47,766
Apparently, my husband was very nasty to you.

767
00:52:47,766 --> 00:52:49,908
Sorry about that.

768
00:52:49,908 --> 00:52:51,642
Not at all.

769
00:52:51,642 --> 00:52:56,742
I know I'm not a reliable person.

770
00:52:56,742 --> 00:53:01,783
And besides, he doesn't like that we're a same-sex couple.

771
00:53:01,783 --> 00:53:04,632
No, you've got that wrong.

772
00:53:05,525 --> 00:53:09,984
There is never an ideal template for marriage.

773
00:53:10,609 --> 00:53:15,642
You have to mutually discover what works for both of you.

774
00:53:17,484 --> 00:53:18,984
Thank you.

775
00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:22,826
Oh. Tonight is the fireworks festival.

776
00:53:22,826 --> 00:53:26,180
Right? What will you wear?

777
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,470
<i>[Swan Maru]</i>

778
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,030
<i>[Swan Maru]</i>

779
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:43,840
<i>[Cotton Candy]</i>

780
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:57,376
You startled me.

781
00:53:57,376 --> 00:53:59,192
Are you okay now?

782
00:53:59,192 --> 00:54:01,117
Yeah, I guess.

783
00:54:03,609 --> 00:54:05,309
Let's go.

784
00:54:08,818 --> 00:54:09,984
Look, there's sponge cake.

785
00:54:09,984 --> 00:54:12,967
You look like a sponge cake.

786
00:54:20,151 --> 00:54:22,926
I feel ill.

787
00:54:23,651 --> 00:54:25,151
You want a sea sickness pill?

788
00:54:25,151 --> 00:54:26,651
Okay.

789
00:54:28,026 --> 00:54:29,726
Here.

790
00:54:36,275 --> 00:54:39,909
Hey, what are you so upset about?

791
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,859
Why didn't you wear a yukata?
<i>(T/N: summer kimono)</i>

792
00:54:41,859 --> 00:54:45,010
- So, that's your reason?
- Yes.

793
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:47,651
Because it's embarrassing to wear a yukata.

794
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:49,110
Come on, Choko.

795
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,984
Everyone onboard wears the yukata.

796
00:54:50,984 --> 00:54:53,192
Forgive me.

797
00:54:54,275 --> 00:54:56,084
Forget it.

798
00:54:56,672 --> 00:54:58,513
I do love you.

799
00:54:59,859 --> 00:55:02,384
See? Now you're happy.

800
00:55:08,151 --> 00:55:13,451
You don't have anyone to share the fireworks with?

801
00:55:16,733 --> 00:55:22,375
The ones I love, inevitably fall for someone else.

802
00:55:27,985 --> 00:55:32,060
One day, they'll realize how you feel.

803
00:55:34,674 --> 00:55:36,802
I hope so.

804
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,193
What?

805
00:55:58,944 --> 00:56:04,593
I haven't watched the fireworks since college.

806
00:56:04,593 --> 00:56:06,036
Didn't you and Chizu go?

807
00:56:06,036 --> 00:56:10,077
Yes, when we were kids, every year.

808
00:56:10,077 --> 00:56:11,735
Can I get a bite?

809
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:12,818
You always do this.

810
00:56:12,818 --> 00:56:15,027
Come on? Let's swap for a while.

811
00:56:15,027 --> 00:56:18,127
- No way!
- I insist.

812
00:56:18,127 --> 00:56:20,477
Wow, it's a big one.

813
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:33,143
Isn't that beautiful?

814
00:57:00,236 --> 00:57:02,077
Listen, Choko.

815
00:57:03,777 --> 00:57:05,477
I refuse.

816
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:12,994
I'll never marry again.

817
00:57:13,785 --> 00:57:15,585
Why not?

818
00:57:16,444 --> 00:57:21,478
Look, there's a massive age difference between us.

819
00:57:23,153 --> 00:57:28,694
You still love the Director. You can't get over him.

820
00:57:28,694 --> 00:57:31,020
You're wrong.

821
00:57:32,028 --> 00:57:36,861
You love me now, but what happens when the passion fades?

822
00:57:40,486 --> 00:57:42,394
Never again.

823
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:47,288
I can't go through it another time.

824
00:57:57,795 --> 00:57:59,371
What's that supposed to be?

825
00:57:59,371 --> 00:58:01,530
Looks like a tangerine.

826
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:04,613
- Like a tangerine?
- That's what it looked like.

827
00:58:06,262 --> 00:58:07,862
I need to find a toilet.

828
00:58:07,862 --> 00:58:09,097
You want anything?

829
00:58:09,097 --> 00:58:11,272
No, I'm full.

830
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,088
<i>[Are you free now?]</i>

831
00:58:33,088 --> 00:58:35,439
<i>[We need to talk about the future.]</i>

832
00:58:35,439 --> 00:58:37,456
He left his phone?

833
00:58:41,879 --> 00:58:43,630
<i>[Where are you?]</i>

834
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:45,463
<i>[Can we meet near your place?]</i>

835
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:50,379
<i>[Maki]</i>

836
00:58:50,379 --> 00:58:52,296
<i>[Can we meet up tonight?]</i>

837
00:59:04,887 --> 00:59:08,138
Are you serious about marriage?

838
00:59:15,154 --> 00:59:16,921
What are you looking at?

839
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,704
You've had messages pouring in.

840
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:34,372
Haruta, I have to go.

841
00:59:34,372 --> 00:59:37,180
Sure. Go to him.

842
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,196
What?

843
00:59:38,196 --> 00:59:41,412
I get it that you have no time to watch the fireworks with me.

844
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:44,021
Go run to Mamiana.

845
00:59:44,843 --> 00:59:47,587
Why must you be so nasty?

846
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:50,854
I'm not your priority.

847
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:54,071
It's always work, work, work!

848
00:59:54,071 --> 00:59:56,138
It's all about your dreams.

849
00:59:57,363 --> 00:59:59,304
And now, Mamiana.

850
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,070
What?

851
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:04,795
I saw you yesterday.

852
01:00:04,795 --> 01:00:07,821
You and him leaving the hospital together.

853
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,719
So what?

854
01:00:14,363 --> 01:00:17,737
I didn't even know you were ill.

855
01:00:23,279 --> 01:00:27,221
Unlike you, I don't make a big fuss over nothing.

856
01:00:31,612 --> 01:00:33,112
I make a big fuss?

857
01:00:33,112 --> 01:00:35,395
Yes, like now.

858
01:00:39,612 --> 01:00:43,004
Okay, go live your own life by yourself!

859
01:00:51,279 --> 01:00:54,172
- I'm leaving.
- You've really changed.

860
01:00:55,112 --> 01:00:57,946
No, it's you who just haven't progressed.

861
01:00:57,946 --> 01:00:59,529
What?

862
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:04,895
You're at the head office now, so you look down on me.

863
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:06,930
You really make me cringe.

864
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,530
What?!

865
01:01:09,488 --> 01:01:12,929
Being with you drives me crazy.

866
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:15,572
Being with Justice is way better.

867
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:18,555
Mamiana would never be this childish.

868
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:39,912
Okay then.

869
01:01:42,612 --> 01:01:44,479
Let's break up.

870
01:01:54,196 --> 01:01:55,996
Good idea.

871
01:01:59,905 --> 01:02:02,396
Thanks for everything.

<i>[Shooting Corner]</i>

874
01:02:33,655 --> 01:02:35,996
Are you sure about that?

875
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:49,056
Justice!

876
01:02:52,253 --> 01:02:55,795
I was looking for someone to watch the fireworks with.

877
01:02:55,795 --> 01:02:58,012
Shall we do it together?

878
01:03:00,531 --> 01:03:01,823
They are over there.

879
01:03:01,823 --> 01:03:03,949
Don't make a joke of it.

880
01:03:11,114 --> 01:03:12,739
Listen.

881
01:03:13,822 --> 01:03:18,448
You know, Haruta, I really like you.

882
01:03:20,156 --> 01:03:21,756
I mean that...

883
01:03:22,364 --> 01:03:25,072
as a person and as my senior...

884
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:27,122
I get it!

885
01:03:28,114 --> 01:03:30,306
Don't preach to me.

886
01:03:41,364 --> 01:03:42,964
Damn it!

887
01:03:47,656 --> 01:03:49,764
What did you throw away?

888
01:03:52,573 --> 01:03:54,373
A ring.

889
01:03:55,322 --> 01:03:57,122
Seriously?

890
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:01,381
You idiot.

891
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:04,573
Hey, come back.

892
01:04:04,573 --> 01:04:06,097
Don't go in, you idiot.

893
01:04:06,097 --> 01:04:10,131
Justice, you don't need to do that. Just come back.

894
01:04:14,197 --> 01:04:16,805
C'mon, that's enough.

895
01:04:16,805 --> 01:04:18,989
Get lost!

896
01:04:24,406 --> 01:04:25,573
Justice?

897
01:04:25,573 --> 01:04:27,440
Listen, Haruta.

898
01:04:29,364 --> 01:04:34,840
You have to tell him your true feelings.

899
01:04:37,043 --> 01:04:39,202
What brought this on?

900
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:43,789
My parents and my elder brother...

901
01:04:45,197 --> 01:04:50,131
died in an accident three years ago.

902
01:04:54,989 --> 01:04:58,306
On my brother's birthday.

903
01:05:00,085 --> 01:05:03,160
You know the last thing I said to him?

904
01:05:05,406 --> 01:05:07,689
Get lost!

905
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,665
Just like what I did just now.

906
01:05:15,782 --> 01:05:18,332
No happy birthday wishes at all.

907
01:05:19,532 --> 01:05:21,831
I just screamed and asked him to get lost.

908
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:39,340
Listen, Haruta.

909
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:44,058
We can never be sure...

910
01:05:46,323 --> 01:05:49,390
we'll see our loved ones tomorrow.

911
01:05:52,288 --> 01:05:54,780
That's why you should...

912
01:05:55,532 --> 01:05:58,865
tell him how you feel.

913
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,532
Why are you the one crying?

914
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:34,155
I got it.

915
01:06:44,448 --> 01:06:47,457
I've never seen such crappy fireworks.

916

This can't be true.

920

Mr. Goro?

921
01:07:24,865 --> 01:07:27,490
I've decided to sell this place.

922
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:29,366
But still...

923
01:07:29,366 --> 01:07:36,549
Our old-fashioned business isn't a good fit for your new resort.

924
01:07:38,698 --> 01:07:41,323
Wait. Where are you going?

925
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:48,170
- To get answers from the "Germanium 7" Team.
- Okay.

926
01:07:52,073 --> 01:07:53,115
Here we go.

927
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:55,889
<i>It's all your fault, Mamiana.</i>

928
01:07:57,906 --> 01:07:59,240
I'm sorry, Sir.

929
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,698
So, what's your plan?

930
01:08:00,698 --> 01:08:02,989
My daughter is being held hostage.

931
01:08:02,989 --> 01:08:05,281
What? A hostage?

932
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:06,948
Who is?

933
01:08:06,948 --> 01:08:12,465
Why does Phoenix Mountain Resort even need to talk to my daughter?

934
01:08:12,465 --> 01:08:16,632
It's like they've kidnapped her. Call the police.

935
01:08:16,632 --> 01:08:20,423
Chairman, even if we do get your daughter released safely,

936
01:08:20,423 --> 01:08:22,782
it'll leak that we were dealing with gangsters.

937
01:08:22,782 --> 01:08:25,423
And that will destroy the company's reputation.

938
01:08:25,423 --> 01:08:30,206
We can't give away all the land we've worked hard to acquire.

939
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:34,172
Sir, please leave everything to me.

940
01:08:41,406 --> 01:08:43,248
That sounds bad.

941
01:08:44,015 --> 01:08:45,749
Very bad.

942
01:08:47,033 --> 01:08:51,366
That Mamiana is up to no good, I bet.

943
01:08:51,931 --> 01:08:53,057
Why do you say that?

944
01:08:53,057 --> 01:08:55,799
It's just an intuition.

945
01:08:57,033 --> 01:08:59,850
Oh! I get it now.

946
01:09:00,618 --> 01:09:06,238
Mamiana is working for the gangster's front company, Phoenix Mountain Resort.

947
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:13,480
Having us buy out the tenants makes it easier for them to steal the project.

948
01:09:17,743 --> 01:09:19,860
What are you two doing here?

949
01:09:20,868 --> 01:09:23,218
- Well...
- No, don't say it.

950
01:09:23,218 --> 01:09:24,643
Haruta.

951
01:09:24,643 --> 01:09:26,268
Yes, Sir.

952
01:09:26,268 --> 01:09:31,476
Come see me 8pm tonight at Tokyo Bay City Hotel.

953
01:09:32,283 --> 01:09:33,883
Yes, Sir.

954
01:09:44,651 --> 01:09:47,068
What?! Why just me alone?

955
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:49,693
Excuse me.

956
01:09:50,414 --> 01:09:52,335
Enter.

957
01:09:52,335 --> 01:09:53,902
Okay.

958
01:09:55,297 --> 01:09:57,280
Excuse me.

No, thank you.

01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:34,640
<i>W-w-wait! Hold on!</i>

965
01:10:37,935 --> 01:10:39,520
I'm sorry.

966
01:10:43,809 --> 01:10:47,710
<i>Hang on. If I let myself go with the flow,</i>

967
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:51,226
<i>then Mamiana won't hit on Maki.</i>

968
01:11:10,535 --> 01:11:12,852
Why were you at the head office?

969
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:17,130
What?

970
01:11:17,993 --> 01:11:20,702
You're in Sales, aren't you?

971
01:11:23,326 --> 01:11:28,268
I have something I really need to tell you.

972
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:30,518
What is it?

973
01:11:30,518 --> 01:11:32,060
Well...

974
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:37,068
We said we would build a town of a million smiles,

975
01:11:37,068 --> 01:11:40,077
but no one is smiling in that town now.

976
01:11:40,077 --> 01:11:44,226
Takemoto, the Kimono dealer, and Sakaguchi, the florist.

977
01:11:44,226 --> 01:11:47,418
And same goes for Goro, the udon restaurant owner.

978
01:11:50,535 --> 01:11:52,960
What are you plotting?

979
01:11:54,118 --> 01:11:59,118
Are you the one pulling the strings for the gangsters?

980
01:12:12,034 --> 01:12:13,993
Me? A string-puller?

981
01:12:13,993 --> 01:12:16,202
That's funny.

982
01:12:21,202 --> 01:12:25,251
A friend in the police department contacted me.

983
01:12:26,618 --> 01:12:32,977
He said our resort partners are heavily involved in the drugs-trade.

984
01:12:33,993 --> 01:12:38,826
<i>The resort is a cover for a major narcotics transshipment hub.</i>

985
01:12:38,826 --> 01:12:40,909
<i>I see.</i>

986
01:12:41,701 --> 01:12:42,977
Drugs?

987
01:12:42,977 --> 01:12:44,701
So, I dissolved the partnership.

988
01:12:44,701 --> 01:12:48,610
<i>Dissolve the partnership? I refuse to accept that!</i>

989
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:51,994
Look, but even if we are innocent,

990
01:12:51,994 --> 01:12:56,002
once it leaks out, our reputation is ruined.

991
01:12:57,077 --> 01:13:02,209
I have a responsibility to protect and preserve our company.

992
01:13:04,701 --> 01:13:08,677
Never tell a living soul what you heard at the meeting room today, okay?

993
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:13,885
Maki and I will deal with it.

994
01:13:16,618 --> 01:13:18,852
With Maki, you say?

995
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:20,593
Yes, why?

996
01:13:20,593 --> 01:13:24,235
How about you let me do it instead?

997
01:13:25,077 --> 01:13:30,685
They'll understand if I talk to them. Sincerely, from the heart.

998
01:13:30,685 --> 01:13:32,369
Sincerity trumps over everything.

999
01:13:32,369 --> 01:13:34,369
Not a chance.

1000
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:39,285
Go back and do your own job, okay?

1001
01:13:42,202 --> 01:13:43,909

- Trains?
- Exactly.

Okay, so where?

1066
01:17:38,769 --> 01:17:39,853
Find the train. Which train line?

1067
01:17:39,853 --> 01:17:44,094
Why not just use his phone's GPS to locate him?

1068
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:47,386
Good idea.

1069
01:17:47,386 --> 01:17:51,536
Haruta, open your map app now.

1080
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,530
<i>[20. 12. 46.]</i>

1081
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:35,228
- What's that?
- A time-bomb, obviously.

1082
01:18:35,228 --> 01:18:37,594
No, you gotta be kidding me!

1083
01:18:37,594 --> 01:18:39,258
Cut the red wire?

1084
01:18:39,258 --> 01:18:41,178
- No way!
- Why not?

1085
01:18:41,178 --> 01:18:43,120
- What are you doing?
- Why do you want to cut it?

1086
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,494
If we don't cut something, we'll get blown up.

1087
01:18:45,494 --> 01:18:47,677
No. Don't cut anything.

1088
01:18:47,677 --> 01:18:49,694
Let me go!

1089
01:18:49,694 --> 01:18:51,220
Wait a moment.

1090
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:54,803
These numbers? Is that 20 hours to go?

1091
01:18:56,413 --> 01:18:57,746
Cut the red one.

1092
01:18:57,746 --> 01:18:59,413
- No, don't.
- Why?

1093
01:18:59,413 --> 01:19:01,580
- Why not?
- No, please don't!

1094
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:02,938
That never works.

1095
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,413
Okay, I get it.

1096
01:19:05,413 --> 01:19:07,863
I won't cut the damn wires.

1097
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:18,387
The number has decreased.

1098
01:19:18,913 --> 01:19:21,787
Now we've only got 10 minutes.

1099
01:19:21,787 --> 01:19:25,222
Sorry. I cut the wrong one.

1100
01:19:25,222 --> 01:19:27,787
I should've cut the other one.

1101
01:19:27,787 --> 01:19:31,163
- It should be the blue one. I made a mistake.
- No, please.

1102
01:19:31,163 --> 01:19:33,871
- It must be the blue one.
- No, don't do it!

1103
01:19:33,871 --> 01:19:35,704
No, never!
<i>[9 minutes 55 seconds left]</i>

1104
01:19:40,013 --> 01:19:41,546
Haruta!

1105
01:19:42,204 --> 01:19:43,871
Haruta!

1106
01:19:58,996 --> 01:20:00,580
Ouch! That hurts!

1107
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:04,904
Come on, kid. Break it down.

1108
01:20:04,904 --> 01:20:08,071
I've still got a million things to do outside.

1109
01:20:08,829 --> 01:20:13,622
One day, I'll marry someone like Johnny Depp.

1110
01:20:13,622 --> 01:20:14,714
Are you listening?

1111
01:20:14,714 --> 01:20:17,281
Listen. Don't be rude.

1112
01:20:18,289 --> 01:20:20,539
Don't you have any regrets?

1113
01:20:20,539 --> 01:20:23,564
I've got more regrets than I can count.

1114
01:20:23,564 --> 01:20:26,230
Like what? A broken heart?

1115
01:20:27,147 --> 01:20:30,105
Yeah, but it was me who did the dumping.

1116
01:20:30,105 --> 01:20:32,156
I see. So, you dumped someone.

1117
01:20:32,156 --> 01:20:33,689
Look...

1118
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:39,247
I'd rather dump someone, than be a barrier to their dreams.

1119
01:20:39,247 --> 01:20:42,947
Really? How very thoughtful of you.

1120
01:20:45,371 --> 01:20:47,348
No, not really.

1121
01:20:49,071 --> 01:20:51,065
I was the jealous one.

1122
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:54,955
Just your standard, everyday jealousy.

1123
01:20:54,955 --> 01:20:57,230
Yeah, it is common.

1124
01:20:57,789 --> 01:20:59,706
Honestly.

1125
01:20:59,706 --> 01:21:05,314
If I'm to die like this, I should have supported him.

1126
01:21:05,314 --> 01:21:07,097
Damn it.

1127
01:21:08,164 --> 01:21:10,456
Oh no.

1128
01:21:10,456 --> 01:21:11,956
Only 30 seconds left.

1129
01:21:12,456 --> 01:21:15,080
Check around here.

1130
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,581
Director.

1131
01:21:16,581 --> 01:21:18,622
Maki.

1132
01:21:18,622 --> 01:21:20,606
It's no good. We haven't found him yet.

1133
01:21:20,606 --> 01:21:24,181
I know. Throw it outside.

1134
01:21:25,289 --> 01:21:27,330
I'm quite heavy.

1135
01:21:31,372 --> 01:21:34,222
Take your stupid bomb!

1136
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:41,165
What's that?

1137
01:21:41,165 --> 01:21:42,865
Don't tell me...

1138
01:21:49,881 --> 01:21:51,581
Damn it.

1139
01:22:04,518 --> 01:22:07,331
Don't tell me that the Director is inside, too?

1140
01:22:07,331 --> 01:22:09,023
Director.

1141
01:22:13,165 --> 01:22:15,256
- Justice!
- Justice!

1142
01:22:18,665 --> 01:22:20,656
What's happening here?

1143
01:22:23,373 --> 01:22:27,231
It's too dangerous for you. I'll go.

1144
01:22:27,231 --> 01:22:29,382
- No, I will.
- Why?

1145
01:22:29,382 --> 01:22:32,740
- I will go save him!
- No way!

1146
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:43,632
Hang in there.

1147
01:22:43,632 --> 01:22:45,648
It's too dangerous. Go back.

1148
01:22:45,648 --> 01:22:47,048
If you're going, so am I.

1149
01:22:47,048 --> 01:22:49,923
This is my order as your superior. Go back now!

1150
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,273
Admit it, Director.

1151
01:22:51,273 --> 01:22:54,774
You forgetting about Haruta was a lie, right? You want that one last chance, right?

1152
01:22:55,832 --> 01:22:59,656
I only wanted him to know my true feelings.

1153
01:22:59,656 --> 01:23:01,998
You don't need to say it. He knows it perfectly.

1154
01:23:01,998 --> 01:23:04,231
- There you go again.
- What?

1155
01:23:04,231 --> 01:23:09,131
You're always expecting everyone to read your mind. Always seeking attention.

1156
01:23:09,874 --> 01:23:11,915
Don't you dare say that!

1157
01:23:11,915 --> 01:23:14,674
You're just too proud. That's your problem.

1158
01:23:14,674 --> 01:23:16,540
You're scared of facing the truth.

1159
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:17,456
Shut up!

1160
01:23:17,456 --> 01:23:20,056
- I got you, right?
- No!

1161
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:33,790
Let him see everything, including your ugly side.

1162
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:36,639
That's true love, isn't it?

1163
01:23:53,843 --> 01:23:55,770
What's that sound?

1164
01:23:55,770 --> 01:23:57,420
Huh?

1165
01:23:57,420 --> 01:23:59,040
What's going on?

1166
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:00,457
Haruta-san!

1167
01:24:00,457 --> 01:24:02,233
Justice!

1168
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:05,900
Kaoruko-san, hurry! Hurry!

1169
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:07,570
Watch your head.

1170
01:24:13,107 --> 01:24:14,658
Haruta!

1171
01:24:14,658 --> 01:24:18,982
- Leave me, take her first.
- No, never.

1172
01:24:18,982 --> 01:24:22,457
I'll never make that same mistake again.

1173
01:24:22,457 --> 01:24:25,600
Just leave me. Go with her.

1174
01:24:28,666 --> 01:24:30,799
Haruta-san!

1175
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:38,020
One, two...

1176
01:24:43,464 --> 01:24:45,715
- Haruta-san!
- Haru-pon!

1177
01:24:45,715 --> 01:24:48,870
- Haruta-san!
- Haru-pon!

1178
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:53,250
- Haruta-san!
- Haru-pon!

1179
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:55,550
- Haruta-san!
- Haru-pon!

1180
01:24:56,381 --> 01:24:58,031
He's not breathing.

1181
01:24:58,031 --> 01:25:00,380
No! Haruta...Haruta-san!

1182
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:02,091
Harupon!

1183
01:25:02,091 --> 01:25:05,532
I will do it.

1184
01:25:05,532 --> 01:25:07,508
Not you! I'll do it.

1185
01:25:07,508 --> 01:25:09,882
No, I will.

1186
01:25:09,882 --> 01:25:11,949
Get lost, boy!

1187
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,900
- Just once!
- You're crazy.

1188
01:25:19,165 --> 01:25:22,582
Haru-pon is my Snow White!

1189
01:25:24,916 --> 01:25:26,899
Watch out!

1190
01:25:35,649 --> 01:25:37,715
- Haruta-san.
- Haru-pon!

1191
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:40,223
Is he okay?

1192
01:25:42,666 --> 01:25:44,574
Director!

1193
01:25:44,574 --> 01:25:46,833
Quick, come this way!

1194
01:25:46,833 --> 01:25:48,566
Director, you go ahead first.

1195
01:25:48,566 --> 01:25:50,916
Don't talk nonsense!

1196
01:25:50,916 --> 01:25:56,082
Do you think I could ever abandon my beloved subordinates?

1197
01:25:56,082 --> 01:25:59,182
No, Director. Get to safety first.

1198
01:25:59,182 --> 01:26:01,974
Director, I beg you. Go now!

1199
01:26:01,974 --> 01:26:03,874
Damn it!

1200
01:26:03,874 --> 01:26:05,582
Please go!

1201
01:26:05,582 --> 01:26:08,516
Damn it!

1202
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:17,916
I'LL....BE...BAAAAAACK!!!

1203
01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:37,070
Maki!

1204
01:26:38,416 --> 01:26:40,374
The heat.

1205
01:26:40,374 --> 01:26:43,024
It's so hot.

1206
01:26:45,249 --> 01:26:49,841
Can I take back what I said earlier?

1207
01:26:49,841 --> 01:26:51,433
What?

1208
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:56,315
About us breaking up.

1209
01:26:56,315 --> 01:26:58,012
Now?

1210
01:27:00,375 --> 01:27:05,875
I understand that you have your own dreams.

1211
01:27:06,667 --> 01:27:09,365
Always busy, always working.

1212
01:27:09,365 --> 01:27:13,991
But I, foolishly, got upset about that.

1213
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:20,159
However, I've found my own dream now.

1214
01:27:21,167 --> 01:27:23,175
What are you talking about?

1215
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,358
You don't want to know my dream?

1216
01:27:28,358 --> 01:27:30,291
I'm not interested now.

1217
01:27:30,291 --> 01:27:32,300
Go on, ask me.

1218
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:37,400
There's nothing between Mamiana and me.

1219
01:27:39,084 --> 01:27:43,067
I don't know what you saw, but it was always just business.

1220
01:27:43,583 --> 01:27:45,308
I know.

1221
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,917
Watch out!

1222
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:54,492
Maki!

1223
01:27:58,126 --> 01:28:00,108
Maki!

1224
01:28:04,417 --> 01:28:08,600
I'm okay. Just go now.

1225
01:28:09,084 --> 01:28:12,059
Get on, I'll piggy-back you.

1226
01:28:12,059 --> 01:28:13,957
Hurry.

1227
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:28,625
Director!

1228
01:28:28,625 --> 01:28:30,834
Director, are you okay?

1229
01:28:30,834 --> 01:28:34,250
They're still inside.

1230
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:36,625
It's okay. The rescue team is coming soon.

1231
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:38,108
Take a seat.

1232
01:28:38,108 --> 01:28:39,126
Thanks.

1233
01:28:39,126 --> 01:28:41,751
- Any injuries?
- I'm fine.

1234
01:28:41,751 --> 01:28:43,850
Director, you're missing a shoe.

1235
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:45,530
Thank you.

1236
01:29:07,216 --> 01:29:08,841
Director?

1237
01:29:09,828 --> 01:29:11,628
What's wrong, Sir?

1238
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:15,467
I get it now.

1239
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:19,602
What have I done?

1240
01:29:22,217 --> 01:29:26,125
What have I done?

1241
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:29,226
Seriously?

1242
01:30:13,375 --> 01:30:15,859
This must be how it feels

1243
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:19,669
when a chicken get fried.

1244
01:30:23,173 --> 01:30:27,389
I think this is more like being grilled.

1245
01:30:29,406 --> 01:30:31,148
You're right.

1246
01:30:37,918 --> 01:30:39,852
Listen, Maki.

1247
01:30:40,585 --> 01:30:45,776
You're very finicky, aren't you?

1248
01:30:48,002 --> 01:30:51,235
No, you're just over-disorganized.

1249
01:30:57,826 --> 01:30:59,568
Does that make me bad?

1250
01:31:03,496 --> 01:31:05,796
No, it doesn't.

1251
01:31:16,751 --> 01:31:18,476
Listen.

1252
01:31:22,793 --> 01:31:29,002
I sincerely wanted to become a family with you.

1253
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:40,194
What does that mean?

1254
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:42,268
But the problem was...

1255
01:31:43,793 --> 01:31:47,443
I didn't understand anything previously.

1256
01:31:51,761 --> 01:31:53,711
We're both men.

1257
01:31:55,085 --> 01:32:01,701
To begin with, we can't even legally marry.

1258
01:32:03,327 --> 01:32:05,343
And besides...

1259
01:32:06,644 --> 01:32:11,219
I really love children.

1260
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,759
All these things...

1261
01:32:15,501 --> 01:32:17,943
that make a family.

1262
01:32:22,587 --> 01:32:24,396
Same goes for me, too.

1263
01:32:27,089 --> 01:32:33,630
I used work as an excuse not to confront you.

1264
01:32:38,793 --> 01:32:42,076
We saw the worst in each other.

1265
01:32:43,777 --> 01:32:47,103
I was scared of our relationship.

1266
01:32:48,163 --> 01:32:50,696
The deeper I fell into love...

1267
01:32:53,636 --> 01:32:56,444
the more it seemed I would suffer.

1268
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:10,868
Can I say something?

1269
01:33:15,182 --> 01:33:16,682
Sure.

1270
01:33:18,372 --> 01:33:20,271
Let's say if...

1271
01:33:23,432 --> 01:33:25,665
you know, in the future...

1272
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:30,368
if we do end up having many fights.

1273
01:33:32,597 --> 01:33:38,988
And you won't cook for me anymore.

1274
01:33:40,683 --> 01:33:45,975
Or you'll refuse to wash my underwear.

1275
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:52,039
When you won't reply to my texts.

1276
01:33:53,454 --> 01:33:55,878
If you get fat.

1277
01:33:57,613 --> 01:34:00,222
Or you end up bald.

1278
01:34:02,789 --> 01:34:07,415
Even if your farts start to really stink.

1279
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:11,409
When you lose all your teeth.

1280
01:34:12,633 --> 01:34:15,433
And have ill-fitting dentures.

1281
01:34:17,253 --> 01:34:19,495
Or you grow senile.

1282
01:34:22,608 --> 01:34:25,924
And you forget that we ever met.

1283
01:34:27,969 --> 01:34:29,769
Even if...

1284
01:34:33,003 --> 01:34:36,637
you don't even recognize me anymore.

1285
01:34:41,128 --> 01:34:43,237
Even with all that...

1286
01:34:46,379 --> 01:34:48,411
Despite everything...

1287
01:34:50,795 --> 01:34:56,504
I will still only ever love you.

1288
01:35:12,670 --> 01:35:16,411
I want to be with you even if I'm dead.

1289
01:35:27,886 --> 01:35:29,787
Me, too.

1290
01:35:32,295 --> 01:35:35,137
You're the only one I could ever love.

1291
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:34,288
Hey there.

1292
01:36:42,070 --> 01:36:44,120
HARUTA-SAAAAN!

1293
01:36:44,128 --> 01:36:45,979
Maki.

1294
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:52,289
Director!

1295
01:36:54,753 --> 01:36:56,253
Haru...

1296
01:36:57,546 --> 01:36:59,128
...tan?

1297
01:37:02,410 --> 01:37:04,476
Haru-tan.

1298
01:37:04,476 --> 01:37:06,258
Yes, -tan.

1299
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:08,150
Haru-tan.

1300
01:37:08,150 --> 01:37:10,122
It's me, Haru-tan.

1301
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:13,795
Haru-tan!

1302
01:37:13,795 --> 01:37:15,046
Did you hear that?

1303
01:37:15,046 --> 01:37:17,429
His memory has returned!

1304
01:38:06,888 --> 01:38:09,021
Mr. Chairman, we have a proposal.

1305
01:38:09,021 --> 01:38:13,821
We implore you to reconsider the proposed bay area project.

1306
01:38:14,422 --> 01:38:16,372
Reconsider?

1307
01:38:16,372 --> 01:38:21,046
None of the locals support the resort we envisioned.

1308
01:38:21,046 --> 01:38:26,560
We need to build a town that will satisfy their needs and desires.

1309
01:38:27,046 --> 01:38:28,755
Mr. Chairman.

1310
01:38:28,755 --> 01:38:33,046
Sir, we beg you to reconsider.

1311
01:38:33,046 --> 01:38:35,530
<i>Please, Sir.</i>

1312
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:39,363
The head office makes decisions on project policy.

1313
01:38:39,963 --> 01:38:42,921
That's not the concern of you, sales people.

1314
01:38:42,921 --> 01:38:45,522
- But still...
- Mr. Chairman.

1315
01:38:54,462 --> 01:38:56,296
They're absolutely right.

1316
01:38:56,296 --> 01:38:57,796
Mamiana?

1317
01:38:57,796 --> 01:39:01,911
When did we stop listening to the local residents?

1318
01:39:01,911 --> 01:39:09,456
Didn't you start this business to bring joy to the people in the town?

1319
01:39:12,542 --> 01:39:19,835
Our dedicated sales staff work very well with the residents and business owners.

1320
01:39:19,835 --> 01:39:26,543
With those two, plus our head office staff, we form an invincible trinity.

1321
01:39:29,089 --> 01:39:33,805
But who will be the partner of the development?

1322
01:39:34,422 --> 01:39:39,214
Excuse me, Mr Haruta. There's a Mr. Chou from Horai Found to see you.

1323
01:39:39,214 --> 01:39:42,172
Who? What? Hong Kong? Me?

1324
01:39:42,172 --> 01:39:43,549
Did you get into some trouble again?

1325
01:39:43,549 --> 01:39:45,449
How would I know?

1326
01:39:57,798 --> 01:40:00,622
It's been long. Do you still remember me?

1327
01:40:01,297 --> 01:40:04,072
Sorry, but I have no idea who he is.

1328
01:40:04,072 --> 01:40:10,798
Don't you remember? You dropped this key holder.

1329
01:40:10,798 --> 01:40:12,505
My keychain.

1330
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:16,080
<i>Thank you.</i>

1331
01:40:17,214 --> 01:40:21,322
I remember now. You're that old guy. Yes, I know him. Why are you here?

1332
01:40:21,322 --> 01:40:28,506
You saved our priceless antique family treasure.

1333
01:40:28,506 --> 01:40:32,067
You appeared from nowhere, like a God.

1334
01:40:32,067 --> 01:40:36,982
The Horai Fund is most glad to finance our next project.

1335
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:40,064
I never expected you to know such a person.

1336
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,898
I don't really know him.

1337
01:40:41,898 --> 01:40:44,914
But he's a great old guy, isn't he?

1338
01:40:47,008 --> 01:40:49,957
I hope our work brings us together again.

1339
01:40:51,067 --> 01:40:52,667
Yes, Sir.

1340
01:40:54,722 --> 01:40:57,350
I need you to come somewhere with me.

1341
01:40:57,350 --> 01:40:59,530
What?

1342
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:03,089
Phoenix Mountain Resort executives are under arrest.

1343
01:41:03,089 --> 01:41:08,937
They were forming an illegal drug empire in the Tokyo Bay Development Project.

1344
01:41:11,154 --> 01:41:16,255
Haruta saved Tokyo Bay from becoming a keystone of the drug trade.

1345
01:41:16,255 --> 01:41:19,672
Who would have expected Haruta to save Japan?!

1346
01:41:20,456 --> 01:41:26,322
♪ <i>He's our hero</i> ♪

1347
01:41:26,322 --> 01:41:28,714
Chizu, you're still waiting for your hero?

1348
01:41:28,714 --> 01:41:30,356
I guess so.

1349
01:41:30,356 --> 01:41:32,548
You gave up on marriage for a career, right?

1350
01:41:32,548 --> 01:41:36,856
Don't say that. I want a career and a family.

1351
01:41:36,856 --> 01:41:38,439
And I will have both.

1352
01:41:38,439 --> 01:41:39,985
I don't understand.

1353
01:41:39,985 --> 01:41:41,292
- Do you?
- Not at all.

1354
01:41:41,292 --> 01:41:44,206
- And I'll unify the world.
- Seriously?

1355
01:41:50,714 --> 01:41:52,420
Why bring me here?

1356
01:41:52,420 --> 01:41:53,840
<i>[Yudegoro]</i>

1357
01:41:53,847 --> 01:41:57,782
At your hotel the other day, I saw your photo.

1358
01:42:01,747 --> 01:42:05,748
<i>That very same photo was in this restaurant.</i>

1359
01:42:05,748 --> 01:42:08,857
<i>I never thought I would see him smiling.</i>

1360
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:16,799
When I was a boy, the restaurant didn't make money, we were very poor.

1361
01:42:16,799 --> 01:42:23,907
I'd had enough of Dad and his damned noodles, so I ran away from home.

1362
01:42:25,131 --> 01:42:28,532
I bet he doesn't want to see me now.

1363
01:42:30,173 --> 01:42:33,740
I think you're wrong there.

1364
01:42:36,382 --> 01:42:38,257
What could you possibly know?

1365
01:42:38,757 --> 01:42:41,007
This was what he said.

1366
01:42:41,007 --> 01:42:43,632
<i>Are you sure about closing up shop?</i>

1367
01:42:43,632 --> 01:42:47,431
<i>Anyway, my son will never come back.</i>

1368
01:42:47,431 --> 01:42:50,589
<i>He has his own life now.</i>

1369
01:42:52,090 --> 01:42:54,982
<i>Sorry for being so stubborn.</i>

1370
01:42:54,982 --> 01:42:58,836
I'm positive he feels exactly the same.

1371
01:43:00,855 --> 01:43:06,171
Even if the relationship is broken, you can fix it.

1372
01:43:06,996 --> 01:43:08,660
Not just your family, but this entire town, too.

1373
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:11,570
but this entire town, too.

1374
01:43:38,273 --> 01:43:40,574
Okay.

1375
01:43:42,048 --> 01:43:45,066
What shall I have?

1376
01:43:53,546 --> 01:43:55,679
Soba with tempura batter.

1377
01:43:58,227 --> 01:44:00,553
Not udon noodles?

1378
01:44:15,790 --> 01:44:17,415
Director.

1379
01:44:22,559 --> 01:44:27,318
I want your blessing to marry Choko.

1380
01:44:27,318 --> 01:44:29,637
What are you saying?

1381
01:44:32,678 --> 01:44:34,911
Can you make her happy?

1382
01:44:35,721 --> 01:44:37,321
Maybe.

1383
01:44:38,507 --> 01:44:41,263
Absolutely. Totally.

1384
01:44:41,263 --> 01:44:43,907
It's my life's mission to make her happy.

1385
01:44:45,932 --> 01:44:47,715
In that case...

1386
01:44:48,883 --> 01:44:52,157
I approve. With all my heart.

1387
01:44:56,341 --> 01:44:58,316
My dearest Choko.

1388
01:45:00,648 --> 01:45:03,356
Please marry me.

1389
01:45:12,883 --> 01:45:16,574
This all started as a big mistake.

1390
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:30,134
Yes, I'll marry you.

1391
01:45:30,134 --> 01:45:32,467
I did it!

1392
01:45:32,467 --> 01:45:34,184
Director!

1393
01:45:34,967 --> 01:45:38,359
Please take good care of Choko.

1394
01:45:38,359 --> 01:45:42,390
I'm not much good at anything.

1395
01:45:42,390 --> 01:45:45,575
But I will make both of you very happy.

1396
01:45:45,575 --> 01:45:47,260
Now sit down and behave.

1397
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:49,101
Don't get pushy.

1398
01:45:49,634 --> 01:45:51,742
Overseas?

1399
01:45:51,742 --> 01:45:56,692
The Singapore Development team specifically asked for you.

1400
01:45:56,692 --> 01:46:01,051
I know having a family makes it a difficult choice.

1401
01:46:01,051 --> 01:46:03,425
I have five children, too.

1402
01:46:03,425 --> 01:46:06,884
What? You're married with five children?

1403
01:46:06,884 --> 01:46:08,926
Yes. Didn't I mention it?

1404
01:46:08,926 --> 01:46:10,425
I had no idea you had a wife.

1405
01:46:10,425 --> 01:46:11,884
Yes, I do.

1406
01:46:11,884 --> 01:46:16,850
It's a very good offer, so please consider it.

1407
01:46:44,128 --> 01:46:46,327
I refuse, Sir.

1408
01:46:47,134 --> 01:46:49,359
Take the chance.

1409
01:46:49,359 --> 01:46:52,717
Being a project leader at the head office is a dream job.

1410
01:46:52,717 --> 01:46:57,059
But being a leader just doesn't suit me.

1411
01:46:57,668 --> 01:47:01,544
I want to manage projects by walking through the town,

1412
01:47:01,544 --> 01:47:04,928
and build a town with them together.

1413
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:10,625
That's my biggest dream at the moment, Sir.

1414
01:47:13,142 --> 01:47:15,067
How like you, Haruta.

1415
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:19,459
I'm counting on you.

1416
01:47:19,459 --> 01:47:22,225
Yes, Sir. Here I go!

01:48:35,493 --> 01:48:40,393
Together, we will raise a big family... and...

1435
01:48:42,385 --> 01:48:44,593
One day, I'll be the chairman.

1436
01:48:44,593 --> 01:48:45,718
You're ambitious!

1437
01:48:45,718 --> 01:48:48,801
- Love and peace!
- Love and peace!

1438
01:48:48,801 --> 01:48:50,852
Great!

1439
01:48:50,852 --> 01:48:53,109
Congratulations!

1440
01:49:01,218 --> 01:49:05,185
Every one of them is finding the happiness of their own.

1441
01:49:05,885 --> 01:49:07,960
Indeed they are.

1442
01:49:08,885 --> 01:49:13,920
Maybe I should hold back on love for a while.

She is about to toss the bouquet.

1445
01:49:27,010 --> 01:49:31,743
It doesn't really matter if you don't love me.

1446
01:49:33,665 --> 01:49:40,249
I want to love far more than I want to be loved.

1447
01:49:45,926 --> 01:49:47,918
Here it goes!

1448
01:49:58,509 --> 01:50:03,744
I, Musashi Kurosawa, will find true happiness.

I'd better get going.

Rise to the top, Maki.

I'm no bureaucrat.

1458
01:51:39,220 --> 01:51:41,595
Whatever, but I won't lose to you.

1459
01:51:41,595 --> 01:51:46,053
I'll work hard, knowing you're on the other side of the world.

1460
01:51:46,053 --> 01:51:47,428
Technically, it's still on this side.

1461
01:51:47,428 --> 01:51:49,636
You're always so finicky.

1462
01:51:49,636 --> 01:51:53,062
You don't give up, do you?

1463
01:51:53,971 --> 01:51:59,279
Do your best to make your dreams come true.

1464
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:02,060
Okay.

1465
01:52:13,388 --> 01:52:14,988
See you later....

Ryota.

1467
01:52:24,845 --> 01:52:26,638
Why use my first name?

1468
01:52:26,638 --> 01:52:28,181
- Go on, use mine.
- No way!

1469
01:52:28,181 --> 01:52:31,597
- Come on, say it. Try to say it.
- I don't want to.

1470
01:52:40,596 --> 01:52:44,079
See you later.... Soichi.
