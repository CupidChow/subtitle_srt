1
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:14,748
Ms. Vice Chairwoman is here.

2
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:23,601
Hello, mother.

3
00:00:26,846 --> 00:00:28,302
How is Dojae?

4
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:32,864
How is his progress?

5
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:35,651
Let's have a sit first.

6
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:42,775
Dojae, has recovered a lot.

7
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,363
He'll be back soon.

8
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:47,187
You really went through a lot.

9
00:00:48,122 --> 00:00:50,318
Dojae was the one who suffered the most.

10
00:00:51,354 --> 00:00:53,734
When he first opened
his eyes after the surgery,

11
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:55,430
he saw me and called me "Mother".

12
00:00:56,249 --> 00:00:58,122
It reminded me of that day.

13
00:01:00,564 --> 00:01:03,156
When he saw me as he opened his eyes...

14
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:05,171
...and asked me who I was.

15
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:06,747
That fateful day.

16
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:21,464
You know how stubborn he is.

17
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:25,543
Did you get in touch with him?

18
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,525
I did.

19
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:32,182
I told him if he doesn't return soon,
One Air might catch up to T'road soon.

20
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:34,642
That's so like you two.

21
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:37,646
He's going try his best to return
as soon as he can after listening to that.

22
00:01:51,238 --> 00:01:52,399
Hey.

23
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:55,371
When are you going to introduce to us
the girl you're dating?

24
00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:01,980
Thanks for the meal.

25
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:03,227
I'm going now.

26
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:05,388
You better watch your mouth.

27
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,651
Wait! Ryu Eunho!

28
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:08,861
Take this with you.

29
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:10,014
Give it to Segye.

30
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:16,019
Gosh, that brat.

31
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,945
I wonder who he takes after.
His mouth is closed shut.

32
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,380
Stop pestering him.
What if he acts up again?

33
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:23,257
Just leave him alone.

34
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:26,088
What about him?
Has he never pestered me before?

35
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,884
By the way, how could you
call this pestering him?

36
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:35,062
What does she look like?

37
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:40,662
Well... she's...

38
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,391
...pretty.

39
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:45,082
Give me more details.
In what way is she pretty?

40
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:52,119
Thank you for the meal.

41
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:54,469
I'm going. Bye...

42
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:55,921
Hey! Ryu Aram!

43
00:02:56,023 --> 00:02:58,282
Geez. I can't stand those two.

44
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:01,483
I wonder who they take after?

45
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:03,498
They take after you, of course.

46
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,996
They take after you...

47
00:03:07,595 --> 00:03:09,595
That's why they're good looking.

48
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,996
Very good looking.

49
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:14,940
I have very high standards, you know.

50
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,758
Thank you for the meal.

51
00:03:17,688 --> 00:03:19,301
I'm leaving.

52
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:21,474
-Geez...
-Goodness.

53
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:27,699
I'm so curious. It's killing me.

54
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:39,312
Hey.

55
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:41,153
Hi. You're here?

56
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:43,978
Goodness.

57
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:45,589
I want to go too.

58
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:46,661
No, you can't.

59
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:47,759
Why not?

60
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:50,630
I also miss Segye.
I miss Kingkang as well.

61
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:52,374
You can't.

62
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:54,771
You look too fancy...

63
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:57,335
...to be appearing in the countryside.

64
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,123
You'll just attract people's attention.

65
00:03:59,695 --> 00:04:01,135
She went there for some peace and quiet.

66
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,150
Then...

67
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,035
...tell her to come to Seoul.

68
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,620
Be patient. I'll bring her back soon.

69
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:10,953
Is she doing okay?

70
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:15,194
At first, she was in a complete mess.

71
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:16,762
but she's doing better now.

72
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:18,106
She looks more alive now.

73
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:22,872
I haven't touched the money
she wired to me.

74
00:04:23,152 --> 00:04:25,500
Tell her she can just tell me
whenever she needs it.

75
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:27,891
I thought you said
you were going to study?

76
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,976
Use it. She gave it to you.

77
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:31,401
Or donate it.

78
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:32,871
How could I?

79
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:35,092
She worked so hard for that money.

80
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:38,227
It's not even much. She'll just earn more.

81
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:41,216
Are you going to make her act again?

82
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:45,612
Even if I don't make her,
she'll be back on her own sooner or later.

83
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,054
Acting is her calling.

84
00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:48,737
How could she just throw it away?

85
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,665
It's just a matter of time.

86
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,544
Bye.

87
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,751
Drive carefully.

88
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:54,718
Okay.

89
00:05:00,672 --> 00:05:02,195
I want to see her too.

90
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,789
Is her daughter living here
after retiring?

91
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:14,464
I think they rent the place out.

92
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:15,832
An old woman lives there.

93
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:18,277
I once saw an old woman
coming out of there at night.

94
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:20,647
You're wrong.
There's a child living in the house.

95
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,413
Maybe the old woman and the child
live here together.

96
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,183
Then what about the young lady
I saw last time?

97
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,167
I know.

98
00:05:31,346 --> 00:05:33,810
The mother must leave her child
for the grandmother to take care of.

99
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:35,318
And comes here to visit once in a while.

100
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:36,926
Right?

101
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,372
You're right.

102
00:05:54,783 --> 00:05:55,654
Hello.

103
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,205
-Hello.
-Hello.

104
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,599
Hello.

105
00:05:58,964 --> 00:06:00,755
I guess you're back from somewhere.

106
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,373
-You're pretty.
-Thank you.

107
00:06:03,816 --> 00:06:05,037
She must be the child's mom.

108
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:06,266
Yes. You might be right.

109
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:07,629
She looks young to be a mother though.

110
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:09,569
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

111
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:19,446
Hi. You're here.

112
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:25,561
Am I here to visit my friend
or a knitting club?

113
00:06:27,489 --> 00:06:29,550
You should at least get a TV.

114
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:30,878
No, thanks.

115
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,446
Why?

116
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:34,731
I'm sure it'll make you
want to go back to acting.

117
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:37,912
You'll sit here and think that you can
do a better job than the actress.

118
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,780
What's that?

119
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:42,002
Things Eunho's mom made for you.

120
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:43,972
I'm so grateful.
She sends me stuff all the time.

121
00:06:44,057 --> 00:06:46,428
Eunho wanted to tag along.
I barely come here.

122
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:47,869
I miss Eunho too.

123
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:50,252
The way I see it...

124
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,992
...I think he misses Kingkang more.

125
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,273
My Kingkang is irresistibly charming.

126
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,183
Aren't you?

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,899
Here.

128
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:04,286
The books you asked for.

129
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:08,982
Do you like them that much?

130
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,690
These days,

131
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:15,035
I don't even know if I'm running
an entertainment or publishing company.

132
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:18,879
I meet more people in publishing
more than I meet directors, nowadays.

133
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:22,262
They're all grateful to you.

134
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:25,475
They told me that all the books
you read do very well.

135
00:07:25,609 --> 00:07:26,847
Thank you so much.

136
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:31,826
Doesn't being stuck here,

137
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:33,631
make you want to act again?

138
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:37,464
Don't you feel like you need to at least
read books to people to feel alive?

139
00:07:38,044 --> 00:07:40,935
I told you that you're born an actress.

140
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:42,865
Do you want to go back now?

141
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,120
It's not like that.

142
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:46,532
I'm just bored, that's all.

143
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:50,027
Are you really not going
to step out of the house?

144
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:52,139
Are you going to keep on living like this?

145
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:53,065
I do go out.

146
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,579
I mean...

147
00:07:55,018 --> 00:07:57,921
Will you ever go out when you're you?

148
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:12,510
You said you'll knit a stitch
every time you miss him.

149
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:16,739
The color changed, so you must
have ran out the one before.

150
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,088
Looks like you miss him like crazy.

151
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:20,612
How many balls of yarn have you used?

152
00:08:22,342 --> 00:08:23,223
Here.

153
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:24,553
This is yours.

154
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:30,708
I didn't know people knit
dish-washing sponge too.

155
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:32,296
You're so mean.

156
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:37,322
Gosh. You're so frustrating.

157
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:41,111
Why are you so loyal to him...?

158
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:45,212
Goodness.

159
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:49,024
I can't believe she knit me
a dish-washing sponge.

160
00:08:55,592 --> 00:08:56,549
What are you doing?

161
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:57,732
What are you taking pictures of?

162
00:08:58,356 --> 00:08:59,680
Geez.

163
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:02,122
Segye, you're very dexterous.

164
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:04,352
The sponge you made me is so pretty.

165
00:09:04,497 --> 00:09:06,158
I want to brag about it
on my social media.

166
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:08,301
Geez.

167
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,374
My sponge. Great.

168
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:25,955
It's done.

169
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:32,851
Will this fit him though?

170
00:09:35,673 --> 00:09:37,220
Did I get it wrong?

171
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:41,110
Should have I made it smaller?

172
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,408
I miss you.

173
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:13,940
You're recovering well.

174
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:16,946
You scared me when you told me
the rate of success is five percent.

175
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:19,785
That was ten years ago.

176
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,431
Nowadays, it's at least...

177
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:24,185
...about 20 percent.

178
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,352
Then, it's a good thing...

179
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:28,058
...that I decided to do it now
and not back then.

180
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:30,143
You lived with that
condition for 10 years.

181
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:32,941
What made you decide to suddenly
have the surgery?

182
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:34,759
Whether I recognize people or not...

183
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:37,647
...doesn't matter to me anymore.

184
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:39,361
But...

185
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:41,896
...someone I know
cries about it all the time.

186
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,695
And that's an important issue to me.

187
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:48,022
I've known you for a long time...

188
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:50,553
...but this is the first time
I can actually see your face.

189
00:10:50,748 --> 00:10:52,324
What do you think now that you do?

190
00:10:52,668 --> 00:10:54,585
I'm happy to see you.

191
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:04,664
Hi.

192
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:07,734
Look like you've been doing well.

193
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:08,988
Yes, I have.

194
00:11:09,072 --> 00:11:09,849
Truly.

195
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:11,219
Nevertheless...

196
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:12,998
...you still have to take this test.

197
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,192
You're so strict.

198
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:16,478
I work hard when I'm paid well.

199
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:28,971
My mother.

200
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:34,774
My grandpa.

201
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:44,747
My father.

202
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,018
Sara.

203
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:06,142
You don't recognize him?

204
00:12:06,587 --> 00:12:07,579
Has this photo...

205
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:11,457
...been edited?

206
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:13,623
What are you talking about?

207
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:15,722
Is it obvious?

208
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:17,252
How can it not?

209
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:22,720
You look better in real life,
Jung Joohwan.

210
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,415
You did great.

211
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,989
You got all of them correct.

212
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:38,594
(Message from Yoo Woomi)

213
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:41,310
Segye has been doing well.

214
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:43,626
You're doing fine too, right?

215
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:13,671
Segye refuses to get out of the house.

216
00:13:13,964 --> 00:13:17,183
I'm afraid that something
might happen to her.

217
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:31,204
I don't want my last memory of you
to be your crying face.

218
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:34,966
Thus, I'm choosing to make
sure that doesn't happen.

219
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:37,934
I wanted to see you...

220
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,670
...but I thought you'd cry again
when you see me.

221
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:43,030
So I'll just watch you from afar...

222
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:44,856
...and leave afterward.

223
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:48,329
To tell you the truth, I'm scared.

224
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:51,741
I'm scared of a life without you.

225
00:14:53,129 --> 00:14:54,082
So...

226
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,801
...I'll come back again.

227
00:14:57,582 --> 00:14:59,397
Until I came back...

228
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:02,210
...you just have to wait for me.

229
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:06,344
No matter what...

230
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,516
...just keep on living.

231
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,781
Are you doing well?

232
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:12,967
Just like you told me to...

233
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,644
...I'm doing my best to keep on living.

234
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:34,975
That was such a long business trip.

235
00:16:36,485 --> 00:16:37,736
Where would you like to go?

236
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:39,204
To see my mom.

237
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:54,321
Do you like the ad?

238
00:16:54,892 --> 00:16:58,054
During your absence, she was responsible
for our company's sales.

239
00:16:58,551 --> 00:16:59,926
She was a hot issue.

240
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:02,224
She shot the ad just before she left,

241
00:17:02,348 --> 00:17:03,567
we got really lucky.

242
00:17:04,196 --> 00:17:05,089
Joohwan.

243
00:17:05,682 --> 00:17:06,558
Yes?

244
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:07,674
Is Han Segye...

245
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,008
...pretty?

246
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,045
Well...

247
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,674
...you can say that.

248
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,356
She's not my type, though.

249
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:16,420
I envy you.

250
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:17,631
You've actually seen her.

251
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:19,988
You'll see her soon. What's the big deal?

252
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:19,797
I'm back.

253
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:22,706
Mother.

254
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:31,921
You look lovely.

255
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:33,917
Be it ten years ago...

256
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,602
...or right now.

257
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:39,815
I aged a lot because of you.

258
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,648
Dojae.

259
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:18,195
I really like your seat.

260
00:19:18,345 --> 00:19:19,265
It makes me want it.

261
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,942
Are you back?

262
00:19:29,832 --> 00:19:31,973
So this is what my sister looks like.

263
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:35,561
I thought you look really scary.

264
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:37,201
But you're just...

265
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:38,886
...cute.

266
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:42,780
Are you trying to pick a fight
as soon as you got here?

267
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:43,733
No.

268
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:45,306
I'm here to see you.

269
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:50,047
Congratulations on your return to work.

270
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:54,365
It's too early for that.

271
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,735
Before I get back to work,

272
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,487
there's something I must do.

273
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:10,837
My brother is back.

274
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:12,379
You mean Seo Dojae?

275
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:14,508
Is he alright?

276
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,525
He looks absolutely normal.

277
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:22,166
It might actually be bad for me.

278
00:20:22,683 --> 00:20:24,144
I think...

279
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:27,178
...Han Segye might also return soon.

280
00:20:29,114 --> 00:20:31,640
The Seo Dojae I know
is that kind of person.

281
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:34,112
He never lets go if he wants something.

282
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:36,098
You're saying bad things about him,

283
00:20:36,227 --> 00:20:38,024
but your face says you're happy.

284
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:44,065
Then, what about you?

285
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,119
What are you going to do
to make a living from now on?

286
00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:50,415
It's not like you can
work part-time forever.

287
00:20:52,182 --> 00:20:53,407
I actually don't mind...

288
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,242
...if you don't want to work...

289
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,111
Since I have a lot of money.

290
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,639
Should I go to a graduate school?

291
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,021
Graduate school?

292
00:21:11,824 --> 00:21:14,525
What do you want to be this time?

293
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:18,278
I've given it some thought...

294
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:22,330
...I think becoming a judge
would suit me the best.

295
00:21:27,107 --> 00:21:27,973
That one...

296
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:30,463
...is extremely hard.

297
00:21:31,237 --> 00:21:32,082
Yes.

298
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,077
I know it won't be easy.

299
00:21:34,683 --> 00:21:36,345
It's been a while since I've studied.

300
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,900
Don't you think it'll take some time?

301
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:46,218
I must have not told you.

302
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,517
I graduated from Seoul
National University's law school.

303
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,457
Are you okay?

304
00:21:59,382 --> 00:22:00,497
Seoul National University...

305
00:22:01,018 --> 00:22:02,327
...Law School

306
00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:09,889
Did I surprise you?

307
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:11,937
No.

308
00:22:14,182 --> 00:22:15,658
Have some fish.

309
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:26,845
Try it.

310
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:33,373
I'm sure I've told you that I'm smart.

311
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,489
I didn't know that was what you meant.

312
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,624
Now I can see
why your mother was so opposed...

313
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:43,499
...to you becoming a priest.

314
00:22:44,913 --> 00:22:46,683
you can drop me off over there.

315
00:22:47,173 --> 00:22:50,096
If I get off too near to my house,
my family will make a fuss again.

316
00:22:51,252 --> 00:22:52,104
Why?

317
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:55,043
They've been asking me to introduce you.

318
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,658
Then...

319
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:58,813
...I'll go meet them.

320
00:23:00,187 --> 00:23:01,266
Are you okay with that?

321
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,502
Why?

322
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,791
Are you...

323
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:08,152
...ashamed to introduce me to them?

324
00:23:08,237 --> 00:23:10,112
No. I just...

325
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:12,255
...thought it'll make you feel pressured.

326
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:18,640
I'm not the one who should feel
pressured. It's you and your family.

327
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:20,755
Since you're meeting someone like me.

328
00:23:21,155 --> 00:23:23,923
I'm even driving you home
in a nice car like this.

329
00:23:33,337 --> 00:23:34,453
You're right.

330
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:36,888
Now that I think about it...

331
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:38,504
...I do feel a little bit pressured.

332
00:23:40,449 --> 00:23:43,276
How did I meet such an amazing
and admirable person...

333
00:23:43,861 --> 00:23:44,966
...like you?

334
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,110
I guess that just your luck...

335
00:23:49,457 --> 00:23:50,504
...and fate.

336
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:56,772
I can't believe you're talking
about things like luck and fate.

337
00:23:57,747 --> 00:23:59,747
Just hearing you say them is surprising.

338
00:24:02,163 --> 00:24:04,689
There'll be more things
you'd be surprised about.

339
00:24:04,774 --> 00:24:06,453
so stop being silly and get off.

340
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:07,568
I'm tired.

341
00:24:08,177 --> 00:24:09,035
Okay.

342
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,095
Mister...

343
00:24:12,272 --> 00:24:13,804
...you haven't paid for the ride.

344
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:25,443
Why?

345
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:27,692
Is it too much to ask for?

346
00:24:40,364 --> 00:24:41,359
Bye.

347
00:24:59,758 --> 00:25:01,586
How did I...

348
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:03,793
...become so bewitched by him?

349
00:25:37,242 --> 00:25:38,078
Hey there.

350
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,089
You can put it here.

351
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:46,582
You're ridiculous.

352
00:25:46,673 --> 00:25:48,060
I can't believe you made me do this.

353
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,547
Thanks for the compliment.

354
00:25:49,735 --> 00:25:51,193
When are you coming back to work?

355
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:52,642
I don't want to work.

356
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,707
Why don't you do it for me?

357
00:25:55,175 --> 00:25:57,126
Oh, dear me.

358
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:09,213
It's really true.

359
00:26:10,491 --> 00:26:12,705
Her complexion is too fair...

360
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:15,614
...and her lips are too red.

361
00:26:48,521 --> 00:26:49,916
(Those Who Read Books to You)

362
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:55,506
I love that these books are read
by different people.

363
00:26:55,673 --> 00:26:57,159
I've been enjoying the audiobooks.

364
00:26:57,357 --> 00:27:00,922
Don't you think the woman we hear often
sounds exactly like Han Segye?

365
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:03,123
Her voice is so pleasant to hear.

366
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,208
She sounds like the actress, Han Segye.

367
00:27:27,185 --> 00:27:28,796
Are you sure you don't
want me to come with you?

368
00:27:28,906 --> 00:27:30,320
You should get some rest.

369
00:27:30,405 --> 00:27:32,268
You can't follow me everywhere I go.

370
00:27:33,107 --> 00:27:35,613
I'm a little sad
now that you can recognize faces.

371
00:27:35,975 --> 00:27:38,427
We used to stick to each other,
but now you're doing fine on your own.

372
00:27:38,838 --> 00:27:40,140
Aren't you going to ask me
where I'm going?

373
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,329
That's obvious.

374
00:27:41,414 --> 00:27:43,089
Then, shouldn't you at least wish me luck?

375
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:44,741
The result is also obvious.

376
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,290
I also hope that's the case.

377
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,767
I'll go to the office and
get some things organized for you.

378
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:52,350
So you can relax until you return to work.

379
00:27:52,435 --> 00:27:53,317
Okay.

380
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:54,479
Thanks.

381
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:55,711
Mr. Seo.

382
00:27:55,814 --> 00:27:56,649
Yes.

383
00:27:56,868 --> 00:27:57,723
Good luck.

384
00:27:59,202 --> 00:28:00,115
Thanks.

385
00:28:06,262 --> 00:28:08,496
Yes. I'm going to the bookstore
to get some books.

386
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:12,012
I feel bad for only taking
Kingkang out in the front lawn.

387
00:28:12,097 --> 00:28:13,590
I want to take her out for a walk.

388
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:16,266
That's great. It's a good idea.

389
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:17,724
You should go out and get some fresh air.

390
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:18,929
I'm only going out for a while.

391
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:22,018
Gosh. Don't do that. Stay outside longer.

392
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:25,052
What if the neighbors saw me
and start a ruckus?

393
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:28,542
I'll handle it if it happens.

394
00:28:28,631 --> 00:28:30,285
So take your time...

395
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:32,811
...and stay out for as long as you want.

396
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,835
Don't you know that's my expertise?

397
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:36,467
All right.

398
00:28:37,123 --> 00:28:38,145
Bye.

399
00:28:40,672 --> 00:28:41,569
Let's go.

400
00:29:09,994 --> 00:29:10,886
Kingkang,

401
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:13,309
I'll be back soon.
Stay here quietly, okay?

402
00:29:49,953 --> 00:29:52,234
Does she not recognize me because
she hasn't seen me for a long time?

403
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:54,930
She's not barking.

404
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:25,019
Thank you.

405
00:31:39,783 --> 00:31:42,197
Kingkang, be a good girl.

406
00:31:42,923 --> 00:31:43,834
let's go.

407
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:49,424
No! Gosh.

408
00:31:57,204 --> 00:31:58,345
Thank you.

409
00:32:09,201 --> 00:32:10,324
My arm is getting tired.

410
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:23,685
So this is...

411
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:26,793
...what you look like.

412
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,853
I told you to not run away...

413
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:20,333
Can you really recognize me?

414
00:33:21,986 --> 00:33:23,086
For real?

415
00:33:23,475 --> 00:33:24,453
Seriously?

416
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:25,672
Yes.

417
00:33:25,897 --> 00:33:27,255
But how?

418
00:33:27,995 --> 00:33:29,597
How is that possible?

419
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,188
Didn't I promise you...

420
00:33:32,201 --> 00:33:33,612
...that I'll take care of it?

421
00:33:34,503 --> 00:33:36,889
If this condition makes you feel sad...

422
00:33:37,728 --> 00:33:39,624
...then I'll take care of everything.

423
00:33:39,709 --> 00:33:41,647
But you said it's incurable.

424
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:44,115
The success rate is low. That's all.

425
00:33:45,205 --> 00:33:46,295
How low?

426
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,489
Let's see...

427
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,115
About 20 percent?

428
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:52,013
It was 5 percent ten years ago.

429
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:53,176
You're insane!

430
00:33:53,261 --> 00:33:54,023
Ouch.

431
00:33:54,108 --> 00:33:55,269
You're crazy. That's insane.

432
00:33:55,354 --> 00:33:57,126
What if you died?

433
00:33:57,903 --> 00:33:59,888
You're the crazy one.

434
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:02,731
How were you going to live without me?

435
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:06,066
Why would you do such a thing
because of me? I'm nothing special.

436
00:34:06,151 --> 00:34:07,072
You?

437
00:34:08,234 --> 00:34:10,504
The woman I risked my life twice for.

438
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:15,951
Spend the rest of your life repaying me.

439
00:34:17,078 --> 00:34:18,688
Since I did it for you...

440
00:34:19,298 --> 00:34:20,652
...you should take the responsibility.

441
00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:21,752
Forever.

442
00:34:25,183 --> 00:34:27,113
I'll take the responsibility, forever.

443
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:31,616
I'll give you everything you want.

444
00:34:33,662 --> 00:34:34,904
You're going to regret saying that.

445
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,686
There is something
I've wanted to do with you.

446
00:34:40,471 --> 00:34:41,609
What is it?

447
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,473
What... What is it?

448
00:34:55,756 --> 00:34:57,050
What?

449
00:35:01,637 --> 00:35:03,039
Please spare my life.

450
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:05,230
It's me.

451
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:07,157
It's Okjeong.

452
00:35:19,044 --> 00:35:21,046
Are you okay? Aren't you tired?

453
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:21,860
Shh...

454
00:35:21,944 --> 00:35:22,780
Be quiet.

455
00:35:23,431 --> 00:35:25,278
I'm watching a movie right now.

456
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:28,048
Do you know how long I waited
to watch this with you?

457
00:35:30,102 --> 00:35:31,223
Look at me.

458
00:35:31,308 --> 00:35:33,441
I have a lifetime to look at you now.

459
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:36,150
I want you to look at me.

460
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:41,659
Seriously...

461
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,673
It was already hard enough
for me to hold back.

462
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,121
Did you really knit this yourself?

463
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:10,097
Yes, I did it myself.

464
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:11,346
All of them?

465
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:13,249
Yes, all of them.

466
00:36:16,553 --> 00:36:17,619
It fits perfectly.

467
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:18,968
That's a relief.

468
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:22,297
Looks like you thought of me all the time
except for when you were sleeping.

469
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,429
No, you're wrong. I also thought of you
while I was sleeping.

470
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,046
Why?

471
00:36:38,424 --> 00:36:39,409
It's nothing.

472
00:36:40,522 --> 00:36:42,203
I just want your scent on me.

473
00:36:43,804 --> 00:36:45,616
You don't have to worry about that.

474
00:36:46,565 --> 00:36:48,801
I thought the sweater as you...

475
00:36:49,047 --> 00:36:52,125
...and hugged it to sleep
whenever I missed you.

476
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:06,683
When you left the letter here...

477
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:10,039
...I ran to look for you.

478
00:37:11,902 --> 00:37:13,840
But you weren't there.

479
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:17,438
The day I ran away?

480
00:37:20,496 --> 00:37:22,987
I was not confident if I can handle
seeing your crying face.

481
00:37:23,882 --> 00:37:25,261
So that's why...

482
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:28,144
...I ran away that day.

483
00:37:35,195 --> 00:37:37,623
Is it really okay for me to do this?

484
00:37:40,517 --> 00:37:42,020
Being with you like this...

485
00:37:44,171 --> 00:37:45,729
...so shamelessly.

486
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:52,696
I'm the shameless one.

487
00:37:55,937 --> 00:37:57,815
I risked my life...

488
00:37:58,507 --> 00:38:00,376
...and now asking you
to take the responsibility of me.

489
00:38:03,174 --> 00:38:05,174
I regret making that choice.

490
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:09,312
I left you...

491
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:14,307
...and couldn't be with you
during the hardest time of your life.

492
00:38:17,282 --> 00:38:18,581
I regret that a lot.

493
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:24,064
Because of my choice...

494
00:38:25,457 --> 00:38:26,883
...I almost lost everyone...

495
00:38:27,437 --> 00:38:29,128
...including you and me.

496
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:34,408
I was too selfish.

497
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,311
No.

498
00:38:38,928 --> 00:38:40,405
You were just...

499
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,305
...in a lot of pain.

500
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:31,431
It's okay.

501
00:39:34,551 --> 00:39:36,058
I'm here now.

502
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:05,230
You better not run away.

503
00:40:05,453 --> 00:40:07,258
I promise I won't run away.

504
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:09,802
Forever.

505
00:40:11,678 --> 00:40:12,707
But...

506
00:40:13,017 --> 00:40:16,023
...you can leave anytime
if you want to run away.

507
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:19,090
I'll go and chase you.

508
00:40:19,981 --> 00:40:21,547
I won't stop until I catch you.

509
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:25,358
I'll come back for you.

510
00:40:26,345 --> 00:40:27,713
There's no need for that.

511
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:29,842
I'll go to you.

512
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:32,825
So...

513
00:40:35,259 --> 00:40:36,578
...wait for me there.

514
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,484
Hi, Woomi.

515
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:49,084
I'm coming back to Seoul.

516
00:41:49,876 --> 00:41:50,775
I just came back...

517
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,092
...from seeing her.

518
00:41:53,651 --> 00:41:54,639
Segye?

519
00:41:54,784 --> 00:41:55,630
Yes.

520
00:41:56,795 --> 00:41:57,978
How is she doing?

521
00:41:58,393 --> 00:41:59,297
She...

522
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,429
...wasn't doing very well.

523
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,116
That's right. I thought so.

524
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,342
Are you okay?

525
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,203
She left you.

526
00:42:13,342 --> 00:42:14,568
Are you still okay with that?

527
00:42:14,653 --> 00:42:15,488
No.

528
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:18,337
You're wrong.

529
00:42:20,502 --> 00:42:21,589
That's not true.

530
00:42:24,392 --> 00:42:25,473
One day.

531
00:42:26,895 --> 00:42:28,597
I'll tell you about it One day.

532
00:42:30,011 --> 00:42:32,926
You called to ask me
because you're worried, right?

533
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:35,666
You're afraid that I might be opposed
to you seeing her.

534
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:36,738
People...

535
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,878
...has misunderstood Segye a lot.

536
00:42:40,831 --> 00:42:42,219
But she's not who they think she is.

537
00:42:43,537 --> 00:42:45,823
The circumstances she's in
doesn't allow her to explain herself.

538
00:42:49,555 --> 00:42:51,213
Do what you want.

539
00:42:52,798 --> 00:42:56,783
I will no longer meddle
with your life choices.

540
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,167
There must be a good reason
behind every choice that you took.

541
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:05,446
I'll just watch and
lend a hand when you need me.

542
00:43:05,602 --> 00:43:06,452
Mother...

543
00:43:07,584 --> 00:43:09,607
I'm just glad that you're back alive.

544
00:43:11,164 --> 00:43:13,239
Do what you want. Whatever they might be.

545
00:43:15,221 --> 00:43:16,283
Thank you.

546
00:43:20,203 --> 00:43:22,697
When do you plan to get back to work?

547
00:43:36,466 --> 00:43:37,917
Welcome back, CEO Seo.

548
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,417
-Welcome back, CEO Seo.
-Welcome back, CEO Seo.

549
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:43,002
How have you all been?

550
00:43:45,894 --> 00:43:47,455
(T'road Airline Business Plan)

551
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:51,463
Now, then...

552
00:43:53,379 --> 00:43:55,238
Let's start our overdue meeting.

553
00:44:10,622 --> 00:44:11,697
Hey.

554
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:13,113
How have you been doing?

555
00:44:13,477 --> 00:44:14,432
Not good.

556
00:44:14,592 --> 00:44:15,813
Do you think I'll be doing well?

557
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:18,953
Woomi bullied me so much
while you were gone.

558
00:44:19,038 --> 00:44:20,031
She's angry at me a lot too.

559
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:20,986
Hey!

560
00:44:21,238 --> 00:44:22,738
When did I ever bully you?

561
00:44:22,823 --> 00:44:23,664
See?

562
00:44:23,749 --> 00:44:25,285
She yelled and swore at me.

563
00:44:25,384 --> 00:44:27,844
I swear. It was hell without you.

564
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:30,219
He needs a good beating.

565
00:44:30,308 --> 00:44:31,691
I've been too nice to you lately.

566
00:44:31,776 --> 00:44:34,142
Come here you. Come here.

567
00:44:36,053 --> 00:44:37,180
You deserve to be beaten.

568
00:44:37,265 --> 00:44:40,545
You deserve it for saying
stupid things like that.

569
00:44:41,447 --> 00:44:42,452
See?

570
00:44:42,705 --> 00:44:44,844
She hits and abuses me.

571
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:48,544
I hate Yoo Woomi the most.

572
00:44:49,292 --> 00:44:50,561
You're all I have.

573
00:44:51,424 --> 00:44:53,175
I finally feel like I'm back.

574
00:44:53,266 --> 00:44:54,939
You lost so much weight.

575
00:44:55,265 --> 00:44:58,193
I was able to survive
thanks to your mom's side dishes.

576
00:44:58,853 --> 00:45:00,599
Please thank her for me.

577
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,023
You tell her yourself.

578
00:45:02,192 --> 00:45:04,032
My mom misses you so much.

579
00:45:04,117 --> 00:45:07,489
She's sad she has no one
to play Go-Stop with.

580
00:45:07,573 --> 00:45:09,778
I better go there and
make her lose some money.

581
00:45:09,863 --> 00:45:10,734
Hey!

582
00:45:11,259 --> 00:45:13,755
What should we do after we unpacked?

583
00:45:14,783 --> 00:45:16,574
It's been a while, so why don't
we have a drinking party?

584
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:17,407
Okay?

585
00:45:17,491 --> 00:45:19,192
No. I have somewhere to be.

586
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,282
Did you hear that?

587
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:23,589
He does that all the time
ever since he started dating.

588
00:45:24,198 --> 00:45:26,267
You traitor!

589
00:45:27,247 --> 00:45:29,789
-It's just the two of us then...
-Sorry.

590
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:31,506
I need to go somewhere too.

591
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,014
Look at you two.

592
00:45:35,272 --> 00:45:37,129
Do you think I don't have
anyone to hang out with?

593
00:45:37,521 --> 00:45:39,061
I have somewhere to be as well, okay?

594
00:45:41,577 --> 00:45:42,587
Geez.

595
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:45,969
Hi, honey...

596
00:45:46,103 --> 00:45:47,293
It's me.

597
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:48,880
Are you busy later?

598
00:45:50,027 --> 00:45:51,079
You are?

599
00:45:51,164 --> 00:45:52,947
-Geez.
-Are you sure?

600
00:45:53,031 --> 00:45:54,984
-Anyway, what about that room?
-What?

601
00:45:55,069 --> 00:45:56,982
What happened to that room
with the framed photos?

602
00:45:57,067 --> 00:45:58,303
It was empty.

603
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,373
I was planning to go pick you up.

604
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,620
I thought you would,
so I came here instead.

605
00:46:32,446 --> 00:46:34,240
I've always only been receiving them.

606
00:46:36,012 --> 00:46:37,821
I don't know how to react to this.

607
00:46:38,018 --> 00:46:39,557
It's the first time
I've ever received flowers.

608
00:46:39,668 --> 00:46:41,612
As someone who has received
countless of them...

609
00:46:41,696 --> 00:46:42,987
...it's not really a big deal.

610
00:46:43,376 --> 00:46:45,693
Just receive them with a big smile.

611
00:46:47,048 --> 00:46:49,481
You sure know how to drive me crazy.

612
00:46:54,224 --> 00:46:55,124
I...

613
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:56,977
...became the CEO.

614
00:46:57,896 --> 00:46:59,313
Today is my first day...

615
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:00,746
...as the CEO.

616
00:47:01,126 --> 00:47:01,987
Really?

617
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:04,630
Good thing I bought the flowers.

618
00:47:06,006 --> 00:47:07,735
What do you want as a gift?

619
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,594
Do you want to go eat some ramyun?

620
00:47:16,848 --> 00:47:17,856
At my home.

621
00:47:59,265 --> 00:48:00,559
The photos...

622
00:48:01,702 --> 00:48:02,963
...are all here.

623
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,816
After you disappeared...

624
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,654
...I want to at least
keep one picture of you.

625
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:13,876
But I didn't know
which one was the real you.

626
00:48:15,321 --> 00:48:16,896
But then it hit me...

627
00:48:18,017 --> 00:48:19,339
...they are all you.

628
00:48:21,415 --> 00:48:22,251
So I took them all.

629
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,268
Then...

630
00:48:32,188 --> 00:48:33,410
...you've seen all of them.

631
00:48:34,565 --> 00:48:35,743
My faces.

632
00:48:36,536 --> 00:48:37,617
Yes, I did.

633
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:41,586
I was happy...

634
00:48:42,408 --> 00:48:43,680
...that I could see all of them.

635
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:47,073
It'll probably...

636
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:50,057
...be harder from now on.

637
00:48:51,075 --> 00:48:54,850
You can recognize the real me now.

638
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,918
I seem to only make you suffer.

639
00:49:02,914 --> 00:49:04,090
Don't worry.

640
00:49:04,558 --> 00:49:07,156
I'm not in love with
what's on the outside.

641
00:49:12,847 --> 00:49:13,696
But...

642
00:49:17,043 --> 00:49:18,087
...I'm in love...

643
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:20,514
...with what's inside.

644
00:49:25,142 --> 00:49:28,027
How can an amazing person
like you come into my life?

645
00:49:29,197 --> 00:49:30,054
No.

646
00:49:31,915 --> 00:49:33,644
It's you who came to me.

647
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:36,572
You're the one...

648
00:49:37,593 --> 00:49:38,556
...who came into my life.

649
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,799
(Those Who Read Books to You)

650
00:49:54,457 --> 00:49:55,789
How did you know?

651
00:49:55,873 --> 00:49:57,072
That I'm doing this?

652
00:49:57,404 --> 00:49:58,283
Well...

653
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,919
Woomi might have been your friend,

654
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:03,904
but she's also my friend now.

655
00:50:04,718 --> 00:50:06,276
And Eunho is like a younger brother to me.

656
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,237
Once they befriend someone...

657
00:50:09,553 --> 00:50:11,980
...they tend to be loyal till the end.

658
00:50:12,065 --> 00:50:13,319
You're right.

659
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:17,774
I listen to this
every time I miss hearing your voice.

660
00:50:18,525 --> 00:50:21,717
I think I wrote about 30 comments.

661
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:26,001
Anyway, when you invited
me over for some ramyun,

662
00:50:26,086 --> 00:50:28,064
I didn't know you meant it literally.

663
00:50:29,094 --> 00:50:29,994
What?

664
00:50:30,371 --> 00:50:31,782
Were you expecting something else?

665
00:50:32,987 --> 00:50:33,997
Not really.

666
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,839
That's exactly what
lustful eyes looked like.

667
00:50:38,923 --> 00:50:40,066
You're totally wrong.

668
00:50:40,151 --> 00:50:42,086
Then, you should have been more subtle.

669
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,803
Gosh. I told you, you're wrong.

670
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:45,887
Gosh. I'm totally right.

671
00:50:51,005 --> 00:50:52,226
The ramyun was good.

672
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:57,070
You're really good at making ramyun.

673
00:50:57,155 --> 00:50:58,446
You should spend the night here.

674
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:02,668
Why? You don't want to?

675
00:51:02,753 --> 00:51:05,166
Why would you suddenly say that
while eating ramyun?

676
00:51:05,251 --> 00:51:07,885
Are there steps to say that or something?

677
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:09,972
I thought you said it's all about timing.

678
00:51:14,419 --> 00:51:16,868
Anyway, there's something
I've been curious about.

679
00:51:20,098 --> 00:51:21,555
What's that about?

680
00:51:25,747 --> 00:51:26,890
Can't you tell?

681
00:51:27,373 --> 00:51:28,481
She's my girlfriend.

682
00:51:29,682 --> 00:51:31,715
How's that your girlfriend?
It should be me.

683
00:51:36,436 --> 00:51:37,763
I have a wish.

684
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,347
A wish?

685
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,840
What is it?

686
00:51:41,222 --> 00:51:43,287
Tell me. I'll grant you anything.

687
00:51:43,724 --> 00:51:44,994
I want to watch a movie.

688
00:51:45,457 --> 00:51:46,470
One you starred in.

689
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:47,444
A movie?

690
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:49,135
Again?

691
00:51:49,676 --> 00:51:50,829
Sure. Let's watch it.

692
00:51:50,914 --> 00:51:52,665
-Which one should we watch?
-That's not what I meant.

693
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,320
It's boring to re-watch
the ones we already seen.

694
00:51:55,984 --> 00:51:57,388
I want to watch a new movie...

695
00:51:57,703 --> 00:51:58,823
...that you starred in.

696
00:52:01,715 --> 00:52:05,586
Just listening to your voice
isn't good enough for me anymore.

697
00:52:10,779 --> 00:52:12,146
Will you do that for me?

698
00:52:17,258 --> 00:52:19,015
My Segye is so kind.

699
00:52:20,633 --> 00:52:21,761
You're so obedient.

700
00:53:24,509 --> 00:53:25,669
Sir...

701
00:53:25,956 --> 00:53:27,342
...I'm Yoo Woomi.

702
00:53:27,516 --> 00:53:29,165
I'm Yoo Woomi of World Entertainment.

703
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:30,922
Don't you trust my instinct?

704
00:53:31,047 --> 00:53:35,623
You've proven that you have good instinct
through Han Segye.

705
00:53:36,134 --> 00:53:38,408
But this is a huge project.

706
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,387
We can't just cast any actors.

707
00:53:41,487 --> 00:53:45,353
Plus, the director requested
for an experienced actress.

708
00:53:45,596 --> 00:53:46,570
Exactly.

709
00:53:46,822 --> 00:53:49,091
That's why you should trust me.

710
00:53:50,113 --> 00:53:52,597
She must be quite the actress...

711
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:54,672
...if you're talking so highly of her.

712
00:53:57,407 --> 00:53:59,650
Fine. Sure. Let's just go for her.

713
00:54:00,263 --> 00:54:01,520
Let's meet her.

714
00:54:01,978 --> 00:54:03,520
You will not regret this.

715
00:54:05,151 --> 00:54:06,933
I told her to be on time.

716
00:54:09,103 --> 00:54:10,359
Hi...

717
00:54:11,364 --> 00:54:12,847
Hello, sir.

718
00:54:14,494 --> 00:54:15,856
It's been a while.

719
00:54:15,941 --> 00:54:17,173
What do you think?

720
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:20,375
She's a very experienced actress.

721
00:54:24,072 --> 00:54:25,325
Let's sign the contract.

722
00:54:26,401 --> 00:54:27,569
Right now.

723
00:54:58,571 --> 00:54:59,423
Cut!

724
00:54:59,698 --> 00:55:00,578
Okay.

725
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:05,326
You did well.

726
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:07,926
-How did I do?
-Is that even a question?

727
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,827
You did so well,

728
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:11,990
Actress Han.

729
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:15,921
You have no idea how much I missed this.

730
00:55:16,006 --> 00:55:18,477
She can retire and come
back as she pleases.

731
00:55:18,562 --> 00:55:21,012
It must be nice to be able to do that.

732
00:55:21,172 --> 00:55:23,093
Why did she even retire
in the first place?

733
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,908
It was such a short break.

734
00:55:25,098 --> 00:55:25,939
Those little...

735
00:55:26,024 --> 00:55:27,122
Excuse me.

736
00:55:28,171 --> 00:55:29,044
It's fine.

737
00:55:44,045 --> 00:55:45,289
What can I do?

738
00:55:45,421 --> 00:55:46,742
I deserve it.

739
00:55:47,116 --> 00:55:49,436
I should take responsibility
for my actions.

740
00:55:51,138 --> 00:55:52,368
Han Segye.

741
00:55:53,836 --> 00:55:55,003
Let's wrap up for today.

742
00:55:55,088 --> 00:55:56,046
Already?

743
00:55:56,131 --> 00:55:58,604
What do you mean?
We get to finish early thanks to you.

744
00:55:58,707 --> 00:55:59,614
Also...

745
00:55:59,973 --> 00:56:00,840
...over there...

746
00:56:01,384 --> 00:56:02,660
...your boyfriend came.

747
00:56:03,139 --> 00:56:04,020
What?

748
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:15,225
Your "Uncle" is one strange man.

749
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:17,198
If he follows you around longer,

750
00:56:17,283 --> 00:56:18,853
his company will go under.

751
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,785
-What is this?
-Your contract.

752
00:56:28,316 --> 00:56:30,095
(Spokesmodel Contract)

753
00:56:32,574 --> 00:56:34,649
I'm giving you this offer
as the CEO of the company.

754
00:56:35,501 --> 00:56:36,859
Let's sign the contract.

755
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,500
Be T'road Airline's spokesmodel.

756
00:56:38,585 --> 00:56:41,001
You should give this to Woomi, not me.

757
00:56:41,086 --> 00:56:42,956
She's kind of uptight.

758
00:56:43,377 --> 00:56:45,607
She refused to even look at it
even though we know each other.

759
00:56:46,479 --> 00:56:48,037
I need my girlfriend's help.

760
00:56:48,517 --> 00:56:50,747
Put in a good word for me.

761
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,365
Is this a solicitation?

762
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,320
If it were, are you going to report me?

763
00:56:55,826 --> 00:56:56,867
Do you have a pen?

764
00:56:59,195 --> 00:57:00,067
Here.

765
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:02,946
(CEO, Seo Dojae)

766
00:57:04,038 --> 00:57:05,497
(Han Segye)

767
00:57:09,598 --> 00:57:10,666
Mr. Sponsor,

768
00:57:11,038 --> 00:57:13,209
I'll do my utmost best to please you.

769
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:16,070
What did I say?

770
00:57:16,757 --> 00:57:20,157
Haven't I told you to read the contract
carefully before you sign it?

771
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:21,456
What?

772
00:57:24,914 --> 00:57:28,257
The employee must accompany the employer
on business trips upon request.

773
00:57:28,342 --> 00:57:32,799
While accompanying,
the employee must wear a red dress.

774
00:57:32,884 --> 00:57:34,824
Again? When?

775
00:57:35,045 --> 00:57:36,705
Well, whenever.

776
00:57:37,561 --> 00:57:39,115
When does the shooting end?

777
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,152
Why are you still obsessed
over red dresses?

778
00:57:41,237 --> 00:57:42,976
There's no need for that anymore.

779
00:57:43,437 --> 00:57:44,766
The truth is,

780
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:48,050
my ideal type of women
is those who wear red dresses.

781
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:51,260
You've got to be kidding.

782
00:57:52,276 --> 00:57:54,747
Your outfit today is close enough.

783
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,866
This is pink.

784
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:58,667
-Sure.
-It's pink.

785
00:57:58,751 --> 00:57:59,663
Sure.

786
00:59:33,817 --> 00:59:35,393
Look at that face.

787
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,763
Or that face.

788
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:47,831
I could turn into either of them.

789
00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:51,833
Will you still want to be with me?

790
00:59:52,987 --> 00:59:54,558
We've already talked about this.

791
00:59:55,831 --> 00:59:57,011
Bet your life...

792
00:59:57,421 --> 00:59:58,369
...on me.

794
01:00:30,152 --> 01:00:32,188
Come out. Let's go on a date.

795
01:00:32,273 --> 01:00:34,034
Mr. Han Segye's Boyfriend.

796
01:00:34,244 --> 01:00:35,560
I'll call you when I'm done.

797
01:00:35,645 --> 01:00:37,124
Or not.

798
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:39,909
He's so considerate of me.

799
01:00:39,994 --> 01:00:42,296
He calls me immediately
once he gets off work.

800
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:44,939
Are you bragging in front of me?

801
01:00:45,024 --> 01:00:46,524
Do you have a boyfriend?

802
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,004
She does.

803
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,965
So now...

804
01:00:51,562 --> 01:00:52,454
...love me...

805
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:55,342
...and yourself.
