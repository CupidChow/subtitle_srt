1
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:43,462
Do I really have to go to this thing?

2
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:45,062
Why? What is it now?

3
00:00:45,147 --> 00:00:47,733
The director can accept
the reward on my behalf.

4
00:00:47,824 --> 00:00:50,277
Why would the director do that
on your behalf?

5
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:53,466
You disappeared once a month
until the filming was over.

6
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:55,756
You're lucky he didn't sue you.

7
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:58,425
-Then you can...
-Fat chance.

8
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:02,796
Your appearance and your photos
can make pots of money.

9
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:06,727
I guess I'm nothing but a product.

10
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:09,861
Don't play the victim. It won't work.

11
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:15,594
I've seen you pull that trick constantly
since high school.

12
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:16,974
Don't forget.

13
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:19,873
They're giving you that award
under the condition that you show up.

14
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,781
I'm not getting the award for showing up.

15
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:23,482
I'm getting it because
I'm a great actress.

16
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:24,880
That's a fact.

17
00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:28,544
I'm just getting a strange feeling.

18
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:30,487
What? Is it that time of the month?

19
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:32,672
Isn't it one week later?

20
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:33,614
That's right.

21
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:35,402
So look up ahead or you'll crash the car.

22
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:36,787
-What?
-Green light.

23
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:38,465
Jeez, you scared me.

24
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:10,102
The 2018 White Bear Film Award
for Best Actress.

25
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:13,889
The last year's award winner Kang Sora,
will be presenting the award.

26
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:15,840
Hello, I'm Kang Sora.

27
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,158
I will announce the winner right away.

28
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:21,311
The Best Actress Award of 2018...

29
00:02:21,946 --> 00:02:23,953
This is making me nervous too.

30
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,197
(Han Segye)

31
00:02:25,282 --> 00:02:28,503
Congratulations to Han Segye,
"Searching for Your Earth."

32
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:38,605
In “Searching for Your Earth,” Han Segye
portrayed the character “Lee Haeyoung”...

33
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:42,345
...who suffers from sociophobia
after losing her lover in an accident.

34
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,716
With her subtle portrayal
of the character's complex personality...

35
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:49,786
...she received appraisals for adding
another unique female character...

36
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,029
...in Korean film history.

37
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,430
Segye...?

38
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:13,308
Segye!

39
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,249
What?

40
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:25,469
What's going on?

41
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:11,799
Are you okay?

42
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,867
Damn it! I left a shoe behind...

43
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,659
It's a limited edition!

44
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:33,014
I left my shoe. Oh for crying out loud!

45
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,332
-Gosh, I'm so pissed!
-Segye!

46
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,337
You'll tear the dress apart!

47
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,790
Oh my god!

48
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,504
Hey, calm down.

49
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,344
You'll rip the dress.

50
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:46,919
Let me go!

51
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,657
I was 20 years old when it first happened.

52
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:54,778
It was during the trip to Europe
that I went with Woomi.

53
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:21,181
I thought it was a dream.

54
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:31,443
I thought I'd wake up from the dream
if someone called my name.

55
00:06:36,357 --> 00:06:38,611
I've suddenly grown old overnight.

56
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,565
And it wasn't a dream.

57
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:01,696
Is she okay?

58
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,149
Oh my god! Someone call 911!

59
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,828
It was my first day in purgatory.

60
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,847
The last thing that I remember is a man.

61
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:12,064
The shirt stained with his blood.

62
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:15,140
Maybe…

63
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,793
...I'm still paying the price for that.

64
00:07:23,124 --> 00:07:23,967
(Best Actor Award Han Segye)

65
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:27,407
Welcome to Entertainment Inside
where we always bring you...

66
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:29,461
...the hottest news in entertainment.

67
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:31,498
We have a shocking news from the start.

68
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:35,192
Last week, during the presentation
of the award for best actress...

69
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:38,029
...Han Segye suddenly ran out
of the hall.

70
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:40,546
The only response given by her agency
over the past week...

71
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:43,457
...is that they're still checking
what happened.

72
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,291
What are your thoughts, Mr. Kim?

73
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,062
She bolted again.

74
00:07:47,147 --> 00:07:50,429
She is something else.

75
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:53,258
Some say she wasn't satisfied
with the Best Actress Award...

76
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:54,439
What about my shoe?

77
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:56,903
I can't ask them to find it.
It's too embarrassing.

78
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:59,595
I heard she played hard to get
with the broadcasting company...

79
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,381
...when they asked for her attendance.

80
00:08:01,684 --> 00:08:04,391
Apparently, she not only does that
with broadcasting companies...

81
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:05,992
...but also with men.

82
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:08,742
After all, her love life's known
to be very complicated.

83
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:10,890
I heard she doesn't care
about race or age.

84
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:13,242
I wonder if she doesn't run away
from her date?

85
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,715
I bet she does.

86
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:19,346
Look what happened. She ran away
during the award ceremony.

87
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:22,235
Ditching a date would be nothing.

88
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:28,202
Hey, did you hear what he just said?

89
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,505
That's hilarious.

90
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:34,610
How can I ditch a date
when I've never had one?

91
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:37,644
How am I supposed to go out on dates
when I'm like this?

92
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:43,017
I guess I don't have a choice.

93
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:46,950
I should retire.

94
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:50,189
Are you serious? You're at it again.

95
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:51,593
Again!

96
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:01,012
I think Han Segye is...

97
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:02,356
Do you have money?

98
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,107
Money? What money?

99
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:06,368
Do you need money? How much?

100
00:09:06,453 --> 00:09:07,516
Not for me but for yourself.

101
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,504
You'll have to pay penalties
for contract violations.

102
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:13,032
Hey, you don't have to worry
about that at all.

103
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:18,290
She has tons of penalties
to pay right now anyway.

104
00:09:21,215 --> 00:09:23,015
-You can sell this house.
-Is it 100 million won?

105
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,529
That should be enough to take care of it.

106
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:26,162
How much do you have
in your bank account?

107
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:27,772
Hey, Ryu Eunho.

108
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:31,043
Are you hexing me to go
bankrupt or something?

109
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:32,910
That's ridiculous.

110
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:35,456
I'm about to enter a seminary.
I would never hex anyone.

111
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,488
Then find your way to God right now.

112
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:40,805
Go ask him why he's doing this to me.

113
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,587
I'm just worried about you.

114
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:46,017
You shouldn't run away
from reality without a plan.

115
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:48,696
I can't believe I let you live
just because you're my friend.

116
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:50,817
I should send you to God right now.

117
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:52,031
Calm down.

118
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:56,149
There's a rumor going around
that Han Segye has a hidden child.

119
00:09:56,234 --> 00:09:58,803
Which is why we prepared this.

120
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:02,408
It's an exclusive footage obtained
by Entertainment Inside.

121
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:03,339
Take a look.

122
00:10:03,424 --> 00:10:06,006
That footage was taken...

123
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:10,392
...when she suddenly vanished
for a week during her last drama shoot.

124
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:13,929
That's two months ago, right?

125
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,991
Oh yeah...

126
00:10:16,344 --> 00:10:19,107
It's from two months ago when she turned
into a grade-schooler...

127
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,056
(Reporter Park)

128
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:27,469
One, two, three, four, five...

129
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,085
There's good news and bad news.

130
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,601
Which one do you want to hear first?

131
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:36,369
The bad news.

132
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:39,423
We've lost 13 commercials so far.

133
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:44,507
I had that many commercials?
My career's on a roll.

134
00:10:45,347 --> 00:10:46,413
What's the good news?

135
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:50,229
Just now, we received...

136
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:53,900
...two new commercial offers
for baby diapers and formula.

137
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:56,842
I should go check my bank balance.

138
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:59,614
Hey, it's not so bad
if you think about it.

139
00:10:59,698 --> 00:11:02,681
It's a great company
that makes products...

140
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:04,923
...for babies with rare diseases.

141
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:09,132
I should to the countryside
to farm with my mom...

142
00:11:09,787 --> 00:11:12,668
...take my puppy around for walks
and live like a Confucian scholar.

143
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:15,825
How much does farmland cost these days?

144
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,654
Let's move on to Hollywood stars.

145
00:11:17,873 --> 00:11:23,040
Recently, Brad Pitt revealed
that he's suffering from face blindness...

146
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:26,229
Hey! Han Segye!

147
00:11:55,856 --> 00:11:57,866
It's difficult to terminate
the contract right away.

148
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,358
Han Segye is unreachable at the moment.

149
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:02,149
What should we eat for lunch?

150
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:03,851
Are you even listening?

151
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:06,799
Spicy sausage stew or ox bone soup?
Which one do you want?

152
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:10,895
If we lose this code-share agreement,
you and I will lose our jobs.

153
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:12,901
Then we won't have any lunch money.

154
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:15,666
Spicy sausage stew is nice,
but the smell clings to the clothes.

155
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,823
Chief Seo, this is a serious matter.

156
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,134
There are talks about you
among the board members.

157
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:23,134
It's serious for you but not for me.

158
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:24,571
I'm the son of the chairwoman.

159
00:12:24,754 --> 00:12:28,289
What are they going to do?
Kick me out of my own house?

160
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:30,848
Now is not the time to be charming.

161
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:35,477
You're right.

162
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,958
I might lose my appetite before lunch.

163
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:41,607
Waist angle at 90 degree...

164
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:48,878
The issue regarding Han Segye is
actually a good thing.

165
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:50,806
Strategic Planning decided to go with her.

166
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:54,214
He's a poor judge of character.

167
00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:57,942
How will he run any business?

168
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:03,283
It's so obvious that he doesn't have
the brains for business.

169
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,773
That's why people talked about him
in the last shareholders' meeting

170
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:10,876
Words are going around that Chief Seo is
still inexperienced to lead the group.

171
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,429
Even if he's part of the owner family,
he's no match against a veteran like you.

172
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:16,825
Which is why the Chairman
only gave him the chief title.

173
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:18,525
And keeps an eye on him.

174
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:21,754
That kid is so arrogant too.

175
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:24,823
Always asking a busy man like me
to come and go.

176
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:28,356
He should just mind his own...

177
00:13:29,223 --> 00:13:30,201
...business!

178
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:31,835
Hello, Chief!

179
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,993
Director Kim Hongwoo is in the middle,
with Baek Sangyong on the left...

180
00:13:38,077 --> 00:13:39,743
...and Seo Moosuk on the right.

181
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,325
Hello. How are you?

182
00:13:57,063 --> 00:13:59,345
-Long time no see, Director...
-On the right.

183
00:14:01,394 --> 00:14:02,230
...Kim.

184
00:14:02,314 --> 00:14:04,160
Oh, yes.

185
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:06,705
Are you doing well?

186
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:08,820
Seems like you're working out these days.

187
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:10,932
You look much younger.
I almost didn't recognize you.

188
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,738
Oh please.

189
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:20,167
I get older everyday
because of the trouble you caused.

190
00:14:20,748 --> 00:14:22,803
The new plane we purchased is the problem.

191
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:25,733
It was expected to work
this month after maintenance…

192
00:14:32,632 --> 00:14:34,667
Because of the Strategic Planning team...

193
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:38,876
...there will be a setback
in this month's flight schedule.

194
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:43,430
The Chairman will hear about this.

195
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,181
If the code-share agreement
gets delayed because of this…

196
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:49,220
...a lot of complaints will be raised
within the company.

197
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:52,818
I guess you're probably right.

198
00:14:52,903 --> 00:14:56,273
Yes. The Strategic Planning team
will have to be responsible…

199
00:14:56,381 --> 00:14:58,243
I guess ox bone soup would be better.

200
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:01,598
I should eat spicy sausage stew
on the weekends.

201
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,351
It smells terrible, after all.

202
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:08,371
It'll take time to remove the smell.

203
00:15:08,455 --> 00:15:09,288
Excuse me?

204
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:11,581
You're joking right now?

205
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:13,025
In this situation?

206
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,317
Food? How can you think about food?

207
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:17,032
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

208
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:19,471
Seeing that you're on the edge,
it looks like you haven't eaten.

209
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:26,151
You should get some lunch.

210
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:28,928
Try to eat something that doesn't stink.

211
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,168
It's impolite to emit a bad smell.

212
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,567
Look, Chief Seo!

213
00:15:35,115 --> 00:15:37,492
Buy a new plane with this after lunch.

214
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:41,423
It shouldn't be a problem
since it's my personal card.

215
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,965
There's no limit on this credit card.

216
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:48,420
Please excuse me.
I'm going to get some ox bone soup.

217
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,198
What a guy.

218
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:02,227
I can only use money
to put people like him down.

219
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:04,861
Why? Do you think I'm shallow?

220
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,527
You have more than just money.

221
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:10,906
Educational background,
looks, character, and so on.

222
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:15,362
Why not mention my looks first?
I like that part the most.

223
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:26,826
Nice to meet you here like this.
Chief Seo Dojae.

224
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,024
I didn't know you were interested
in this this kind of thing.

225
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:33,598
What are you trying to be now?

226
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:36,329
A CEO who's good at her job.

227
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:40,514
Do you think of your work
as a hobby, Chief of T'road?

228
00:16:40,884 --> 00:16:43,962
Easy there now. Are you trying to eat me?

229
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:46,169
That's a scary thought.

230
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:49,437
I might get an upset stomach
if I eat anything I want.

231
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:51,572
You're getting sassier as you get older.

232
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:54,290
Don't you find me cute when I'm sassy?

233
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:06,221
Forget about adding new routes.
You should change your spokesmodel first.

234
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:08,502
Grandpa's furious.

235
00:17:09,977 --> 00:17:12,583
As for me, I appreciate your mistakes.

236
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,357
Grandpa doesn't overlook mistakes
just because you're family, you know.

237
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,376
I do know.

238
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:20,155
You're not related to him by blood
and yet you're CEO.

239
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:22,278
He's a very sophisticated man, isn't he?

240
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:25,182
Even if it's just a low-cost airline,
how could he entrust it to you?

241
00:17:25,872 --> 00:17:28,481
Dojae, please don't get sick.

242
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,349
I'll be the one suffering
if you get sick.

243
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:31,981
I already have a lot of work to do.

244
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:35,572
Yeah, you look pretty tired.
You should take a break.

245
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,557
If you want to take a break,
let me know anytime.

246
00:17:37,877 --> 00:17:40,667
Your job would be child's play for me.

247
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:48,373
Passengers taking the flight
to Jeju Island, please head to zone C.

248
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,544
I'll go now. Take it easy.

249
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:02,258
Do I look crazy? I won't take it easy
for your sake.

250
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,584
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

251
00:18:05,286 --> 00:18:07,009
Flight to to Jeju Island, right?

252
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:10,006
The flight is at 1:00 PM.
Please go to Gate 7.

253
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:11,657
It's to the right.

254
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:13,207
Enjoy your flight

(Special Customer Service by the CEO)

256

It's a jungle front and back.

257
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,642
The ones in front wants a piece of me.

258
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:25,553
The ones in the back
wants to tear me apart.

259
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:28,930
The flight to Jeju Island is at 1:00 PM.
Please go to Gate 7.

260
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:30,706
-Okay.
-Turn right and go straight.

261
00:18:32,205 --> 00:18:34,386
What do you need to do
in this case, Joohwan?

262
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:39,172
Find out where Han Segye is
by any means necessary.

263
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:41,163
Find her and make her fix everything.

264
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,580
Does she think it will all go away
if she goes into hiding?

265
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:53,998
So naive.

267
00:19:03,974 --> 00:19:05,073
You look so lovely.

That's it. Zoom in.

269
00:19:11,362 --> 00:19:13,162
One more time.

270
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:15,857
One, two, three... Okay.

271
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:19,273
Okay, close-up shot.

272
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:20,467
One, two...

273
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,354
More. A little more.

274
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,928
More?

275
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:27,843
Look more pitiful? Just how much more?

276
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:32,067
Hold on. Hey, wipe your lips.
You look too lively.

277
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:33,184
Okay, let's go.

278
00:19:33,745 --> 00:19:34,920
Here we go.

279
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:37,056
Nice.

280
00:19:37,598 --> 00:19:39,347
-Good.
-Oh, good.

281
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:42,680
You can say everything else,
but don't say you have a kid.

282
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:46,502
I'll deal with the situation
like a great CEO should.

283
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:48,218
You stay here and pretend to be sick.

284
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:53,175
Maybe it's not too late to buy a farmland.

285
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:54,553
You like famine crops.

286
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:57,390
I'll take courses from a cyber university.
Let's take up farming together.

287
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:00,200
Okay then.

288
00:20:00,345 --> 00:20:04,290
Then I'll immerse myself
in the patient role I played last time...

289
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,822
...when I go for a check-up later.

290
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:07,283
No. That character was a manic!

291
00:20:07,368 --> 00:20:09,135
-Exactly!
-Why you...!

292
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,486
Get yourself checked thoroughly.

You're transforming when
it's not even time.

Yeah, what is it?

300
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:41,231
I've found out Han Segye's
current location.

301

321
00:21:39,286 --> 00:21:41,400
She sure is pretty.

322
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:48,286
Your Highness.... It's Okjung.

323
00:21:48,923 --> 00:21:50,893
She sure is good at acting.

324
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:52,289
Of course she's good.

325
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,626
That role fits her perfectly.

326
00:21:55,032 --> 00:21:55,899
Gosh.

327
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:58,037
I heard she's a complete lunatic.

328
00:21:58,122 --> 00:21:58,955
Really?

329
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:05,003
You want to kill me?

330
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,048
Then go ahead and kill me.

331
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:09,816
Death will not be the end of me.

332
00:22:10,482 --> 00:22:12,611
My spirit will wander
the realms of hell...

333
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:17,582
...condemning you and your kingdom
to eternal darnation!

334
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:29,135
Die.

335
00:22:29,406 --> 00:22:30,695
She's dying.

336
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,767
You think that's funny?

337
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,360
Then, should I cry? Come on.

338
00:22:35,696 --> 00:22:38,418
She's really sick. I feel bad for her.

339
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:42,317
Gosh, no. Han Segye's not sick.
She's faking it.

340
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:45,874
By the way, she never had plastic surgery.

341
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,138
I saw her photo and there was nothing.
It's all natural.

342
00:22:48,347 --> 00:22:49,468
I thought so.

343
00:22:50,262 --> 00:22:51,314
Even these are real.

344
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:52,740
Doctor!

345
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,988
That's sexual harassment.

346
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,822
How is it sexual harassment?

347
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,153
That's going too far.

348
00:22:59,238 --> 00:23:01,718
I was trying to be funny.
Can't you take a joke?

349
00:23:01,802 --> 00:23:04,387
It's not so much of a joke
if no one laughed.

350
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:08,134
Okay, I'm sorry. Jeez...

351
00:23:09,072 --> 00:23:12,818
It seems like you both like Han Segye.
She even has a kid.

352
00:23:13,943 --> 00:23:15,921
I can tell she messed around a lot.

353
00:23:16,363 --> 00:23:17,458
What do you know?

354
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:19,266
It all shows in the face.

355
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:20,788
But, do you know...

356
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:22,190
...who the kid's father is?

357
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,408
-Who?
-Do you know?

358
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:26,438
Beats me. How would I know
if she adopted him from somewhere?

359
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:27,479
Come on.

360
00:23:27,564 --> 00:23:28,870
It's none of my business.

361
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:36,446
What the...?

362
00:23:40,229 --> 00:23:41,281
What the heck was that?

363
00:23:42,144 --> 00:23:43,025
Oh, dear.

364
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:45,971
I threw a tangerine as a joke.
Why aren't you laughing?

365
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,061
Why do you give a darn
if I had plastic surgery or not?

366
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:53,449
You're the one who should get
plastic surgery. Especially here.

367
00:23:57,924 --> 00:24:00,141
Are you crazy, woman?
This is a hospital!

368
00:24:00,227 --> 00:24:01,829
Yes I'm crazy, man!

369
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:04,096
Should I not go crazy in this situation?

370
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:09,734
This situation?

371
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,353
What situation?

372
00:24:11,856 --> 00:24:14,336
This situation where you're hiding
in a hospital after causing trouble?

373
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:17,690
You should be ashamed of yourself.

374
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:21,217
Get a grip. Not a single person
here likes you.

375
00:24:21,302 --> 00:24:23,592
Not just here. Try going outside!

376
00:24:23,677 --> 00:24:26,482
Everyone's busy criticizing you.
Why are you blaming me?

377
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:29,368
What... What?

378
00:24:29,547 --> 00:24:32,268
You don't even know the father
of the kid you're raising.

379
00:24:32,353 --> 00:24:33,186
What?

380
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,603
Gosh, I've heard about that.

381
00:24:35,688 --> 00:24:39,225
Don't talk to me, okay?
It only makes me look bad.

382
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:40,646
So annoying.

383
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:55,154
It's not true.

384
00:24:55,732 --> 00:24:56,795
It's not true.

385
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,386
-Stop it!
-It's not true.

386
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,304
It's not true.

387
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:08,757
I said it's not true!

388
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:12,896
What the hell? Everyone get out!

389
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,078
Hey, Woomi.

390
00:25:21,093 --> 00:25:23,183
Buy some tangerines on the way.
The biggest ones.

391
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:25,353
What's your room number?

392
00:25:25,438 --> 00:25:27,526
Pardon? Room 1005.

393
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,429
Take them to Room 1005.

394
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:34,152
Nothing. I just borrowed some tangerines.

395
00:25:44,003 --> 00:25:47,807
What did I do so wrong?

396
00:25:49,104 --> 00:25:52,435
I can't control this.
What am I supposed to do?

397
00:25:52,683 --> 00:25:54,953
What am I supposed to do?

398
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:05,264
(Mom)

399
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:09,705
I'm embarrassed because of you.
I can't live in this neighborhood.

400
00:26:09,878 --> 00:26:11,740
That's why I don't live
in your neighborhood.

401
00:26:11,825 --> 00:26:14,468
What's so hard about getting an award
that you ran away?

402
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:16,586
I knew it since you were little.

403
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:19,552
You hated preschool so you tried
to sneak away all the time.

404
00:26:19,637 --> 00:26:20,808
You haven't changed at all.

405
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:22,620
What do you know?

406
00:26:22,705 --> 00:26:24,910
What do you know!

407
00:26:24,995 --> 00:26:26,861
Don't talk to your mom like that.

408
00:26:29,431 --> 00:26:32,112
Who am I going to blame?
I gave birth to you.

409
00:26:32,196 --> 00:26:34,802
Yeah, who are you going to blame?
You gave birth to me.

410
00:26:35,018 --> 00:26:35,936
Are you in the hospital?

411
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:37,411
Should I go there?

412
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,056
Forget it. Just hang up.

413
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,458
But still...

414
00:26:43,017 --> 00:26:45,283
You have no idea what I'm going through.

415
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:51,777
Are you sure that woman's here?

416
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,999
She's not here.
Han Segye already ran away.

417
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:20,818
Shouldn't we search a club instead of
a hospital if we want to find her?

418
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,099
Or a hotel. She has many boyfriends.

419
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,239
Find out who she's dating.

420
00:27:25,342 --> 00:27:27,553
Have someone on stakeout
in front of his house.

421
00:27:33,844 --> 00:27:35,950
Was I too loud just now?

422
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:37,356
-Pardon?
-I mean...

423
00:27:37,897 --> 00:27:40,900
I wonder if I was loud enough
to disturb a sad person.

424
00:27:43,257 --> 00:27:44,157
Yeah, go ahead.

425
00:27:44,242 --> 00:27:47,619
I've leaked the spokesmodel
contract cancellation...

426
00:27:47,704 --> 00:27:49,208
...to the shareholders and the partners.

427
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:50,719
Have it released in the news as well.

428
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:54,973
We have to nail it down so that
Han Segye can't walk all over us.

429
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:06,030
Hey, Joohwan.

430
00:28:06,525 --> 00:28:07,358
Do you know...

431
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:10,308
...how to use sign language?

432
00:28:10,392 --> 00:28:12,257
Sign language?

433
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:16,209
She moved their finger like this,
and then like that...

434
00:28:18,203 --> 00:28:19,036
Never mind.

435
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:21,395
Anyway, she has a child, right?

436
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,336
Search the places around her house
where kids might go.

437
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:27,497
Like a kids' cafe or a daycare center.

438
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:30,284
She wouldn't abandon her own child
no matter how messed up she is.

439
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:31,813
Excuse me.

440
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:36,140
It's okay. You can use it.

441
00:28:40,316 --> 00:28:41,862
Don't you think you're out of line?

442
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:45,190
Do you know me?

443
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,428
I'm sorry, what is your name?

444
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:51,663
I forget easily.

445
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,604
Now what the hell is this?

446
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:56,611
What a creative way to piss someone off.

447
00:28:56,696 --> 00:28:58,039
I think you're misunderstanding...

448
00:28:58,123 --> 00:28:59,939
The one who hurt the other
tends to forget easily...

449
00:29:00,023 --> 00:29:02,541
...but the one who got hurt
remembers it forever.

450
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:05,790
I got it. I don't like talking behind
somebody's back, either.

451
00:29:09,392 --> 00:29:11,266
Excuse me, but are you crazy?

452
00:29:11,908 --> 00:29:13,373
Is this why you're in the hospital?

453
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,324
You bet. I am crazy.

454
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:17,760
So I'll consider this as your apology.

455
00:29:21,154 --> 00:29:24,467
I'll pay for that. Send me
a written claim for your phone.

456
00:29:24,552 --> 00:29:26,298
Consider that as my apology.

457
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,377
(The woman I met at Seodong Hospital
wearing a patient gown...)

458
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,615
(Slightly wavy hair)

459
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,418
(Handkerchief)

460
00:29:46,502 --> 00:29:48,587
( Hospitalized due to mental illness?)

461
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:59,095
You're not a child.
How could you lose your phone?

462
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,566
I didn't lose it.
I was snatched away from me.

463
00:30:02,515 --> 00:30:03,492
By whom?

464
00:30:03,613 --> 00:30:04,884
That I don't know.

465
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:06,579
I knew it.

466
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,308
-You're checking on them, right?
-All 12 of them are okay.

467
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:16,354
Yorong gained weight
and Mimi's picky about food.

468
00:30:16,492 --> 00:30:18,061
Dr. Oh's coming.

469
00:30:26,717 --> 00:30:29,573
Let him come.
It won't make a difference.

470
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:31,491
Who knows?

471
00:30:31,682 --> 00:30:32,853
Your impairment was...

472
00:30:33,712 --> 00:30:34,729
...caused by an accident.

473
00:30:34,813 --> 00:30:36,735
Right. Hope is a good thing.

474
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,430
What about the code-share agreement?

475
00:30:41,197 --> 00:30:45,909
I was just about to tell you.
Kyla wants to reconsider the deal.

476
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:49,973
Because of Han Segye? Didn't you
tell them that we're letting her go?

477
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,989
I did tell him. That's the problem.

478
00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:55,670
I love Han Segye. I love Korea!

479
00:30:55,951 --> 00:30:58,360
-I love you.
-I love you.

480
00:30:58,445 --> 00:31:01,460
Apparently, the CEO's daughter is
a huge fan of Han Segye.

481
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:05,984
The word is that he took the deal
because she's our spokesmodel.

482
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,923
Damn that stupid Hallyu...

483
00:31:09,013 --> 00:31:09,903
What should we do?

484
00:31:10,016 --> 00:31:11,006
It's better this way.

485
00:31:11,427 --> 00:31:14,416
We don't have to spend
money and time to find Han Segye.

486
00:31:15,246 --> 00:31:17,157
We won't cancel the contract.

487
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:18,888
That's a little difficult.

488
00:31:19,202 --> 00:31:23,132
We just got a call from from her side
that she's terminating the contract.

489
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:26,207
What? Who is she to forestall us?

490
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:33,726
I guess I don't have a choice.

491
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:36,670
I don't want to take such measures, but...

492
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,858
How dare he say that I'm crazy.

493
00:31:53,696 --> 00:31:55,189
Who does he think he is?

494
00:31:56,678 --> 00:31:59,021
Hey, Han Segye.

495
00:32:00,566 --> 00:32:02,418
What the hell are you up to?

496
00:32:02,502 --> 00:32:03,335
Me?

497
00:32:03,873 --> 00:32:04,981
Taking time for self-reflection.

498
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,687
Can't you see the nude nail polish?
It's the icon of self-reflection.

499
00:32:13,403 --> 00:32:16,653
My beautiful girl. You clever girl!

500
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:18,845
What's wrong with you? Watch my nails.

501
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,483
Give me money.

502
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:22,474
Get her off me.

503
00:32:23,515 --> 00:32:25,880
-Hey, come on.
-That was really nice of you.

504
00:32:27,016 --> 00:32:28,813
I'm proud you, buddy.

505
00:32:29,052 --> 00:32:31,693
Nice thing? What nice thing?

506
00:32:31,778 --> 00:32:33,251
Going with the nude tone?

507
00:32:33,557 --> 00:32:34,596
Didn't you make a donation?

508
00:32:35,882 --> 00:32:38,894
Not anyone can do it
even if they're rich.

509
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:41,405
A donation? Me?

510
00:32:41,496 --> 00:32:42,541
100 million won.

511
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:43,887
100 million won?

512
00:32:44,136 --> 00:32:46,729
The rumors about you being
a mom went away.

513
00:32:46,814 --> 00:32:48,851
Now they're saying
that you were sponsoring those kids...

514
00:32:48,936 --> 00:32:53,315
...and that you were taking care
of them at your house.

515
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,883
But it wasn't me.

516
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:56,127
It was you.

517
00:32:58,191 --> 00:32:59,030
It wasn't me.

518
00:32:59,302 --> 00:33:01,780
It was you. That's what everyone's saying.

(Low-income Youths Sponsors'

520
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:09,430
It wasn't me. Something went wrong.

521
00:33:09,515 --> 00:33:12,888
Then it must be your fan.
You have a lot of fans in the Middle East.

522
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,897
They give us money to study
then make us come to these things.

523
00:33:18,281 --> 00:33:20,904
The photos from today will be
uploaded on the Internet, right?

524
00:33:21,473 --> 00:33:25,504
They think poor people don't have
any self-respect.

525
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:27,566
That old creep will be here, right?

526
00:33:28,393 --> 00:33:29,452
This can't get any worse.

527

-Yes, boss.

528
00:33:39,037 --> 00:33:41,326
-Listen to me, okay?
-It's not me, really.

529
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,641
Hurry up.

530
00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:46,792

..."and for actively supporting
low-income families and youths."

photos with the founder and the sponsors.

please come up to the front.

-Sir, please come to the middle.
-Oh, no.

548
00:35:01,758 --> 00:35:04,235
No, please. You should be in the middle.

549
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,018
Thank you.

550

-Please look to the front.

553
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,241
Ms. Han, please look over here.

554
00:35:15,325 --> 00:35:16,690
Smile.

555
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:19,543
Wow Gayoung, it seems like you've grown.

556
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:24,497
Your uniform's a little small for you.

557
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:26,043
You look like a grown woman now.

558
00:35:26,132 --> 00:35:28,244
If I see you on the streets.
I won't recognize you...

559
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:29,952
...and try to make a move on you.

560
00:35:30,118 --> 00:35:31,865
Please look to the front.

561
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,067
Ms. Han, look over here.

562
00:35:33,152 --> 00:35:34,830
You could be my girlfriend.

563
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:39,763
You know, my girlfriend is
just five years older than you.

564
00:35:41,402 --> 00:35:44,034
Gayoung, do you want to be my girlfriend?

565
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,263
What?

566
00:35:49,574 --> 00:35:51,123
It was a joke.

567
00:35:51,502 --> 00:35:53,414
I was trying to make you smile
for the photo.

568
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:02,697
It seems like Mr. Kim really adores you.
Lucky you, Gayoung.

569
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,388
Of course. I do adore her.

570
00:36:06,004 --> 00:36:07,048
She's like a daughter to me.

571
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,832
Shit. I can't take this anymore.

572
00:36:21,803 --> 00:36:23,223
I can't take this anymore.

573
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:25,919
I only take solo shots.

574
00:36:26,514 --> 00:36:29,986
I can't take group photos.

575
00:36:35,182 --> 00:36:37,329
It's cool if you want your good work
to be noticed.

576
00:36:37,877 --> 00:36:42,036
But isn't it wrong to stooge
the kids like this?

577
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,430
Am I the only one who thinks so?

578
00:36:47,556 --> 00:36:50,225
Or does everyone want to deny it?

579
00:36:58,145 --> 00:36:58,978
And...

580
00:37:03,153 --> 00:37:05,219
What... What do you want?

581
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:12,642
Shoot, shoot!

582
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:14,824
What are you doing?

583
00:37:14,908 --> 00:37:17,669
Why? Because you're adorable.

584
00:37:17,956 --> 00:37:19,425
You're like my dad.

585
00:37:23,801 --> 00:37:25,154
Doesn't everyone do this to their dads?

586
00:37:25,866 --> 00:37:27,846
I don't have a dad, so I don't know.

587
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:30,288
But...

588
00:37:32,021 --> 00:37:34,085
...normally people don't do that
to their daughters.

589
00:37:35,858 --> 00:37:38,906
Even real fathers are careful
not to touch their daughters.

590
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,693
Why would another man touch
someone else's daughter...

591
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:45,142
...without permission
saying that she's adorable?

592
00:37:48,454 --> 00:37:51,453
What nonsense!

593
00:37:51,538 --> 00:37:52,834
Gosh, seriously!

594
00:37:53,873 --> 00:37:55,118
Don't take photos!

595
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:56,825
Ms. Han, what did you do?

596
00:37:57,073 --> 00:37:58,097
Mr. Kim!

597
00:37:58,251 --> 00:37:59,353
Mr. Kim

598
00:38:01,627 --> 00:38:02,460
Mr. Kim!

599
00:38:03,141 --> 00:38:04,030
You come with me.

600
00:38:06,294 --> 00:38:07,310
-Ms. Han.
-Ms. Han Segye.

601
00:38:07,394 --> 00:38:08,973
Please say something.

602
00:38:09,058 --> 00:38:10,851
-Why did you do that?
-Ms. Han.

603
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:13,792
It'll be okay. Just don't go online
for a few days.

604
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:15,847
You're crazy!

605
00:38:16,012 --> 00:38:18,364
Everyone acted like they didn't notice,
so I had to do something.

606
00:38:18,777 --> 00:38:21,662
Creeps like him who does shit like that
just because they're rich...

607
00:38:21,747 --> 00:38:23,353
...needs to be kicked in the ass.

608
00:38:23,437 --> 00:38:24,270
Hey!

609
00:38:27,527 --> 00:38:28,360
Mr. Kim.

610
00:38:29,685 --> 00:38:31,706
You humiliated me?

611
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:34,414
You make money
by smiling in front of cameras.

612
00:38:34,597 --> 00:38:36,155
Do you know who I am?

613
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,007
Mr. Kim, don't be like this. Let's talk.

614
00:38:39,095 --> 00:38:41,232
You're some CEO of some
corporation or whatever.

615
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:42,672
Was your name Taejin?

616
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:44,010
Or Creep-Jin?

617
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:45,394
Wh... What?

618
00:38:45,478 --> 00:38:49,302
Consider yourself lucky that I make money
by smiling in front of cameras.

619
00:38:49,434 --> 00:38:51,824
If I were a cop,
I would've arrested you right away.

620
00:38:51,908 --> 00:38:52,940
Watch what happens.

621
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:55,077
I'll cut of all my donations
to this foundation.

622
00:38:55,162 --> 00:38:57,579
Cut it off. I'll pay for everything.

623
00:38:57,664 --> 00:38:59,917
How do you plan to do that?

624
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:03,174
I'll make a phone call
and cut off all the funding.

625
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:06,180
It'll be all your fault
if the students here starve.

626
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:11,623
Money means seniority and rank
in this country.

627
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:14,160
If you think of it like that,
I have many subordinates.

628
00:39:14,706 --> 00:39:17,400
You have no idea about the power of money.

629
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:20,177
That is so ignorant.

630
00:39:20,412 --> 00:39:21,245
What?

631
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:28,451
Why you...!

632
00:39:33,725 --> 00:39:34,584
And who are you?

633
00:39:34,669 --> 00:39:36,875
Someone who'll support
this foundation instead of you.

634
00:39:37,304 --> 00:39:38,294
"You"?

635
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,651
Did you just address me as "you"?

636
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:42,486
You said money means seniority and rank.

637
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:44,339
Since I'm your superior,
I'll talk to you like one.

638
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,017
What the hell are you?

639
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,599
How dare you, boy...

640
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,121
Oh yeah...

641
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:53,398
I haven't introduced myself.

642
00:39:55,621 --> 00:39:56,563
Hello.

643
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:59,988
I'm the Chief of Strategic Planning
at T'road Airlines. My name's Seo Dojae.

644
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:02,890
Seo Dojae?

645
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:05,206
Seo Dojae...

646
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:07,700
Wait...

647
00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:11,242
If you got that through your head,
just go home.

648
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,472
Mr. Kim Taejin, CEO of Jinji Corporation.

649
00:40:25,736 --> 00:40:26,938
Thank you.

650
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:28,372
Ms. Han Segye?

651
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:32,780
That was pretty impressive.

652
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:36,409
You're the lunatic from the hospital.

653
00:40:40,446 --> 00:40:41,953
Excuse me for a second.

654
00:41:00,399 --> 00:41:01,910
Now I understand.

655
00:41:03,384 --> 00:41:04,345
Good.

656
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,115
You need to pay me back.

657
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,335
(Spokesmodel Contract)

658
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,552
I'm not renewing the contract.

659
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:20,345
Then you'll be in trouble.
You had a photoshoot using my money.

660

662
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:30,383
"The happiness of giving."

(There's No Stopping Han Saegye)

664
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:33,438
Not this one.

665
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,928
Are you threatening me right now?

666
00:41:37,302 --> 00:41:40,342
Please wait. We're not done threatening.

667
00:41:40,427 --> 00:41:43,839
"The donations made by Han Segye
were found to be false."

668
00:41:43,924 --> 00:41:47,260
"Since she's been showing up
at social welfare events"...

669
00:41:47,509 --> 00:41:49,440
..."this is expected to cause
a lot of controversy."

670
00:41:49,615 --> 00:41:52,001
"The anonymous donator who actually
donated the 100 million won said"...

671
00:41:52,086 --> 00:41:58,282
..."he will not forgive her
for taking credit of his deed.”

672
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:05,994
With just one click, the news will be
sent out immediately.

673
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,581
What a pleasant world we live in.

674
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,116
Again, it'll be troublesome
if you don't take my offer.

675
00:42:12,417 --> 00:42:14,679
Not for me, but for you.

676
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:18,369
Suit yourself.

677
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:21,124
I'm going to retire anyway.

678
00:42:21,994 --> 00:42:23,015
Hey, Segye.

679
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,763
I have no regrets on leaving
the entertainment world.

680
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:29,016
I feel like I'm meant to retire now.

681
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:31,998
In that case...

682
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,856
Chief Seo, please let this one slide.

683
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:50,301
Why are you on your knees? Get up!

684
00:42:50,385 --> 00:42:53,159
Segye is actually a poor soul.

685
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,044
Please have mercy just this once...

686
00:42:56,134 --> 00:42:57,263
Ms. Yoo.

687
00:43:01,447 --> 00:43:04,238
What should we do? It's your choice.

688
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:18,952
Come on, Segye. This could ruin me!

689
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:27,809
Okay, get up. Get up.

690
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,540
I'll sign the contract.

691
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,875
Really?

692
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:34,930
Yes, I will. I'll sign the stupid thing.

693
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:37,695
Give me a pen before she changes her mind.

694
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:43,431
Sign here.

695
00:43:43,828 --> 00:43:45,123
Hurry up.

696
00:43:52,056 --> 00:43:53,805
She signed. Get rid of the e-mail now.

697
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,047
Okay.

698
00:43:58,433 --> 00:44:01,600
I think... I just sent out the e-mail.

699
00:44:01,685 --> 00:44:02,318
-What?
-What?

700
00:44:02,403 --> 00:44:05,488
Oh dear. I tried to click cancel...

701
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:07,778
...but hit the send button instead.

702
00:44:07,904 --> 00:44:08,757
My bad.

703
00:44:10,777 --> 00:44:11,616
Is that so?

704
00:44:11,759 --> 00:44:13,022
-"Is that so"?
-"Is that so"?

705

(From Jung Joohwan:
Han Segye's Press Release)

706
00:44:19,361 --> 00:44:20,454
I deleted it.

707
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,863
I never mentioned
who will be receiving it.

708
00:44:26,189 --> 00:44:28,933
The receiver's e-mail was mine.

709
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,405
I'm telling you this
as a concerned business partner.

710
00:44:34,636 --> 00:44:36,385
When you sign contracts in the future...

711
00:44:37,379 --> 00:44:39,074
...make sure you check
everything thoroughly.

712
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:40,595
You crook.

713
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,884
Oh, turn the contract to the next page.

714
00:44:50,351 --> 00:44:53,829
"B must accompany A
to business trips upon his request."

715
00:44:54,037 --> 00:44:58,196
"B must wear a red dress at all times
when she's accompanying A."

716
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:04,435
That part is very important.

717
00:45:04,789 --> 00:45:05,859
Please remember it.

718
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:09,624
Let's go on a business trip first.
Just the two of us.

719
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:14,027
Then I'll deduct half
from the 100 million.

720
00:45:17,411 --> 00:45:20,595
-This is a fraud.
-A fraud that pays. Just do it.

721
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,994
It's just Gyeongju,
not Australia. Just go.

722
00:45:23,123 --> 00:45:25,595
100 million is huge.
Suck it up and do as he says.

723
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,090
I can pay him back. I have money.

724
00:45:27,174 --> 00:45:28,765
No you don't.

725
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:33,346
If you don't go to Gyeongju,
you'll end up paying all the penalty.

726
00:45:34,327 --> 00:45:37,622
I think he's a pervert.
Why would he tell me what to wear?

727
00:45:37,706 --> 00:45:39,082
He said it's confidential.

728
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:40,893
A top-secret meeting.

729
00:45:40,978 --> 00:45:42,993
Doesn't it sound like a business TV show?

730
00:45:43,078 --> 00:45:46,469
You actually believe that?
You are a gullible woman.

731
00:45:46,554 --> 00:45:49,557
Be a good girl and
don't cause any trouble.

732
00:45:49,656 --> 00:45:51,310
Call me if anything happens.

733
00:45:51,394 --> 00:45:53,798
I might cause something to happen.

734
00:45:54,322 --> 00:45:56,433
Pray that I don't fight that pervert.

738
00:46:14,353 --> 00:46:15,706
Hello, Chief.

739
00:46:15,865 --> 00:46:18,584
I'm Baek Minsuk,
the captain of this flight.

740
00:46:18,936 --> 00:46:21,492
I'll do my best to make your journey
safe and pleasant.

741
00:46:21,878 --> 00:46:23,421
Thank you for your service.

742
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:33,557
It's my first time to see a captain
coming out to greet someone.

743
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:34,862
Really?

744
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:36,531
I'm quite used to it.

745
00:46:44,781 --> 00:46:45,682
Excuse me.

746
00:46:46,211 --> 00:46:47,234
Go ahead.

747
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,661
Are you nervous?

748
00:46:52,746 --> 00:46:53,919
What do you mean?

749
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:57,615
Aren't you reading a book
because you're nervous to look at me?

750
00:47:02,073 --> 00:47:02,953
Are you nervous?

751
00:47:03,939 --> 00:47:05,256
Sitting next to me.

752
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,241
Who wouldn't get nervous
looking at this face?

753
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,767
Please don't talk to me.
I'm trying to read.

754
00:47:20,852 --> 00:47:22,361
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

755
00:47:23,705 --> 00:47:24,601
I'm Han Segye.

756
00:47:24,686 --> 00:47:27,669
I told you not to talk to me.
You're loud.

757
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:38,656
You must have a nasty temper.
Even the captain caters to your whim.

758
00:47:42,379 --> 00:47:43,213
Oops.

759
00:47:43,998 --> 00:47:47,107
I was actually thinking to myself,
but it kind of slipped out.

760
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,241
I'll put your luggage in your room.

761
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:17,799
Sure. Thank you.

762
00:48:17,884 --> 00:48:20,564
I can also take the bag
you're carrying right now.

763
00:48:24,538 --> 00:48:25,620
Thank you.

764
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:35,869
Come to my room if you need something.
It's the one next to yours.

765
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,270
Why would I go to your room?

766
00:48:37,355 --> 00:48:38,608
You don't have a choice.

767
00:48:39,007 --> 00:48:41,886
Your luggage is being sent to my room.

768
00:48:43,414 --> 00:48:45,643
I knew it.

769
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:49,954
Are you really a pervert?

770
00:48:51,111 --> 00:48:52,495
Is that what you want?

771
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:54,535
-Do you think I'm crazy?
-Glad to hear that.

772
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:56,975
It's not good if you misunderstand
me like that.

773
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,596
Let's just say I'm holding
your luggage as hostage.

774
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:03,235
I need assurance that you'll stay
here until the meeting tomorrow.

775
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,406
You run away as a hobby.

776
00:49:05,491 --> 00:49:06,895
Return my luggage when I'm asking nicely.

777
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,856
I'm not giving it back
even if you use bad words.

778
00:49:10,124 --> 00:49:12,623
I'll return it to you
right after the meeting.

779
00:49:14,733 --> 00:49:15,984
Where are you going?

780
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:19,386
Going for my hobby.

781
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:21,960
You signed the contract.

782
00:49:22,517 --> 00:49:24,323
I guess I'll be back before the meeting.

783
00:49:24,644 --> 00:49:27,374
Or maybe I won't
if I'm having too much fun.

784
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:30,178
You don't have money.

785
00:49:30,448 --> 00:49:31,894
None of your business.

786
00:49:40,943 --> 00:49:42,947
She's a pain in the ass.

787
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:48,185
It's my first time transferring
taxi fare to the driver.

788
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,835
What happened?

789
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:52,779
Nothing. I forgot my wallet
in the hotel room.

790
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:55,670
Don't tell Woomi about this, okay?

791
00:49:55,755 --> 00:49:58,424
I wasn't going to,
but now that you're asking me not to...

792
00:49:58,508 --> 00:50:00,183
...I think I should tell her.

793
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:01,932
I'll pay you back double when I get back.

794
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:05,405
-Double?
-Deal?

795
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:06,520
Deal.

796
00:50:32,108 --> 00:50:33,091
Ms. Han Segye.

797
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:41,615
What?

798
00:50:41,851 --> 00:50:43,401
How did you know that I was here?

799
00:50:45,228 --> 00:50:46,515
Did you put a tail on me?

800
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:48,331
No more games now. Let's go.

801
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:51,156
I gave you enough time for your hobby.

802
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,584
I asked how you found me here.

803
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:58,010
(Travel Guide of Gyeongju)

804
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:07,998
(Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond)

805
00:51:09,057 --> 00:51:10,768
Did you go through my bag?

806
00:51:13,593 --> 00:51:14,715
I'll give you five minutes.

807
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:17,215
Who are you to go through my bag?

808
00:51:17,299 --> 00:51:19,363
Me? Your creditor.

809
00:51:19,626 --> 00:51:21,544
It seems like you're mistaken.

810
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,948
I didn't come here to play with you.

811
00:51:24,062 --> 00:51:27,208
I can break the contract
right now if you want.

812
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:31,865
I can send e-mails to the reporters
from right here.

813
00:51:36,836 --> 00:51:38,229
What are you playing at?

814
00:51:38,314 --> 00:51:39,897
You said I have five minutes.

815
00:51:40,638 --> 00:51:41,683
Count up to five minutes.

816
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:55,629
I didn't expect you to be interested
in historical sites.

817
00:51:56,509 --> 00:51:58,309
No matter how much time passes by...

818
00:51:59,107 --> 00:52:01,129
...things like this stay
in the same spot.

819
00:52:02,144 --> 00:52:03,967
I envy that so much.

820
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,356
But this place was rebuilt.

821
00:52:09,444 --> 00:52:12,485
But the site remains. The site!

822
00:52:13,226 --> 00:52:16,389
Are you getting mad at your creditor?

823
00:52:17,117 --> 00:52:20,950
No. My voice is getting higher
because of the beautiful scenery.

824
00:52:21,036 --> 00:52:22,920
It's so nice and pretty.

825
00:52:23,005 --> 00:52:24,343
Five minute's up.

826
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:28,234
Are you coming or not?

827
00:52:30,312 --> 00:52:32,416
Yes, I'm coming.

828
00:52:44,471 --> 00:52:47,411
Why the red dress? It's so uncomfortable.

829
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:48,891
Because it stands out.

830
00:52:50,316 --> 00:52:51,710
I found you in one go.

831
00:52:51,795 --> 00:52:54,706
It's rare for a woman in a red dress
to be wandering around alone...

832
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:56,173
...in the middle of the night.

833
00:52:57,658 --> 00:52:59,383
-So it's a shackle.
-You know it.

834
00:53:00,538 --> 00:53:04,092
You seem to like making sarcastic remarks.
Is that how you became chief?

835
00:53:04,177 --> 00:53:07,911
You seem to like drama.
Is that why you became an actress?

836
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:09,653
Gosh, what a jerk.

837
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:11,488
-Would you like to get out?
-Sure.

838
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:33,577
He really took off?

839
00:53:34,967 --> 00:53:36,547
Where am I?

840
00:53:41,846 --> 00:53:44,088
Why not just leave me at the palace?

841
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:15,872
(No available taxis near you.)

842
00:54:15,957 --> 00:54:18,388
I can't even get a taxi.

843
00:54:24,716 --> 00:54:26,145
I'm hungry.

844
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,063
I'm here to pick you up.

845
00:54:41,306 --> 00:54:43,676
I figured you would've spent
all your energy by now.

846
00:54:49,066 --> 00:54:50,790
I can't stand up.

847
00:54:51,572 --> 00:54:53,991
I've spent up all my energy
because of someone.

848
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:15,546
Shall we get dinner?

849
00:55:16,963 --> 00:55:18,345
I asked because I'm hungry.

850
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:27,057
Enjoy.

851
00:55:28,944 --> 00:55:30,774
I guess you are sorry.

852
00:55:30,864 --> 00:55:34,066
It's quite common to treat
a business partner to a meal.

853
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,486
Give me a heads up if you plan
on running away again.

854
00:55:38,571 --> 00:55:40,037
Then you won't be a business partner.

855
00:55:40,647 --> 00:55:42,710
I never planned on running away.

856
00:55:42,795 --> 00:55:45,566
It's always unexpected,
accidental and spontaneous.

857
00:55:48,725 --> 00:55:51,785
It seems like you enjoy your life
the way you want.

858
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:54,408
I can't afford to live like that.

859
00:55:55,387 --> 00:55:57,499
I have so many things
to be responsible for.

860
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:02,993
What do you mean by that?

861
00:56:03,786 --> 00:56:07,413
I'm asking you to not complain
when we're working.

862
00:56:07,571 --> 00:56:08,856
It's not that cute anyway.

863
00:56:12,895 --> 00:56:14,164
Enjoy my life?

864
00:56:15,215 --> 00:56:16,282
The way I want?

865
00:56:18,372 --> 00:56:19,303
That's true.

866
00:56:20,842 --> 00:56:22,363
That's one way to look at it.

867
00:56:23,845 --> 00:56:24,685
Okay.

868
00:56:25,495 --> 00:56:26,981
What do you need me to do?

869
00:56:27,439 --> 00:56:30,406
I need to know so I can be
ready to perform.

870
00:56:31,006 --> 00:56:34,565
You just have to be yourself.
A Hallyu star.

871
00:56:35,021 --> 00:56:36,382
I'll handle the rest.

872
00:56:36,467 --> 00:56:37,812
I guess that's me.

873
00:56:37,896 --> 00:56:40,388
A Hallyu star who enjoys
her life however she wants.

874
00:56:40,802 --> 00:56:42,645
I'm not sure if that's you.

875
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:45,013
But the person I want to be
partner with...

876
00:56:45,196 --> 00:56:47,103
...is her.

877
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:49,800
Alright.

878
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:52,529
I'll bring that person
to the meeting tomorrow.

879
00:56:56,441 --> 00:56:59,391
With that said, can I ask
you something as your partner?

880
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:02,345
It's a very important matter.

881
00:57:03,217 --> 00:57:04,158
Do you really...

882
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,155
...have a kid?

883
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:14,534
No.

884
00:57:16,327 --> 00:57:18,558
For your information,
I'm an unbiased person.

885
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:21,095
Everybody has their own reason...

886
00:57:22,516 --> 00:57:23,774
I said no.

887
00:57:24,371 --> 00:57:28,024
I'm only asking because we need to
come up with a plan if it's true.

888
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:29,477
So we can protect you.

889
00:57:29,562 --> 00:57:30,935
Why are you so mean?

890
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,232
I just want facts. I wasn't being mean.

891
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:38,245
Even if I was mean, is there a reason
for me to be courteous to you?

892
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:41,205
I don't have any good memories
since the first time we met.

893
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:44,127
-I thought you were a good person.
-What made you think so?

894
00:57:44,212 --> 00:57:46,440
When you said you'll support
the foundation.

895
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:48,354
I thought you were a nice guy.

896
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:53,656
You're just not a good person to me.

897
00:57:57,543 --> 00:58:00,110
Oh, well. I'm not that good either.

898
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:39,025
How could he say something so mean?

899
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,287
I can't stand him.

900
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,179
What a jerk.

901
00:58:56,362 --> 00:58:57,453
I didn't deserve that.

902
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,246
It's so unfair.

903
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,552
I don't run away because I want to!

904
00:59:03,338 --> 00:59:05,708
I hate being that way, too!

905
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,546
You asshole...

906
00:59:10,364 --> 00:59:11,710
Do you hear me?

907
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,919
Do you hear me?

908
00:59:16,947 --> 00:59:17,827
You're so mean...

909
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,567
I hate it too...

910
00:59:23,482 --> 00:59:26,274
The asshole can hear you.

911
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:27,694
Asshole...

912
00:59:29,735 --> 00:59:32,185
I don't want to be like this!

913
00:59:36,204 --> 00:59:37,345
Thank you.

914
00:59:41,687 --> 00:59:42,619
Thank you.

915
00:59:53,721 --> 00:59:55,058
Your eyes are puffy.

916
00:59:56,048 --> 00:59:58,495
It's because I ate ramyeon before bed.

917
01:00:18,419 --> 01:00:19,509
This is...

918
01:00:19,593 --> 01:00:21,585
Nice to meet you. I'm Han Segye.

919
01:00:36,744 --> 01:00:39,627
You really thought that I rejected it
because of the model?

920
01:00:39,898 --> 01:00:41,552
That's why you brought Han Segye?

921
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:44,973
This is our T'road Airline's
way of providing...

922
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,711
...the best service
for you and your daughter.

923
01:00:48,438 --> 01:00:51,243
It is our basic duty
to provide our customers...

924
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,191
...the best and special service.

925
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:55,926
That makes sense,
but you're wasting your time.

926
01:00:56,306 --> 01:01:00,430
T'road Airline is not
the business partner I'm considering.

927
01:01:01,713 --> 01:01:05,028
Tell me whatever conditions you want.

928
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:12,836
"I'm a fan of yours."

929
01:01:16,413 --> 01:01:20,177
I'm someone that can tell you
what I want, but...

930
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:24,003
...what about the other customers
who aren't able to speak out?

931
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,986
"Can you use Korean Sign Language?"

932
01:01:30,554 --> 01:01:34,290
"I learned because
I wanted to talk to you."

933
01:01:37,094 --> 01:01:38,528
"I want to give you something."

934
01:01:58,605 --> 01:02:01,218
"Thank you. I'm very touched."

935
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:04,120
"Does it look like me?"

936
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:06,356
"You're much more prettier."

937
01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:11,424
"You are prettier."

938
01:02:11,508 --> 01:02:12,812
"Thank you."

939
01:02:21,017 --> 01:02:23,331
The model in the campaign is important.

940
01:02:23,457 --> 01:02:27,793
Because they will be representative
of our company.

941
01:02:27,888 --> 01:02:29,428
Including the policy.

942
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,007
When we receive a passengers'
information in advance...

943
01:02:34,092 --> 01:02:37,220
...we will arrange
a sign language service.

944
01:02:37,698 --> 01:02:42,308
Also, sign language and subtitles
will be provided during the flight.

945
01:02:43,058 --> 01:02:46,396
For the best service
to all of our passengers.

946
01:02:46,537 --> 01:02:48,681
There is no exception.

947
01:03:15,602 --> 01:03:17,316
Why did you learn sign language?

948
01:03:18,796 --> 01:03:21,458
Because I may not be able
to speak one day.

949
01:03:25,076 --> 01:03:26,939
Let's just say it was for acting.

950
01:03:28,157 --> 01:03:30,774
For a role I might take one day.

951
01:03:32,231 --> 01:03:34,591
I thought maybe you wouldn't show up.

952
01:03:35,558 --> 01:03:38,325
Then you would've thought
that I ran away again.

953
01:03:39,846 --> 01:03:42,152
Actually, I hate running away.

954
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:45,103
I don't do it because I like it.

955
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:47,189
I know.

956
01:03:51,238 --> 01:03:53,354
The meeting was a success thanks to you.

957
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:55,547
I'm thanking you.

958
01:03:57,581 --> 01:04:00,572
-And there's something I didn't tell you.
-What do you want to say now?

959
01:04:01,513 --> 01:04:04,007
Save it. I don't have a kid.

960
01:04:05,292 --> 01:04:06,258
I'm sorry.

961
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:12,271
For being rude at the hospital
and yesterday.

962
01:04:12,356 --> 01:04:13,825
For being rude all this time.

963
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:16,519
I was in a situation.

964
01:04:21,497 --> 01:04:23,048
You're pretty late with the apology.

965
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:27,731
I'm sorry too.

966
01:04:29,022 --> 01:04:30,526
For running away...

967
01:04:31,276 --> 01:04:32,599
...for running away...

968
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:36,218
...and for running away.

969
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:39,876
I was in a situation myself.

970
01:04:42,298 --> 01:04:43,142
I know.

971
01:06:25,947 --> 01:06:26,947
Oh, no...

972
01:06:28,131 --> 01:06:29,308
What should I do?

973
01:06:31,376 --> 01:06:34,573
Ladies and gentleman,
we will be landing shortly.

974
01:06:34,811 --> 01:06:41,381
Please return to your seats and make
sure your seat belt is securely fastened.

975
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:44,469
Miss? The plane will be landing soon.

976
01:06:44,554 --> 01:06:46,202
You have to come out.

977
01:06:46,956 --> 01:06:49,193
Miss? Are you okay?

978
01:06:49,878 --> 01:06:53,298
Please open the door so we can help you.

979
01:06:53,383 --> 01:06:54,677
It won't open?

980
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:59,046
-Miss, are you okay?
-What's going on?

981
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:03,994
I think Ms. Han is inside,
but there's no response.

982
01:07:04,301 --> 01:07:07,423
Maybe she collapsed.

983
01:07:10,162 --> 01:07:11,197
Ms. Han?

984
01:07:12,171 --> 01:07:14,163
Answer me, Ms. Han.

985
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:23,354
If you don't answer in five seconds,
I'll break this door down.

986
01:07:24,003 --> 01:07:24,836
One..

987
01:07:25,638 --> 01:07:26,471
Two...

988
01:07:27,457 --> 01:07:28,290
Three...

989
01:07:29,195 --> 01:07:30,785
Four, five...

990
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:39,790
Ms. Han.

991
01:07:41,707 --> 01:07:42,829
Are you okay?

992
01:07:45,196 --> 01:07:46,029
Please...

993
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:47,945
I need...

994
01:07:49,781 --> 01:07:50,614
Sorry?

995
01:07:58,711 --> 01:08:00,391
Please help me.

996
01:08:02,234 --> 01:08:04,047
Please cover me.

997
01:08:09,832 --> 01:08:10,751
Get me a blanket.

998
01:08:10,835 --> 01:08:11,668
Yes, sir.

999
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,493
Here.

1000
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:01,371
(Beauty Inside)

1001
01:09:01,474 --> 01:09:03,743
That woman was really strange.

1002
01:09:03,828 --> 01:09:07,727
Your voice is Han Segye's voice.
But your clothes haven't changed.

1003
01:09:07,812 --> 01:09:09,197
I got caught.

1004
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:10,914
-What?
-What?

1005
01:09:10,998 --> 01:09:14,473
I keep seeing a person
as someone who can never be.

1006
01:09:14,558 --> 01:09:15,917
I told you I don't have a kid.

1007
01:09:16,001 --> 01:09:17,100
I don't have a kid.

1008
01:09:17,184 --> 01:09:18,090
Who are you?

1009
01:09:18,174 --> 01:09:19,794
And who are you?

1010
01:09:19,878 --> 01:09:23,264
You can't differentiate
people's face, right?

1011
01:09:23,348 --> 01:09:26,396
Stop trying to test me. Ms. Han Segye.
