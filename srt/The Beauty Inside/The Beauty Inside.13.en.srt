1
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:21,192
Han Segye.

2
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,686
(Aunt)

3
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:49,835
How could you...

4
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:55,111
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,018
My face is...

6
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:28,245
My face...

7
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:30,940
... isn't turning back to normal.

8
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,950
How can you be totally fine?

9
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:25,470
Then, did you think I would die?

10
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,200
I took great care...

11
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:31,620
... to make sure that I wouldn't die.

12
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:34,475
And yet, you lay down unconscious?

13
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,026
Wouldn't it be weirder
to lie down if I'm awake?

14
00:03:39,772 --> 00:03:42,979
I went all the way to the gates of heaven,

15
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:44,817
but they said if I wanted to enter,

16
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,530
I have to bring you. So I came back.

17
00:03:46,615 --> 00:03:48,107
Why are you trying to kill me?

18
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,586
This won't do.

19
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:55,077
You can't be a priest because
you can't make sacrifices.

20
00:03:55,162 --> 00:03:56,076
Just give it up.

21
00:03:57,631 --> 00:04:01,000
I've already been thinking
if I should do that or not.

22
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,484
Really?

23
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:03,798
I don't know.

24
00:04:03,883 --> 00:04:05,708
Call me when you've made a decision.

25
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:09,288
Lift it for me.

26
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:15,949
Ouch.

27
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,885
Thank you for the food. Bye.

28
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,096
Where are you going?

29
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:24,378
To look for Segye.

30
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:27,855
I bet she's all lost and
confused somewhere.

31
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:31,591
Mother, I'm leaving.

32
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:33,092
Thank you for the food.

33
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:34,750
Oh my. Wait...

34
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:37,068
Did you even chew the food?

35
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,100
I'll make beef bone soup,
so come over with Segye.

36
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:43,957
What? Why would you make beef bone soup?

37
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:48,559
Beef soup is the best for healing bones
and restoring your energy.

38
00:04:48,644 --> 00:04:50,651
Then, we'll have to eat that
for a whole month.

39
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:54,030
Are you a kid?
Why are you so picky about food?

40
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,111
Okay, Mother. I'll come with Segye.

41
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:58,875
-All right. Come together.
-Okay.

42
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,185
You little...

43
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:02,037
Your son is the best.

44
00:05:02,122 --> 00:05:03,971
-Of course. Bye.
-Bye.

45
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:06,115
Hey. Give me a call.

46
00:05:07,843 --> 00:05:09,386
Did you manage to call Segye?

47
00:05:09,994 --> 00:05:11,567
How are you feeling?

48
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:14,776
I came here on my two feet. I'm fine.

49
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:17,218
I want to know if you got a hold of her.

50
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,170
You did, right?

51
00:05:20,078 --> 00:05:23,272
If Segye is hiding because
she feels bad for me...

52
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:24,934
She came to see me.

53
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:27,545
Though, she disappeared again after that.

54
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,611
When?

55
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:30,311
Where?

56
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,299
You should've held on to her.

57
00:05:32,476 --> 00:05:34,647
The last time you saw her...

58
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:37,676
... what did she look like?

59
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:40,241
An old man.

60
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:42,997
She was an old man.

61
00:05:43,254 --> 00:05:44,526
Han Segye...

62
00:05:46,052 --> 00:05:47,796
... still looks like that...

63
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,360
... even though a week has passed.

64
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:54,416
She said she's not turning back to normal.

65
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,895
So?

66
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:03,191
I've been thinking for a long time...

67
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,084
... that something like this
might happen one day.

68
00:06:07,823 --> 00:06:09,987
So, what will you do now?

69
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:12,623
If Segye looks like that...

70
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,773
If she has to live as an old man
for the rest of her life...

71
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:20,048
... will you still love her?

72
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:29,245
I'm not sure.

73
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:31,994
Will I be able...

74
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:34,326
... to love her until I die?

75
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:38,146
Can I ignore what others think about me?

76
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,781
Can I not judge myself?

77
00:06:43,213 --> 00:06:45,067
And spend the rest of my life with her.

78
00:06:51,075 --> 00:06:52,873
Help me.

79
00:06:58,838 --> 00:07:00,217
Well done.

80
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:18,851
I tried hard to come to a conclusion.

81
00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:20,479
But I can't.

82
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,402
(Han Segye)

83
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:29,285
(Han Segye? Or not?)

84
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:32,216
(Real Segye)

85
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:34,962
You wrote...

86
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:37,847
... Han Segye's name on all of them.

87
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:39,627
What does it mean?

88
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:45,130
(Makes no sense. Han Segye's situation
and the people she changes to... )

89
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:50,679
You lost your chance.

90
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:59,499
A chance to be honest with someone.

91
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,221
I know very well...

92
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,567
... that chance doesn't come
as often as you think.

93
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:08,160
It means they are all Han Segye.

94
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:23,327
Love has made him crazy.

95
00:08:29,357 --> 00:08:33,226
(Han Segye)

96
00:08:33,311 --> 00:08:36,202
(Han Segye)

97
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:40,272
All he can think about is her.

98
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:45,203
I worried for nothing.

99
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,770
I shouldn't have been worried about it.

100
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:58,020
I did think that something like this
would happen one day.

101
00:09:04,603 --> 00:09:05,468
But...

102
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:07,929
... I never thought...

103
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,350
... that I would end up looking like this.

104
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:22,217
I miss you.

105
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:26,744
I miss you even when I look like this.

106
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:29,766
I miss you...

107
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:31,419
... like crazy.

108
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:48,467
Sir, I'm getting off.

109
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:37,647
After I ended up like this...

110
00:10:39,287 --> 00:10:42,613
... I thought of letting you go.

111
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:45,437
I told myself that many times...

112
00:10:45,857 --> 00:10:48,159
... but I just couldn't.

113
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,914
So I thought...

114
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:53,823
... I should at least talk to you...

115
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,970
... I should at least beg you.

116
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:01,460
I won't ask for anything else.

117
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:02,608
But...

118
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:06,103
... please let me come and
see you once in a while.

119
00:11:07,243 --> 00:11:08,951
If you choose to live like that...

120
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:11,606
... then what about me?

121
00:11:14,964 --> 00:11:16,964
Do you know how mortified I was?

122
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:21,070
When I realized that I almost lost you...

123
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:24,610
... because I was scared
of what the others would think.

124
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:26,596
I...

125
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:30,126
... started hating myself again.

126
00:11:31,414 --> 00:11:32,861
Meeting you...

127
00:11:33,932 --> 00:11:35,555
... loving you...

128
00:11:36,008 --> 00:11:38,985
... and being loved by you
made me forget some things.

129
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:41,921
But they all came flashing back.

130
00:11:42,972 --> 00:11:44,584
I almost went back...

131
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,374
... to that horrible life again.

132
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:49,522
Seo Dojae...

133
00:11:52,347 --> 00:11:54,347
I'm ready to give it all up.

134
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:57,210
My family, my position, everything.

135
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:00,314
If it means I can stay with you.

136
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:02,212
I'm prepared for it.

137
00:12:02,881 --> 00:12:04,159
That's the life...

138
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:05,667
... I choose.

139
00:12:08,212 --> 00:12:09,269
I don't care...

140
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:13,065
... how you look.

141
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:50,696
How can I let you do that?

142
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:54,429
How can you live like that?

143
00:13:13,565 --> 00:13:15,282
I'm myself again, right?

144
00:13:17,066 --> 00:13:18,706
I'm back, right?

145
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,318
Hey! You crazy brat!

146
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:53,523
That's what I want to say.

147
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:54,903
Are you insane?

148
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:56,326
You told me to trust you,

149
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,961
and you went on and did that?

150
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,720
Why did you run your car over?

151
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:00,850
What?

152
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:04,487
I could've run over Chae Yoori,
but I held it in. Was what I did wrong?

153
00:14:04,572 --> 00:14:06,424
You've really lost it.

154
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,610
Why won't your face turn back to normal?

155
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:15,400
I don't know.

156
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,244
It just happened.

157
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:19,108
Then, how did it turn back?

158
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:21,013
I don't know that either.

159
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,049
It just happened.

160
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,060
As if there was ever a valid reason.

161
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:29,571
What an unpredictable disease.

162
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,563
Whatever.

163
00:14:32,124 --> 00:14:33,825
When I heard you're not coming back,

164
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:36,055
I was so worried that
my company will go bankrupt.

165
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:38,856
Do you only see me as your money maker?

166
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:42,202
Of course, you fool.

167
00:14:43,704 --> 00:14:45,704
The next time you disappear...

168
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:47,013
... leave Kingkang behind.

169
00:14:47,856 --> 00:14:50,724
She must have had a hard time.
Look at her. She's so thin.

170
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:52,302
What are you talking about?

171
00:14:52,387 --> 00:14:53,902
I fed her very well.

172
00:14:54,048 --> 00:14:55,217
I'm sure you only fed yourself.

173
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:57,000
I even bought her snacks.

174
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:58,755
Only your face got chubbier.

175
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,876
I heard that Han Segye
had plastic surgery.

176
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:05,186
The surgery was botched.
So she couldn't appear on TV these days.

177
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,586
Isn't she pregnant?

178
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:09,088
Someone I know said,
she saw her at the hospital.

179
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:12,017
Nonsense. Her manager was
hospitalized, remember?

180
00:15:12,107 --> 00:15:13,208
She might be there to visit her.

181
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:16,334
Be careful with your words.
These days, if you misspeak...

182
00:15:16,478 --> 00:15:17,902
... you can get sued.

183
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:21,117
That's right. This situation
would look weird to anyone.

184
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,054
All I have to do is
throw in a little hint.

185
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:33,079
Hello, Reporter Park.

186
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:35,856
I have something interesting to tell you.

187
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,320
It's regarding Han Segye.

188
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:53,824
All her contracts include a clause that
says she must take a week off every month.

189
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:55,941
If they won't let her,
then she'll run away.

190
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,892
Why would she need to run away?

191
00:15:58,806 --> 00:16:00,380
It's too typical to say
that she's doing it,

192
00:16:00,465 --> 00:16:02,068
simply because she doesn't want to.

193
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:04,204
Look at this.

194
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:06,371
Don't you find this strange?

195
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:09,096
You only see her coming out,
but not go in.

196
00:16:10,823 --> 00:16:13,878
Yoori, where did you get this from?

197
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:15,968
I don't remember.

198
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:18,181
Was it my stylist?

199
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:20,010
Or was it my manager?

200
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:21,754
Anyway, someone gave it to me.

201
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:24,156
What could it be?

202
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:25,636
I really have no idea.

203
00:16:25,721 --> 00:16:27,452
You're doing this again?

204
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,508
Hi, Segye.

205
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:31,989
It's Han Segye.

206
00:16:34,669 --> 00:16:35,584
What's this?

207
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,330
Did you call her here?

208
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:40,798
You must have been under a lot of stress.

209
00:16:40,994 --> 00:16:44,124
You've been saying
that my face keeps changing.

210
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,379
I think you've read too many comics.

211
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:53,272
No, listen.

212
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:56,507
I have the evidence here.

213
00:16:56,592 --> 00:16:58,716
-If you look at this video...
-What?

214
00:17:00,174 --> 00:17:01,435
What's in the video?

215
00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:02,978
It's just me.

216
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:06,129
But it shows you coming out...

217
00:17:06,214 --> 00:17:08,425
I think you need to go to the hospital.

218
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,589
Inferiority complex is also an illness.

219
00:17:11,674 --> 00:17:13,487
Who do you think
will get hurt more by this?

220
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:17,428
Stop pretending to be stupid
and look at the situation clearly.

221
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:21,814
You might be able to get away this time,
but as long as I know...

222
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:23,625
You must have forgotten something.

223
00:17:33,705 --> 00:17:34,701
What?

224
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:37,142
Did you think I'd be nice?

225
00:17:37,378 --> 00:17:38,684
You said it yourself.

226
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:43,704
I don't show up at work, run away from set
and just date any guy.

227
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,659
Those are the things I did, not you.

228
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:49,608
This is who I am.

229
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:51,455
Hey!

230
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,705
What?!

231
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:55,956
Do you want to pour juice on me too?

232
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,547
When there are so many people watching?

233
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,576
Are you sure you can do it?

234
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:09,791
I'm already used to it.

235
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,474
Pouring some juice on a girl like you
can't do anything to my image.

236
00:18:14,278 --> 00:18:16,695
People might talk about it
for a week or two. But that's it.

237
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:18,295
I already have a bad image.

238
00:18:18,854 --> 00:18:20,218
I don't care about what they say.

239
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,809
One more thing.

240
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:29,774
Let me warn you...

241
00:18:31,723 --> 00:18:33,151
... stop spreading absurd rumors.

242
00:18:34,828 --> 00:18:36,494
My face can change?

243
00:18:38,163 --> 00:18:39,836
I wish that's true.

244
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:47,203
Then, I could kill you
while I look different.

245
00:18:50,037 --> 00:18:52,987
Nobody would find out.

246
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,641
You'll die...

247
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:56,309
... and I'll disappear.

248
00:18:58,062 --> 00:19:01,070
That what I call, the perfect crime.

249
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:09,682
What's wrong?

250
00:19:10,244 --> 00:19:11,539
Are you scared now?

251
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,756
Bye.

252
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:29,211
Is actress C delirious?

253
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:32,011
It is widely known
in the entertainment industry,

254
00:19:32,095 --> 00:19:34,085
that actresses C and H hate each other.

255
00:19:34,186 --> 00:19:37,619
Contrary to the common belief
that Miss H harasses Miss C,

256
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:40,734
Miss C is actually suffering
from an inferiority complex.

257
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,921
And it seems to be taking its toll on her.

258
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:46,106
It's been rumored that
Miss C is mentally deranged.

259
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:50,471
Miss C keeps saying nonsense
like Miss H's face is changing,

260
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:52,807
It's been baffling the staff.

261
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,800
According to Miss H's
closest acquaintance,

262
00:19:54,884 --> 00:19:57,954
she sincerely hopes
that Miss C will get better.

263
00:19:58,124 --> 00:20:00,791
Miss H is surprisingly very gracious.

264
00:20:01,415 --> 00:20:04,626
C is Chae Yoori, and H is Han Segye.

265
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:07,204
I did such a great job.

266
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,378
I did a fantastic job.

267
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:13,728
They say she's delirious.

268
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:19,175
It makes me feel so good.

269
00:20:21,206 --> 00:20:25,795
Geez. I wish I was there to see her face.

270
00:20:27,585 --> 00:20:29,585
That was my best performance ever.

271
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,114
I was amazing.

272
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,919
You deserve the grand prize.

273
00:20:33,004 --> 00:20:34,803
I would like to thank my manager...

274
00:20:38,396 --> 00:20:40,325
I'm so relieved that you're on my side.

275
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,014
Let's stay friends forever.

276
00:20:43,203 --> 00:20:44,345
Let's not be enemies.

277
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,417
I know right.

278
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,654
I'm truly glad that she's on my side.

279
00:20:51,496 --> 00:20:52,916
Hello.

280
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:55,512
Hi, Kingkang.

281
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:03,558
Hey...

282
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:05,385
Kingkang, be quiet.

283
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:09,688
He never barks at strangers.

284
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:10,949
This is odd.

285
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:12,006
Exactly.

286
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:16,285
Well, that can happen.

287
00:21:16,513 --> 00:21:17,573
It's okay.

288
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,253
Don't take it to heart.

289
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:21,108
It's okay. It's okay.

290
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:22,961
Calm down.

291
00:21:27,072 --> 00:21:28,706
Who could it be?
I'm not expecting anyone.

292
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,644
Who is it?

293
00:21:32,046 --> 00:21:33,601
It's alright, Kingkang.

294
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:36,145
No. It's fine.

295
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:43,644
You?

296
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:45,621
Now that you have a girlfriend and
new friends, you don't need me anymore?

297
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:48,006
How did you get here?

298
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:49,877
Why bother asking? Isn't it obvious?

299
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:50,811
I followed you.

300
00:21:51,264 --> 00:21:52,226
Wow.

301
00:21:53,474 --> 00:21:54,871
I know you all.

302
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,787
-Let me take a seat.
-You already did.

303
00:21:57,871 --> 00:21:59,871
This looks delicious.

304
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:02,213
Since I haven't had dinner yet...

305
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:03,139
Hold on.

306
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:04,204
Please pay for it first.

307
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,096
We all chipped in 10,000 won each.

308
00:22:06,706 --> 00:22:07,914
Tell him to pay for it.

309
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:10,812
Jung Joohwan.

310
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:15,796
You must have already told them, right?

311
00:22:16,104 --> 00:22:17,424
About your condition?

312
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:25,118
Wow. So you did tell them.

313
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,286
I was the only one who didn't know
that you told them.

314
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:29,226
Actually...

315
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,346
... something happened...

316
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:36,449
It was very complicated.
That's why he couldn't tell you.

317
00:22:37,034 --> 00:22:39,675
I can't believe I have a foolish boss,

318
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,383
who makes his girlfriend
talk in his stead.

319
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,201
I'll raise your salary.

320
00:22:47,623 --> 00:22:49,857
I shall do my best to serve you.

321
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,526
I envy you.

322
00:22:58,796 --> 00:22:59,995
Hey, there.

323
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,607
What's your name?

324
00:23:03,303 --> 00:23:04,614
Geez, seriously...

325
00:23:05,449 --> 00:23:06,458
Why?

326
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,293
Why? What's wrong?

327
00:23:20,862 --> 00:23:22,233
Hello, little doggie.

328
00:23:25,114 --> 00:23:27,114
Hello, little doggie.

329
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,177
Gosh. Stop it already. Just go.

330
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,484
Just sit back down.

331
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:39,843
It's odd, isn't it?

332
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:41,063
"Hello, little doggie."?

333
00:23:44,144 --> 00:23:45,724
You're such a good dog.

334
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:08,093
Today was fun, wasn't it?

335
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Secretary Jung is such a nice person.

336
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:14,800
That's why he's been working for me
for so long.

337
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,912
They're all nice people.

338
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,122
I'm talking about those
who have been staying by our sides.

339
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:22,956
That's because you're a nice person.

340
00:24:24,271 --> 00:24:26,271
You're the one who's a nice person.

341
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:34,315
This time around...

342
00:24:37,566 --> 00:24:38,770
... I was afraid.

343
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:47,068
When I first had this illness...

344
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,971
... the saddest thing to me...

345
00:24:49,694 --> 00:24:52,604
... was not being able to recognize
those whom I love.

346
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,425
Because I couldn't recognize them...

347
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,949
... I couldn't even love myself.

348
00:25:02,855 --> 00:25:05,194
But I thought wrong.

349
00:25:06,736 --> 00:25:08,457
Nothing has changed.

350
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:10,938
I thought that if people change,

351
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,160
things change too.

352
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:15,642
I was only fooling myself.

353
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:17,733
You are the one...

354
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:20,852
... who thought me that.

355
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:31,654
When my first symptoms appeared,

356
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,002
I received help from someone.

357
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:40,527
He's an absolute stranger...

358
00:25:40,757 --> 00:25:42,413
... but he risked his life for me.

359
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,763
That's why I wanted to help others too.

360
00:25:50,094 --> 00:25:51,938
Every time I change into someone else...

361
00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:55,955
... I always prayed for time
to pass by quickly.

362
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,825
But you have helped me...

363
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,143
... to come out into the world.

364
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:07,510
I got better.

365
00:26:09,093 --> 00:26:11,209
I've become a much better person.

366
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:26,260
I'm going to...

367
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:28,587
... reveal my illness.

368
00:26:31,014 --> 00:26:32,600
I've decided to trust...

369
00:26:34,457 --> 00:26:36,003
... the people I love.

370
00:26:45,532 --> 00:26:46,799
You've gone through a lot.

371
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:49,548
All this time.

372
00:26:57,696 --> 00:26:58,739
I...

373
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,381
... have an illness.

374
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:08,500
When I had the car accident ten years ago,

375
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:10,484
I injured my brain.

376
00:27:11,193 --> 00:27:12,099
So...

377
00:27:12,948 --> 00:27:14,948
... I can't recognize people's faces.

378
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,499
What?

379
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,537
What do you mean?

380
00:27:21,394 --> 00:27:22,661
Dad...

381
00:27:22,746 --> 00:27:26,251
What do you mean, you can't
recognize people's faces?

382
00:27:27,406 --> 00:27:28,697
That's exactly what it is.

383
00:27:29,722 --> 00:27:30,989
I have prosopagnosia.

384
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,304
I can't remember your face, Grandpa.

385
00:27:34,735 --> 00:27:37,515
If you pretend to be someone else
and walk pass me...

386
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,271
... I won't be able to recognize you.

387
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:45,307
Is it serious?

388
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:46,478
Yes.

389
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:50,083
Can it be cured?

390
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,171
No.

391
00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:56,665
You.

392
00:27:57,101 --> 00:27:58,316
Did you know about this?

393
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,692
Yes, I do.

394
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,215
What about you?

395
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:09,557
Well...

396
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:11,656
I didn't know.

397
00:28:13,347 --> 00:28:15,853
I know you're my daughter...

398
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,892
... but how can you be so cruel?

399
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:20,109
You knew it all along,

400
00:28:20,194 --> 00:28:24,649
yet you didn't say a thing
to your father nor your husband.

401
00:28:28,512 --> 00:28:30,512
Don't be mad at Mom.

402
00:28:31,465 --> 00:28:32,820
I was the one who wanted
to keep it a secret.

403
00:28:32,905 --> 00:28:36,270
You were about to kick
him out of the house...

404
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:37,933
... if he had a single flaw.

405
00:28:39,346 --> 00:28:42,353
How do you expect Dojae to tell you that?

406
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:50,819
Grandpa...

407
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:52,331
... are you crying?

408
00:28:54,361 --> 00:28:56,262
How could I not?

409
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:57,599
Why are you crying?

410
00:28:57,895 --> 00:29:01,232
Every word I ever said to you...

411
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:03,627
... I regret them all.

412
00:29:04,273 --> 00:29:05,717
I'm sorry, that's why.

413
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,129
It must have been hard for you.

414
00:29:27,228 --> 00:29:31,876
You must have really hated me
for not knowing anything.

415
00:29:32,515 --> 00:29:33,600
I'm sorry...

416
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,534
... for not meeting your expectations.

417
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:36,688
Nonsense.

418
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,731
There's no grandson as good as you
in this country.

419
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:45,463
Since we're all being honest,
I also have something to say.

420
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,667
I...

421
00:29:53,056 --> 00:29:54,704
I'm not going to marry Kiho.

422
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:56,658
Why not?

423
00:29:57,071 --> 00:29:59,323
What's wrong? Is he not treating you well?

424
00:29:59,796 --> 00:30:01,450
I don't love him.

425
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:04,286
I only loved his social status.

426
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:09,388
Don't get married.

427
00:30:10,228 --> 00:30:14,788
No one here has forced you
to marry that guy.

428
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:16,818
I'm partly responsible.

429
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:22,175
You needed his help in order to beat me.

430
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:23,508
You're right.

431
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:24,620
But...

432
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:27,058
... it's not your fault.

433
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:30,566
Even though I took your side just now...

434
00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:34,194
... that was all because of my greed.

435
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:36,497
Everything...

436
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:38,936
... is my fault.

437
00:30:39,123 --> 00:30:40,927
It's my fault.

438
00:30:41,018 --> 00:30:42,573
No, it's my fault.

439
00:30:42,902 --> 00:30:45,389
I made the kids fight each other.

440
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:47,178
You can blame yourselves later.

441
00:30:47,338 --> 00:30:48,833
There's something more urgent.

442
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,356
Mr. Choi...

443
00:30:51,013 --> 00:30:52,597
... knows about Dojae's condition.

444
00:30:53,173 --> 00:30:55,260
Director Kim might also
find out about it soon.

445
00:30:55,448 --> 00:30:56,484
After that...

446
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:59,895
... he'll stop at nothing
to bring Dojae down.

447
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:02,865
Choi Kiho.

448
00:31:03,423 --> 00:31:05,423
That fearless jerk.

449
00:31:05,645 --> 00:31:10,116
Director Kim, that fearless punk.

450
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:13,383
Calm down.

451
00:31:13,816 --> 00:31:15,552
Don't get too worked up.

452
00:31:15,636 --> 00:31:17,253
Please calm down, you two.

453
00:31:17,345 --> 00:31:19,085
-Calm down.
-You beat me to it.

454
00:31:19,518 --> 00:31:21,518
I was going to tell on them first.

455
00:31:23,221 --> 00:31:24,751
If you feel guilty to me...

456
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:26,921
... you should teach them a lesson.

457
00:31:27,006 --> 00:31:27,974
You...

458
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:30,457
You...

459
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,328
You fool.

460
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:39,577
You can't handle that one thing,
and yet you want to take over my company?

461
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:43,617
I can't give my company
to a fool like you.

462
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:44,683
That's it.

463
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:46,694
That's more like the grandpa I know.

464
00:31:48,584 --> 00:31:50,691
We're in such a good mood,
so I thought you're going to let it slide.

465
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,127
Sunho Group is not going down,

466
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,939
just because one
executive director is sick.

467
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,263
Don't worry.

468
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,473
I'll take on more work if it's necessary.

469
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:01,184
Plus, we have Sara.

470
00:32:02,174 --> 00:32:03,616
That's what I'm worried about.

471
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:05,431
If that's the case...

472
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:07,401
... then, should I lend a hand
in the business too?

473
00:32:07,486 --> 00:32:09,870
Dad, you think running
a business is like a child's play?

474
00:32:10,353 --> 00:32:12,457
Just keep taking care of your flowers
like you always do.

475
00:32:26,464 --> 00:32:28,891
Kiho will definitely go berserk.

476
00:32:29,435 --> 00:32:30,288
I know.

477
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:31,879
There's no way he'll sit back on this.

478
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,399
You handle it.

479
00:32:40,202 --> 00:32:43,163
You should handle it
since you're my elder brother.

480
00:32:44,018 --> 00:32:45,290
I have somewhere to go.

481
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:56,087
Yes. We just left the grocery store.

482
00:32:56,738 --> 00:32:57,591
Okay.

483
00:32:57,864 --> 00:32:58,933
Okay...

484
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:04,066
Who was that? Why do you have
to report your whereabouts every time?

485
00:33:04,235 --> 00:33:05,335
None of your business.

486
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,364
Do you have a girlfriend?

487
00:33:08,449 --> 00:33:10,063
-Get lost.
-You do.

488
00:33:10,148 --> 00:33:12,234
-I said get lost.
-You have a girlfriend.

489
00:33:12,768 --> 00:33:13,622
How old is she?

490
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:14,630
Is she pretty?

491
00:33:14,838 --> 00:33:16,031
Is she on social media?

492
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:18,525
Geez. Seriously.

493
00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:25,007
That is a super expensive car.

494
00:33:25,092 --> 00:33:25,943
Look.

495
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:37,464
Why are you here?

496
00:33:41,824 --> 00:33:42,910
Who is this?

497
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,474
I'm his sister.

498
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,956
Ryu Eunho's younger sister.

499
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:50,871
The one he doesn't get along with?

500
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:57,476
You said you two don't get along.
I guess that was a lie.

501
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:02,803
Let me steal your brother for a while.
Is that okay?

502
00:34:02,888 --> 00:34:04,916
Yes. Of course.

503
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,194
Of course, you can.

504
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:08,678
You can take him for as long as you want.

505
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:12,880
Hurry. Go.

506
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:15,994
Before this pretty lady changes her mind.

507
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:18,923
Thank you.

508
00:34:20,974 --> 00:34:21,906
What's your name?

509
00:34:21,991 --> 00:34:24,292
I'm Ryu Aram.

510
00:34:24,377 --> 00:34:26,126
Thank you, Aram.

511
00:34:32,176 --> 00:34:34,192
You better not say anything
when you get home.

512
00:34:34,395 --> 00:34:35,536
Do you understand?

513
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,035
Mind your own business.

514
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:39,290
Go.

515
00:34:39,782 --> 00:34:40,801
Hurry.

516
00:34:44,105 --> 00:34:45,320
You can do it, Ryu Eunho!

517
00:34:45,637 --> 00:34:47,502
Best of luck!

518
00:34:54,112 --> 00:34:55,983
You better not lose her.

519
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:57,869
If you do, I'll kill you.

520
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:05,173
You paid for it last time.
So this time, it's my treat.

521
00:35:05,442 --> 00:35:06,492
I don't want that.

522
00:35:07,557 --> 00:35:08,766
Why not?

523
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:10,571
I want to treat you.

524
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:14,559
You said you never dated anyone.
How did you know all these things?

525
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,395
Eunho?

526
00:35:22,384 --> 00:35:23,301
Dojae.

527
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,770
Since when did you start
seeing each other?

528
00:35:41,378 --> 00:35:42,593
Since 6PM.

529
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:45,364
You know that's what I'm asking.

530
00:35:46,062 --> 00:35:48,399
Dojae, you're in no position
to be mad at him.

531
00:35:50,325 --> 00:35:51,753
I'm the one who's chasing him.

532
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:53,795
Hey! Why did you make her chase you?

533
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,364
I didn't teach you
to treat women like that.

534
00:35:55,484 --> 00:35:56,669
What are you talking about?

535
00:35:57,432 --> 00:35:59,432
You wanted to be friends, but I said no.

536
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:04,956
That's it. I taught him well.

537
00:36:05,306 --> 00:36:06,417
So...

538
00:36:07,304 --> 00:36:10,116
So, both of you are seriously...

539
00:36:10,812 --> 00:36:11,985
... in a relationship?

540
00:36:13,094 --> 00:36:15,094
-Since when?
-Since 6PM.

541
00:36:15,209 --> 00:36:16,558
Han Segye...

542
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:18,417
... what do you like about Dojae?

543
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:20,982
I just could not fathom.

544
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:25,094
He knows me better than anyone else.

545
00:36:25,339 --> 00:36:26,618
He knows that I'm nice.

546
00:36:28,314 --> 00:36:29,853
What are you talking about?

547
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:31,291
You think she's nice?

548
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:34,493
Are you possessed or something?

549
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:36,370
Then what about you?

550
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,961
What do you like about my sister?

551
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:41,532
She's mean...

552
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:44,440
... but that her charm.

553
00:36:45,164 --> 00:36:46,157
What are you talking about?

554
00:36:46,422 --> 00:36:48,347
Her words can be mean
but she's very kindhearted.

555
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:50,388
What are you talking about? I am mean.

556
00:36:50,473 --> 00:36:52,417
Gosh. You all are just so adorable.

557
00:36:54,468 --> 00:36:56,720
You siblings sure have problems.

558
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,906
They sure do.

559
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,548
They definitely have problems.

560
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:25,752
Oh, okay.

561
00:37:30,647 --> 00:37:32,573
I think you've got the order wrong.

562
00:37:42,068 --> 00:37:43,468
How did it go with your family?

563
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,374
I didn't get to ask you about it
because we suddenly ran into them.

564
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:47,927
As you just saw...

565
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,551
... it went well.

566
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,645
My grandpa even cried.

567
00:37:53,876 --> 00:37:57,036
I really didn't expect
for my grandpa to cry.

568
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,413
Geez. You did a great job.

569
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,746
While he was crying because of me,

570
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:06,497
I whined at him, asking him
to handle a problem at the company.

571
00:38:06,582 --> 00:38:08,181
But I was yelled at instea

572
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:10,677
You deserved to get yelled at.

573
00:38:11,263 --> 00:38:13,441
You always want things the easy way.

574
00:38:14,207 --> 00:38:15,125
You caught me.

575
00:38:17,602 --> 00:38:18,967
Do you want to...

576
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:22,367
... come in and eat some ramyun?

577
00:38:23,307 --> 00:38:25,952
You always want things the easy way.

578
00:38:26,447 --> 00:38:27,848
Do I look like an easy person to you?

579
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:28,904
Who?

580
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,690
Me?

581
00:38:52,815 --> 00:38:53,955
What are you looking at?

582
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:00,100
You're awake...

583
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:02,414
... but why are you leaning on my shoulder?

584
00:39:03,061 --> 00:39:04,906
You know I'm awake...

585
00:39:06,546 --> 00:39:08,152
... but why are you not doing anything?

586
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:11,701
Why aren't you asking me?

587
00:39:13,141 --> 00:39:14,024
Whether...

588
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,820
... I've decided to be a priest...

589
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:18,789
... or not.

590
00:39:18,874 --> 00:39:21,614
If you tell me you are going to be one,
at this point...

591
00:39:22,755 --> 00:39:23,680
... then...

592
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:27,287
... you're really a mean person.

593
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:30,014
That's not good.

594
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:32,653
I'm a nice guy.

595
00:39:44,487 --> 00:39:46,231
Is it because I'm too nice?

596
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:49,184
It really drove me crazy...

597
00:39:50,026 --> 00:39:51,997
... when I thought...

598
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:56,619
... you were going to that jerk.

599
00:40:03,051 --> 00:40:04,040
I guess...

600
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:07,858
... I'm just too nice.

601
00:40:13,212 --> 00:40:14,149
No.

602
00:40:15,256 --> 00:40:16,467
You're really mean.

603
00:40:22,282 --> 00:40:23,878
You're extremely...

604
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:27,791
... terrible.

605
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:43,695
Face blindness?

606
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,936
That's the easy way to explain it.

607
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,827
The medical term for it...

608
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:51,037
... is prosopagnosia.

609
00:40:51,856 --> 00:40:53,447
So...

610
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,969
... you can't distinguish faces...

611
00:40:56,117 --> 00:40:57,612
I was in a car accident.

612
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,504
I injured my brain...

613
00:41:00,013 --> 00:41:01,832
... and this condition
was the result of it.

614
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:06,144
I'm not just a little confused...

615
00:41:07,118 --> 00:41:10,375
... I can't recognize
people's faces at all.

616
00:41:13,735 --> 00:41:15,273
So that's why...

617
00:41:15,543 --> 00:41:17,543
... I've caused you a lot of inconvenience.

618
00:41:17,888 --> 00:41:21,421
It'll probably going to be
a lot more troublesome in the future.

619
00:41:21,573 --> 00:41:23,302
I ask for your understanding in advance.

620
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:27,726
I thought...

621
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:32,071
... I should personally tell you all.

622
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,536
(A place to rest in the sky)

623
00:41:36,304 --> 00:41:39,406
So that's why he noticed
every tiny detail.

624
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:41,422
From your new hairstyle...

625
00:41:41,547 --> 00:41:42,981
... to him getting an ear-piercing.

626
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,860
We're so oblivious...

627
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,814
... and were making bets about it.

628
00:41:47,899 --> 00:41:50,603
I feel sorry for him.
He must have gone through a lot.

629
00:41:50,793 --> 00:41:55,322
Manager Lee, will it be okay if people
find out about Mr. Seo's condition?

630
00:41:55,443 --> 00:41:56,942
Of course, it won't be okay.

631
00:41:57,131 --> 00:42:00,953
I'm sure he's willing to take the risks
to get what he wants.

632
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:02,797
Why would it not be okay?

633
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,318
I better be okay.

634
00:42:05,403 --> 00:42:08,372
If something happens, I won't sit back.

635
00:42:08,577 --> 00:42:11,804
I'll show then what the Strategic
Planning team is capable of.

636
00:42:13,912 --> 00:42:15,792
Manager Lee, are you crying?

637
00:42:15,988 --> 00:42:16,829
I'm not.

638
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,713
-Yes, you are.
-I said I'm not crying.

639
00:42:18,798 --> 00:42:19,669
Manager Lee.

640
00:42:20,268 --> 00:42:22,162
I'm not crying.

641
00:42:23,404 --> 00:42:24,410
It's okay.

642
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,610
Wait for me. Wait for me.

643
00:42:29,653 --> 00:42:30,871
Wait for me.

644
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:35,525
You did a great job.

645
00:42:36,285 --> 00:42:37,799
I didn't do much.

646
00:42:38,082 --> 00:42:38,972
That's right.

647
00:42:39,303 --> 00:42:40,812
I did all the hard work.

648
00:42:42,653 --> 00:42:43,523
Well...

649
00:42:43,815 --> 00:42:44,958
That, I agree.

650
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:46,363
You did well.

651
00:42:47,784 --> 00:42:49,833
Can you not use the past tense?

652
00:42:49,918 --> 00:42:51,544
I'll still have a lot of work to do.

653
00:42:51,628 --> 00:42:52,616
What can you do?

654
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,306
Your boss keeps giving you more work.

655
00:42:55,644 --> 00:42:56,700
It's fine.

656
00:42:57,148 --> 00:42:59,027
It's an investment for my future.

657
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:01,912
You need to be the CEO
so that I can become a president.

658
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,729
I'll make sure that it'll go smoothly.

659
00:43:07,307 --> 00:43:08,464
I'm a genius, you know.

660
00:43:08,592 --> 00:43:09,505
I'm competent.

661
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:11,000
Have you still not given up on that dream?

662
00:43:11,085 --> 00:43:12,184
It's not a dream.

663
00:43:12,269 --> 00:43:14,256
It's a realistic goal.

664
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,209
I think...

665
00:43:16,331 --> 00:43:18,713
... word will slowly start leaking by now.

666
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,040
What's your next plan?

667
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:21,461
Next...

668
00:43:23,926 --> 00:43:25,102
... we wait.

669
00:43:28,382 --> 00:43:29,231
What?

670
00:43:29,828 --> 00:43:31,720
Face blindness?

671
00:43:31,805 --> 00:43:34,692
Yes. He told his staff about it today.

672
00:43:34,776 --> 00:43:35,885
Personally.

673
00:43:37,935 --> 00:43:39,819
Is it a serious illness?

674
00:43:40,853 --> 00:43:43,748
I'm bad at recognizing people too, though.

675
00:43:44,029 --> 00:43:45,036
So?

676
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:47,257
What is it exactly like?

677
00:43:47,498 --> 00:43:49,481
Does he have bad eyesight or something?

678
00:43:49,566 --> 00:43:50,772
Explain so that I can understand.

679
00:43:50,856 --> 00:43:54,585
All I know is that he can't tell
who's who by just looking at their faces.

680
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:55,648
What?

681
00:43:57,894 --> 00:44:00,577
Then again, the symptoms
are not important.

682
00:44:00,735 --> 00:44:03,167
What matters is that he has an illness.

683
00:44:03,252 --> 00:44:05,811
How can we entrust the company
to a sick person?

684
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:08,652
We can't. It's a bad idea.

685
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:13,516
This must be what Choi Kiho
has been keeping from me.

(Director Kim, T'road Airline)

688
00:44:26,156 --> 00:44:28,395
Hello, Mr. Choi. Have you heard the news?

689
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,480
-What news?
-You know...

690
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:34,354
Apparently, Mr. Seo has a sad story.

691
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,673
I feel so sorry for him.

692
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,467
He...  What is it called, again?

693
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:40,716
Prosopagnosia.

694
00:44:40,868 --> 00:44:43,532
Prosopagnosia? That one.

695
00:44:43,821 --> 00:44:46,077
He already revealed...

696
00:44:46,162 --> 00:44:48,273
... the card you've been holding.

697
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:52,321
Mr. Seo is truly impressive.

698
00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:54,143
Did he reveal it himself?

699
00:44:54,227 --> 00:44:56,014
Yes, he did.

700
00:44:56,678 --> 00:44:57,828
Oh no.

701
00:44:57,913 --> 00:44:59,913
You must be very disappointed.

702
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,209
See?

703
00:45:03,294 --> 00:45:05,680
You should've told me
from the very beginning.

704
00:45:05,863 --> 00:45:08,253
Business is all about collaboration.

706

-You're not allowed to enter...
-Let me go.

708
00:45:30,246 --> 00:45:32,246
It's okay. You may leave.

709
00:45:33,488 --> 00:45:34,496
Yes, ma'am.

710
00:45:38,412 --> 00:45:40,359
Isn't it basic manner to knock first?

711
00:45:40,443 --> 00:45:41,897
Why did you reveal it this way?

712
00:45:42,797 --> 00:45:43,967
Are you insane?

713
00:45:47,508 --> 00:45:49,091
You said it was a gift.

714
00:45:51,154 --> 00:45:53,394
It's my right to use it however I want.

715
00:45:55,654 --> 00:45:57,079
Or was it a bomb?

716
00:45:57,902 --> 00:46:00,516
Then, I threw it at you.

717
00:46:00,601 --> 00:46:01,513

718
00:46:01,598 --> 00:46:02,503
I...

719
00:46:04,087 --> 00:46:05,566
I'm not marrying you.

720
00:46:08,152 --> 00:46:09,914
You've really lost your mind.

721
00:46:10,246 --> 00:46:12,835
I helped you out of pity.
But this is how you repay me?

722
00:46:12,982 --> 00:46:14,649
You really don't know what's scary, right?

723
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:15,918
I do know.

724
00:46:17,336 --> 00:46:19,589
I almost joined your side.

725
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:24,030
That's what's really scary.

726
00:46:24,237 --> 00:46:26,237
Don't push my limits.

727
00:46:26,712 --> 00:46:29,031
I went easy on you
because you're a woman.

729

What's going on between you two?

732

I called him here.

733
00:46:38,573 --> 00:46:39,905
I have something to send.

734
00:46:41,214 --> 00:46:43,711
I had my doubts, but I guess I was right.

735
00:46:43,796 --> 00:46:46,727
You caused all this mess
because of some guy?

736
00:46:46,812 --> 00:46:48,635
Kang Sara, are you serious?

737
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,348
Do you really think
it's just because of one guy?

738
00:46:51,432 --> 00:46:53,733
There are many guys involved in this.

Are you okay?

740
00:47:09,722 --> 00:47:10,989
I'm not okay.

741
00:47:15,574 --> 00:47:18,420
I wanted to show you
what I was throwing away.

742
00:47:19,926 --> 00:47:21,316
That's why I called you here.

743
00:47:23,054 --> 00:47:24,137
I also...

744
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:29,452
I also want to throw away everything.

745
00:47:30,821 --> 00:47:31,966

00:47:58,032 --> 00:47:59,595
So, I'm terminating our contract.

754
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,517
Go ahead.

755
00:48:04,355 --> 00:48:07,310
I don't think you
understand the situation.

756
00:48:08,294 --> 00:48:09,429
You're sick.

757
00:48:10,662 --> 00:48:12,744

Our agreement is void.

But you've got some nerves.

What?

767
00:48:38,464 --> 00:48:39,391
You've been nice?

768
00:48:39,575 --> 00:48:41,414
Why do you think I was easy on you?

769
00:48:42,595 --> 00:48:44,021
Because you can help me?

770
00:48:44,574 --> 00:48:45,987
Because I was scared of you?

771
00:48:46,953 --> 00:48:47,961
Not at all.

My fans need to see my face
to feel reassured.

I have no excuse.

But still, your boyfriend this time
is worth fighting for.

824

I'll pay for it.

I know.

No, I'm not busy. Why?

00:52:02,279 --> 00:52:03,419
Later, when I have time.

837
00:52:09,768 --> 00:52:12,173
I'm such a lucky girl.

838
00:52:13,202 --> 00:52:15,935
I'm being loved by people unconditionally.

839
00:52:16,881 --> 00:52:18,719
I'm such a lucky guy.

840
00:52:19,412 --> 00:52:22,661
I'm being loved by a girl
who's being loved unconditionally.

841
00:52:24,592 --> 00:52:26,228
What about you?

842
00:52:27,016 --> 00:52:29,016
Did anything special happen today?

843
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:30,312
Well...

844
00:52:31,558 --> 00:52:32,939
I did some cleaning up.

845
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,024
I'm so proud of you.

846
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:37,660
You cleaned by yourself.

847
00:52:47,887 --> 00:52:49,691
I have something I want to ask you.

848
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,020
Your illness...

849
00:52:56,112 --> 00:52:58,788
Can you tell me how you got it?

850
00:53:00,368 --> 00:53:02,997
I'm afraid it's too painful for you
to remember.

851
00:53:05,296 --> 00:53:07,345
So I couldn't ask you.

852
00:53:13,744 --> 00:53:15,744
My father was a sculptor.

853
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:18,727
He had always been...

854
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:21,101
... a free-spirited person.

855
00:53:22,336 --> 00:53:24,336
While he was still married to my mom...

856
00:53:25,281 --> 00:53:26,995
... he left for Europe alone.

857
00:53:27,681 --> 00:53:29,092
He left both me and my mom behind...

858
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:31,210
... and just left.

859
00:53:33,286 --> 00:53:35,920
But nonetheless,
he was still a father to me.

860
00:53:37,806 --> 00:53:40,511
While living our own lives
like strangers...

861
00:53:42,048 --> 00:53:44,772
I heard that my father
was in critical condition.

862
00:53:46,162 --> 00:53:47,301
Before he died...

863
00:53:48,387 --> 00:53:50,289
... he said he wanted to see me.

864
00:54:09,105 --> 00:54:10,145
I just arrived.

865
00:54:10,825 --> 00:54:12,707
I'm on my way out
after stopping by the hotel.

866
00:54:13,156 --> 00:54:14,997
I'm heading straight
to the hospital where he's at.

867
00:54:15,082 --> 00:54:16,691
I'll head over as soon as I can.

868
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:17,898
I'm sorry.

869
00:54:17,983 --> 00:54:19,469
I'll go first and wait for you.

870
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,198
Please...

871
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:22,759
... don't be late.

872
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:02,051
Oh my gosh.

873
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:03,048
What happened?

874
00:55:03,132 --> 00:55:04,164
Call 911.

875
00:55:04,197 --> 00:55:05,704
Call the ambulance.

876
00:55:05,796 --> 00:55:06,922
He's badly hurt.

877
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:08,253
Call for an ambulance.

878
00:55:10,806 --> 00:55:13,188
-Is he okay?
-There has just been an accident.

879
00:55:13,273 --> 00:55:14,095
What's the address here?

880
00:55:14,224 --> 00:55:16,262
-97, Prince Street.
-It's 97...

881
00:55:19,281 --> 00:55:20,398
Is she okay?

882
00:55:21,095 --> 00:55:22,344
Oh my gosh. Someone call 911.

883
00:55:22,429 --> 00:55:23,347
Ma'am?

884
00:55:23,432 --> 00:55:24,526
Ma'am, are you hurt?

885
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:30,093
Are you hurt? Ma'am?

886
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:42,577
What happened?

887
00:55:42,661 --> 00:55:43,563
It was a car crash.

888
00:55:43,647 --> 00:55:44,934
He lost a lot of blood.

889
00:55:45,464 --> 00:55:47,293
His blood pressure is really weak.

890
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:49,039
We must get him to surgery right now.

891
00:55:49,124 --> 00:55:50,215
Go faster.

892
00:55:51,002 --> 00:55:52,224
Please stay with us.

893
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:53,752
Hurry. Hurry.

894
00:55:53,861 --> 00:55:55,123
Come on.

895
00:55:55,256 --> 00:55:56,277
-Run.
-Go ahead.

896
00:55:56,362 --> 00:55:57,344
Run!

897
00:56:51,129 --> 00:56:52,279
Dojae...

898
00:57:00,888 --> 00:57:02,145
Dojae.

899
00:57:05,518 --> 00:57:06,676
Dojae...

900
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:42,025
My son...

901
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:45,406
You should get up soon.

902
00:58:49,346 --> 00:58:51,173
Wake up...

903
00:58:53,316 --> 00:58:55,033
... and meet your dad.

904
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:36,743
Can you hear me?

905
00:59:36,827 --> 00:59:38,042
Give me some signal.

906
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:39,310
Are his pupils normal?

907
00:59:39,395 --> 00:59:40,341
Yes, normal.

908
00:59:40,463 --> 00:59:42,379
What about his heartbeat? Is it stable?

909
00:59:42,844 --> 00:59:44,372
-Yes, stable.
-Dojae.

910
00:59:46,495 --> 00:59:47,578
Who...

911
00:59:49,609 --> 00:59:50,487
... are you?

912
01:00:02,734 --> 01:00:04,333
And like that, ten years passed by.

913
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:19,533
I...

914
01:00:22,282 --> 01:00:24,034
I need to go home.

915
01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:25,948
Now?

916
01:00:32,107 --> 01:00:34,371
I have something to do.

917
01:00:37,847 --> 01:00:39,085
I'm sorry.

918
01:00:39,882 --> 01:00:41,020
I'll take you home.

919
01:00:41,105 --> 01:00:42,007
No.

920
01:00:43,321 --> 01:00:44,330
It's fine.

921
01:00:46,089 --> 01:00:47,366
Then, I'll just walk you
to the front door.

922
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:49,279
It's okay. I can go out on my own.

923
01:00:50,155 --> 01:00:51,447
I can go alone.

924
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:53,612
Is it something urgent?

925
01:00:55,614 --> 01:00:56,483
Yes.

926
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,152
It's urgent.

927
01:01:00,222 --> 01:01:01,182
I forgot...

928
01:01:04,837 --> 01:01:06,382
I forgot to do something.

929
01:01:09,377 --> 01:01:11,055
I guess this is one of the downside...

930
01:01:11,453 --> 01:01:12,715
... of having a famous girlfriend.

931
01:01:15,153 --> 01:01:16,315
Take care on your way home.

932
01:01:16,745 --> 01:01:18,207
Call me when you get home.

933
01:01:52,392 --> 01:01:53,285
You...

934
01:01:55,222 --> 01:01:57,639
... don't know how to differentiate
people's faces, right?

935
01:01:57,770 --> 01:01:58,927
How much do you recognize?

936
01:01:59,012 --> 01:02:00,416
Do you recognize your family?

937
01:02:02,731 --> 01:02:05,615
-Can I help you?
-Don't I look better than her?

938
01:02:08,562 --> 01:02:09,734
But can you tell the difference?

939
01:02:10,023 --> 01:02:11,905
You don't know how I feel
right now, do you?

940
01:02:12,605 --> 01:02:13,438
Right.

941
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,731
You can't even remember me anyway.

942
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,874
I practiced as I watched them.

943
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:27,264
I practiced distinguishing people.

944
01:02:27,645 --> 01:02:29,116
Although it was no use.

945
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:32,143
From that day on,
I have never loved myself.

946
01:02:32,411 --> 01:02:33,624
Ever.

947
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,592
How am I supposed to say it?

948
01:02:38,019 --> 01:02:40,019
When I'm a total mess?

949
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:41,670
I'm not okay.

950
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,988
It's not okay for me.

951
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,176
I want to see you.

952
01:02:47,976 --> 01:02:49,478
I want to recognize you.

953
01:02:52,854 --> 01:02:54,729
What should I do?

954
01:02:57,055 --> 01:02:59,759
I feel so guilty. What should I do?

955
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:28,513
I don't deserve to be with him.

956
01:03:28,834 --> 01:03:30,319
How dare I smile?

957
01:03:30,403 --> 01:03:32,189
How dare I be happy?

958
01:03:32,712 --> 01:03:35,300
I don't deserve it all.

959
01:04:26,731 --> 01:04:29,879
(Uncle)

960
01:04:38,697 --> 01:04:40,308
Did you get home safely?

961
01:04:43,824 --> 01:04:46,017
I should've taken you home.

962
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:49,744
I keep regretting letting
you leave like that.

963
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:00,354
Han Segye?

964
01:05:01,841 --> 01:05:03,186
Seo Dojae...

965
01:05:03,977 --> 01:05:05,290
... listen carefully.

966
01:05:09,999 --> 01:05:12,659
You became like that because of me.

967
01:05:14,006 --> 01:05:15,464
What do you mean?

968
01:05:16,784 --> 01:05:19,364
It's my fault that you became like that.

969
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:51,358
(Beauty Inside)

970
01:05:51,477 --> 01:05:54,598
It's all my fault
that you have to live this way.

971
01:05:54,682 --> 01:05:57,860
Saving your life was the best thing
I've ever done in my life.

972
01:05:57,944 --> 01:05:59,811
I don't know who else to call,

973
01:05:59,895 --> 01:06:01,253
that's why I called you.

974
01:06:01,338 --> 01:06:02,716
I feel less lonely now.

975
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,369
So this woman can't live without me.

976
01:06:05,637 --> 01:06:09,258
We can't be happy if we are together.

977
01:06:09,342 --> 01:06:11,887
That's our destiny. An ill-fated one.

978
01:06:11,971 --> 01:06:13,469
I know you love me.

979
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:14,476
Let's...

980
01:06:15,281 --> 01:06:16,319
...  break up.
