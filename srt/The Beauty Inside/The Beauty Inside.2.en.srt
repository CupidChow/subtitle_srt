1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,834
I fall under a spell once a month.

2
00:00:15,534 --> 00:00:18,235
Not those spells from fairytale.

3
00:00:18,634 --> 00:00:20,135
A real spell.

4
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:39,801
Oh, gosh! Scared me!

5
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:45,435
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding me right now?

6
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:48,601
Once a month, for a week,

7
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,801
I live as another person.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,200
Different sex,

9
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:12,634
different age...

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,601
...and different native.

11
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:28,201
-How much is this?
-To go, please.

12
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,300
The food here is really great!

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,201
The food was so good.

14
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:37,667
-Thank you. Take care.
-Good bye.

15
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:56,835
At first, I wanted to die.

16
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:59,434
Then, I wanted to live.

17
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:03,231
-This is it for...
-...today's Han Segye.

18
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,436
-This is it for...
-...today's Han Segye.

19
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:09,333
All the faces that wanted
to live, were me.

20
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,326
-This is it for...
-...today's Han Segye.

21
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:48,028
But now,

22
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:50,615
I just wanted to be disappear.

23
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:51,917
What should I do?

24
00:02:52,198 --> 00:02:54,819
I'll count to five and if you don't
answer by then, I'll smash this door.

25
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,127
One,

26
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:57,918
two,

27
00:02:58,799 --> 00:02:59,712
three,

28
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:02,420
four, five.

29
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:09,999
Ms. Han Segye.

30
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,094
Are you alright?

31
00:03:18,787 --> 00:03:20,491
Please help me.

32
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:24,195
Please cover me.

33
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:27,393
-Please bring a blanket.
-Yes, sir.

34
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:34,506
Here...

35
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:49,292
Why did I turn myself and
see you at that moment?

36
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,084
Those eyes that were looking
at me didn't flinch at all.

37
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:57,386
Why?

38
00:03:58,776 --> 00:03:59,583
Why...

39
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:38,917
I don't know what's going on but you
don't have to tell me what's going on.

40
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,211
I'm not really interested.

41
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,994
So...

42
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,785
...just walk and trust me.

43
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:33,959
In the plane, she suddenly...

44
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:36,063
She does this sometime.
I guess she's too tired.

45
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:36,952
Let's go.

46
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,799
What happened, sir?

47
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:01,894
I don't know too.

48
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,695
Is she Ms. Han Segye?

49
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:09,203
I guess.

50
00:06:09,989 --> 00:06:10,901
Maybe.

51
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:28,479
Are you okay?

52
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:30,574
I got caught.

53
00:06:31,075 --> 00:06:31,982
What?

54
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,179
I think I did.

55
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:45,968
(Sunho)

56
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,043
Good morning, Mr. Seo!

57
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:01,146
Yes, good morning.

58
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:02,456
Secretary Jung.

59
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:17,811
How did you know it was me?

60
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:19,518
Are you joking?

61
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:21,019
I'm not joking.

62
00:07:21,314 --> 00:07:23,123
I even changed my part of hair.

63
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:24,527
Your loafers.

64
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:28,017
Those are the loafers that you
took it from me as your birthday gift.

65
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:31,617
-Correct.
-Are you having fun?

66
00:07:31,697 --> 00:07:34,815
I'm the type who enjoy work.

67
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,557
S has came to work! S has came to work!

68
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,471
Why are we putting on our name card for?

69
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:10,174
Don't tell me our boss can't
remember his employees' names.

70
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,682
No way. He's too perfect.

71
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:14,576
Gosh, perfect my butt.

72
00:08:14,664 --> 00:08:16,468
He's just pretending.

73
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,269
He just learned weird
thing from somewhere.

74
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:23,268
How was your trip for the meeting?

75
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:25,164
Congratulations for
accomplishing the contract, sir!

76
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:26,559
It's too early to celebrate.

77
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,388
I'm sorry, sir.

78
00:08:39,492 --> 00:08:42,700
I took out my name card for a while
because I had to go outside...

79
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:46,195
Have you changed your hair, Sujeong?

80
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:47,798
I almost couldn't recognize you.

81
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,488
Manager Lee.

82
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,297
Please submit about the Russian
route that we talked about last time,

83
00:08:54,385 --> 00:08:56,590
-as soon as you're done with it.
-Yes, sir.

84
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,801
Gee, Mr. Seo is so perfect.

85
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:09,406
He has sharp eyes maybe
because he's handsome.

86
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:11,209
How is that even related?

87
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:14,706
Even Sujeong's boyfriend can't
recognize, yet he does.

88
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,114
He's so odd.

89
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:18,918
He even has fishes in his office.

90
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:20,406
So odd.

91
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,888
-Why didn't you help me?
-You aren't a kid.

92
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:32,190
You can handle that kind of thing.

93
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:35,697
No, I can't handle. Take care of me.

94
00:09:35,793 --> 00:09:37,492
I'm in danger in every business.

95
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:39,500
Just check the fishes properly.

96
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:43,692
Ddolki, Ddeongee, Hochi, Saechomi.

97
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:47,891
If I check, can you even correct me?

98
00:09:47,979 --> 00:09:49,686
Are you watching me because you know?

99
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:56,981
Drago, Yorong, Macho. Oh, hello, Mimi.

100
00:09:58,068 --> 00:10:00,275
When's my next schedule with
Professor Oh for counsel?

101
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,963
Five days from now. At 10 o’ clock in
No. 1401, Sunho Hotel

102
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:08,560
Mungchi, Kiki.

103
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,755
By the way,

104
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:15,152
she sounded like other person's voice.

105
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,453
Her expression looked afraid
as if she saw something scary.

106
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,350
Maybe she was scared of you.

107
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,652
Oh, my gosh.

108
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:23,962
How scary.

109
00:10:25,143 --> 00:10:27,049
Anyway, she's weird.

110
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:30,149
You already know there're
lots of weird things.

111
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,747
Yes.

112
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:36,048
Nothing weird about her.
Because I'm the weirdest.

113
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:40,642
Why?

114
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,639
Are you now pitying me?
Are you moved to sympathy?

115
00:10:43,724 --> 00:10:45,240
You want to be nice to me, right?

116
00:10:45,838 --> 00:10:48,030
You haven't checked with
Kangdari and Jingjingee.

117
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,725
Kangdari and Jingjingee. Are you happy?

118
00:10:52,924 --> 00:10:54,329
But you know what?

119
00:10:55,106 --> 00:10:56,915
-Han Segye doesn't have any child.
-So?

120
00:10:57,018 --> 00:10:59,018
-Just saying.
-That's good.

121
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:02,624
If that was true, we would've had to take
the risk to take care of the scandal.

122
00:11:04,212 --> 00:11:07,227
Shouldn't you take care of that first
before you take care of the scandal?

123
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,648
Have you checked his fellow rider?

124
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,051
According to the cabin
crews who were on board,

125
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,655
she's Han Segye.

126
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:23,040
Han Segye?

127
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,849
That actress? The model of T'road Airline?

128
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:28,757
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

129
00:11:28,852 --> 00:11:30,955
I have done checking
the list of passengers.

130
00:11:35,443 --> 00:11:37,456
You went to the trip secretly.

131
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:39,162
And you brought a gift.

132
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:41,051
I didn't know you have this kind of hobby.

133
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:44,341
-How interesting.
-And...

134
00:11:44,444 --> 00:11:46,650
...I heard there was a small
disturbance in the cabin.

135
00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:48,844
Han Segye abruptly ran into the toilet....

136
00:11:48,937 --> 00:11:51,744
...during the flight and never came out.

137
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:55,437
I guess they had a love fight or whatever.

138
00:11:56,429 --> 00:11:57,646
Good job.

139
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:10,613
What's valuable and precious...

140
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:12,998
...you had to cover with the blanket?

141
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:22,120
How dare you put hands on my body!

142
00:12:22,215 --> 00:12:24,708
Let go! Let me go!

143
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:27,319
You imbeciles! Darn you all!

144
00:12:27,415 --> 00:12:29,415
I belong to your highness!

145
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:31,326
I'm his woman!

146
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:33,535
Your highness! Your highness!

147
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:35,924
Please spare my life...

148
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:40,123
It's me, sire. It's Okjung.

149
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:43,417
Your highness...

150
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:52,292
You're watching it again?

151
00:12:52,681 --> 00:12:54,484
Aren't sick of your debut work?

152
00:12:54,588 --> 00:12:57,495
Why do you open your eyes in the morning?
Aren't you sick of it?

153
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,098
Why did you mess with her
when you know you can't win?

154
00:13:01,677 --> 00:13:02,995
-Yes.
-Right, right.

155
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:07,690
I'll be a spirit that wonders
around Hades and rip you apart...

156
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,295
By the way, it's really fascinating.

157
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,696
Look how she recognize
her because she feeds her.

158
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:17,196
She feeds her?
I'm the who feeds her everyday.

159
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,689
And I'm the one who feeds you.

160
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,697
I always thank you for your kindness.

161
00:13:24,782 --> 00:13:27,385
When will you stop taking
your friend's money?

162
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,380
What do you mean taking?

163
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:31,795
I'm getting paid rightfully
as a housekeeper.

164
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,184
If you are still going to come in and out,
then why don't you change that bulb?

165
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:39,279
Leave it. I left it,
so I can change when I grow taller.

166
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:42,776
How nice for you to be
able to grow taller.

167
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:47,076
Why did you change again?

168
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:48,981
You already changed last time.

169
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:58,891
It supposed to be around this time.
Last time was irregular.

170
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,992
Why did I change on the
ceremony out of all occasions?

171
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:09,787
Last time wasn't enough so this
time is going to be dramatic.

172
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:10,988
Dramatic?

173
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,099
-Yes, she was discovered.
-Oh, she was discovered...

174
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:15,488
What?

175
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:18,092
What's his intention?

176
00:14:18,894 --> 00:14:20,687
Why is he so quite?

177
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:23,289
-Who's he?
-It's unbelievable.

178
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,487
How can he believe how it just changed?

179
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:28,879
Normal person couldn't
believe even if he saw it.

180
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:30,578
"Am I crazy?"

181
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:33,381
-That's what he would think.
-Right?

182
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:35,579
I don't have to worry about it, right?

183
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:38,271
As long as you don't show
yourself in front of him too much.

184
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:41,382
It's just for a week. After a week,
that face will no longer exist.

185
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:44,460
-Who's he?
-Gosh! You...

186
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:47,167
(Seo Dojerk)

187
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,665
What? What?

188
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:50,363
(Seo Dojerk)

189
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:55,062
Hey, hey! Hang...

190
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:56,657
Hang up, hang up.

191
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,261
Hey, hang up. Hang up!

192
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:02,459
No!

193
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,750
Ms. Han Segye can't answer
your phone right now.

194
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:07,853
She just went inside to take a shower.

195
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,354
Yes.

196
00:15:09,553 --> 00:15:11,156
Please call again next time.

197
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:15,947
Are you crazy? Why did you tell him
like that? Why that genre out of all?

198
00:15:18,344 --> 00:15:20,836
It's all over. Pack your stuff.

199
00:15:20,932 --> 00:15:23,834
-It's time to retire for real.
-What?

200
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:25,428
What's wrong? I solved it for you!

201
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:29,325
You're so naive you don't even
know what you just talked about.

202
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:32,117
What? What's going on? What?

203
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:34,220
You won't know even if we tell
you, you punk!

204
00:15:36,322 --> 00:15:37,218
By the way,

205
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:40,527
why do I feel like I have forgotten
something important since just now?

206
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:42,934
Forgotten about what? Feeding your dog?

207
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:44,442
I said I just fed her.

208
00:15:44,521 --> 00:15:46,330
Can you stop talking nonsense?

209
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:52,431
A man?

210
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,965
She just went inside to take a shower.

211
00:16:07,164 --> 00:16:08,267
Take a shower?

212
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:23,268
Please help me.

213
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:27,069
Please cover me.

214
00:16:28,356 --> 00:16:29,867
Strange woman...

215
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:20,230
She's making me concerning for nothing.

216
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:22,032
Should I just throw it away?

217
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:30,914
I just called you to check whether
you've arrived home safely.

218
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:32,509
It didn't mean anything.

219
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:35,509
So do you know or not?

220
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:38,704
Gosh, scared me...

221
00:17:38,803 --> 00:17:40,413
And please come to get your stuff back.

222
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:41,905
Before I get rid of it.

223
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:44,496
My office is too small to store it.

224
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:48,597
I wondered what I forgot about.

225
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:51,395
Where are my senses?

226
00:17:54,082 --> 00:17:56,090
(Yoo Woomi)

227
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,467
(Ryu Eunho)

228
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:08,680
I'll get rid of it,
if you don't answer me within a minute.

229
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:10,783
Sure...

230
00:18:11,575 --> 00:18:15,091
Just get rid of...

231
00:18:16,273 --> 00:18:17,284
Get rid of...

232
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:29,401
Get rid of...

233
00:18:33,683 --> 00:18:35,489
Oh, gosh!

234
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:44,184
I'll go within an hour.

235
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:48,083
30 minutes.

236
00:18:51,586 --> 00:18:54,594
Number of people who have
departed for this third quarter...

237
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,096
...has increased 2.5%
compared to last year.

238
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:59,096
-This month's sales...
-To the cafe in company.

239
00:18:59,184 --> 00:19:00,493
...currently achieved 82%,

240
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:04,512
-82% of the management plan.
-Okay...

241
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:09,206
Percentage...

242
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:11,517
82 percentage...

243
00:19:15,105 --> 00:19:17,811
Then it's possible to achieve 100%
until the end of this month, right?

244
00:19:17,891 --> 00:19:19,311
Of course, sir!

245
00:19:28,387 --> 00:19:29,506
What should I wear?

246
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:38,711
Not this. No, not this too.

247
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:45,210
This? No. This, this?

248
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,410
Not this too...

249
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,711
No.

250
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:54,398
This.

251
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,892
Is it too much?

252
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:14,990
This face will no longer
exist after a week anyway.

253
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:57,338
Ms. Han Segye.

254
00:20:58,521 --> 00:21:00,028
You came here by yourself.

255
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:04,131
You seemed very busy. You can't
even answer your own phone call.

256
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:07,431
You are 10 minutes late to be precisely.

257
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:10,138
You should buy the coffee since
I've been taking care of your stuff.

258
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,138
-Well...
-Why?

259
00:21:12,217 --> 00:21:14,130
You can't even pay for the coffee?

260
00:21:14,414 --> 00:21:15,630
It's not that...

261
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:21,436
Do you...

262
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:23,432
...know me?

263
00:21:28,615 --> 00:21:29,818
Please excuse me.

264
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,620
I got confused.

265
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:35,429
I work under Ms. Han.

266
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:41,423
Well, like a housekeeper.

267
00:21:42,121 --> 00:21:43,820
I came here for Ms. Han's request.

268
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:49,915
I'll deliver the luggage
safely to Ms. Han.

269
00:22:01,718 --> 00:22:03,233
Mommy!

270
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:09,531
It's dangerous to play in here.

271
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,946
Where is your mom?

272
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:25,685
Are you...

273
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,774
Are you this girl's mother?

274
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:34,181
This guy is talking about a child again!

275
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,585
I said I'm not a mother.
I don't have a child.

276
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:44,185
What are you going to say this time?

277
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:47,290
Don't say it.
I told you I don't have a child.

278
00:22:51,877 --> 00:22:54,785
-Jinyoung!
-Mommy!

279
00:22:56,468 --> 00:22:58,868
Thank you. Let's go.

280
00:23:01,366 --> 00:23:04,381
-Seems like there's a misunderstanding.
-You and your misunderstanding.

281
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,392
Wait.

282
00:23:21,082 --> 00:23:21,883
This.

283
00:23:22,772 --> 00:23:24,391
Isn't this yours?

284
00:23:27,978 --> 00:23:29,489
Give it to me. It's mine.

285
00:23:31,474 --> 00:23:33,778
Are you sure it's yours?

286
00:23:33,873 --> 00:23:35,889
-Yes, it is.
-Are you...

287
00:23:36,086 --> 00:23:38,189
-...certain?
-Yes, I am.

288
00:24:25,983 --> 00:24:28,101
I'm right. That's Han Segye.

289
00:24:33,284 --> 00:24:34,196
(Receipt)

290
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:35,998
(Signature : Han Segye)

291
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,592
-Oh, gosh!
-Hello.

292
00:24:44,093 --> 00:24:45,092
Have a great day.

293
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:50,988
She changed her worker again.

294
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,591
Changed again...

295
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:56,788
The person who comes to my house
everyday, can't recognize me.

296
00:24:57,384 --> 00:24:58,582
So cute.

297
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:06,674
Nobody recognizes me among these...

298
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,995
...many people.

299
00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:16,789
Whatever I do,

300
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:19,902
even if I die right now,

301
00:25:19,987 --> 00:25:21,902
nobody will find out.

302
00:25:22,593 --> 00:25:25,597
-But...
-But why did he call me Han Segye?

303
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:26,994
What?

304
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,888
Even though he recognized me, wouldn't
it be natural to think that I'm not?

305
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:38,391
You went where? Are you crazy?

306
00:25:40,685 --> 00:25:42,295
What were you thinking?

307
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,481
Do you want to get caught?

308
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:46,273
You didn't answer my call.

309
00:25:46,361 --> 00:25:49,376
Even if I didn't,
you should've waited until I did!

310
00:25:49,575 --> 00:25:53,575
You're comfortable living like this.
It's very livable, isn't it?

311
00:25:53,965 --> 00:25:54,980
You crazy witch.

312
00:25:55,084 --> 00:25:59,282
How can you say crazy witch to
someone who's way older than you?

313
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:02,574
-Oh, well, it's not that...
-It's fine.

314
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,677
I'm actually same age as her.

315
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,773
But my face changed suddenly.

316
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,876
What is she talking about?

317
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:12,868
Actually, I have a disease
that changes myself...

318
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:16,575
...to someone else once a month...

319
00:26:16,965 --> 00:26:19,480
Elder sis, you must be really drunk.

320
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,869
-You should've eaten some snacks too.
-You're right.

321
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:24,480
You should give her more snacks.

322
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:26,170
-Yes.
-She's very drunk.

323
00:26:28,842 --> 00:26:29,857
See?

324
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,763
I just told them the fact
but they don't believe me.

325
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,363
Yes, I shouldn't have mentioned.

326
00:26:36,463 --> 00:26:38,774
I even left my boyfriend and came here.

327
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:43,273
Hey, by the way,

328
00:26:43,358 --> 00:26:45,280
I have something to ask you.

329
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:48,081
Do you even have a boyfriend?

330
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:49,182
Gosh!

331
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:53,391
It just came in to my mind.

332
00:26:54,383 --> 00:26:56,478
What would it be like...

333
00:26:56,879 --> 00:26:59,180
...if there's another person...

334
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:04,183
...who can call me "Segye", even though
I look like this, other than you guys?

335
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:14,117
I know it's impossible.

336
00:27:15,918 --> 00:27:20,034
Even you guys who've been friends with
me for years, couldn't recognize me.

337
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:00,221
Woomi.

338
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,618
It's me.

339
00:28:04,824 --> 00:28:05,824
Woomi.

340
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:09,628
-Woomi.
-Why are you doing this?

341
00:28:09,716 --> 00:28:13,025
It's me, it's me! Please talk to me!

342
00:28:13,128 --> 00:28:15,344
Grandma, I think you
came to the wrong room!

343
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:19,238
It's me, Segye! Woomi, please!

344
00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:20,536
Woomi!

345
00:28:34,628 --> 00:28:36,731
What should I do?

346
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:39,135
What should I do?

347
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:22,107
Woomi!

348
00:29:30,452 --> 00:29:32,875
How, how did this...

349
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:34,371
What just happened...

350
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:36,471
How did you...

351
00:29:36,963 --> 00:29:39,280
Is that you, Segye?

352
00:29:39,971 --> 00:29:42,788
Segye, is it really you?

353
00:29:42,876 --> 00:29:44,979
Are you joking me? Are you joking me?

354
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:47,888
It's not a joke, you punk!

355
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,070
Hey, I just sensed it.

356
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,173
I sensed it.

357
00:29:55,562 --> 00:29:56,871
You should go.

358
00:30:00,557 --> 00:30:01,874
What's going on?

359
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,446
-What the heck!
-Hey.

360
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:13,843
It's me, Segye.

361
00:30:14,225 --> 00:30:15,733
I told you she changes.

362
00:30:15,836 --> 00:30:19,233
-Oh, so you can change to a man too.
-I guess.

363
00:30:19,328 --> 00:30:20,542
Close your legs...

364
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:21,653
-Oh, hey!
-I'm sorry.

365
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,851
-Where are you touching?
-Gosh.

366
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:27,240
It's a dream that I can wake up by death.

367
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:28,645
I'll see you guys later.

368
00:30:29,836 --> 00:30:31,550
It's not a dream, Eunho!

369
00:30:32,145 --> 00:30:34,753
-Hey, hey!
-Hey, it's not!

370
00:30:34,848 --> 00:30:36,451
It's a dream!

371
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,753
That's what happened...

372
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:40,949
That's what happened.

373
00:30:42,537 --> 00:30:45,750
If it's a dream,
I'm the one who wants to wake up.

374
00:30:46,452 --> 00:30:48,555
How am I going to live without you guys?

375
00:30:50,246 --> 00:30:53,752
When you become a priest and
you become a bride later,

376
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,263
how am I going to live alone?

377
00:30:56,343 --> 00:30:57,652
How are you alone?

378
00:30:58,255 --> 00:30:59,556
You have Kingkang.

379
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:03,354
Kingkang will visit
your lord before I do.

380
00:31:03,838 --> 00:31:07,665
Hey, I'm just getting married,
not getting into the prison.

381
00:31:07,752 --> 00:31:09,958
Gosh, you're talking nonsense.

382
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:16,456
Yes, I just talked
nonsense because I'm drunk.

383
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:19,939
I want to go back home because I'm drunk.

384
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,447
I'll pay for the bill!

385
00:31:23,535 --> 00:31:26,439
-Hey, let's go back together.
-Don't!

386
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:30,639
I'll be perfectly fine to walk
around alone with this face.

387
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,332
Please don't disturb
my freedom and romance.

388
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:37,641
You should get some rest staring
from tomorrow. You can have fun.

389
00:31:37,736 --> 00:31:40,137
-You don't get to have fun because of me.
-Hey,

390
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:43,542
-still...
-If you call me tomorrow, I'll fire you.

391
00:31:43,622 --> 00:31:44,752
You get it?

392
00:31:46,244 --> 00:31:49,641
Just for three days.
I'll take rest just for three days.

393
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:52,447
Bye.

394
00:31:52,932 --> 00:31:54,638
Call me when you get home!

395
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:59,923
Hey, she asked you to take one day
off and why did you say three days?

396
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,908
(Han Segye
Han Segye)

397
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:22,992
(Characteristic of Han Segye's housekeepr)

398
00:32:27,189 --> 00:32:29,395
That woman is never Han Segye.

399
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:31,887
She can never be Han Segye.

400
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:35,592
But why is she Han Segye?

401
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:38,877
Her foot size was approximately 240mm.

402
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:41,085
Fast and small steps.

403
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:42,990
Steady walk.

404
00:32:44,284 --> 00:32:45,593
Her hairstyle...

405
00:32:46,204 --> 00:32:48,603
It's too common and a lot of change.

406
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:51,096
Quite luxurious fabric.

407
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,992
According to its patterns,
I can assume it's a designer brand.

408
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:56,396
Her necklace...

409
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,492
This troubles my mind.

410
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:10,233
(Characteristic of Han Segye)

411
00:33:16,117 --> 00:33:17,424
Her voice...

412
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:19,313
Do you...

413
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,717
...know me?

414
00:33:24,997 --> 00:33:26,799
Please help me.

415
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,394
Please cover me.

416
00:33:33,481 --> 00:33:35,387
I should find out by
myself, if I'm curious.

417
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:06,264
I guess I had too much drinks.

418
00:34:06,955 --> 00:34:08,368
I'm seeing things.

419
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:15,980
He's not a hallucinations.

420
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,377
Gee, it hurts.

421
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:42,481
Here.

422
00:34:43,275 --> 00:34:44,076
Please use this.

423
00:34:51,273 --> 00:34:52,376
Thank you.

424
00:34:58,551 --> 00:34:59,352
Excuse me.

425
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,942
I planned to meet with Ms.
Han before I come.

426
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,543
-Pardon?
-Is Ms. Han inside?

427
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:16,448
-It's impossible.
-Why is it impossible?

428
00:35:17,154 --> 00:35:18,947
She didn't deliver me any message.

429
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:22,256
Then I'll call Ms. Han now.

430
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:27,354
Gosh, my phone! Where's my phone?

431
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,246
Oh, please come inside.

432
00:35:30,842 --> 00:35:32,637
Please wait inside.

433
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:41,651
Well, then.

434
00:36:03,551 --> 00:36:05,451
I guess her dog loves people.

435
00:36:05,547 --> 00:36:06,951
She doesn't seem shy.

436
00:36:07,444 --> 00:36:09,150
Normally, dogs follow their owners only.

437
00:36:10,944 --> 00:36:13,250
She has nice personality.

438
00:36:15,638 --> 00:36:17,146
It must be your day off.

439
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:19,033
-You drank.
-Pardon?

440
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:22,030
Oh, yes. Well...

441
00:36:23,824 --> 00:36:26,240
Would you like a cup of coffee?

442
00:36:26,336 --> 00:36:27,645
It's fine.

443
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:29,835
I'm not here to have a cup of coffee.

444
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:32,030
I'll call Ms. Han.

445
00:36:32,134 --> 00:36:33,935
-I can call her.
-No!

446
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,330
I'll call her. I will.

447
00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:38,732
Please sit down and wait.

448
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:57,078
Phone. My phone.

449
00:36:59,978 --> 00:37:02,875
Phone. Where is my phone?

450
00:37:03,456 --> 00:37:05,765
Gosh, phone. Where's my phone?

451
00:37:08,464 --> 00:37:09,859
I'm going insane!

452
00:37:20,663 --> 00:37:23,174
I didn't even drink that
much, but I feel sick.

453
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:27,782
I have weird feeling...

454
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:36,880
(Please enter the pass code)

455
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,389
So many clothes...

456
00:39:10,872 --> 00:39:12,483
What are you doing over there?

457
00:39:20,366 --> 00:39:23,167
Your voice is Han Segye's voice.

458
00:39:23,366 --> 00:39:24,969
But your clothes haven't changed.

459
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:33,985
Well, those clothes are
way too expensive for...

460
00:39:34,867 --> 00:39:36,771
...a housekeeper to wear.

461
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:40,275
Well, this...

462
00:39:40,362 --> 00:39:42,179
I found it strange.

463
00:39:47,376 --> 00:39:50,070
-It's same.
-What are you doing?

464
00:39:53,972 --> 00:39:54,987
Smell of alcohol.

465
00:39:56,066 --> 00:39:56,986
It's same.

466
00:40:02,587 --> 00:40:03,594
It's same.

467
00:40:07,096 --> 00:40:08,397
Who are you?

468
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,724
And who are you?

469
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:24,029
You asked a stranger if she's Han Segye.

470
00:40:24,617 --> 00:40:26,830
You are now asking Han Segye who is she.

471
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:30,229
You...

472
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:34,727
...don't know how to differentiate
people's face, right?

473
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:49,812
Which one?

474
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:52,907
Tell me which one is me among them.

475
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,706
If I say this is me,

476
00:40:58,508 --> 00:41:00,200
can you assure you can trust me?

477
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:10,732
So you went there alone?

478
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,647
-Recklessly.
-It wasn't reckless.

479
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:15,440
I had my plan.

480
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:20,148
So you planned and did
such reckless thing?

481
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,346
Are you my teacher? Stop scolding me.

482
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:26,139
You always dosomething to be scolded.

483
00:41:26,628 --> 00:41:28,827
That woman was really strange.

484
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:32,231
-What's so strange?
-It doesn't make sense and has no reason.

485
00:41:32,414 --> 00:41:34,822
But I keep feeling like
she's another person.

486
00:41:35,021 --> 00:41:36,830
So I fee like she's another person...

487
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:39,331
...and I feel like the other
people are the same person.

488
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:40,724
And they are all one person.

489
00:41:41,122 --> 00:41:43,716
Are you talking about love, not person?

490
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,328
Things that you're talking about is love.

491
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:50,130
It doesn't make sense and has no reason
but I see you in every other people.

492
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:11,503
For me, due to the posterior
brain damage by accident,

493
00:42:11,789 --> 00:42:15,400
the path of brain that connects the system
which analyze visual information...

494
00:42:15,485 --> 00:42:17,499
...of face and system of
memory, has been damaged.

495
00:42:18,095 --> 00:42:20,293
There's problem with remembering.

496
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,794
So like you have said before,

497
00:42:22,879 --> 00:42:24,887
I'm relying on the
information and training.

498
00:42:26,379 --> 00:42:28,379
Classify with secondary clues.

499
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:31,171
Thanks to consistent training,

500
00:42:31,264 --> 00:42:33,680
distinguishing a person with
elements other than face...

501
00:42:33,765 --> 00:42:36,868
...is superior to other
prosopagnosia patients.

502
00:42:37,669 --> 00:42:38,677
I see.

503
00:42:40,163 --> 00:42:41,970
I've been living like this for 10 years.

504
00:42:42,962 --> 00:42:46,562
What do you think of
my condition right now?

505
00:42:47,054 --> 00:42:48,857
May I know in which way?

506
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:53,166
There's something I'm
confused about lately.

507
00:42:53,961 --> 00:42:55,366
I keep seeing...

508
00:42:56,247 --> 00:42:58,866
...a person as someone who can never be.

509
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,369
Has it gotten worse?

510
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,274
Well, I'm not sure too.

511
00:43:09,067 --> 00:43:11,075
I'll give you one secret.

512
00:43:11,671 --> 00:43:13,575
If you can't distinguish with your eyes,

513
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:15,575
then don't distinguish with your eyes.

514
00:43:15,964 --> 00:43:17,170
What do you mean?

515
00:43:18,066 --> 00:43:22,780
Can't blind people love another person?

516
00:43:24,265 --> 00:43:27,568
Our emotions are sent to somewhere else,

517
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,179
not our eyes or brain.

518
00:43:30,267 --> 00:43:31,766
So it's more accurate.

519
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,128
Who are you?

520
00:44:21,484 --> 00:44:22,785
Hello, Ms. Vice chairwoman.

521
00:44:24,881 --> 00:44:25,681
Mother.

522
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:30,981
I'm here for the meeting.

523
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:33,180
Are you coming back from
meeting professor Oh?

524
00:44:33,272 --> 00:44:33,984
Yes.

525
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,087
You cut your hair.

526
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:41,482
I'm lucky to have a son who
can tell I've cut my hair.

527
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:45,183
-I'm sorry.
-If you're, then do me a favor.

528
00:44:45,278 --> 00:44:47,786
Meet minister Jo's daughter
at 2 o'clock today.

529
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,478
-Mother.
-You need to get back to your work, right?

530
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,978
Good luck.

531
00:44:53,768 --> 00:44:56,482
I should get going too.
I'll be late for the meeting.

532
00:45:12,284 --> 00:45:13,997
(Ms. Vice chairwoman)

533
00:45:16,379 --> 00:45:18,591
-Joohwan.
-Yes.

534
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,083
Do a good job.

535
00:45:20,781 --> 00:45:22,695
Chief Seo, Sunho Group and I,

536
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:25,402
everything is depended on you.

537
00:45:25,592 --> 00:45:27,408
-Yes.
-I can be upset...

538
00:45:27,488 --> 00:45:29,805
...over this kind of
thing more than 100 times.

539
00:45:30,498 --> 00:45:32,307
But Dojae has only one time.

540
00:45:32,395 --> 00:45:35,196
Everything will be over for
Dojae with that one time.

541
00:45:35,577 --> 00:45:37,999
-Yes, I understand.
-I'm depending on you.

542
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:42,793
Who was that?

543
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,291
From work.

544
00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:09,310
What should I do?

545
00:46:09,803 --> 00:46:12,017
What should I do with me?

546
00:46:14,112 --> 00:46:17,418
If I ever drink again,
then I'm not Han Segye.

547
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:19,815
Well, I'm not myself sometimes.

548
00:46:21,006 --> 00:46:26,202
How can you not know that? How can you?

549
00:46:29,602 --> 00:46:31,110
What do you mean what should I do?

550
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:35,712
What can he do? Can he report
this to the police? NIS? FBI...

551
00:46:37,514 --> 00:46:39,013
...is bit scary.

552
00:46:39,816 --> 00:46:42,419
Oh, gosh...

553
00:46:42,507 --> 00:46:43,919
Delivery!

554
00:46:45,516 --> 00:46:46,929
Delivery...

555
00:46:56,807 --> 00:46:58,807
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

556
00:46:59,997 --> 00:47:01,806
Wait!

557
00:47:02,005 --> 00:47:04,809
-May I have your autograph?
-Sure...

558
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,396
There you go.

559
00:47:12,784 --> 00:47:15,485
Please write, "To my beloved, Youngsoo."

560
00:47:17,081 --> 00:47:19,580
-Right, I changed back...
-Yes?

561
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:25,777
I just came back from
hard and tiring trip,

562
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,586
so I'm still having a jet lag.

563
00:47:27,674 --> 00:47:29,680
Then, I can't get your autograph?

564
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:32,482
Oh, my. Of course you can.

565
00:47:45,844 --> 00:47:48,859
"To my beloved Youngsoo."

566
00:47:49,756 --> 00:47:55,258
"Heart, kisses,
always be happy and a dot."

567
00:47:56,953 --> 00:48:01,460
My natural look right now is
a secret between you and me.

568
00:48:01,556 --> 00:48:03,857
-Secret...
-Got that, Youngsoo?

569
00:48:05,445 --> 00:48:06,253
Yes...

570
00:48:08,746 --> 00:48:09,547
Good bye.

571
00:48:11,942 --> 00:48:13,061
Yes!

572
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:16,061
Yes, I'm on my way.
I said I'm going now.

573
00:48:16,441 --> 00:48:18,656
She's not a child.
She can take care of her own meal.

574
00:48:20,145 --> 00:48:22,161
Don't swear at me. It's unpleasant.

575
00:48:22,844 --> 00:48:25,661
Okay. Okay!

576
00:48:48,897 --> 00:48:51,404
-Hey, open the door.
-It's you again.

577
00:48:53,002 --> 00:48:54,398
(Han Segye)

578
00:48:55,805 --> 00:48:57,805
-Who is this?
-Is she taking shower again?

579
00:48:58,297 --> 00:49:01,597
Why are you calling her when she's taking
shower? I guess you miss her so much.

580
00:49:01,693 --> 00:49:03,693
-Pardon?
-You can't even bear that?

581
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:06,798
-I think you're misunderstanding...
-I know.

582
00:49:06,997 --> 00:49:09,298
I miss you very much too.

583
00:49:12,092 --> 00:49:14,298
-I love you.
-Hello?

584
00:49:16,283 --> 00:49:17,299
Hello?

585
00:49:20,196 --> 00:49:21,791
Where were you?

586
00:49:26,073 --> 00:49:28,688
No, I think I got nothing else to day.

587
00:49:29,078 --> 00:49:30,077
I agree.

588
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:41,934
You don't remember, do you?
We've met before.

589
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,723
-Have we?
-Yes, we have.

590
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:48,327
We even said hello at Dongsung
Group cooperate party.

591
00:49:48,414 --> 00:49:50,517
Of course, I don't remember.

592
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,216
I'll tell...

593
00:49:53,096 --> 00:49:55,299
...Sunho Group's decision to my father.

594
00:50:08,504 --> 00:50:09,908
This restaurant makes grood coffee.

595
00:50:20,269 --> 00:50:22,975
You're here.
Sorry, I was erasing my makeup.

596
00:50:25,672 --> 00:50:27,878
Oh, it's hangover soup.

597
00:50:29,866 --> 00:50:31,566
(Han Segye)

598
00:50:37,948 --> 00:50:39,750
Wow, it looks good.

599
00:50:53,096 --> 00:50:55,498
What are you doing?
I'm back. You should say hello.

600
00:51:03,983 --> 00:51:06,286
-Where's your phone?
-My phone?

601
00:51:06,878 --> 00:51:08,784
I lost my phone because I
got too drunk last night.

602
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,082
If I changed to a man,
I would've gone to sauna with you.

603
00:51:16,876 --> 00:51:17,987
Do you want to go next month?

604
00:51:18,384 --> 00:51:21,393
-Don't you dare, you pervert.
-What?

605
00:51:21,884 --> 00:51:23,091
Why?

606
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:27,894
Call it. When I called
you, some man answered.

607
00:51:27,982 --> 00:51:30,080
Really? Maybe I've left
it at the cart bar.

608
00:51:35,746 --> 00:51:36,369
Yes.

609
00:51:37,073 --> 00:51:40,179
I'm the phone owner.
May I know who's answering the phone?

610
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:41,972
I'm the handkerchief owner.

611
00:51:47,258 --> 00:51:48,455
Ryu Eunho...

612
00:51:50,051 --> 00:51:51,765
Do you do everything as long as I pay you?

613
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:53,963
What do you take me for?

614
00:51:54,047 --> 00:51:55,864
What is it? I do everything.

615
00:51:56,348 --> 00:51:58,158
Can you steal one stuff for me?

616
00:51:58,546 --> 00:52:00,855
You're really taking me for something.

617
00:52:02,054 --> 00:52:04,149
Wake up. I'm Catholic.

618
00:52:04,252 --> 00:52:06,856
Exactly.
God will forgive you, if you pray.

619
00:52:06,943 --> 00:52:09,754
What is it this time? What did you do?

620
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,048
My phone is...

621
00:52:12,635 --> 00:52:16,044
...is in the wrong hand and in that phone,

622
00:52:16,631 --> 00:52:18,837
there's something that shouldn't be in.

623
00:52:18,925 --> 00:52:21,825
-What shouldn't be in?
-My videos...

624
00:52:22,111 --> 00:52:23,627
Your video?

625
00:52:24,524 --> 00:52:26,741
You're completely crazy, you pervert!

626
00:52:26,821 --> 00:52:30,241
You punk, what are you imagining?
I'm talking about my videos!

627
00:52:30,329 --> 00:52:32,337
The videos that I recorded
whenever I change my face!

628
00:52:32,433 --> 00:52:35,535
"Hello, I'm Han Segye. This is it for
today's Han Segye." These kinds of stuff!

629
00:52:37,231 --> 00:52:39,532
Okay, did you lock your phone?

630
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:42,033
Yes, I did, but...

631
00:52:44,223 --> 00:52:46,929
Oh, gosh. I can't. I should strike first.

632
00:52:47,025 --> 00:52:48,032
Drive for me.

633
00:52:49,214 --> 00:52:51,232
-Hey, finish your food.
-Come on, hurry!

634
00:52:56,121 --> 00:52:58,619
Wow, you did a good job.

635
00:52:58,704 --> 00:53:00,815
You ruined it very well.

636
00:53:00,905 --> 00:53:03,915
I always thank you for your
compliments and support.

637
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:05,719
(Enter the pass code)

638
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,021
(Incorrect pass code)

639
00:53:12,206 --> 00:53:13,411
No way...

640
00:53:19,204 --> 00:53:22,308
What's the point of locking if it's
this easy. What is she locking for?

641
00:53:26,379 --> 00:53:28,498
That man knows my weakness.

642
00:53:28,994 --> 00:53:30,994
I need to have his weakness too.

643
00:53:31,184 --> 00:53:32,993
Weakness? What weakness?

644
00:53:33,089 --> 00:53:35,793
Nothing. Everything makes
sense, if that's what happened.

645
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,110
So what makes sense?

646
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,607
It's a long story and I'm lazy to explain.

647
00:53:40,695 --> 00:53:42,504
You should be quiet and just drive.

648
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:47,408
What is it? I should know,
so I can be your accomplice or not.

649
00:54:07,926 --> 00:54:09,442
Hey, follow that car quickly!

650
00:54:09,529 --> 00:54:11,045
-That car?
-That one, that one.

651
00:54:27,507 --> 00:54:29,507

652
00:54:36,472 --> 00:54:38,289
I'm getting out.
You should just go back home.

653
00:54:38,369 --> 00:54:40,377
-What are you going to do?
-Checking.

654
00:55:10,174 --> 00:55:12,475
Can you lend me that for a while?

655
00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:14,776
-Pardon?
-Chief of strategic planning team?

656
00:55:14,864 --> 00:55:16,181
No, Chief of planning strategic team?

657
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:18,370
Anyway, I'm here to meet Mr. Seo Dojae.

658
00:55:24,982 --> 00:55:26,982
Yes, it's me.

659
00:55:27,085 --> 00:55:29,791
Please excuse me. I'll be right back.

660
00:55:30,584 --> 00:55:33,083
Oh my gosh, it is really her.

662
00:55:34,586 --> 00:55:35,990
Give me a minute.

663
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:42,091
Good thing that I wore a blouse today.

664
00:56:09,903 --> 00:56:10,720
By the way,

665
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:15,212
why is the receptionist
going to the designer team?

666
00:56:31,286 --> 00:56:32,889
Do you have something to say,

667
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:34,698
Ms. Han Segye?

668
00:56:37,077 --> 00:56:39,088
Stop challenging me.

669
00:57:06,447 --> 00:57:07,550
Really?

670
00:57:07,654 --> 00:57:09,447
What's going on?

671
00:57:09,543 --> 00:57:11,257
She's now the top search result.

672
00:57:16,354 --> 00:57:17,870
You're here, sir.

673

(Love trip of Seo Dojae and Han Segye)

674
00:57:32,217 --> 00:57:34,212
"As we checked,
the woman who rode together with..."

675
00:57:34,307 --> 00:57:35,712
"...chief Seo Dojae was
top star, Han Segye."

676
00:57:35,797 --> 00:57:37,908
"Meanwhile, actress Han is
currently on contract..."

677
00:57:38,003 --> 00:57:39,803
"...as a model of T'road
where chief Seo is."

678
00:57:39,891 --> 00:57:42,602
"When the public was uproarious about
Han's scandal, unlike other advertisers,"

679
00:57:42,687 --> 00:57:45,705
"only T'road extended the
contract and it caused questions."

680
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,402
You don't have to read it for me.

681
00:57:48,387 --> 00:57:50,005
Are you guys really dating?

682
00:57:52,089 --> 00:57:53,304
You think?

683
00:57:53,495 --> 00:57:56,098
-For now, you should take care of this.
-Who?

684
00:57:56,384 --> 00:57:58,592
-Ms. Han Segye?
-I mean the public.

686
00:58:12,205 --> 00:58:13,324
Taxi!

687
00:58:14,118 --> 00:58:15,221
Taxi.

688
00:58:19,644 --> 00:58:20,754
Taxi!

689
00:58:21,747 --> 00:58:22,556
Taxi...

690
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:24,350
Mister...

691
00:58:25,342 --> 00:58:27,151
Hey, is it for real?

692
00:58:27,549 --> 00:58:28,450
Unbelievable!

693
00:58:29,742 --> 00:58:32,146
Really? Han Segye is
dating with a millionaire?

694
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:33,749
The articles are up!

695
00:58:37,633 --> 00:58:39,633
Hey, there's Han Segye!

696
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:41,824
It's Han Segye!

697
00:58:42,316 --> 00:58:45,125
-Hey, don't!
-Are you guys really dating?

698
00:58:45,316 --> 00:58:47,011
When did you guys start to date?

699
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,416
-Hey, don't do that!
-What? They are dating!

700
00:58:56,712 --> 00:58:58,315
One, two, three!

701
00:59:56,887 --> 00:59:58,689
You asked me if I can trust you.

702
00:59:59,078 --> 01:00:00,792
I don't have any confident
to not trust you.

703
01:00:02,189 --> 01:00:05,196
-But it didn't make sense.
-It didn't make sense.

704
01:00:05,592 --> 01:00:07,401
Reason? I don't have one.

705
01:00:07,894 --> 01:00:09,298
But that's just how I felt.

706
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:12,997
To me, you were just you continuously.

707
01:00:23,898 --> 01:00:25,302
You've done it before
so you know what to do.

708
01:00:26,088 --> 01:00:28,509
Just walk and trust me.
