1
00:00:03,207 --> 00:00:05,405
Yeah, I just arrived.

2
00:00:08,604 --> 00:00:10,777
It's fine. It'll only take a moment.

3
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:12,876
Kingkang?

4
00:00:13,778 --> 00:00:15,449
Kingkang is still at Eunho's house.

5
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,325
My mom tidied up everything.

6
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:29,029
She organized everything...

7
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:31,511
...so I didn't have to do anything.

8
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:35,538
You know...

9
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:38,455
Mom's picture...

10
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,607
...and one of her flowerpot.

11
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:47,791
I'm in the house now.

12
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,613
I'll call you later.

13
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:55,245
Okay.

14
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,193
It's so peaceful without me.

15
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:13,907
My house.

16
00:01:24,642 --> 00:01:28,197
You drive me nuts.
I can't take this anymore.

17
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:33,060
Junk food again?

18
00:01:33,598 --> 00:01:36,282
Do the dishes right away
when you're done eating.

19
00:01:37,157 --> 00:01:38,715
It stinks.

20
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:20,723
Eat the side dishes on time
so you don't throw them away.

21
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:24,708
Understood or not?

22
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,388
She made a lot.

23
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:18,932
I told you to put your socks
in the laundry basket right away.

24
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:21,129
So dirty.

25
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,110
Han Segye, you're so dirty.

26
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,239
Why are soap operas
so predictable these days?

27
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:03,407
Segye, you don't do soap operas?

28
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:31,304
It's embarrassing to do this alone.

29
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:35,330
You are amazing.
How do you do this all the time?

30
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,031
Segye.

31
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:44,846
Have you eaten?

32
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:46,305
Yeah.

33
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,514
Did you make do with junk food again?

34
00:04:49,362 --> 00:04:51,779
You need to take care of your health
while you can.

35
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:54,561
Did you wash the dishes afterwards?

36
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:56,312
Yes, I did.

37
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:57,998
What about cleaning?

38
00:04:58,558 --> 00:04:59,495
And the laundry?

39
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:02,887
You always make me
tell you to do everything.

40
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:05,176
I've done all those too.

41
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:08,539
Are you going to sleep now?

42
00:05:09,468 --> 00:05:10,344
Yeah.

43
00:05:10,988 --> 00:05:12,141
Sleep tight.

44
00:05:12,517 --> 00:05:14,548
Sleep a sound, dreamless sleep.

45
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:16,412
You too, Mom.

46
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,647
Sleep a sound, dreamless sleep.

47
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:21,508
You did a great job today.

48
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,256
My precious daughter.

49
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:27,853
You've done a great job all the way.

50
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:30,797
My precious mom.

51
00:05:31,485 --> 00:05:32,899
Tomorrow will be another day.

52
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:34,278
My daughter...

53
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,436
... is the best!

54
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:39,011
Yeah.

55
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,076
Tomorrow will be another day.

56
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,407
Because your daughter's the best.

57
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,615
Is this all done?

58
00:06:04,525 --> 00:06:06,466
Tomorrow will be another day....

59
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,884
... because your daughter is the best.

60
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:17,844
Hello.

61
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:19,442
Hello.

62
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,806
-Hello.
-Will you be okay?

63
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:23,058
I'll be fine.

64
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:24,985
Hello.

65
00:06:25,683 --> 00:06:26,786
Hello.

66
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:30,961
Hello.

67
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:32,130
Hello.

68
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:33,558
You're here.

69
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:38,493
The shooting's been delayed
because of me, right?

70
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:40,533
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:41,985
Also...

72
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:45,789
...thank you for coming.

73
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:47,841
To my mom's funeral.

74
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,362
I'm the one who should
thank you for being here.

75
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:53,696
Take it easy.

76
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:55,971
Let me know anytime
if it's too hard for you.

77
00:06:57,999 --> 00:06:58,832
All right.

78
00:06:59,546 --> 00:07:00,379
Go get ready.

79
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,994
I'll take it all away from you.

80
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:11,544
I'll put you to rest.

81
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:21,174
Cut. Okay.

82
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:22,816
Cut, okay!

83
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:30,684
She must be dying inside.
Yet, look at that cold stare of hers.

84
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:32,801
She's a real pro all right.

85
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,083
You surprised me.

It's really strange.

91
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,453
She's definitely hiding something.

92
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:07,989
Why?

93
00:08:08,476 --> 00:08:09,395
Is something going on?

94
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:11,996
-What's up?
-Are we close?

95
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:14,471

96
00:08:14,987 --> 00:08:16,265
Just keep driving.

Hello?

98
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:25,742
Yes.

99
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:27,741
I want to put a tail on somebody.

100
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:36,505
I'm buying tonight because I'm thankful.

101
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,617
Order anything you want.

102
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:39,293
Anything!

103
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,847
You don't have to thank us.
We're friends.

104
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:46,024
You guys won't know unless I say it.

105
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:50,726
Some things need to be spoken out
so the other person will know.

106
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:53,782
You guys will never know unless I say it.

107
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,716
Listen to the valuable advice
coming from your big sister.

108
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:01,740
Hey.

109
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,550
Whatever comes into your mind,
let it out as soon as possible.

110
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:08,856
-Hey.
-Yeah?

111
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,084
I love you.

112
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,551
All of a sudden?

113
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:15,230
What's gotten into you?

114
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,312
You told me to let it out.

115
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:20,819
Hey.

116
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,662
I also love you.

117
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:25,196
You guys are grossing me out.

118
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:27,071
Do you need money?

119
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:30,400
I even work as a chauffeur these days.
I have a lot of money.

120
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:33,077
Why are you working as a chauffeur?

121
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:36,585
Should I give you some money?
How much do you need? 10 million won?

122
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:38,149
It's been a while.

123
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,380
-Rolled omelet, right?
-Yes.

124
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:42,057
I added one extra.

125
00:09:42,536 --> 00:09:45,316
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

126
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:49,355
Tasty.

127
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:52,578
What's her secret?

128
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:54,894
My mom's rolled omelet was terrible.

129
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:57,530
This is really difficult
to make, you know.

130
00:10:13,417 --> 00:10:14,250
Oh, dear.

131
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:16,490
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,287
I've spoiled the moment, didn't I?

133
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:25,718
I'm fine. That came out because
the rolled omelet is really good.

134
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:29,180
So it's true.

135
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:31,540
What is?

136
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:33,043
Someone said...

137
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:35,893
...that you'll pretend
like everything's okay.

138
00:10:37,293 --> 00:10:38,947
But none of it's real.

139
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:45,290
Poor little thing.

140
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:48,815
My poor girl.

141
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:55,596
Hey.

142
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:58,365
I'm fine. Really.

143
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:01,500
Just stay still. Don't act up.

144
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:14,999
I'm going home now.

145
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:17,043
Did you drink a lot?

146
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:20,574
A little bit.

147
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,986
Are you okay?

148
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,543
I'm fine.

149
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:25,319
Better than I expected.

150
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:28,232
Really.

151
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,902
If I could...

152
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:36,470
...I'd stay with you
from morning until night.

153
00:11:37,658 --> 00:11:39,375
It's been awhile I heard you say that.

154
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:41,701
But your friends...

155
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:44,724
... have loved you
for a longer time than I have.

156
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,547
I know when I should join and shouldn't.

157
00:11:48,623 --> 00:11:49,624
What a shame.

158
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:51,809
I wish I'd have met you sooner.

159
00:11:51,907 --> 00:11:53,685
What?

160
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:56,712
I'm not sure if you're smart or cold.

161
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:02,055
The filming will be over soon.

162
00:12:02,774 --> 00:12:08,891
When it's over, we can stay together
from morning until night.

163
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:12,973
Sleep tight.

164
00:12:14,287 --> 00:12:16,013
I'll call you again.

165
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:17,526
Sleep tight.

166
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:36,888
Mom?

167
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:47,180
I've stopped the press release for now.

168
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:49,480
I heard you were at the funeral.

169
00:12:50,863 --> 00:12:52,296
You don't have to do that.

170
00:12:54,552 --> 00:12:56,395
I had to.

171
00:12:56,663 --> 00:12:59,101
If rumors spread around when she's
already going through a tough time...

172
00:12:59,186 --> 00:13:00,912
...things will get worse for her.

173
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,618
I didn't think of if that way.

174
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,188
Thank you, Mom.

175
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:13,293
That girl.

176
00:13:14,604 --> 00:13:15,795
Do you love her?

177
00:13:17,117 --> 00:13:17,950
Yes.

178
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,124
Does she know?

179
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,920
Your disorder.

180
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:23,919
She knows.

181
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:29,055
So what are you doing?

182
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:32,198
When your father left
the country all of a sudden…

183
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:35,381
...my life was all about work and you.

184
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:37,350
But then you got hurt.

185
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,370
I couldn't do anything about it.
I was powerless.

186
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,409
Right at that moment...

187
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:47,773
...my world collapsed around me.

188
00:13:52,685 --> 00:13:55,257
When you woke up, Professor Kang said...

189
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,323
...that if you're my light...

190
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:00,985
...he'll be the soil.

191
00:14:01,878 --> 00:14:03,643
When I heard him say that...

192
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:07,593
...I knew he'd spend his life
with me forever.

193
00:14:09,143 --> 00:14:10,942
Always...

194
00:14:13,057 --> 00:14:16,838
...even in the most painful moment.

195
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:23,196
There are more important
things than work.

196
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:25,064
I missed...

197
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:28,000
...so many of those things.

198
00:14:30,609 --> 00:14:32,149
Go to that girl.

199
00:14:32,346 --> 00:14:35,588
Go to her and fill
every corner of her heart.

200
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:39,088
Don't hold back or wait for your turn.

201
00:14:39,216 --> 00:14:41,581
Don't even think logically.

202
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:43,924
If your love is real...

203
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:46,853
...do as I say.

204
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:06,264
He acts like a fool...

205
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:08,491
...just like me.

206
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:19,096
Why the sudden visit?

207
00:15:19,181 --> 00:15:20,685
Because I'm foolish.

208
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,019
What?

209
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:24,367
Because I'm foolish...

210
00:15:25,445 --> 00:15:26,774
...I only came now.

211
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:42,256
Oh no...

212
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:49,482
I thought I was okay, but I wasn't.

213
00:15:50,535 --> 00:15:51,469
I guess...

214
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,289
...it was too much for me to bear.

215
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:15,933
I'm so bad.

216
00:16:17,114 --> 00:16:17,953
What do you mean?

217
00:16:19,206 --> 00:16:21,080
I make it all about me.

218
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,765
It's always me who's in pain...

219
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:27,320
...and going through a hard time.

220
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:30,085
You're in pain too.

221
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:33,192
It must be so difficult for you...

222
00:16:33,747 --> 00:16:35,464
...but I make it worse for you.

223
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:47,673
If you knew how selfish my love is...

224
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:51,844
...you'd be surprised.

225
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:00,988
I'm loving you for my own good.

226
00:17:04,198 --> 00:17:05,925
When I'm with you...

227
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,984
...I feel like nothing can go wrong.

228
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,840
I feel like everything is fine...

229
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:17,722
...and I'm living...

230
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:21,197
...a normal life.

231
00:17:36,018 --> 00:17:37,273
You can be bad.

232
00:17:39,855 --> 00:17:41,077
You can hate everything.

233
00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:45,464
I'll love you regardless of that.

234
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:53,074
Even if you're not
beautiful, you're still...

235
00:17:55,218 --> 00:17:56,957
...perfect the way you are.

236
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:00,246
I love you.

237
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:05,096
Me too.

238
00:18:07,158 --> 00:18:08,430
Like a miracle.

239
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:35,072
I got...

240
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,587
...flowers for my birthday.

241
00:18:39,512 --> 00:18:41,163
And those flowers mean...

242
00:18:43,686 --> 00:18:45,523
"Happiness surely to come."

243
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:51,950
Hello.

244
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,476
Pardon me.

245
00:18:53,984 --> 00:18:57,572
Do you have a flower that means
""Happiness surely to come"?

246
00:18:57,657 --> 00:19:00,270
I think you mean marigolds.

247
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,594
Marigolds?

248
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:07,708
Interestingly, the marigold has
two different floriography.

249
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,651
(Marigold floriography)

250
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:17,956
(Floriography of different marigolds)

251
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,028
(Floriography of different marigolds)

252
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,364
(African marigold and French marigold
have different meanings.)

253
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,033
I thought so.

254
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:39,352
I'm always...

255
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:42,061
...the second choice.

256
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,583
(African marigold means
"Happiness surely to come.")

257
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:46,185
(French marigold means "sad love.")

258
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:11,084
Is this the right flower?

259
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:16,965
I couldn't...

260
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:19,362
...stop thinking about it.

261
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:24,968
What do you want?

262
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:27,320
Even if it isn't me...

263
00:20:27,738 --> 00:20:29,170
...you will find it.

264
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:30,573
Happiness.

265
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:38,429
That's what you...

266
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,287
...came here to say?

267
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:46,813
This is why...

268
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,116
...I don't like nice guys.

269
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:56,309
If it bothers you...

270
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:58,394
...just forget what I said.

271
00:20:59,553 --> 00:21:00,504
I just...

272
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:04,864
...blurted that out without thinking.

273
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:07,938
You were nice to me...

274
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:09,913
...so it just came out.

275
00:21:11,873 --> 00:21:14,124
I'm not an impulsive person.

276
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:17,220
It was wrong of me to say that.

277
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:24,483
I've submitted my application form...

278
00:21:25,373 --> 00:21:26,391
...to a seminary.

279
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:35,432
Aren't you...

280
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,031
...going to say anything?

281
00:21:41,537 --> 00:21:42,468
No.

282
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,213
What was it...

283
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:56,458
...that I wanted to hear?

284
00:22:10,385 --> 00:22:11,683
Cut. Okay!

285
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:12,748
-Thank you.
-Great job!

286
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:13,799
Thank you!

287
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:15,588
Thank you.

288
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:18,288
Great job, everyone.

289
00:22:19,201 --> 00:22:20,516
Thank you.

290
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:23,012
Great job, everyone.

291
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:26,779
Mr. Lee...

292
00:22:27,711 --> 00:22:29,294
Thank you for all your trouble.

293
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,319
Thank you for giving me a chance.

294
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:35,521
And for trusting me.

295
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,337
Looking at you...

296
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,302
I thought...

297
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:44,342
...maybe I'm the one who's changed.

298
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,563
You haven't changed a bit.

299
00:22:48,137 --> 00:22:49,536
But I judged you...

300
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:51,280
...based on rumors.

301
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,045
I'm sorry.

302
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,008
I should thank you...

303
00:22:59,729 --> 00:23:00,979
...for giving me a chance.

304
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:06,368
It was nice to see you again.

305
00:23:14,232 --> 00:23:15,458
Thank you for your support.

306
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:20,111
-Really?
-Spicy food.

307
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,643
Spicy food?

308
00:23:22,977 --> 00:23:24,658
Awesome.

309
00:23:27,396 --> 00:23:28,452
Good work.

310
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:30,934
I guess I won't see you for a while.

311
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,652
Who knows?

312
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:37,543
You might see me again soon.

313
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:48,961
(Uncle)

314
00:23:53,238 --> 00:23:54,306
Is it over?

315
00:23:55,711 --> 00:23:56,835
You must be a psychic.

316
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:58,508
How did you find out?

317
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,059
I've been looking forward to this day.

318
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,355
Where should I go?

319
00:24:03,664 --> 00:24:04,497
Here.

320
00:24:56,178 --> 00:24:57,693
For real?

321
00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:00,604
You really rented a whole plane?

322
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:07,900
My boyfriend's on a whole other level.

323
00:25:07,985 --> 00:25:10,085
Indeed. Your boyfriend's on another level.

324
00:25:26,177 --> 00:25:27,677
Hello, Chief.

325
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:30,767
I'm Baek Minsuk,
the captain of this flight.

326
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,699
I'll do my best so you can have
a pleasant flight.

327
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:35,245
Thank you for your service.

328
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,645
Is this what I say next?

329
00:25:50,518 --> 00:25:53,152
"I've never seen the captain
coming out to greet someone."

330
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,173
"Really?"

331
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,656
"I'm quite used to it."

332
00:26:01,758 --> 00:26:03,144
It's so funny.

333
00:26:03,756 --> 00:26:05,850
Back then, I didn't expect us
to be this way.

334
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:07,466
I kind of expected it.

335
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:11,065
I felt nervous.

336
00:26:13,408 --> 00:26:15,325
When you leaned against my shoulder...

337
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:17,512
...I couldn't turn over the page.

338
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:19,464
Really?

339
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:22,983
That was a secret.

340
00:26:28,918 --> 00:26:29,822
How's this?

341
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:31,957
Do you feel nervous again?

342
00:26:33,432 --> 00:26:34,476
Now...

343
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:37,497
...it's your turn to be nervous.

344
00:26:41,698 --> 00:26:42,588
Look over there.

345
00:26:51,302 --> 00:26:52,307
Say hello...

346
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,485
...to your mother.

347
00:27:00,714 --> 00:27:03,014
We're closest to the sky.

348
00:27:28,061 --> 00:27:30,849
I remember the first time
when I bought the fish.

349
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:51,164
The fishes swimming
inside the blue tank...

350
00:27:51,947 --> 00:27:54,030
...looked like they were flying
in the sky.

351
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,229
I would sit down and look
at them for a long time.

352
00:28:14,062 --> 00:28:17,362
At one point, that was my whole world.

353
00:28:18,386 --> 00:28:19,811
Everything looked the same...

354
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:22,109
...in my strange world.

355
00:28:39,488 --> 00:28:42,087
And my strange lover...

356
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:44,051
...who came into my strange world.

357
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,673
About my dad...

358
00:29:06,482 --> 00:29:09,305
My mom told me...

359
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:12,134
...my dad suddenly
came into her life.

360
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,683
He was suddenly so sweet...

361
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:18,383
...then he suddenly made
her fall in love.

362
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:21,293
...and then he suddenly disappeared.

363
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:32,958
That's what you did.

364
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:37,147
You suddenly came into my life...

365
00:29:38,632 --> 00:29:40,749
...you were suddenly so sweet...

366
00:29:41,296 --> 00:29:43,148
...and you suddenly made me fall in love.

367
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,778
I won't disappear.

368
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:51,934
Really?

369
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:53,648
So...

370
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:56,297
...don't you disappear either.

371
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:04,369
I wish that my stranger lover…

372
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,229
...will be continue to be strangely...

373
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:09,717
...very strangely...

374
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,445
...happy for a long time.

375
00:30:25,422 --> 00:30:26,666
I'll take a picture of you.

376
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,015
One more time.

377
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:38,791
This one came out really well.
Have a look.

378
00:30:43,378 --> 00:30:44,205
Good one, right?

379
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:45,593
-This one?
-This one.

380
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:48,883
That way, I can also be happy.

381
00:30:58,572 --> 00:31:01,485
Do you remember the time
I turned into a child?

382
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,673
At that time, my mom and I...

383
00:31:07,077 --> 00:31:09,623
...spent time together
just like during my childhood.

384
00:31:10,946 --> 00:31:13,205
I ate with her.

385
00:31:13,845 --> 00:31:16,971
I watched TV with her,
and went to sleep with her.

386
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:21,667
Back then, I didn't realize...

387
00:31:23,933 --> 00:31:26,620
...but it was all for
this moment right now.

388
00:31:28,578 --> 00:31:30,561
We only remember some moments...

389
00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:32,891
...after they have passed.

390
00:31:33,665 --> 00:31:34,594
How will we...

391
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,625
...remember this moment after it passes?

392
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:44,918
It would be nice if we can recall
this as a very happy moment.

393
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,539
Maybe it won't be a very happy moment.

394
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:49,605
Why?

395
00:31:50,356 --> 00:31:52,277
You're going to make me even happier?

396
00:31:58,982 --> 00:32:01,108
I'm going to be happier.

397
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:04,643
My mom would want me
to have a happy life.

398
00:32:06,686 --> 00:32:07,879
She wouldn't want me...

399
00:32:09,476 --> 00:32:12,297
...to spend my life in tears and sadness.

400
00:32:15,345 --> 00:32:16,583
I will smile a lot...

401
00:32:18,923 --> 00:32:20,353
...and give lots of love.

402
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:24,140
Is this...

403
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,018
...a love declaration?

404
00:32:27,047 --> 00:32:27,880
Yes.

405
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:30,700
I'm going to make you happy.

406
00:32:32,989 --> 00:32:34,197
For a long, long...

407
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,596
...very long time.

408
00:32:39,642 --> 00:32:41,022
So that moments like this...

409
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:43,053
...feel like nothing.

410
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:25,613
Goodness.

411
00:33:26,827 --> 00:33:28,141
You are quite busy.

412
00:33:28,226 --> 00:33:31,473
You know that, yet you're giving
me an unscheduled visit?

413
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:36,890
Oh, come on. Why would you say that?

414
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:40,708
We work for the same company.
We're practically family.

415
00:33:40,793 --> 00:33:43,955
Isn't it nice when
family gives you a visit?

416
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:49,213
You're so cold sometimes.

417
00:33:49,297 --> 00:33:51,185
What do you want to talk about this time?

418
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,199
Choi Kiho. He's back in Korea.

419
00:33:57,807 --> 00:33:58,890
You didn't know?

420
00:33:59,117 --> 00:34:02,873
Goodness, I know that it's
a loveless engagement...

421
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,305
...but you don't even know
that your fiance's back.

422
00:34:07,985 --> 00:34:11,983
I have to say, you are very clever.

423
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:13,911
It's impressive.

424
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:20,725
Well, it's good to have Mr. Choi
as your supporter.

425
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:22,594
He can add legitimacy.

426
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,965
He's the eldest son
in his family, after all.

427
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:28,652
Although, he's a total yahoo.

428
00:34:28,737 --> 00:34:30,054
Director Kim...

429
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:33,037
Oops.

430
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:34,591
Whoa...

431
00:34:35,138 --> 00:34:39,377
That was more than just cold.
It scared me.

432
00:34:39,615 --> 00:34:40,456
I should go.

433
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,811
Don't mind what I said.

434
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:50,385
I came here in good faith to give you
a heads up so you won't get upset.

435
00:34:50,866 --> 00:34:52,361
I'm busy so I should get going.

436
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:53,702
Bye.

437
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:57,228
That's just strange...

438
00:34:58,655 --> 00:34:59,814
Goodness...

439
00:35:11,765 --> 00:35:13,510
Someone called for a chauffeur.

440
00:35:13,601 --> 00:35:15,119
The VIP room.

441
00:35:21,718 --> 00:35:25,764
You must be crazy. You're meeting
your fiance tomorrow.

442
00:35:27,432 --> 00:35:31,726
Hey. We may be engaged,
but it's actually a business relationship.

443
00:35:32,688 --> 00:35:34,766
This is totally fine.

444
00:35:35,012 --> 00:35:36,243
Do you think that vicious girl...

445
00:35:36,327 --> 00:35:38,345
...agreed to marry me
without knowing my habits?

446
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:43,169
She has something to sponge off of me.

447
00:35:43,828 --> 00:35:47,653
You talk as if you're not
planning to sponge off of her.

448
00:35:48,307 --> 00:35:51,825
You're using Kang Sara so you can
tear down Sunho Group.

449
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:54,129
You know it.

450
00:35:56,415 --> 00:36:01,693
You should've seen how Seo Dojae
wagged his tail to calm me down.

451
00:36:02,312 --> 00:36:04,089
It was so fun to watch.

452
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:08,983
That would make a great wedding gift.

453
00:36:16,364 --> 00:36:17,197
What?

454
00:36:18,103 --> 00:36:19,988
-I'm the chauffeur.
-"I'm the chauffeur."

455
00:36:23,566 --> 00:36:24,487
You're the chauffeur?

456
00:36:30,236 --> 00:36:32,436
Then go get my car ready.

457
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:38,443
Damn, Kiho. You still got
that temper of yours.

458
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:39,781
Why?

459
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:42,139
Was that wrong of me?
Is there a problem?

460
00:36:49,312 --> 00:36:51,240
You're the only girl I have.

461
00:36:52,737 --> 00:36:53,673
Kang Sara?

462
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:55,988
Who's Kang Sara?

463
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,800
Who was it again?

464
00:36:59,149 --> 00:37:00,482
Kang Sara of One Air?

465
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,024
She's such a turn-off.

466
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:09,956
That woman doesn't know
how to be submissive.

467
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:14,162
Hey, I'm not marrying her
because I love her.

468
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,452
That woman...

469
00:37:16,631 --> 00:37:19,321
...is desperate to beat her brother.

470
00:37:21,496 --> 00:37:22,958
Women with ambition...

471
00:37:23,388 --> 00:37:25,061
...are so much fun.

472
00:37:30,032 --> 00:37:30,928
Hey, chauffeur.

473
00:37:31,748 --> 00:37:33,256
Do you mind driving safely?

474
00:37:35,228 --> 00:37:37,327
What? No, it's nothing.

475
00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:45,390
I knew it.

476
00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:47,028
You're a total player.

477
00:38:47,548 --> 00:38:48,381
A player?

478
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:50,995
I won't say more.

479
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:54,719
Aren't you hungry?

480
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:00,468
Darling.

481
00:39:00,748 --> 00:39:02,814
I'm starving.

482
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:06,150
You're such a player.

483
00:39:31,206 --> 00:39:32,044
Over here.

484
00:39:32,129 --> 00:39:34,468
-Aren't you Han Segye? Hello.
-Hello.

485
00:39:56,404 --> 00:39:57,434
Check this out...

486
00:40:04,016 --> 00:40:05,388
Excuse me.

487
00:40:43,622 --> 00:40:45,109
I'm sorry.

488
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,176
It's Han Segye!

489
00:40:50,374 --> 00:40:52,011
-It's her!
-Really?

490
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:33,430
Han Segye.

491
00:41:34,277 --> 00:41:36,999
So this is how you felt
when you tried to look for me.

492
00:41:39,892 --> 00:41:42,033
It must've been so nerve wrecking.

493
00:41:44,108 --> 00:41:47,433
It must've been so disappointing
when you mistook someone else for me.

494
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,448
Yet, you never gave up looking for me.

495
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,044
Thank you.

496
00:41:56,705 --> 00:41:57,833
Thank you so much.

497
00:41:57,918 --> 00:42:00,067
You don't have to be so grateful.

498
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:02,527
I told you it's for my own good.

499
00:42:09,803 --> 00:42:11,646
I wanted to sweep you off your feet.

500
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,896
I guess it worked.

501
00:42:15,986 --> 00:42:17,304
Hold it for a moment.

502
00:42:18,117 --> 00:42:19,626
I haven't given it to you just yet.

503
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:55,510
I'll recognize you from now on...

504
00:42:56,216 --> 00:42:57,881
...no matter what you look like.

505
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,263
Let's go back now.

506
00:43:20,938 --> 00:43:21,771
To home.

507
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,378
(Choi Kiho)

508
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:13,818
(Snail Bride)

509
00:44:17,757 --> 00:44:18,896
-Hello...
-Where are you?

510
00:44:21,609 --> 00:44:22,703
Where are you?

511
00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:25,144
Don't make me ask three times.

512
00:44:25,228 --> 00:44:26,314
Church.

513
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:28,311
Which church?

514
00:44:29,855 --> 00:44:31,669
I'm still not sure.

515
00:44:34,776 --> 00:44:35,609
But...

516
00:44:36,277 --> 00:44:40,179
...If I don’t decide now, I would think
about it again for a long time.

517
00:44:41,835 --> 00:44:42,810
Julianus...

518
00:44:44,295 --> 00:44:47,819
You will never know
the path you didn't walk...

519
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,890
...regardless of where it leads to.

520
00:44:57,055 --> 00:44:58,955
Why don't you try...

521
00:44:59,935 --> 00:45:00,805
...wearing this?

522
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:03,576
No.

523
00:45:04,013 --> 00:45:09,537
I have to endure many more years
and pray even more to wear that...

524
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:10,842
But, I...

525
00:45:13,004 --> 00:45:15,435
If it can help you find your way...

526
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:20,073
...the Lord will never say
that it's wrong.

527
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:46,703
What's wrong?

528
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:50,233
You can't look away
because you look too good?

529
00:46:12,983 --> 00:46:15,873
A while ago, I asked you where you were.

530
00:46:17,531 --> 00:46:18,516
It was...

531
00:46:20,651 --> 00:46:22,847
... a hint that I was coming.

532
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,255
Did you want me to see you...

533
00:46:29,848 --> 00:46:30,996
...looking like this?

534
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,343
There's something I wanted to check.

535
00:46:36,945 --> 00:46:38,966
Not because you wanted to...

536
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:40,502
...test something?

537
00:46:48,115 --> 00:46:49,181
You have no idea...

538
00:46:51,296 --> 00:46:52,846
...what I just left behind.

539
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,781
What did you leave behind?

540
00:47:01,025 --> 00:47:02,030
Tell me.

541
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,394
What did you leave behind?

542
00:47:05,688 --> 00:47:07,213
Why should I tell you?

543
00:47:07,297 --> 00:47:08,431
I need to know...

544
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:11,455
...to decide if I should
leave it behind or not.

545
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:22,059
Forget it.

546
00:47:24,904 --> 00:47:26,596
I was fighting a losing battle...

547
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,089
...from the beginning.

548
00:47:31,825 --> 00:47:33,769
I thought he was nice...

549
00:47:34,805 --> 00:47:36,477
...but he's cheaper than I thought.

550
00:47:37,965 --> 00:47:41,158
Is he giving me a bad deal
because I'm not a believer?

551
00:47:44,915 --> 00:47:45,798
Or...

552
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:48,543
...is he punishing me...

553
00:47:49,922 --> 00:47:51,284
...because I'm bad?

554
00:48:47,949 --> 00:48:49,227
Why do you like me?

555
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:54,165
Because you're pretty.

556
00:48:55,171 --> 00:48:56,791
Because I have...

557
00:48:57,255 --> 00:48:58,554
...commodity value?

558
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,963
I've never seen...

559
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,164
...anyone so pretty in my life.

560
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:12,488
That pretty someone...

561
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,013
...even listens to me.

562
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:20,875
He comes when I ask him to.

563
00:49:21,649 --> 00:49:23,362
He prepares meals for me.

564
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,540
Also...

565
00:49:27,821 --> 00:49:29,700
...he feeds me something really sweet
from time to time.

566
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:35,597
Why?

567
00:49:36,601 --> 00:49:37,727
Are you upset?

568
00:49:40,474 --> 00:49:42,213
You have a fiance, right?

569
00:49:44,029 --> 00:49:45,019
Is his name...

570
00:49:45,946 --> 00:49:47,447
...Choi Kiho?

571
00:49:50,899 --> 00:49:52,492
Why did you lie?

572
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,362
I've never lied.

573
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:02,429
I just...

574
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:06,203
...didn't tell you.

575
00:50:11,682 --> 00:50:13,060
At first...

576
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:16,554
...I thought there was
no need to tell you.

577
00:50:17,687 --> 00:50:18,762
Then...

578
00:50:21,596 --> 00:50:23,220
...I did not want to tell you.

579
00:50:25,294 --> 00:50:26,590
You got some nerves.

580
00:50:28,468 --> 00:50:29,301
I know.

581
00:50:29,715 --> 00:50:30,743
That's the way I am.

582
00:50:31,856 --> 00:50:32,689
But...

583
00:50:34,802 --> 00:50:36,338
...why do I like that?

584
00:50:45,862 --> 00:50:47,531
It looks like you have guest.

585
00:50:55,423 --> 00:50:56,730
We'll talk later.

586
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:58,489
Why don't you go now.

587
00:50:59,045 --> 00:50:59,878
What?

588
00:51:00,814 --> 00:51:02,231
You should've told me you were coming.

589
00:51:02,417 --> 00:51:03,510
What a surprise.

590
00:51:03,595 --> 00:51:05,081
Good to know that.

591
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,897
I wanted to surprise you.

592
00:51:07,186 --> 00:51:09,366
Let's go inside and talk.

593
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:22,678
I'll call you.

594
00:51:23,127 --> 00:51:24,146
Come back when I call you.

595
00:51:26,804 --> 00:51:28,124
You said you'll come if I call.

596
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:30,909
So...

597
00:51:32,518 --> 00:51:33,824
...come to me when I call you.

598
00:52:00,613 --> 00:52:02,099
I guess you knew that I was back.

599
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,895
Judging from your lukewarm reaction.

600
00:52:04,066 --> 00:52:06,149
I've heard. Although I didn't want to.

601
00:52:06,234 --> 00:52:07,491
Who's that guy just now?

602
00:52:07,797 --> 00:52:09,737
We don't ask questions like that
in our relationship...

603
00:52:10,415 --> 00:52:11,248
...do we?

604
00:52:11,777 --> 00:52:12,610
Right.

605
00:52:12,828 --> 00:52:14,767
You're not the kind of woman...

606
00:52:14,852 --> 00:52:18,243
...who'd throw away her ambition
because of some pretty boy.

607
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:21,505
If you were, I wouldn't have
partnered up with you.

608
00:52:22,548 --> 00:52:24,912
-What brings you here?
-Nothing.

609
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:28,312
Do I need a reason to visit my fiance?

610
00:52:29,309 --> 00:52:30,142
Oh, really?

611
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:32,549
Well, you've seen me now.

612
00:52:34,406 --> 00:52:37,556
Your brother's still a jerk
after all this time.

613
00:52:40,671 --> 00:52:43,722
You're not chiming in.
I guess you two have gotten close.

614
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,185
It's not like that.

615
00:52:46,988 --> 00:52:48,752
I'm tired. Just leave.

616
00:52:49,451 --> 00:52:50,401
Sunho group...

617
00:52:51,097 --> 00:52:52,117
...is a matter of time.

618
00:52:53,209 --> 00:52:54,790
I will put it in your hands.

619
00:52:55,724 --> 00:52:58,602
If you become the madam of Sunho group,
it will also benefit me.

620
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:02,146
Not the madam...

621
00:53:02,921 --> 00:53:03,754
The owner.

622
00:53:04,211 --> 00:53:05,044
Sure.

623
00:53:05,555 --> 00:53:07,017
As you wish.

624
00:53:08,499 --> 00:53:09,784
I brought a gift.

625
00:53:09,868 --> 00:53:10,774
A gift?

626
00:53:13,741 --> 00:53:15,259
That's not like you at all.

627
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,669
It's an information you'll like.

628
00:53:20,295 --> 00:53:21,579
Seo Dojae's weakness.

629
00:53:45,529 --> 00:53:47,091
What happened?

630
00:53:47,176 --> 00:53:50,194
Why did you call me for a a drink
when I just came back to Seoul?

631
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,023
I don't have anyone to drink with.

632
00:53:54,294 --> 00:53:56,222
Sorry for calling you in this situation.

633
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:59,830
Goodness. You can call me anytime.

634
00:53:59,958 --> 00:54:02,706
I'm itching to comfort you.

635
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:11,682
What the heck?

636
00:54:12,242 --> 00:54:14,507
Why are you binge drinking
all of a sudden?

637
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:20,004
I...

638
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:23,260
...mustered up my courage
and went to her place.

639
00:54:25,548 --> 00:54:26,588
But...

640
00:54:27,637 --> 00:54:28,866
...she kicked me out.

641
00:54:31,771 --> 00:54:33,384
The door was snapped shut...

642
00:54:34,085 --> 00:54:35,443
...in front of me.

643
00:54:37,272 --> 00:54:38,689
I stood in front of the closed door...

644
00:54:39,257 --> 00:54:40,944
...for a long time.

645
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:43,715
But...

646
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:46,473
...the door didn't open again.

647
00:54:47,933 --> 00:54:49,866
It never opened again.

648
00:54:53,342 --> 00:54:54,425
Then it hit me.

649
00:54:55,684 --> 00:54:59,530
This is how she must've felt.

650
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:01,669
Seriously...

651
00:55:02,616 --> 00:55:03,801
Are you drunk?

652
00:55:05,448 --> 00:55:06,281
Yeah.

653
00:55:11,848 --> 00:55:12,974
What about her?

654
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:15,706
Does she like you back?

655
00:55:18,975 --> 00:55:19,808
Hey.

656
00:55:21,003 --> 00:55:23,484
Let me give you an advice
from experience.

657
00:55:24,577 --> 00:55:26,088
Don't try to figure it out alone.

658
00:55:27,316 --> 00:55:30,380
Actually, you can figure it out alone.

659
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,130
But make sure to speak out
what's in your mind.

660
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:35,460
Speak out right away.

661
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,367
Or it will hurt.

662
00:55:38,212 --> 00:55:39,177
It will hurt her?

663
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:43,273
Look at you. You're a lost cause.

664
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,861
You're putting her feelings
above your own.

665
00:55:50,382 --> 00:55:52,642
You're in too deep in your first love.

666
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,057
Right?

667
00:55:54,913 --> 00:55:55,859
Love?

668
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,477
I'm not sure about that.

669
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,360
It was my 10 year long dream.

670
00:56:04,115 --> 00:56:05,629
I can't believe...

671
00:56:06,421 --> 00:56:08,165
...that I'm so easily faltered.

672
00:56:09,318 --> 00:56:10,151
Hey.

673
00:56:10,841 --> 00:56:12,870
You dream your dreams,
not the other way around.

674
00:56:14,743 --> 00:56:16,567
So what if you change your dream?

675
00:56:17,534 --> 00:56:19,176
No one will blame you.

676
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:23,714
If someone criticizes you,
I'll kick their asses with Woomi.

677
00:56:28,436 --> 00:56:31,168
Why did Kang Sara have to be so pretty?

678
00:56:32,457 --> 00:56:33,290
Hey.

679
00:56:33,842 --> 00:56:35,105
How did you know?

680
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:37,666
-What?
-Kang Sara.

681
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:41,820
Only an idiot won't be able
to figure that out.

682
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:46,286
Something's seriously wrong
with those siblings.

683
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:48,362
Right.

684
00:56:49,344 --> 00:56:50,394
They do have problems.

685
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:11,179
I don't have anything concrete yet.

686
00:57:13,354 --> 00:57:15,198
No, I can feel it.

687
00:57:15,588 --> 00:57:17,267
She's definitely hiding something.

688
00:57:17,525 --> 00:57:19,903
Maybe she has a kid,
or some other problem.

689
00:57:21,565 --> 00:57:22,739
Keep digging around.

690
00:57:23,082 --> 00:57:25,915
I'll pay whatever you want
as long as you find evidence.

691
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,412
I'll call you again.

692
00:57:36,672 --> 00:57:38,333
Look over here.

693
00:57:38,418 --> 00:57:39,845
One, two, three...

694
00:57:40,066 --> 00:57:41,084
Okay.

695
00:57:41,817 --> 00:57:43,448
You're so pretty.

696
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,698
That's too much. One, two three!

697
00:57:47,188 --> 00:57:48,332
Excellent.

698
00:57:48,914 --> 00:57:52,017
You're in a good mood, as usual.

699
00:57:52,193 --> 00:57:54,826
You're always in a good mood
when you see me.

700
00:57:54,911 --> 00:57:59,494
Let me guess.
It's because of L.O.V.E, love.

701
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:02,440
Well, maybe it's because of the perfume.

702
00:58:02,525 --> 00:58:04,807
Aren't you pretty.

703
00:58:04,892 --> 00:58:06,371
One, two, three!

704
00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:09,375
Here.

705
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:11,973
Hey.

706
00:58:12,182 --> 00:58:13,752
Eunho got sick from drinking.

707
00:58:14,104 --> 00:58:16,082
He's sick from love, not from drinking.

708
00:58:16,167 --> 00:58:17,000
Hey.

709
00:58:18,007 --> 00:58:21,096
Did you two have a secret conversation
while I was gone?

710
00:58:21,725 --> 00:58:22,745
Maybe?

711
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:24,373
It's a secret.

712
00:58:24,916 --> 00:58:26,516
Unbelievable.

713
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:27,771
My feelings are hurt.

714
00:58:27,855 --> 00:58:30,207
You shouldn't have chosen
your boyfriend over your friends.

715
00:58:30,462 --> 00:58:33,234
You're the one to talk.

716
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:35,428
Your trip was like a honeymoon.... Ouch!

717
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:37,351
Keep it down.

718
00:58:37,436 --> 00:58:39,651
Keep what down?

719
00:58:40,082 --> 00:58:41,791
You could get married soon
if you keep that up.

720
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:44,768
Jeez, will you keep it down?

721
00:58:45,006 --> 00:58:46,084
I see marriage in your future.

722
00:58:46,224 --> 00:58:47,225
Really?

723
00:58:56,118 --> 00:58:57,919
What is it? Did you see something?

724
00:58:58,003 --> 00:58:59,566
I just feel a bit...

725
00:59:03,018 --> 00:59:04,648
No, maybe I'm wrong.

726
00:59:05,215 --> 00:59:06,287
About marriage?

727
00:59:06,775 --> 00:59:08,089
You'll get married.

728
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:10,022
Maybe I will?

729
00:59:10,107 --> 00:59:11,355
You've gone crazy.

730
00:59:22,968 --> 00:59:24,675
I feel strange.

731
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:26,386
Why? About what?

732
00:59:28,144 --> 00:59:29,888
Do you feel like you're going to Chang?

733
00:59:30,837 --> 00:59:32,691
No, it's not that.

734
00:59:35,287 --> 00:59:36,171
Then what is it?

735
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:37,882
Are you not feeling well?

736
00:59:38,397 --> 00:59:39,913
Do you feel chilly?

737
00:59:40,597 --> 00:59:43,110
It's not that either.
I just feel a bit...

738
00:59:45,322 --> 00:59:47,641
It's just strange. I feel like...

739
00:59:48,307 --> 00:59:50,087
...I'm being watched.

740
00:59:51,126 --> 00:59:52,191
Watched?

741
00:59:56,141 --> 00:59:58,151
Maybe there's a reporter on your tail?

742
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,763
Maybe?

743
01:00:00,117 --> 01:00:02,527
Hey. Be careful for the time being.

744
01:00:02,622 --> 01:00:05,819
If something doesn't smell right,
you should keep your head down.

745
01:00:06,476 --> 01:00:09,718
I'll coax Reporter Park
to find out if anyone's following you.

746
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:11,740
Hey.

747
01:00:12,531 --> 01:00:14,276
By the way...

748
01:00:14,863 --> 01:00:18,147
...your mother-in-law is
a hell of a woman.

749
01:00:18,232 --> 01:00:20,237
She's not my mother-in-law.

750
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:22,752
Not yet.

751
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:28,343
I asked Reporter Park
because there was no press release.

752
01:00:28,428 --> 01:00:31,313
Your mother-in-law stopped everything
from being released.

753
01:00:31,426 --> 01:00:33,146
It's reassuring.

754
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:38,101
But...

755
01:00:38,611 --> 01:00:41,204
...I think I'm the one
who's not feeling well.

756
01:00:42,244 --> 01:00:43,445
Is it just me or is it cold in here?

757
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:45,638
Why do I feel so chilly?

758
01:00:45,732 --> 01:00:48,977
Hey, flu these days are serious.
You'll get sick as a dog.

759
01:00:49,286 --> 01:00:51,187
Wear this. Bundle up.

760
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:59,422
You're the only one who cares about me.

761
01:00:59,506 --> 01:01:00,522
Hello?

762
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:05,100
Of course. My darling's the only one
who cares about me.

763
01:01:07,237 --> 01:01:08,716
Anything you want to eat?

764
01:01:08,849 --> 01:01:11,234
Yes. Even if I say no, there is.

765
01:01:11,403 --> 01:01:12,284
That's good.

766
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,848
If you said no,
I was going to insist that there is.

767
01:01:15,009 --> 01:01:16,202
What would you like to have?

768
01:01:22,222 --> 01:01:23,664
Just come up with something.

769
01:01:24,497 --> 01:01:25,629
Sushi.

770
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:31,922
Thanks to your excellent choice,
we'll get to meet a little earlier.

771
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:34,947
Really? I'm proud of myself.

772
01:01:35,683 --> 01:01:39,513
We can talk about the day
when we argued at the sushi place.

773
01:01:40,177 --> 01:01:42,289
That story puts me in
an unfavorable position.

774
01:01:58,532 --> 01:01:59,508
Hey!

775
01:01:59,593 --> 01:02:01,906
Sorry. I need to get changed.

776
01:02:02,736 --> 01:02:04,123
Are you serious?

777
01:02:04,496 --> 01:02:05,338
Jeez.

778
01:02:08,105 --> 01:02:09,626
Jeez, it's cold.

779
01:02:10,857 --> 01:02:12,706
So cold...

780
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:15,065
What is this?

781
01:02:44,217 --> 01:02:45,163
Han Segye.

782
01:02:47,253 --> 01:02:48,615
Have you been waiting for me...

783
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:51,592
...or the sushi?

784
01:02:55,409 --> 01:02:57,084
It doesn't matter which one.

785
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:58,974
What are you doing?

786
01:02:59,826 --> 01:03:00,659
We should go inside.

787
01:03:08,894 --> 01:03:10,375
Mr. Seo Dojae...?

788
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:19,311
Mr. Seo, I'm...

789
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:23,375
Ms. Yoo.

790
01:03:23,912 --> 01:03:24,834
I'm sorry.

791
01:03:25,998 --> 01:03:27,028
It's dark...

792
01:03:27,552 --> 01:03:28,620
...so I didn't recognize you.

793
01:03:32,161 --> 01:03:32,994
This.

794
01:03:34,011 --> 01:03:35,272
Please give this to Segye.

795
01:03:37,962 --> 01:03:38,795
Bye.

796
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:11,079
(Han Segye, the woman I met
at the hospital)

797
01:04:12,759 --> 01:04:14,310
Han Segye...

798
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:20,186
(Han Segye or not...?)

799
01:04:20,271 --> 01:04:21,522
Han Segye...

800
01:04:23,154 --> 01:04:25,123
(High school age)

801
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:28,732
(Around 9, 10 years old)

802
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:29,931
What...?

803
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,869
(Mid-forties)

804
01:04:33,237 --> 01:04:34,168
What is all this?

805
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:56,526
(Auntie)

806
01:05:03,272 --> 01:05:04,364
Are you okay?

807
01:05:04,665 --> 01:05:06,102
Woomi told me.

808
01:05:06,311 --> 01:05:07,650
I'll handle Woomi...

809
01:05:10,043 --> 01:05:10,944
Hello?

810
01:05:12,473 --> 01:05:13,394
Hello?

811
01:05:31,477 --> 01:05:32,729
What are you doing?

812
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:34,205
Is it true?

813
01:05:36,387 --> 01:05:37,715
Is it true?

814
01:05:40,417 --> 01:05:42,112
You're unable to recognize faces?

815
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:10,500
(Beauty Inside)

816
01:06:10,742 --> 01:06:12,444
-Oh my gosh!
-It's me.

817
01:06:12,499 --> 01:06:13,599
Is it that day?

818
01:06:13,684 --> 01:06:16,314
You had me followed?
You must be insane.

819
01:06:16,399 --> 01:06:18,363
So this was the secret you were keeping?

820
01:06:18,448 --> 01:06:20,196
I'm very serious right now.

821
01:06:20,281 --> 01:06:22,170
I'm also seriously glad.

822
01:06:22,255 --> 01:06:25,097
So that's why you acted like a jerk.

823
01:06:25,182 --> 01:06:26,190
Hey!

824
01:06:26,275 --> 01:06:27,777
Because of that guy?

825
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:30,016
I also want to find out...

826
01:06:30,102 --> 01:06:33,714
...the reason why my dream
changed to you.
