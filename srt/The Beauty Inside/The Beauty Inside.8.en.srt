1
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:16,211
I closed my eyes just for a moment
and opened them again...

2
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,962
Can you hear me? Give me some signal.

3
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:33,101
...but the world has changed.

4
00:00:34,932 --> 00:00:36,103
Dojae...

5
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:39,640
Who...

6
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:42,509
...are you?

7
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,818
It's prosopagnosia.

8
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:53,882
Also called face blindness.

9
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:56,390
The shock has damaged the temporal lobe.

10
00:00:57,527 --> 00:00:58,847
Face blindness?

11
00:00:58,932 --> 00:01:00,131
It may sound strange,

12
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:01,795
but to make it easier,

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,662
a part of the temporal lobe,

14
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,601
which recognizes the face,
doesn't work anymore.

15
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:09,754
Is it temporary?

16
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:12,439
I'm afraid in this case,
there is no full treatment.

17
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:15,275
That's when I realized...

18
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:28,822
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:11,518
...it's not the world that has changed...

20
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:13,233
...it's me.

21
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,227
Number One?

22
00:02:41,018 --> 00:02:41,885
Number Two?

23
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:48,935
Number Three?

24
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:56,576
Again.

25
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:01,615
Again.

26
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:07,896
It took a long time...

27
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:09,785
Two.

28
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:11,720
Three.

29
00:03:12,784 --> 00:03:13,860
Four.

30
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,021
Five.

31
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:19,086
Six.

32
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:23,970
Number Seven?

33
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,540
Again.

34
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,243
Twelve.

35
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:35,321
This is the first time...

36
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:36,674
...you got all of them right.

37
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:42,340
...until I can recognize
the faces of my loved ones.

38
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,752
The hairstyle.

39
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:18,160
The clothes.

40
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,526
The gait.

41
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:20,861
The scent.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,841
Mother.

43
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:22,927
The speech style.

44
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:24,030
The habits.

45
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm back.

46
00:04:26,928 --> 00:04:29,569
Even when I used all those nuances...

47
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:31,332
...to start recognizing my loved ones.

48
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:32,436
I'm glad you're back.

49
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:36,034
The one person
who I still couldn't recognize...

50
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,350
...was myself.

51
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:55,272
That's probably when it all started.

52
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:56,806
My loved ones...

53
00:04:56,976 --> 00:04:58,565
...whom I can recognize...

54
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:00,801
...and need to recognize.

55
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:02,714
And I...

56
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,284
...was no longer part of them.

57
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,884
From that day on,
I have never loved myself.

58
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,653
Ever.

59
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,155
Can someone...

60
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,924
...like me...

61
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:26,560
...love you...

62
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,975
...and love myself?

63
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:32,332
Will you be okay...

64
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:34,432
...to be with me?

65
00:05:37,614 --> 00:05:38,872
Do you mean it?

66
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:40,907
I do.

67
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:43,510
I don't believe you.

68
00:05:46,782 --> 00:05:48,048
Prove it.

69
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:00,829
Do you like me?

70
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,353
Yes.

71
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:05,044
Even when I'm not beautiful.

72
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:06,923
Even when you're not beautiful.

73
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:09,591
Thank you...

74
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:13,899
...for liking me.

75
00:07:17,878 --> 00:07:19,163
For still liking me...

76
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:22,849
...even when I'm like this.

77
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,410
What should we do about the contract?

78
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:38,366
There's no such thing anymore.

79
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:40,988
I already ripped it.

80
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:42,276
The contract.

81
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:52,123
Now, I'm the only one
who has the contracts.

82
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:54,837
That somehow makes me feel anxious.

83
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:03,684
We broke up.

84
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:05,532
But now we're dating.

85
00:08:06,504 --> 00:08:08,098
We have decided to date.

86
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:09,510
But...

87
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:11,836
...there will be articles
saying that we broke up.

90
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:31,651
It just happened.

91
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:39,571
Would you please do one thing at a time?

92
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:41,398
One at a time!

93
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:46,343
So you got yourself drunk
because of that jerk?

94
00:08:46,878 --> 00:08:48,703
Did you stop eating because of him?

95
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:50,313
No. Never.

96
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:54,886
That guy made you drink till you pass out
and starve yourself.

97
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,318
I will never let you date him.

98
00:08:57,707 --> 00:08:59,034
It's because of work stress.

99
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,440
A hundred percent because of work.

100
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:02,233
Yes. It's because of Chae Yoori.

101

The next one...

102

You better answer me properly.

104
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:10,229
Did you...

105
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,189
...confess to him first?

106
00:09:14,384 --> 00:09:15,257
No.

107
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:17,096
It was him.

108
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,159
I rejected him.

109
00:09:18,244 --> 00:09:19,614
I told him we need to end it.

110
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:21,359
But he confessed to me.

111
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:22,990
Then, that's fine.

112
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:24,719

113
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,360

-Because they're both busy?

-Why would they date in the first place?
-What on earth?

120
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:51,309
-Due to a difference in personality?
-How did they both meet?

121
00:09:51,394 --> 00:09:53,341
-They broke up to focus on work?
-It doesn't make sense.

122
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,896
-After all the fuss?
-It's obvious.

I told you there will be news soon.

132
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:27,581
When I heard of it from my source...

133
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,868
...I was so so shocked.

134
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:33,286
This is why...

135
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:35,618
...I can't really respect the family.

136
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,467
Don't you agree, Ms. Kang?

137
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:43,563
I'm sure you didn't call me
to act like friends and badmouth them.

138
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,518
I heard you called from Director Kim
and lectured him?

139
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:49,858
Ms. Kang, I admire your tenacity.

140
00:10:49,943 --> 00:10:52,377
It's amazing. Bravo.

141
00:10:53,247 --> 00:10:54,541

142
00:10:54,682 --> 00:10:58,172
...I really didn't expect
that he's such a bad guy.

143
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:03,042
I also don't think you called me
to compliment me.

144

00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:26,058
In your dreams.

151
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:29,417
You're supposed to play a game
with people of your own level.

152
00:11:29,502 --> 00:11:31,179
What? What did you say?

153
00:11:31,368 --> 00:11:34,604
I'm not going to fall
for your empty talks.

154
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:36,508
On top of that...

155
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:39,861
...I'm not really interested
in any of your plans.

156
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,456
Who does he think he is?
He doesn't even know his place.

157
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:49,096
The chairman...

158
00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:51,856
...no matter how open-minded he is.

159
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:53,872
...will he pass down the company
to his step-granddaughter...

160
00:11:53,957 --> 00:11:56,234
...instead of his own grandson?

161
00:11:57,411 --> 00:12:01,430
Are you asking that because
you think I don't know?

162
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:04,552
Are you being like this
because you're trusting him?

163
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:09,147
He's still living abroad, isn't he?

164
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:12,788
Rumor has it he's having
the time of his life.

165
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:20,668
You said he was crazy in love?

166
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,766
Even crazy love... will come to an end.

167
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:26,755
That's right. He's definitely crazy.
Plain crazy.

168
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,174
Didn't I told you to
keep a close eye on him?

169
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:31,104
So that he won't end up on the front page.

170
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:33,917
I will do my best so that it won't happen.

171
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:36,254
You're sure good with your words.

172
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,712
Easier said than done.

173
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:38,918
Get on it.

174
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:40,844
If not, I'll deduct your pay.

175
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:42,329
Excuse me?

176
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,453
"Deduct my pay"?

177
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:52,021
Hello. How are you?

178
00:12:53,197 --> 00:12:54,927
I am not fine.

179
00:12:55,012 --> 00:12:57,376
Who said you can release that statement?

180
00:12:57,478 --> 00:12:59,136
You told them Mr. Seo got dumped?

181
00:12:59,303 --> 00:13:00,577
Does it even make sense?

182
00:13:00,662 --> 00:13:01,842
Why not?

183
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,301
That's what Segye said.

184
00:13:04,557 --> 00:13:06,246
She said she dumped him.

185
00:13:07,334 --> 00:13:09,334
It's not true anyway.

186
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:12,325
We already took this much of a risk.

187
00:13:12,953 --> 00:13:14,953
What more do you expect?

188
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:19,114
Seems like you don't understand
what it means to take a risk.

189
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,848
Yes, I don't know.

190
00:13:22,156 --> 00:13:23,675
Is that an office jargon?

191
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:25,189
You see...

192
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,779
...I'm used to working hands-on jobs.

193
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:30,633
Do you think it'll only badly affect us?

194
00:13:30,718 --> 00:13:32,838
Your side will suffer too.

195
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:34,244
Exactly...

196
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:38,437
If we're both going to be affected,
our side wants the less damage.

197
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,953
Geez.

198
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:43,894
It's impossible to talk
with someone on your level.

199
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,987
Do you finally see it now?

200
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:48,385
How low your level is.

201
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,459
If you've realized that,

202
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:54,543
please stop bothering me.

203
00:13:54,648 --> 00:13:57,777
Go complain to your boss first.

204
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:03,700
Thanks for the meal.

205
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,002
I can't live in peace
because of my own son.

206
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:19,597
Stop. Stop.

207
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:22,549
Honey, that's not weed.
That's a flowering plant.

208
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:24,643
We need to weed them out
if they act like one.

209
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:26,467
No. Don't be like that.

210
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:30,094
When a plant is suffering,

211
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:33,102
you have to pat it down with fine soil.

212
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,192
Can you please meet Dojae?

213
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:37,207
He won't listen to me.

214
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:40,889
No one listens to you as well as he does.

215
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:44,434
I think I'm going to blow up if I see him.

216
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:48,117
So can you go and slow talk to him for me?

217
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:58,166
How are you feeling?

218
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:01,383
I'm sorry for ruining the trip.

219
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,207
Why would you apologize to me
for getting sick?

220
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,676
You should apologize to yourself
for not treating yourself well.

221
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:10,247
I'm sorry.

222
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:14,176
Do you have a gun training today?

223
00:15:15,786 --> 00:15:16,736
Will you be okay?

224
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:17,698
Yes.

225
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:20,082
I'm meeting the action team today.

226
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:21,349
Good.

227
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,730
We're going to start shooting soon.

228
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:25,439
Take care of yourself until then.

229
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:26,526
You may leave.

230
00:15:28,354 --> 00:15:29,338
Director Lee...

231
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:32,297
...can I ask you something?

232
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:33,459
Sure.

233
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:37,237
Why did you pick her?

234
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:38,704
Yoori?

235
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,774
Yes.

236
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,905
What do you like about her?

237
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:49,286
It's because...

238
00:15:50,286 --> 00:15:51,600
...she's different from you.

239
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,376
What is the difference?

240
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:55,789
I want to know.

241
00:15:56,682 --> 00:15:57,783
Yoori...

242
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:01,345
Her problem is that
she loves herself too much.

243
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,317
Unlike you.

244
00:16:03,603 --> 00:16:04,779
You two...

245
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:07,662
...have very different problems.

246
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:09,547
So...

247
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,275
...please get along with her, Segye.

248
00:16:20,017 --> 00:16:21,256
Hold here.

249
00:16:30,686 --> 00:16:32,673
Segye, I heard you broke up?

250
00:16:32,757 --> 00:16:35,112
You better not act up
when I'm holding a gun.

251
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:37,403
Rumor has it that you two broke up
because of the tabloid.

252
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:38,557
Is that right?

253
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:42,273
This is awkward. Why are you
suddenly being so polite?

254
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:43,804
You weren't like this a few days ago.

255
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,578
Me?

256
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:49,937
When?

257
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:53,947
"Me"?

258
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:56,532
-"When"?
-Oh my.

259
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:58,472
I must have been drunk

260
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:00,514
I have a bad drunk habit.

261
00:17:01,038 --> 00:17:03,108
I blackout too sometimes.

262
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:05,643
But when did you break up?

263
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:07,742
Is that why you acted
like that during the trip?

264
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,442
Did you get yourself drunk
to nurse your broken heart?

265
00:17:10,526 --> 00:17:11,967
You said you didn't remember anything.

266
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,227
Yes. I don't.

267
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:18,036
-Segye, by the way...
-Hey.

268
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:20,007
Don't talk to me.

269
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:22,762
You know what?

270
00:17:22,846 --> 00:17:25,135
I'm the one who saved your life.

271
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:28,418
If I hadn't gone and asked for help,
you wouldn't be standing here now.

272
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,086
Gosh, she's so noisy.

273
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:32,935
Should I shoot?

274
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,987
Excuse me?

275
00:17:35,056 --> 00:17:36,657
But it'll be a waste of bullets, right?

276
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:40,526
That's not true.

277
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,897
Please write the article
based on the truth.

278
00:17:44,203 --> 00:17:47,238
We had an amicable breakup
for our own good.

279
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:49,019
That's all.

280
00:17:52,592 --> 00:17:55,210
I can't live because I'm so humiliated.

281
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,528
Do you know what I just
went through today?

282
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:01,013
When did you two even start dating?

283
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:03,033
Yesterday?

284
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,902
Then what's with the news?

285
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:06,289
Well...

286
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:07,817
...It just happened.

287
00:18:10,626 --> 00:18:12,113
-I want to quit.
-You can't.

288
00:18:12,197 --> 00:18:13,712
Then, I want a pay raise.

289
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:14,856
I can't.

290
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:16,227
Then, I'm going home.

291
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:17,201
You can't.

292
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:20,284
There are 30 minutes left.

293
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:28,043
-Hello.
-Mr. Seo...

294
00:18:28,128 --> 00:18:30,601
...did you make an appointment
with your father?

295
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:32,974
Father.

296
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:34,261
What brings you here?

297
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:37,687
Well... I was just passing by.

298
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:41,286
I sort of miss my son, so...

299
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:44,958
Is that what my mom told you to say?

300
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,907
A rubber tree...

301
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:52,367
...is a tree that must get hurt...

302
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:54,967
...to become useful.

303
00:18:55,113 --> 00:18:56,479
You know "slash and burn", right?

304
00:18:56,564 --> 00:18:58,103
They burn all the plants...

305
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:00,914
...to grow a new life from the ground.

306
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:08,229
There is no tree that doesn't have a knot.

307
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,550
Even though you failed at love...

308
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:13,386
-...you can use that...
-It's not what you think.

309
00:19:14,616 --> 00:19:17,487
Sure. It's fine.
Everyone is like that at first.

310
00:19:17,586 --> 00:19:19,463
That how you'll grow up...

311
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,150
...and learn to forget about it.

312
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:22,692
I told you, it's not like that.

313
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:28,009
Don't be so bitter about it.

314
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,791
If it's too hard for you,

315
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,407
it's okay to cry.

316
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:33,490
I'm not having a hard time.

317
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:35,597
You'll meet someone better.

318
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:38,756
She doesn't know how to appreciate you.

319
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:41,417
I mean, you're such a great guy...

320
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:46,017
Is there...

321
00:19:46,556 --> 00:19:49,457
...any chance that she'll
give you a second chance?

322
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,406
I see. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

323
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:01,742
Do you want to go for a drink?

324
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:16,924
This won't do.

325
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,261
We need to do something.

326
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:19,968
I totally agree.

327
00:20:21,028 --> 00:20:24,579
I mean, why did you release the article?
You only made things worse.

328
00:20:24,694 --> 00:20:27,065
You're the one who wanted
to terminate the contract.

329
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:30,163
So you just agree to it when I said that?

330
00:20:30,248 --> 00:20:31,777
Shouldn't have I?

331
00:20:32,136 --> 00:20:34,204
You're so senseless.

332
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:37,534
I'm still not used
to those kinds of things.

333
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:38,722
Don't say that!

334
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:39,907
Why?

335
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:41,463
You don't like...

336
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:43,158
...this version of me?

337
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,447
No. It just makes me pity you.

338
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:49,846
It breaks my heart
when I feel sorry for you.

339
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:51,948
I'm touched.

340
00:20:52,657 --> 00:20:55,758
Geez. Why would you be touched,
when it's something so obvious.

341
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,411
By the way, do you notice
any difference today?

342
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,413
That's the question
that men hate the most.

343
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:04,406
I know.

344
00:21:06,774 --> 00:21:07,634
The earrings.

345
00:21:07,796 --> 00:21:08,780
They look good on you.

346
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:12,396
I knew it. You're definitely
different from other men.

347
00:21:13,078 --> 00:21:15,075
It's you who have great taste in men.

348
00:21:17,507 --> 00:21:19,776
Are you complimenting me or yourself?

349
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,913
Me?

350
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:24,381
Wait a second. Stay still.

351
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:30,474
Done.

352
00:21:31,286 --> 00:21:32,242
What did you do?

353
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:33,640
I didn't do anything.

354
00:21:33,957 --> 00:21:35,496
Oh no. I should head home now.

355
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:38,058
See you at our next secret date.

356
00:21:40,737 --> 00:21:41,796
Han Segye.

357
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:44,352
Call me when you get home.

358
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:45,305
Why?

359
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,570
Otherwise, I'll be worried.

360
00:22:01,436 --> 00:22:04,550
Oh my goodness. What's gotten into him?
He's acting like a real boyfriend.

361
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,429
(I just got home)

362
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:15,680
Where have you been?

363
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:17,083
Geez. You surprised me.

364
00:22:18,995 --> 00:22:19,996
Well...

365
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:23,413
...my friend's father suddenly
passed away. So I went to visit.

366
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:27,964
Your friend's father passed away...?

367
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:31,815
So you went to the funeral
wearing those pretty earrings?

368
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:38,534
Did you went to see "Uncle"?

369
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:39,841
At a time like this?

370
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:41,882
How did you know?

371
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:43,163
That his nickname is "Uncle"?

372
00:22:43,248 --> 00:22:45,378
Why don't you take a guess?

373
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:49,306
It's because you rambled
about it in the interview.

374
00:22:50,806 --> 00:22:51,643
I see.

375
00:22:51,728 --> 00:22:52,822
"I see"?

376
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,620
That's all you can say,

377
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:57,927
while I'm in the midst of
canceling all of your interviews?

378
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:04,993
Go ask you Uncle to smoothly cancel...

379
00:23:05,356 --> 00:23:08,157
...your T'road Airline interview.

380
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,071
Sure. Should I do that?

381
00:23:16,927 --> 00:23:18,026
No.

382
00:23:19,336 --> 00:23:20,266
Let's not cancel it.

383
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:22,757
Why? What are you planning to do?

384
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:24,267
I'm going to turn a crisis...

385
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:25,692
...into an opportunity.

386
00:23:32,816 --> 00:23:35,433
I'm not sure if this
is a really good idea.

387
00:23:35,517 --> 00:23:36,760
Trust me.

388
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,126
This is unbelievable.

389
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:44,657
-This is unexpected.
-Why is she here?

390
00:23:45,397 --> 00:23:46,497
She's here.

391
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:54,813
OMG. I have big news.

392
00:23:54,897 --> 00:23:57,339
(What is it? What happened?)

393
00:24:06,346 --> 00:24:07,292
This is huge!

394
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:08,546
Why?

395
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:10,062
Why? What happened?

396
00:24:10,147 --> 00:24:12,081
What is it? What happened?

397
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,173
What's going on?

398
00:24:13,257 --> 00:24:14,921
What is it? Tell me.

399
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,609
Han Segye is in the lobby right now.

400
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:21,240
OMG!

401
00:24:21,536 --> 00:24:23,011
-That's huge.
-Han Segye?

402
00:24:46,757 --> 00:24:48,853
Han Segye is going up to our floor.

403
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:51,086
What should we do?

404
00:24:52,266 --> 00:24:53,158
Oh my...

405
00:24:54,197 --> 00:24:57,497
Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?

406
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:58,791
Why is she here?
I thought they broke up.

407
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,653
-Is she here to meet Mr. Seo.
-Mr. Seo?

408
00:25:00,737 --> 00:25:03,450
-Should I go out and find out?
-Hey, it'll be so obvious if you do.

409
00:25:05,907 --> 00:25:09,691
I have no idea how I should
handle this right now.

410
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:13,611
Mr. Seo. This is the model of the aircraft
that we are planning to buy.

411
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,563
You need to approve this
so that we can proceed.

412
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:20,227
I'm here.
I'm heading to the interview location.

413
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:27,226
-Where are you going?
-Give that to me.

414
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:28,583
You want me to deduct your salary?

415
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:31,497
Big news! Big news!

416
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,697
What is it? Why?

417
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,087
There. Arrived.

418
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:39,060
Han Segye. Lobby.

419
00:25:39,145 --> 00:25:41,383
Han Segye just arrived and
is walking through the lobby.

420
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:43,606
What is she really goes
into Mr. Seo's office?

421
00:25:43,707 --> 00:25:46,417
-What should we do?
-I will go and take a look.

422
00:25:46,517 --> 00:25:48,192
I'll act like I'm lost.

423
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:50,462
Wait. Why would someone get lost
at his own workplace?

424
00:25:50,546 --> 00:25:52,715
-You're a team leader, on top of that.
-You're right.

425
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:54,907
Take this toothbrush.
Go brush your teeth.

426
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,785
It's way past lunchtime.
Why would I brush my teeth now?

427
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:57,995
That'll be more suspicious.

428
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,556
Pretend like you have braces on.

429
00:25:59,657 --> 00:26:01,098
You have to brush often
if you have braces.

430
00:26:01,183 --> 00:26:02,322
I don't have braces.

431
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,776
Say you have lingual braces.
They're attached to the inner sides.

432
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:06,931
Wow. She's a genius.

433
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:52,668
I guess you come to work.

434
00:26:53,076 --> 00:26:54,171
I guess you're going to work.

435
00:26:54,256 --> 00:26:55,607
I hope the interview goes well...

436
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,253
...as the Chief of Strategic Planning.

437
00:27:03,526 --> 00:27:04,705
Of course it will.

438
00:27:05,141 --> 00:27:06,648
I'm the model of the company, after all.

439
00:27:08,096 --> 00:27:09,167
They shook hands.

440
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:12,727
Have a good day.

441
00:27:17,077 --> 00:27:17,964
Oh...

442
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,310
Call me when you're done.

443
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,977
Let's have a meal together.

444
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,982
Sure.

445
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:25,424
It'll be my treat.

446
00:27:25,517 --> 00:27:26,355
Sure.

447
00:27:33,056 --> 00:27:35,157
Wow. Awesome. Did you just see that?

448
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:36,868
For a moment,
I thought we're in Hollywood.

449
00:27:36,953 --> 00:27:37,886
They're so cool.

450
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:39,619
They're the one who just broke up,

451
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,450
but why do I feel like
I'm the one who was dumped.

452
00:27:41,888 --> 00:27:42,731
What?

453
00:27:43,888 --> 00:27:46,127
Oh my gosh. That was the first time
we talked casually.

454
00:27:46,212 --> 00:27:47,012
I know.

455
00:27:47,096 --> 00:27:49,350
Wow. Your acting skills
have improved a bit.

456
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:51,806
I was very nervous.
Looks like it wasn't obvious.

457
00:27:51,907 --> 00:27:54,066
No wonder your hand was cold.

458
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,311
I'm sorry. A fellow actress texted me.

459
00:27:59,447 --> 00:28:00,492
Shall we continue?

460
00:28:00,576 --> 00:28:02,863
It looks like you two
are still in good terms.

461
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,902
Actually, we were worried
that you'd cancel the interview.

462
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:11,266
I don't see the need to avoid each other
just because we broke up.

463
00:28:11,427 --> 00:28:13,011
I consider him a good friend.

464
00:28:13,096 --> 00:28:15,561
I also respect him as a person a lot.

465
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:18,710
-Can we start the shoot now?
-Sure.

466
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:28,263
Is that what you call
"a cold but handsome man"?

467
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:37,286
Yes. Hold on a second.

468
00:28:37,653 --> 00:28:39,143
This is related to business.

469
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:43,717
I've never texted you regarding business.
Who are you actually texting to?

470
00:28:43,886 --> 00:28:46,752
Yes. Just a minute. I won't take long.

471
00:28:47,056 --> 00:28:48,899
Are you even listening to me?

472
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:52,919
-Sir!
-What? What did you say?

473
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:56,014
It's nothing.

474
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:58,899
What should I do know?

475
00:28:59,036 --> 00:29:00,237
You can...

476
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:03,177
...go home.

477
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:05,947
Go home?

478
00:29:06,668 --> 00:29:08,346
-Already?
-Yes.

479
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:09,432
Go home.

480
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,711
Hey.

481
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:19,884
Hand me your phone.

482
00:29:20,457 --> 00:29:22,714
-Why?
-It's worrying me to death.

483
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,170
Give me your phone. I'm confiscating it.

484
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:26,869
Why? I did a good job today, didn't I?

485
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:30,322
You're just dying to
show off, weren't you?

486
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,922
What are you talking about?

487
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,346
Then, what's with the profile picture
on your messenger?

488
00:29:35,447 --> 00:29:36,803
-What?
-You know what I mean.

489
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:39,702
The hand. That's Seo Dojae's hand.

490
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:49,995
What do you mean?
This is just a stock photo.

491
00:29:50,727 --> 00:29:51,922
Are you a kid?

492
00:29:52,427 --> 00:29:53,497
Never mind.

493
00:29:53,757 --> 00:29:55,665
This also an insult to kids.

494
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:58,820
Even kids these days
don't date like you do.

495
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:24,256
Why are you suddenly putting on perfume?

496
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:25,825
What's wrong?

497
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:28,041
It's for you!

498
00:30:28,136 --> 00:30:30,749
I want to lift the mood up,
the ambiance and the conversation.

499
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,190
Geez. The smell is too strong. Seriously.

500
00:30:35,437 --> 00:30:36,383
Look forward.

501
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:40,064
Hey. We might get in an accident.
Look forward.

502
00:30:41,876 --> 00:30:44,606
I'm not going anywhere.

503
00:30:44,707 --> 00:30:46,761
I'll leave after I see you go inside.

504
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:47,933
I'm being serious.

505
00:30:48,017 --> 00:30:49,903
I'm going to watch you go inside...

506
00:30:49,987 --> 00:30:53,038
...and wait outside for 30 minutes...

507
00:30:53,123 --> 00:30:54,686
...before I leave.

508
00:30:55,643 --> 00:30:56,902
I'm going inside now.

509
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:58,532
Watch me. I'm going inside.

510
00:31:05,272 --> 00:31:06,290
You should...

511
00:31:06,762 --> 00:31:08,019
...be careful no matter what.

512
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,267
Stay put.

513
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:13,582
And don't even think
about causing trouble.

514
00:31:13,937 --> 00:31:15,054
Got it.

515
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,630
Gosh, that girl.

516
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,447
What kind of a password is "10041004"?

517
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:55,009
Is that supposed to mean "angel"?

518
00:31:55,094 --> 00:31:57,105
What? Do you want me
to change it to something unrelated?

519
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,064
Like "0116"?

520
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,731
But that's also related now.

521
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:06,002
I told you not to say things
as if it's not a big deal.

522
00:32:08,356 --> 00:32:09,826
I like how your perfume smells.

523
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:13,230
Don't you need to do this?

524
00:32:13,486 --> 00:32:15,123
I no longer have to do that to know...

525
00:32:15,207 --> 00:32:16,707
...that it's your scent.

526
00:32:19,214 --> 00:32:21,069
I should only wear
this perfume from now on.

527
00:32:21,276 --> 00:32:22,960
I can't change my perfume as I please.

528
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:25,027
Being in a relationship
can be so complicated.

529
00:32:25,753 --> 00:32:27,508
Don't think that it's complicated.

530
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:30,833
I'd appreciate it if you think of it
as being consistent.

531
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:33,114
I'd also appreciate it if you do the same.

532
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:37,351
By the way, it's so thrilling
to be in a secret relationship.

533
00:32:37,974 --> 00:32:39,702
I have no idea that having
secrets can be so fun.

534
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,690
It used to make me feel
anxious, sad and lonely.

535
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,830
Now, we can be anxious, sad...

536
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,635
...and lonely together.

537
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:53,207
Shouldn't we aim to not be
anxious, sad and lonely together?

538
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:56,103
I should try my best not to then.

539
00:32:56,731 --> 00:32:57,857
That's better.

540
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:24,558
That light bulb.

541
00:33:25,477 --> 00:33:27,014
Why haven't you changed it?

542
00:33:28,947 --> 00:33:31,207
I was waiting to grow taller.
I can't reach it.

543
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:34,489
Should I do it for you?

544
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:42,126
Oh my gosh!

545
00:33:44,557 --> 00:33:46,371
Can you do that thing one more time?

546
00:33:46,577 --> 00:33:47,347
"That thing"?

547
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:49,897
That thing that you did
with your shirt buttons and your watch.

548
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:52,845
That was nothing.

549
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:01,353
It looks cool and sexy
but it's also funny.

550
00:34:01,437 --> 00:34:03,368
It's funny and cute but also cool.

551
00:34:04,147 --> 00:34:05,768
-What's your plan for tomorrow?
-I have work.

552
00:34:05,853 --> 00:34:07,221
I have to work too.

553
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:08,546
Why?

554
00:34:09,729 --> 00:34:11,079
I don't want to work.

555
00:34:11,805 --> 00:34:13,601
I'm wondering
if we can skip work together.

556
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:15,610
My goodness.

557
00:34:15,793 --> 00:34:17,923
I've never heard you say
you hate going to work before.

558
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:20,475
What's gotten into you?

559
00:34:20,564 --> 00:34:23,102
Mr. Seo Dojae, you must like me a lot.

560
00:34:23,364 --> 00:34:24,208
That's right.

561
00:34:26,976 --> 00:34:28,432
I think so.

562
00:34:31,512 --> 00:34:33,419
Do you know what just crossed my mind?

563
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,338
You'll be very surprised if I told you.

564
00:34:37,772 --> 00:34:40,052
I thought, "I want to change into
someone else right this moment".

565
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,714
"That way, we could be together".

566
00:34:49,716 --> 00:34:50,960
That was...

567
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:56,805
...the first time I ever thought
of changing into someone else.

568
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:02,867
Tell me...

569
00:35:03,822 --> 00:35:05,468
What was it like when
it happened the first time?

570
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,019
I was a mess, of course.

571
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,345
I prayed at the church and temple.

572
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:13,125
I even went to see a shaman.

573
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,623
But it's okay.

574
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:23,375
I guess you get what you want
after going through some misfortune.

575
00:35:23,547 --> 00:35:24,590
Just like now.

576
00:35:28,205 --> 00:35:29,213
Or is it...

577
00:35:30,151 --> 00:35:34,144
...you have to go through some misfortune
to get what you want?

578
00:35:35,156 --> 00:35:36,928
The order doesn't matter.

579
00:35:38,649 --> 00:35:41,080
I just want you to be happy.

580
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:45,132
I can see that.

581
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,582
I'm really...

582
00:35:50,297 --> 00:35:51,295
...happy right now.

583
00:36:03,803 --> 00:36:05,006
Be careful on your way home.

584
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,612
Don't get caught.

585
00:36:07,154 --> 00:36:08,356
I'll be careful...

586
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:09,665
...so I won't get caught.

587
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,596
Seo Dojae.

588
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:16,136
Do you want me to drive you home?

589
00:36:24,037 --> 00:36:25,410
We're already here.

590
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:27,456
Take care.

591
00:36:27,964 --> 00:36:29,125
By the way...

592
00:36:30,495 --> 00:36:32,209
...how are you going to get back home?

593
00:36:34,164 --> 00:36:35,380
This is my car.

594
00:36:48,743 --> 00:36:49,828
Goodbye...

595
00:36:50,006 --> 00:36:51,041
...and goodnight.

596
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,348
Thanks for driving me home.

597
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:56,194
Go inside.
I'll leave after I see you off.

598
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:25,903
Do you want to have
some ramyeon before you go?

599
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:39,196
I told you not to go anywhere.

600
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:41,540
So you invite him over?

601
00:37:42,582 --> 00:37:44,415
Woomi, the thing is...

602
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,434
I could tell from the moment
you sprayed on the perfume.

603
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:49,982
You just have to make me
work overtime, don't you?

604
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,173
Secretary Jung, the thing is...

605
00:37:52,268 --> 00:37:54,928
I knew something was up
when you were looking in the mirror.

606
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,363
Your neighbors made a report that there
are suspicious people wandering around.

607
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,130
You two obviously look suspicious.

608
00:38:02,224 --> 00:38:05,267
You go around wearing caps
as if to avoid people's attention.

609
00:38:17,189 --> 00:38:18,144
Geez.

610
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,373
Seriously.

611
00:38:27,151 --> 00:38:28,327
What's your name?

612
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:29,880
Yoo Woomi.

613
00:38:30,116 --> 00:38:30,989
Yoo Mi?

614
00:38:31,094 --> 00:38:32,294
Yoo Woomi.

615
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:33,502
Yoo Mi?

616
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:37,981
My gosh.

617
00:38:38,137 --> 00:38:39,643
I'm so sorry.

618
00:38:39,728 --> 00:38:42,964
You worried everyone by dressing
like that in the middle of the night.

619
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,705
It's because he has the kind of face...

620
00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:49,519
...that makes people
want to pick fights with him.

621
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:54,395
Yes. That's right.
I tend to make people feel that way.

622
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:58,569
We did our best to cover his face,
but I guess it wasn't enough.

623
00:38:59,565 --> 00:39:03,074
I can't believe people would bother us
by involving the police.

624
00:39:03,419 --> 00:39:05,125
Am I right, Honey?

625
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:08,725
I think you're the one
who's bothering me.

626
00:39:08,903 --> 00:39:10,626
Well, anyway...

627
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:12,394
...please be more careful next time.

628
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:13,628
We will.

629
00:39:13,777 --> 00:39:16,185
-I'm sorry.
-Take care.

630
00:39:16,269 --> 00:39:17,797
You can leave now.

631
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,492
I'm sorry.

632
00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:21,600
Goodbye.

633
00:39:22,074 --> 00:39:23,236
Go inside now.

634
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:24,785
Please don't worry. We're sorry.

635
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,525
We won't do this again.

636
00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:28,439
I'll lock her up inside.

637
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:37,945
Why did you touch me?

638
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:40,165
"Honey"? I want to throw up.

639
00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:41,989
This is all because
of that brat, Han Segye.

640
00:39:59,274 --> 00:40:03,663
Can someone please invent a machine that
can automatically remove your makeup?

641
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:11,160
What are you doing?

642
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:12,841
I've done this many times before.

643
00:40:13,049 --> 00:40:14,033
So don't worry about it.

644
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,644
Every time my friends
passed out after drinking...

645
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:18,433
I'm talking about Han Segye.

646
00:40:18,518 --> 00:40:22,008
I had to take care of her skin
since she's an actress and all.

647
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:27,647
I'm not going to get up
and be all surprised.

648
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:31,991
I'm too tired to even
lift a finger right now.

649
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,454
Why?

650
00:40:36,471 --> 00:40:38,752
Because of that friend of yours.

651
00:40:40,499 --> 00:40:41,653
Did they say they broke up?

652
00:40:41,738 --> 00:40:45,434
It would be great
if they left it at that...

653
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:49,137
...but since they chose
to make it look so cool...

654
00:40:50,043 --> 00:40:51,769
...I have a lot to deal with.

655
00:40:53,014 --> 00:40:56,061
And Director Kim had to
say all that nonsense.

656
00:40:56,405 --> 00:40:57,264
I mean,

657
00:40:57,355 --> 00:41:00,391
if he wants to talk nonsense,
he should've come to me.

658
00:41:00,549 --> 00:41:02,070
But he called me over...

659
00:41:03,814 --> 00:41:06,172
I don't normally tell
these things to others.

660
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:08,264
But why did I just do that?

661
00:41:10,517 --> 00:41:12,126
Because I listen to you.

662
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:16,074
It's because all this time,
you didn't have anyone who listens.

663
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:19,353
I'll listen to everything.

664
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,218
You can tell me everything.

665
00:41:27,336 --> 00:41:28,202
What's this?

666
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:30,710
What?

667
00:41:30,795 --> 00:41:32,954
You have something
you want from me right now.

668
00:41:33,756 --> 00:41:35,670
Wow, how did you know?

669
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,854
I'm a businesswoman.

670
00:41:40,644 --> 00:41:41,491
What is it?

671
00:41:43,361 --> 00:41:44,547
You have a lot of money, right?

672
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:47,240
Would you like to donate?

673
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,784
How can you say that
as if you're selling it?

674
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:54,868
So, if I donate...

675
00:41:55,016 --> 00:41:56,026
...what about you?

676
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,966
What would you do for me?

677
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:01,877
Kang Sara, if you donate,

678
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:04,067
I'll smile.

679
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:07,135
You said my smile has...

680
00:42:07,377 --> 00:42:08,333
...commodity value.

681
00:42:21,137 --> 00:42:22,985
Where did you get all this from?

682
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,928
From an anonymous donor who likes smiles.

683
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:48,731
That woman is so heartless.

684
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:50,831
What are you talking about?

685
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:52,890
She's just forced to live like that.

686
00:42:53,188 --> 00:42:57,231
She donated her child's heart
after he died.

687
00:42:57,489 --> 00:42:59,862
How could you cut open your child?

688
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,219
I could never do that!

689
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:02,981
What's the point of just burying them?

690
00:43:03,066 --> 00:43:04,644
The body will just decay anyway.

691
00:43:04,729 --> 00:43:09,463
I think I'd feel better if I knew
my child's heart is beating somewhere.

692
00:43:21,477 --> 00:43:25,697
Have you decided
which call to respond to, Juliano?

693
00:43:31,468 --> 00:43:34,520
I've made my mind a long time ago,

694
00:43:34,972 --> 00:43:35,961
Father.

695
00:44:06,547 --> 00:44:08,267
Just come home.

696
00:44:09,587 --> 00:44:11,028
How did you know to find me here?

697
00:44:11,299 --> 00:44:12,796
It doesn't matter.

698
00:44:12,979 --> 00:44:14,521
Just come back home...

699
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,325
...before your mother passes away.

700
00:44:18,607 --> 00:44:19,508
Dad.

701
00:44:20,186 --> 00:44:22,078
I can't live the way she wants.

702
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,634
I get it, so come back.

703
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:29,399
I mean...

704
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:32,666
...that is what's written in the contract!

705
00:44:32,751 --> 00:44:35,589
Look at the situation right now
and see if that's possible!

706
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:38,370
Does it make sense to take a week off
considering the situation we're in now?

707
00:44:38,455 --> 00:44:41,371
We included it in the contract
because we have our reasons.

708
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:42,664
Seriously...

709
00:44:42,749 --> 00:44:44,765
if you don't follow the contract,

710
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,606
we'll have no choice
but to take legal action.

711
00:44:47,691 --> 00:44:51,094
We're going to shoot out of the
city anyway. Just wait until then.

712
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:53,955
Or go talk to the director yourself.

713
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,813
Even the lead actress doesn't do this.

714
00:44:55,898 --> 00:44:57,045
It's ridiculous.

715
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:01,879
Wow, seriously...

716
00:45:02,403 --> 00:45:03,946
Geez...

717
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:16,193
Is it your hobby
to give others a hard time?

718
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:18,648
Is it your hobby to pick fights?

719
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:20,881
I heard you asked for a break.

720
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:24,256
Why don't you just drop out?

721
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:26,354
For whose sake?

722
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:27,678
What do you think?

723
00:45:27,763 --> 00:45:29,112
For everyone's sake.

724
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:33,764
We're the ones who will suffer
if you start throwing tantrum again.

725
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:35,208
That's enough.

726
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:38,999
You've been busy pretending
to have a good breakup.

727
00:45:39,343 --> 00:45:41,626
Why don't you put in
the same amount of effort at work?

728
00:45:42,049 --> 00:45:43,085
Please.

729
00:45:46,713 --> 00:45:47,993
For the time being...

730
00:45:49,133 --> 00:45:51,001
...let's push it as far as we can.

731
00:45:51,588 --> 00:45:52,715
Are you insane?

732
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,490
What if something goes wrong?

733
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,836
You don't have a lot of time left.

734
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,667
It'll be worse if I'm not there.

735
00:45:58,912 --> 00:46:00,205
You've matured since you got dumped.

736
00:46:00,289 --> 00:46:01,368
I didn't get dumped.

737
00:46:01,453 --> 00:46:03,546
Right, it's you who dumped him.

738
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:05,393
What was it again?

739
00:46:05,565 --> 00:46:07,536
"You consider him a good friend"?

740
00:46:08,214 --> 00:46:10,321
And "You respect him as a person a lot."?

741
00:46:10,406 --> 00:46:11,752
How did you know that?

742
00:46:11,878 --> 00:46:13,281
You never read articles about me.

743
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:15,188
Somebody told me.

744
00:46:15,379 --> 00:46:16,432
Who?

745
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:17,851
Someone.

746
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,723
Fine.

747
00:46:20,439 --> 00:46:21,658
Let's give it a try.

748
00:46:22,284 --> 00:46:24,199
Tell me immediately
if you feel it coming.

749
00:46:24,308 --> 00:46:27,744
I'll kidnap you and take you away
from the set right away.

750
00:46:27,924 --> 00:46:28,774
Great.

751
00:46:29,136 --> 00:46:30,996
I'll finish everything in one take...

752
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:32,360
...and finish the shooting quickly.

753
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,834
I'll make sure you get a lot of free time.

754
00:46:36,089 --> 00:46:38,091
Come do some volunteering,
if you have so much free time.

755
00:46:38,176 --> 00:46:40,704
Sorry. I'll be too busy having fun.

756
00:46:40,789 --> 00:46:42,335
Then at least make a donation.

757
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,473
Sorry. I have the intention,
but I don't want to because you asked.

758
00:46:45,909 --> 00:46:48,540
You should just keep your mouth shut.

759
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:51,113
That will really help
your volunteering work.

760
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,127
I went to the community center...

761
00:46:55,444 --> 00:46:56,974
...we've been to last time.

762
00:46:59,565 --> 00:47:01,211
I saw the woman you saved.

763
00:47:02,284 --> 00:47:03,586
I overheard...

764
00:47:04,803 --> 00:47:06,580
...that her son passed away...

765
00:47:07,547 --> 00:47:09,712
...and his heart was donated
to someone else.

766
00:47:11,956 --> 00:47:14,761
Wow, that's amazing.

767
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,117
Not just anyone would be able to do that.

768
00:47:20,206 --> 00:47:22,583
But we couldn't just compliment
her for what she did...

769
00:47:23,515 --> 00:47:24,873
...and move along.

770
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:27,125
I know.

771
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,461
I think about her sometimes.

772
00:47:33,332 --> 00:47:37,124
Her eyes looked so empty
as if the world has come to its end.

773
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:41,530
Her world...

774
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:43,738
...probably did come to an end.

775
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:48,140
Gosh!

776
00:47:48,459 --> 00:47:51,624
I can't seem to stop drinking tonight.

777
00:47:55,309 --> 00:47:57,569
Let's have rice noodles tomorrow
to treat our hangover.

778
00:47:57,737 --> 00:47:59,117
-Okay?
-Okay.

779
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:00,467
Okay.

780
00:48:05,711 --> 00:48:06,704
See you tomorrow.

781
00:48:07,141 --> 00:48:08,691
I'll bring Kingkang with me too.

782
00:48:09,128 --> 00:48:10,316
You're leaving already?

783
00:48:10,401 --> 00:48:13,774
I shouldn't come home late at night
while living at someone else's place.

784
00:48:14,173 --> 00:48:15,138
Bye.

785
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:17,474
Bye.

786
00:48:18,594 --> 00:48:20,068
I like his trench coat.

787
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:23,602
He's giving me this...

788
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:27,104
-Aren't you worried?
-About what?

789
00:48:27,189 --> 00:48:28,393
He's basically a slave these days.

790
00:48:28,478 --> 00:48:30,985
Apparently, he told Aram
that he's living on the streets.

791
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,035
What did he tell you?

792
00:48:32,234 --> 00:48:33,854
I, of course, never asked.

793
00:48:33,939 --> 00:48:36,704
He's an adult. I'm sure he can take care
of himself. Why would I bother?

794
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,791
Hey, what kind of friend are you?

795
00:48:38,876 --> 00:48:40,716
I'm like this because I'm his friend.

796
00:48:49,232 --> 00:48:50,505
This won't do.

797
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:14,587
Hey!

798
00:49:14,672 --> 00:49:16,172
Can we really do this?

799
00:49:16,257 --> 00:49:18,657
What if they're bad guys
who are taking advantage of him?

800
00:49:18,819 --> 00:49:20,123
I think we're the bad guys.

801
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:21,082
No.

802
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:47,527
I'm home.

803
00:49:48,396 --> 00:49:49,855
You're a bit late today.

804
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:28,107
What an...

805
00:50:29,267 --> 00:50:30,377
...interesting turn of events.

806
00:50:34,989 --> 00:50:36,075
This is...

807
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:39,365
I heard you're trying to
find my weakness.

808
00:50:39,977 --> 00:50:40,884
But...

809
00:50:41,499 --> 00:50:43,828
...it seems I've found
your weakness instead.

810
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:45,559
Just now.

811
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:50,009
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

812
00:50:52,808 --> 00:50:54,306
I'm not her weakness.

813
00:50:55,529 --> 00:50:57,288
I'll be moving out of this house soon.

814
00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:07,819
Thank you for everything.

815
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:10,083
Hey, Ryu Eunho.

816
00:51:11,647 --> 00:51:12,950
You guys should get going too.

817
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:15,377
We'll talk tomorrow.

818
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,025
I told you.

819
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,895
I told you we're the bad guys.

820
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:40,150
This is the rest of the chandelier's price
after deducting the pay for my work.

821
00:51:41,216 --> 00:51:42,759
Do you even know how much it was?

822
00:51:42,844 --> 00:51:44,026
I looked it up.

823
00:51:44,237 --> 00:51:45,681
The cheapest one costs 388,000 won.

824
00:51:46,347 --> 00:51:48,115
You're more thrifty than I thought.

825
00:51:49,158 --> 00:51:50,324
Also, this one...

826
00:51:50,962 --> 00:51:53,227
...is my small token of appreciation...

827
00:51:53,823 --> 00:51:55,837
...for letting me live and eat here.

828
00:52:04,843 --> 00:52:06,661
What are you telling your friends?

829
00:52:06,746 --> 00:52:08,305
I'll tell them the truth.

830
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,087
The truth?

831
00:52:11,172 --> 00:52:12,822
That I was working here.

832
00:52:16,831 --> 00:52:17,939
When are you moving out?

833
00:52:18,382 --> 00:52:19,289
Tomorrow.

834
00:52:20,726 --> 00:52:22,145
When did you decide that?

835
00:52:22,229 --> 00:52:23,068
Today.

836
00:52:30,948 --> 00:52:32,116
Will you come back...

837
00:52:32,841 --> 00:52:33,988
...if I call you?

838
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:38,905
I didn't mean anything else.

839
00:52:40,471 --> 00:52:42,965
I'm just asking because
I can't be bothered to hire someone new.

840
00:52:43,234 --> 00:52:45,227
Even if I hired someone...

841
00:52:45,338 --> 00:52:48,191
...it'll take a while until they adjust.

842
00:52:49,273 --> 00:52:50,468
Are you going to call me?

843
00:52:53,394 --> 00:52:54,566
Then, I'll come back.

844
00:53:01,188 --> 00:53:03,985
When did you find out about
the cost of the chandelier?

845
00:53:05,709 --> 00:53:06,953
From the beginning.

846
00:53:11,949 --> 00:53:13,888
Seriously, the kids these days...

847
00:53:14,302 --> 00:53:16,219
...can be so reckless.

848
00:53:20,289 --> 00:53:21,330
Fine then.

849
00:53:22,541 --> 00:53:23,488
I'll call you.

850
00:53:24,377 --> 00:53:25,331
Come back then.

851
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,271
It's too sweet.

852
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:56,128
I told him I don't eat breakfast.

853
00:55:42,186 --> 00:55:43,792
How nice.

854
00:55:43,877 --> 00:55:45,402
I feel better already.

855
00:55:47,404 --> 00:55:49,451
Hangover is indeed best treated...

856
00:55:49,769 --> 00:55:51,384
...with rice noodles.

857
00:55:56,213 --> 00:55:57,120
About last night...

858
00:55:57,205 --> 00:55:58,792
-Let's just eat.
-Okay.

859
00:56:02,582 --> 00:56:03,958
You're the one who befriended the enemy.

860
00:56:04,043 --> 00:56:05,571
Why should we be sorry...

861
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:07,597
Get your facts straight.

862
00:56:07,682 --> 00:56:10,409
I've had many chances,
but I didn't tell her anything about you.

863
00:56:13,557 --> 00:56:14,927
Are you dating her?

864
00:56:16,036 --> 00:56:16,972
Really?

865
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,335
I'm not!

866
00:56:18,936 --> 00:56:21,194
Why are you getting mad
when it's not true?

867
00:56:21,593 --> 00:56:23,077
This is about manners.

868
00:56:23,162 --> 00:56:24,512
Manners between friends.

869
00:56:24,597 --> 00:56:27,240
Good manners to someone who has
accepted me when I had nowhere to go

870
00:56:31,459 --> 00:56:33,802
Do you expect us to
understand right away?

871
00:56:34,479 --> 00:56:36,419
You should tell us in detail...

872
00:56:42,998 --> 00:56:44,212
We're sorry.

873
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:46,486
We're just worried about you.

874
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:48,131
I know.

875
00:56:48,385 --> 00:56:50,019
That's why I didn't say anything.

876
00:56:59,704 --> 00:57:01,940
Should I do it?

877
00:57:03,569 --> 00:57:04,480
Donate?

878
00:57:05,937 --> 00:57:06,787
Yes.

879
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:09,716
You sure agree to it fast.

880
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,098
And you.

881
00:57:12,183 --> 00:57:13,277
Are you still drunk?

882
00:57:13,362 --> 00:57:14,298
You're sober, right?

883
00:57:14,383 --> 00:57:15,889
She's completely sober.

884
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,004
She didn't say she'll buy me a house.

885
00:57:18,994 --> 00:57:21,124
I only make promises I can keep.

886
00:57:22,769 --> 00:57:23,838
Are you going to the shoot now?

887
00:57:24,497 --> 00:57:25,592
I should.

888
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:27,253
That's also a promise.

889
00:57:27,681 --> 00:57:28,878
I should keep it.

890
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,309
Eunho, we're sorry.

891
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:34,704
We were just worried.

892
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,854
That's kind of you.

893
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:41,902
I don't know about that.

894
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:46,871
What is this?

895
00:57:46,956 --> 00:57:48,576
Did we get the time wrong?

896
00:57:49,729 --> 00:57:50,656
No, we didn't.

897
00:57:50,824 --> 00:57:52,008
What time does it suppose to start?

898
00:57:52,397 --> 00:57:53,575
We're even late.

899
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:54,506
What?

900
00:57:58,788 --> 00:57:59,604
What is this?

901
00:57:59,689 --> 00:58:01,395
Be happy, Ms. Han Segye.

902
00:58:01,736 --> 00:58:03,174
From a fan of Han Segye.

903
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:08,841
[Be happy, Ms. Han Segye]

904
00:58:17,132 --> 00:58:18,009
Thank you.

905
00:58:19,258 --> 00:58:20,572
Thanks for the food.

906
00:58:20,756 --> 00:58:22,021
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

907
00:58:29,611 --> 00:58:31,667
He's more peculiar than I thought he is.

908
00:58:31,779 --> 00:58:33,175
Your "Uncle", I mean.

909
00:58:35,064 --> 00:58:38,125
[Be happy, Ms. Han Segye.
From a fan of Han Segye]

910
00:59:17,576 --> 00:59:19,521
Do you only buy fish with all your money?

911
00:59:21,143 --> 00:59:23,123
What are you doing here?
You didn't even call me.

912
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:27,270
Why should I call first
when I'm coming to my own company?

913
00:59:32,939 --> 00:59:37,355
What have you been doing?
Can't you do your job properly?

914
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,038
I am doing it properly.

915
00:59:40,565 --> 00:59:41,426
I mean, my job.

916
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:44,725
I heard you broke up with that model.

917
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:46,774
I told you she's an actress, not a model.

918
00:59:47,493 --> 00:59:48,716
How did you know?

919
00:59:49,176 --> 00:59:52,373
Look it up on the internet.
That's all they've been talking about.

920
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:58,042
How come you get dumped all the time?

921
00:59:58,389 --> 01:00:00,409
You fool...

922
01:00:01,589 --> 01:00:03,316
I'm so proud of you, Grandpa.

923
01:00:03,587 --> 01:00:04,684
You can even browse
the Internet on yourself.

924
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:08,013
You can't even get one woman.
All you do is talk.

925
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:10,426
That's enough. You should leave now.

926
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:14,036
My heart is already in pieces
after being dumped.

927
01:00:14,248 --> 01:00:16,115
Do you want me to take care of it?

928
01:00:16,741 --> 01:00:18,509
You want to fix it with money?

929
01:00:18,669 --> 01:00:20,025
She's already rich herself.

930
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:21,382
That's exactly...

931
01:00:21,647 --> 01:00:24,910
...why you got dumped.

932
01:00:26,445 --> 01:00:29,909
You should give her
what she needs the most.

933
01:00:30,477 --> 01:00:33,242
You're a businessman.
You don't even know that?

934
01:00:38,466 --> 01:00:40,628
What she wants the most...

935
01:00:42,155 --> 01:00:44,831
...is not to see me ever again.

936
01:00:45,245 --> 01:00:47,351
You fool.

937
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,207
Yes, we're broken.

938
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,364
Both you and I.

939
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:15,313
But now I know you exist...

940
01:01:16,405 --> 01:01:18,418
...that's why I came out to the world.

941
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:21,434
I thought maybe...

942
01:01:23,245 --> 01:01:25,323
...you've been waiting for me too.

943
01:01:32,062 --> 01:01:33,468
You're right. I have been waiting.

944
01:01:34,644 --> 01:01:37,619
So I could shove your broken life
into the dumpster.

945
01:01:58,502 --> 01:01:59,791
Cut. Okay.

946
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:01,562
It's a cut. We're moving on!

947
01:02:01,647 --> 01:02:04,021
Please prepare for the next scene, C-5.

948
01:02:04,106 --> 01:02:05,812
Let's prepare for the next scene.

949
01:02:05,897 --> 01:02:07,147
Makeup, please.

950
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:13,728
Hey, where is did it go?

951
01:02:19,557 --> 01:02:20,483
Hey.

952
01:02:20,729 --> 01:02:22,101
Will you really be okay?

953
01:02:22,185 --> 01:02:23,961
Should I ask the director
to stop shooting?

954
01:02:24,046 --> 01:02:26,523
I'm okay, there's only one scene left.

955
01:02:27,169 --> 01:02:28,627
I just need to do one more scene.

956
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:30,903
I have a bad feeling though.

957
01:02:31,983 --> 01:02:34,012
I still have two days left.

958
01:02:34,211 --> 01:02:36,843
Five days before and after
have always been risky.

959
01:02:39,633 --> 01:02:40,701
It's okay.

960
01:02:41,014 --> 01:02:42,234
I think I'll be fine.

961
01:02:55,887 --> 01:02:58,612
You're my mistake and imperfection.

962
01:02:59,495 --> 01:03:00,857
Once you disappear,

963
01:03:02,448 --> 01:03:04,293
I'll be complete.

964
01:03:35,259 --> 01:03:36,383
Cut, okay.

965
01:03:36,468 --> 01:03:37,568
Okay!

966
01:04:10,249 --> 01:04:11,429
Are you okay?

967
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:28,966
How old am I now?

968
01:04:33,699 --> 01:04:35,874
Sir, sir!

969
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:38,709
One of the child actors
couldn't come because he fell ill.

970
01:04:38,794 --> 01:04:39,641
What?

971
01:04:40,569 --> 01:04:41,811
Darn it...

972
01:04:42,764 --> 01:04:45,025
-Director Lee will flip out.
-I know.

973
01:04:46,569 --> 01:04:47,488
What should I do?

974
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:50,925
Hey, he has no lines anyway...

975
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:52,619
...let's just get a random kid.

976
01:04:52,704 --> 01:04:54,563
-He just needs to stand there.
-Got it.

977
01:04:54,744 --> 01:04:55,981
Get on it quick!

978
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:01,623
For some reason, I had a feeling
that I should...

979
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,951
...bring children clothes.

980
01:05:08,675 --> 01:05:10,096
What size are these clothes?

981
01:05:10,844 --> 01:05:12,148
They're for nine to ten-year-olds.

982
01:05:16,956 --> 01:05:18,564
Let's just say I'm 10 years old.

983
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:20,392
So that we're closer in age.

984
01:05:21,306 --> 01:05:22,469
But you look younger than that.

985
01:05:33,486 --> 01:05:34,655
Wait...

986
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:37,855
He doesn't know how to act at all!

987
01:05:37,939 --> 01:05:39,077
Another kid will say the lines.

988
01:05:39,162 --> 01:05:41,115
He just needs to stand there. That's all!

989
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:42,225
Thank you in advance!

990
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,370
No! You can't!

991
01:05:54,439 --> 01:05:57,103
Why... don't we have a mom?

992
01:05:57,188 --> 01:05:58,066
Cut.

993
01:06:00,766 --> 01:06:01,966
Shall we try again?

994
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:06,957
Action.

995
01:06:07,766 --> 01:06:09,895
Why... don't we have a mom?

996
01:06:09,979 --> 01:06:11,021
Cut, cut.

997
01:06:13,245 --> 01:06:14,674
Take it slow. Say it slowly.

998
01:06:14,968 --> 01:06:15,861
Try it again.

999
01:06:18,389 --> 01:06:19,235
Action.

1000
01:06:19,377 --> 01:06:21,526
-Why... don't we...
-Cut.

1001
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:25,157
Let's take a break.

1002
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:31,427
I didn't want to butt in,
but I think I have to.

1003
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:36,300
Hey, little kid.

1004
01:06:36,385 --> 01:06:37,283
Little kid?

1005
01:06:37,609 --> 01:06:38,525
Me?

1006
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:39,557
Yes, you.

1007
01:06:39,798 --> 01:06:40,861
But you are a kid too.

1008
01:06:40,946 --> 01:06:42,091
That's right.

1009
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,593
I'm a kid too.

1010
01:06:45,143 --> 01:06:46,164
Hey, friend.

1011
01:06:47,222 --> 01:06:48,434
Repeat after me.

1012
01:06:52,889 --> 01:06:54,195
Why don't we...

1013
01:06:55,049 --> 01:06:56,881
...have a mom?

1014
01:06:57,218 --> 01:06:59,470
Why... don't we have a mom?

1015
01:06:59,555 --> 01:07:01,599
No, no. Cut, cut.

1016
01:07:02,829 --> 01:07:04,147
That's not how it's done.

1017
01:07:08,589 --> 01:07:09,831
Why don't we...

1018
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:13,090
...have a mom?

1019
01:07:14,419 --> 01:07:15,626
Like that.

1020
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:19,326
Why... don't we have a mom?

1021
01:07:21,219 --> 01:07:22,296
Let him say the lines.

1022
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,639
Why don't we...

1023
01:07:28,429 --> 01:07:30,393
...have a mom?

1024
01:07:32,372 --> 01:07:34,558
Then, where did I come from?

1025
01:07:36,048 --> 01:07:38,412
Where do I go back to?

1026
01:07:50,439 --> 01:07:51,296
Cut.

1027
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:52,322
Nice!

1028
01:07:52,407 --> 01:07:53,356
Good job.

1029
01:07:58,561 --> 01:07:59,580
What's your name?

1030
01:08:00,022 --> 01:08:01,058
Where's your mom?

1031
01:08:01,299 --> 01:08:03,436
You're a really good actor.

1032
01:08:03,593 --> 01:08:04,435
Do you have an agent?

1033
01:08:04,853 --> 01:08:07,354
I'm from DM...

1034
01:08:07,439 --> 01:08:08,675
Hey.

1035
01:08:09,033 --> 01:08:11,329
He's already taken.

1036
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,820
My gosh. You did great, my actor.

1037
01:08:16,797 --> 01:08:18,334
He's signed to World Entertainment.

1038
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:26,299
I think I should buy a child car seat.

1039
01:08:26,384 --> 01:08:27,350
I'm sorry.

1040
01:08:27,435 --> 01:08:28,933
Don't be sorry.

1041
01:08:29,018 --> 01:08:31,584
You even shoot an extra scene.

1042
01:08:31,819 --> 01:08:34,058
You really did a great job today.

1043
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:35,453
Thanks for your hard work.

1044
01:08:36,221 --> 01:08:38,295
The production crew will be shooting
outside the city for a while.

1045
01:08:38,379 --> 01:08:40,044
So, don't worry about anything
and get some rest.

1046
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:42,013
I was disappointed because
I didn't get the leading role.

1047
01:08:42,098 --> 01:08:43,125
But this is pretty nice.

1048
01:08:43,209 --> 01:08:46,365
Exactly. How about you keep taking
supporting roles from now on?

1049
01:08:46,449 --> 01:08:48,002
Isn't that a great idea?

1050
01:08:50,881 --> 01:08:51,987
By the way...

1051
01:08:53,048 --> 01:08:56,368
How do I go back home like this?

1052
01:09:32,806 --> 01:09:33,696
Get up.

1053
01:09:34,489 --> 01:09:35,369
Yay!

1054
01:09:35,454 --> 01:09:36,482
-Geez -Come on.

1055
01:09:36,749 --> 01:09:38,109
That's it!

1056
01:09:38,888 --> 01:09:39,947
We did it. Sit.

1057
01:09:41,589 --> 01:09:42,972
Ta-da!

1058
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:45,096
Hey.

1059
01:09:45,371 --> 01:09:46,912
Do you really have to eat this?

1060
01:09:47,428 --> 01:09:49,145
Do you want me to rinse it for you?

1061
01:09:49,229 --> 01:09:51,165
I think it'll be too spicy for you.

1062
01:09:51,249 --> 01:09:52,958
-It's okay.
-No!

1063
01:09:53,179 --> 01:09:54,347
I don't think you will be.

1064
01:09:54,716 --> 01:09:55,715
Give me.

1065
01:09:56,339 --> 01:09:59,319
I know you're an adult in your heart,

1066
01:09:59,604 --> 01:10:01,173
but your stomach
still behaves like a child.

1067
01:10:01,258 --> 01:10:02,828
You shouldn't eat stuff like this.

1068
01:10:06,154 --> 01:10:08,062
I was craving spicy tteokbokki all day.

1069
01:10:08,147 --> 01:10:10,093
Me too.

1070
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:14,069
Yes, it's so nice and spicy.

1071
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:21,349
By the way, honestly,
I was scared earlier.

1072
01:10:21,434 --> 01:10:23,083
I really thought you would get caught.

1073
01:10:23,238 --> 01:10:24,774
-Me too.
-It's fine, it's over.

1074
01:10:24,859 --> 01:10:26,701
It's a relief that you didn't.

1075
01:10:26,786 --> 01:10:27,956
Eat up.

1076
01:10:28,484 --> 01:10:31,829
Enjoy, Segye.

1077
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:34,511
Don't do that.

1078
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:38,314
Why don't you stop talking so rudely?

1079
01:10:41,782 --> 01:10:42,928
(Mom)

1080
01:10:44,715 --> 01:10:46,722
(Mom)

1081
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:51,787
What should we do?

1082
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:53,541
What do you mean?

1083
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,148
I can't answer it.

1084
01:10:56,571 --> 01:10:59,674
Seriously, life is so unfair...

1085
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:04,569
Here, have a drink!

1086
01:11:05,255 --> 01:11:06,396
Cheers!

1087
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:13,905
Did you call Seo Dojae again?

1088
01:11:13,989 --> 01:11:15,175
No!

1089
01:11:15,259 --> 01:11:16,315
Hey...

1090
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:18,010
Hey! Come here!

1091
01:11:18,095 --> 01:11:20,574
Han Segye, your mom is here.

1092
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:21,947
Mom?

1093
01:11:22,766 --> 01:11:23,876
Mrs. Han.

1094
01:11:39,411 --> 01:11:40,594
Who's this?
