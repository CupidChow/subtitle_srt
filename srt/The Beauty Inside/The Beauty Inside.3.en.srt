1
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:05,912
You asked me if I can trust you.

2
00:00:06,302 --> 00:00:08,015
I don't have any confident
to not trust you.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,406
-But it didn't make sense.
-It didn't make sense.

4
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:14,598
Reason? I don't have one.

5
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:16,598
But that's just how I felt.

6
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:20,306
To me, you were just you continuously.

7
00:00:31,153 --> 00:00:32,565
You've done it before
so you know what to do.

8
00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:35,662
Just walk and trust me.

9
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:15,993
-It's not like that.
-It's not.

10
00:01:16,087 --> 00:01:18,190
-It's misunderstanding.
-Of course, it is.

11
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:19,896
Exactly. Think about it.

12
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:23,187
-How can a person change the face...
-Was that what we were talking about?

13
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:24,988
Don't you see anything on internet?

14
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,687
Right,

15
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:28,587
your phone is with me.

16
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:30,786
-I said, they are all misunderstanding.
-There's a rumor...

17
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:32,678
...that we're dating.

18
00:01:33,568 --> 00:01:35,186
It's crazy. Why would I with you...

19
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:38,598
I don't think that's how you should
talk to a person who saved you twice.

20
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:42,090
It's not proper to say at this situation.

21
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:49,203
It's not mine.

22
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,196
-It's yours.
-I said it's not.

23
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:52,911
It's better to be yours.

24
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:01,787
Do you have somewhere to go?

25
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:04,390
I bet reporters are waiting
for you at your house.

26
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:06,089
I do have.

27
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:18,350
What is this situation?

28
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,350
Are you the person who answered the call?

29
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,547
"She's taking shower", that person.

30
00:02:25,237 --> 00:02:26,555
Seo Dojerk?

31
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:29,940
Let's talk later.

32
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:36,026
Hey, my family is...

33
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:47,694
Hello.

34
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:49,486
Nice to meet you.

35
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,391
My family is having a meal...

36
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:18,429
What does he do?

37
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,627
How did the reporters know it was me?

38
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:27,723
I'm running a small business.

39
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,216
I'm not sure.

40
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,811
I think your side leaked this rumor.

41
00:03:35,113 --> 00:03:36,819
Listen to you.

42
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:41,707
Did you hear how rudely he talked?

43
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:45,809
Take it easy.
I have to go to my part-time job.

44
00:03:46,798 --> 00:03:48,600
Why are you making a fuss in my house?

45
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:50,800
-Do you think my house is yours?
-What should I do? I have nowhere to go.

46
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:52,698
Of course you have. Hotels are everywhere.

47
00:03:52,793 --> 00:03:55,206
How can I go to a hotel with him?
He's not you!

48
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,923
-Why would I go to a hotel with you?
-Why can't you?

49
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,113
Maybe it wasn't leaked.
Maybe it was intentionally reported.

50
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:04,124
Have you gone crazy since just now?

51
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:06,418
What's good for me if there's a
romance rumor about you and me?

52
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:07,926
There's a romance rumor about you two?

53
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:10,117
Yes, a while ago. Don't worry about it.

54
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:13,910
You know that they're
all just rumors, right?

55
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:16,793
I'm sure they got ridiculous picture
and start to write ridiculous articles.

56
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:19,707
-I'm totally sure of it.
-It was that day.

57
00:04:21,398 --> 00:04:22,803
The day when you changed.

58
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:31,294
You're very good at cooking, ma'am.

59
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:38,566
Follow me.

60
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,102
Open the door and play.

61
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:56,716
Gosh, you... Didn't you hear?

62
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:58,507
He said she changed!

63
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:00,410
It's a love fight. Love fight!

64
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:03,703
-How can you open the door for love fight?
-My mom and dad are perverts...

65
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:13,487
Yes.

66
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:15,779
Let's just say you were
right about that nonsense.

67
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,581
It is right.

68
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:19,268
Go ahead and talk around.
Let's see who'd trust you.

69
00:05:19,363 --> 00:05:22,069
Should I go ahead and talk to
see whether they trust me or not?

70
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,673
How did you find me on
that street full of people?

71
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:28,373
-That's not important.
-Of course, it is.

72
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:31,182
You can't distinguish people's faces.

73
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,873
Are we talking about that again?

74
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:35,376
Which one?

75
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:38,883
Tell me which one is me among them.

76
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:43,076
If I say this is me,

77
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:45,886
can you assure you can trust me?

78
00:05:48,772 --> 00:05:50,168
Do I have to answer?

79
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:52,961
You haven't answered me too.

80
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:04,200
This isn't answering. This is avoiding!

81
00:06:14,602 --> 00:06:15,514
This one.

82
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:26,312
I think that answered your question.

83
00:06:26,397 --> 00:06:30,609
I answered it that day and I
answered today in the elevator.

84
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,101
Wasn't that enough?

85
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:35,491
When you first met me,
you couldn't recognize me too.

86
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:37,783
Do I really have to know who you are?

87
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:40,886
Why? Just because you're a star?

88
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:44,169
And I think I should be
the one who should ask.

89
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:47,291
At the cafe, alley...

90
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,291
...and in the house,

91
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:52,179
was the person you?

92
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:54,775
Why are you keep saying nonsense?

93
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:07,032
This is it for...

94
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:09,036
...today's Han Segye.

95
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:12,830
I wondered what this meant.

96
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:16,039
But it explains everything.

97
00:07:23,355 --> 00:07:24,259
Why...

98
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,767
...did you help me?

99
00:07:27,164 --> 00:07:28,759
Because you're my business partner.

100
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,357
I...

101
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:35,865
...thought you're...

102
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:39,368
...in similar position as I am.

103
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:40,972
I thought every time...

104
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:44,558
No, even for one time,
I hoped that's why you helped me.

105
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:46,970
To be exact,

106
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:50,863
it didn't matter whether
it was you or not.

107
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:54,157
Sometimes, I just helped you
without knowing it was you.

108
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:56,864
Public will quiet down soon.

109
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,952
I'll make that happen.

110
00:07:59,754 --> 00:08:01,055
Answer me when I call.

111
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,701
Yes, Grandfather.

112
00:08:39,892 --> 00:08:42,201
-I was about to call you...
-"Yes, Grandfather"?

113
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,201
Come back right now!

114
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:57,628
What a smart move! Real smart move!

115
00:08:57,723 --> 00:09:01,437
I guess you don't want to
be the chief of headquarter.

116
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:02,929
Are you really sick?

117
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:05,231
My chairman Im lost some of his energy.

118
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:07,231
Don't kid around with me.

119
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,326
I asked secretary Kim to come later.

120
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,325
Why?

121
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:14,021
-To amend your will again?
-That's...

122
00:09:14,417 --> 00:09:16,822
...my indulgence lately.

123
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:22,040
I keep changing the name
between you and Sara.

124
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,626
I can't give my company to a punk
who can't take care of his own model!

125
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:37,123
Are you really dating with that model?

126
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:38,830
I have my own reasons.

127
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:40,433
I'll take care of it soon.

128
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:43,443
You fool.

129
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,133
You can't even date with a model.

130
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:55,527
Dad, get well soon!

131
00:09:55,718 --> 00:09:58,424
-Did mom visit you?
-Your mom is busy.

132
00:09:58,512 --> 00:10:01,613
-What a bad daughter.
-Don't talk bad about my daughter!

133
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,612
You keep threatening me
with my name on you will.

134
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:08,014
That's why she doesn't want to make time.

135
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:11,411
-I'm my mom's son.
-Quiet!

136
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:12,394
Go now.

137
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:16,309
Go and work,
if don't want to come down hard!

138
00:10:17,103 --> 00:10:19,411
If I ever find you a single flaw,

139
00:10:19,507 --> 00:10:23,417
you'll come down by
yourself before I make you!

140
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,409
Okay. I'll go now.

141
00:10:31,908 --> 00:10:34,907
Why don't you get checked from head
to toe, since you're already here?

142
00:10:36,297 --> 00:10:37,209
Bye.

143
00:10:53,584 --> 00:10:55,393
Aren't you saying hello
to your little sister?

144
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,989
-I didn't see you.
-I know you saw me.

145
00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:10,277
-You got a girlfriend.
-Yes, I got.

146
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,388
I already have so much...

147
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,278
...and I didn't need to
have a girlfriend you made.

148
00:11:15,572 --> 00:11:17,381
I don't understand a
single word you're saying.

149
00:11:17,882 --> 00:11:18,992
I'm disappointed.

150
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,079
I know our fight is tiring fight,

151
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:24,483
I never thought it was a petty fight.

152
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:26,680
I was wrong.

153
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:28,680
That's enough.

154
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:31,283
I'm getting tired of it.

155
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,874
Are you being generous?

156
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:38,373
Are you giving me a chance?

157
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,777
I'm forgiving you just for this once.

158
00:11:45,475 --> 00:11:49,075
Just because my mother loves your father.

159
00:11:57,227 --> 00:11:59,139
Gosh, reporter Park!

160
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:01,438
How can you say that?

161
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:03,438
What happened to our friendship?

162
00:12:03,526 --> 00:12:06,231
You ate so many bowls of soup with me!

163
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,926
She said nothing was
going on between them!

164
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:13,228
It's true! You know she doesn't lie to me.

165
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:14,328
Yes!

166
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,423
-That's right! I'm dating with Seo Dojae!
-Hey, hey!

167
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:19,122
-This is Han Segye and I'm dating him!
-Hey, hey!

168
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:21,024
-You crazy witch!
-Hey.

169
00:12:21,104 --> 00:12:23,723
-Really? Are you guys dating?
-Hey!

170
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,242
You should say no, even though they are!
You should say no, even if they hit you!

171
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:29,639
Are you crazy?
Why would I date that kind of jerk?

172
00:12:30,228 --> 00:12:32,651
I just said to mess with him.

173
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:36,241
Nothing will change, if Seo Dojae
becomes one of my scandal partners.

174
00:12:36,345 --> 00:12:37,741
But for Seo Dojae?

175
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:39,547
I guess something will change for him.

176
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:41,341
How fun.

177
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:44,135
I think she's out of her mind.

178
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:46,135
Who says you messed up with him?

179
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:48,238
You're the one who got messed up!

180
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:51,134
Gosh! Unbelievable!

181
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:53,639
Gosh, that idiot...

182
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:56,036
Never mind...

183
00:12:57,431 --> 00:13:01,431
You guys,
if I ever get take away to the lab,

184
00:13:01,526 --> 00:13:02,828
you'll come visit me, right?

185
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:06,143
What are you talking about?

186
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:07,945
Were you threatened just now?

187
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:09,445
Threatened?

188
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:10,851
By who?

189
00:13:11,646 --> 00:13:12,955
By Seo Dojae?

190
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:15,947
I'm right. You were threatened.

191
00:13:16,741 --> 00:13:20,253
Just now, when my parents were
here, he said,

192
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:23,763
"It's that day. The day you changed",

193
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,557
like this casually.

194
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:28,364
I felt like I'll have an upset
stomach, so I took a pill.

195
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:33,253
You punk! Why are you telling me now? Why?

196
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:38,139
I won't just visit.
I'll bulldoze out everything and get you.

197
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:41,932
That guy is crazy too! He believes that?

198
00:13:42,036 --> 00:13:43,742
He believes that nonsense?

199
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:46,343
I got caught again the other day.

200
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:55,053
He came to my house and he
saw how my face changed.

201
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,751
-What?
-What?

202
00:13:57,434 --> 00:14:00,838
What should I do?
What should I do with myself?

203
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,550
He had my phone too and he
saw my videos I took when I...

204
00:14:05,939 --> 00:14:07,145
...changed my face...

205
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,254
I'm going insane.

206
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:22,779
Reporter Park!

207
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,882
That woman with Mr. Seo is Segye.

208
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:30,689
Of course! I'm letting you
know to write the article.

209
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:32,681
Okay.

210
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:36,191
Yes, write many articles as you can.

211
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,593
Yes, I'm counting on you.

212
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:39,893
Bye!

213
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:42,203
Hey.

214
00:14:42,394 --> 00:14:43,894
Why are you doing this too?

215
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,291
The best defense is attack.

216
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:48,885
We should at least have
one thing to negotiate.

217
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:52,287
If they don't want to cooperate,

218
00:14:53,986 --> 00:14:56,191
then we won't cooperate too.

219
00:14:57,587 --> 00:14:59,587
He better say weird stuff.

220
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:02,698
I'll just say he's crazy
because he got dumped by me.

221
00:15:02,786 --> 00:15:05,786
-That sounds more convincing.
-What about the career?

222
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:08,797
-Are you just going to give up?
-Gee...

223
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:11,602
Being a girlfriend of
millionaire isn't bad.

224
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:14,195
-He's not just a little millionaire.
-He's great.

225
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,092
I'll be highly sought.
Everyone will be curious.

226
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:22,883
You guys are potent.

227
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:24,486
Potent, indeed.

228
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:34,734
(Han Segye is dating
with the millionaire.)

229
00:15:36,116 --> 00:15:38,330
(Han's agent has disclosed that Han
and chief Seo are seeing each other...)

230
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:43,632
That's how you want to play?

231
00:15:45,823 --> 00:15:49,140
Our position is not the same as
Ms. Han Segye's.

232
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,745
No, they didn't break up...

233
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:57,437
There must've been a
misunderstanding on Ms. Han's side.

234
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:01,340
Yes, I'll call you back.

235
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:04,234
Hey.

236
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,428
You must not have slept
yesterday because of me.

237
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,825
-So I'm going to claim for overtime.
-I hope...

238
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:12,020
...your overtime pay isn't my position.

239
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,719
No way.

240
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:18,022
My goal isn't being a CEO,
it's being a highest paid employee.

241
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:19,713
I'm very ambitious.

242
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,617
Anyway, you still did come to work.

243
00:16:24,911 --> 00:16:26,911
It feels like you didn't
want me to come to work.

244
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:29,025
It looks like you're having a good time.

245
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:32,216
-Have you guys talked?
-Sort of.

246
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:37,016
-So how long have you guys been dating?
-Don't kid with me.

247
00:16:40,404 --> 00:16:42,713
Ms. Vice Chairwoman left you a message.

248
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:44,213
What did she say?

249
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:48,403
"If you don't get rid of that wench
immediately, I'll get rid of her",

250
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:49,808
she said.

251
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:56,608
(Reporter Park)

252
00:17:01,093 --> 00:17:02,291
This is Seo Dojae.

253
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,291
I need a minute of your time at
1 PM, reporter Park.

254
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:14,096
Where did you buy this sesame oil?

255
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:16,887
-It's so savory?
-What do you mean where did I buy?

256
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:19,500
-Of course, I bought it from the market.
-Really?

257
00:17:19,993 --> 00:17:21,508
But why is it so savory?

258
00:17:21,604 --> 00:17:25,912
Maybe I gained my appetite back
thinking about him trying to resolve.

259
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:28,611
Let's see...

260
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,923
I'll take this card and... Darn it.

261
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:33,412
Yes, you lost.

262
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:35,412
Is that what you really think?

263
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:37,914
Gee, stop playing poker with your mouth.

264
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:40,019
Your bull crap is way too much.

265
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:44,019
-It isn't. It isn't.
-Oh, my!

266
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:48,825
Yes! I got double score for this.

267
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,124
Come on.

268
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:54,322
-You shouldn't do this to us.
-You're just a housewife...

269
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:56,626
Hey, Aram.

270
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:59,630
-Aram, haven't seen you in ages.
-Hey guys, how are you?

271
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:02,930
That wench always sleep
at other person's house!

272
00:18:03,022 --> 00:18:07,322
Mom, how can you say that to a person
who was drinking all night long?

273
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:09,330
Wow, you're doing so well!

274
00:18:09,418 --> 00:18:11,025
You're doing so great!

275
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:14,223
-You should scold her!
-She's doing great.

276
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,216
When she gets old,
she can't get to play all night long.

277
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:18,607
Hey, play as much as you can right now.

278
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:21,305
-What the...
-I'm so proud of you,

279
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:25,586
-so I should give you some allowance.
-How dare you!

280
00:18:25,793 --> 00:18:27,594
This is mine.

281
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,500
I know it's little but
have some drinks with it.

282
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,191
Thank you.

283
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:36,482
-Gosh, you guys are just the same!
-How pretty.

284
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:38,585
Hey, aren't you going back home?

285
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,190
I'll be here just for few days.

286
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:43,484
Bunch of reporters are in
front of her house now.

287
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,075
-Yes, another score!
-You said, you didn't play much.

288
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:49,688
What the heck are you talking about?

289
00:18:49,783 --> 00:18:51,688
-Eunho!
-Eunho!

290
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:56,684
Gosh, really?

291
00:19:16,078 --> 00:19:17,776
It's fine. Don't come out.

292
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:32,790
I mean...

293
00:19:33,282 --> 00:19:34,600
I look like this because...

294
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:37,298
...I can't even go back to my house
and where do you want me to go?

295
00:19:43,195 --> 00:19:44,401
You look fine.

296
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:46,190
You look natural...

297
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,087
-...and sincere.
-I'm not telling you again, I'm not going.

298
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:51,391
If you don't, you'll regret.

299
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,493
Have you forget that you owe me?

300
00:19:57,086 --> 00:19:58,387
I believe you still have a half to owe.

301
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:01,498
Can't you see the table has turned?

302
00:20:01,689 --> 00:20:05,291
I believe you need to talk
nicely to solve the rumor.

303
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:07,299
I'll deny it.

304
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:09,795
And that will make you a crazy woman.

305
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:12,002
Yes, I am a crazy woman.

306
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,899
People think I am crazy.

307
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:16,304
So I have nothing to lose.

308
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:17,796
But...

309
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:21,091
-...I bet it's not the same for you.
-No.

310
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,790
I have nothing to lose too.

311
00:20:22,894 --> 00:20:26,099
Rather, T'road airline and
Sunho group will lose something.

312
00:20:26,887 --> 00:20:29,998
That's the same thing.
What kind of joke is this?

313
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:35,797
If you become a crazy woman,
T'road Airline will lose out.

314
00:20:36,092 --> 00:20:39,099
If T'road Airline loses out,
then Sunho Group will lose out too.

315
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:40,496
After that,

316
00:20:40,885 --> 00:20:45,389
it'll be people's turn who
possess T'road and Sunho's share.

317
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,096
One of them invested with his whole
fortune, retirement fund of his parents...

318
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,187
...or his first savings.

319
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:55,996
You're shaking their whole
lives just to mess with me.

320
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:57,667
Do you understand?

321
00:20:57,961 --> 00:20:59,961
I don't worry about myself.

322
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,761
And not you.

323
00:21:05,449 --> 00:21:06,861
You still don't want to go?

324
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:16,230
You're taking other people
hostage and how can I not go?

325
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,126
I'll go,

326
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,726
if you make one thing clear.

327
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:23,730
With this, do settle my rest of debts.

328
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:29,135
Thank you for your positive cooperation.

329
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,331
You need to see whether
it's cooperation or not.

330
00:21:34,923 --> 00:21:36,419
(Sharing event for rice of the love)

331
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:40,331
-Please turn this way.
-Please looks this way!

332
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:41,826
This way, Ms. Han Segye!

333
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:44,921
What?

334
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:47,127
What is she thinking?

335
00:21:47,413 --> 00:21:49,118
She said she wants to find his weakness.

336
00:21:49,206 --> 00:21:50,928
Gosh, here she goes again.

337
00:21:51,412 --> 00:21:52,419
Do you know anything?

338
00:21:54,202 --> 00:21:55,114
You think?

339
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,114
Our company's fate is depending on today.

340
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,614
You need to watch well as if you
have an eye behind your head.

341
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:05,722
That's why I brought you here!

342
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:07,410
Please smile wide!

343
00:22:13,305 --> 00:22:15,309
You seem like you're
fine in front of people.

344
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:18,214
It's not easy if you have
that kind of disease.

345
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:21,122
Are you sure you're talking about me?

346
00:22:21,321 --> 00:22:22,519
Not you?

347
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:24,924
Then, the rumor isn't true?

348
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:26,226
Why did such a rumor spread?

349
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,924
It doesn't seem like it
spread without a reason.

350
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:29,718
Can you tell us the truth?

351
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:37,000
We just had a meeting
middle of our own schedule.

352
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:41,500
But I think it's enough to
misunderstand for those who didn't know.

353
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:44,198
It's just something funny that happened.

354
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:46,992
We also made an incorrect statement.

355
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:50,611
I wondered who uploaded that
false rumor as an official report.

356
00:22:50,698 --> 00:22:54,102
Sorry for the confusion.

357
00:22:59,433 --> 00:23:01,242
Isn't that president Kang Sara of One Air?

358
00:23:08,376 --> 00:23:09,472
Ms. Han Segye?

359
00:23:10,377 --> 00:23:12,972
-Please take good care of my brother.
-Pardon?

360
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:14,480
President Kang.

361
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,778
What are you doing?

362
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:20,071
My one and only brother
now has a girlfriend.

363
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,780
And you want to do good
thing with your girlfriend.

364
00:23:24,177 --> 00:23:26,271
How can I not come?

365
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,086
I see...

366
00:23:47,274 --> 00:23:48,980
I guess you guys aren't that close.

367
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:52,782
Think about it.

368
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:57,488
You just came here without checking
whether the news delivered the true story.

369
00:23:58,584 --> 00:23:59,695
How interesting.

370
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:04,083
I guess I misunderstood.

371
00:24:05,687 --> 00:24:07,585
It's a mistake, not misunderstood.

372
00:24:09,284 --> 00:24:10,696
I apologize on behalf of her.

373
00:24:11,188 --> 00:24:13,995
Gee, you don't need to. It's just funny.

374
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,194
I'll just accept the flowers,
since you're giving it to me.

375
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:33,612
-Wow, 100 thousand of sanitary pads...
-They all can fit in there?

376
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:38,824
Oh, I couldn't come with empty hands.

377
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:42,130
One Air prepared 100
thousand of sanitary pads...

378
00:24:42,218 --> 00:24:44,520
...for socially marginalized women.

379
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,924
Top of that, we'd like to stand
up for T'road Airline and Ms. Han.

380
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:52,514
I promise we'll extend our
support for socially marginalized.

381
00:24:59,862 --> 00:25:00,966
Unbelievable!

382
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:03,769
(Donate 1000 tablets for
socially marginalized children)

383
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,571
Oh my gosh.

384
00:25:10,045 --> 00:25:11,549
It arrived bit late.

385
00:25:12,758 --> 00:25:13,858
In information age,

386
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,159
opportunity for education must be equal.

387
00:25:16,254 --> 00:25:18,856
T'road Airline donates 1000 of tablets...

388
00:25:18,957 --> 00:25:22,859
...together with the rice for
socially marginalized children.

389
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:29,853
Now, now, reporters.

390
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:32,753
Due to the protection of human rights,
you can't shoot the community service.

391
00:25:32,847 --> 00:25:34,453
Please do understand.

392
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,349
I'll deliver the news
release within few days.

393
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:39,457
-Thank you.
-Why can't we shoot?

394
00:25:39,544 --> 00:25:41,752
When will you give us the release?

395
00:25:57,295 --> 00:25:59,602
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

396
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,308
-Have a good meal.
-Eat all you want.

397
00:26:06,592 --> 00:26:07,804
Enjoy.

398
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:10,703
Enjoy.

399
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,813
-Have a great meal.
-Give me more rice.

400
00:26:14,095 --> 00:26:14,806
More?

401
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,386
Eat all you want.

402
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:18,791
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

403
00:26:21,366 --> 00:26:22,578
Enjoy your meal.

404
00:26:24,468 --> 00:26:26,776
I guess you are not
close with your sister.

405
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:29,974
We are more like opponents than siblings.

406
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:32,470
Like uprising of siblings?

407
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:37,679
To be exact,
it's more like my sister's treason.

408
00:26:38,373 --> 00:26:41,468
-I can hear you all.
-Really? Great.

409
00:26:42,854 --> 00:26:45,362
How much do you recognize?
Do you recognize your family?

410
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:54,471
I'm just asking because
you're such a snob.

411
00:26:54,962 --> 00:26:56,167
Enjoy.

412
00:26:58,777 --> 00:27:00,665
How does it feel when you change?

413
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:11,692
I'm sure you always need to change
your character because of your job.

414
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:19,935
Enjoy.

415
00:27:20,128 --> 00:27:21,333
Have a great meal.

416
00:27:22,733 --> 00:27:23,743
Grandma.

417
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:25,844
You just had your meal.

418
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:29,350
-I just gave you a lot.
-I haven't eaten.

419
00:27:30,838 --> 00:27:33,442
-I'm not the same old lady.
-Gee.

420
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:35,744
I'm sure I just gave it to you.

421
00:27:35,846 --> 00:27:37,639
You might get stomachache,
if you eat too much.

422
00:27:37,738 --> 00:27:38,543
Just give it to her.

423
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:42,330
-Pardon? But still...
-It's not the same old lady.

424
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:43,327
Give it to her.

425
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:48,806
Hosoon, come here.

426
00:27:50,689 --> 00:27:53,684
-Oh, my!
-She's my twin sister.

427
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,174
I'm sorry. You look exactly like her.

428
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:01,786
Enjoy your meal.

429
00:28:05,862 --> 00:28:06,778
Enjoy.

430
00:28:22,941 --> 00:28:24,456
I'm sorry about just now.

431
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:26,159
I didn't know what was going on.

432
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,251
I think you still does not know.

433
00:28:28,346 --> 00:28:29,456
Can't you see?

434
00:28:32,007 --> 00:28:34,315
I'm checking again just to be sure.

435
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:36,809
Do you want to get married with Dojae?

436
00:28:37,704 --> 00:28:40,315
If you're going to talk nonsense,
then just move. My arms hurt.

437
00:28:40,503 --> 00:28:41,617
I knew it.

438
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,512
I did foolish thing.

439
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:49,303
If I'm correct,
I think we're on the same side.

440
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:53,812
I don't know what he did, but you
hate my brother, Seo Dojae, don't you?

441
00:28:55,097 --> 00:28:56,907
He's such a snob.

442
00:29:00,283 --> 00:29:02,494
That's right. Your brother is a snob.

443
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,704
-That's what I'm saying.
-And same goes to you.

444
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,710
You thought I didn't know?
You tried to mess with both of us.

445
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:14,893
How cute...

446
00:29:15,384 --> 00:29:16,783
...of you to talk recklessly.

447
00:29:18,184 --> 00:29:19,902
Maybe that's why people like you.

448
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:24,102
The uprising of siblings...

449
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:26,606
No, my sister's treason?

450
00:29:26,693 --> 00:29:28,907
Please exclude me from that.

451
00:29:29,196 --> 00:29:31,300
I don't really like that kind of
genre because it's too tiring.

452
00:29:32,311 --> 00:29:35,598
Gosh, how tacky...

453
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:10,015
Han Segye is an interesting woman.

454
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:17,358
Aren't curious how I knew about today?

455
00:30:17,452 --> 00:30:20,262
Manipulating media is what you do best.
Why do you ask for?

456
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:22,960
Is this how you trying
to cover up the scandal?

457
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:25,259
It's too boring.

458
00:30:25,648 --> 00:30:29,646
I guess I just showed up
at the table you prepared.

459
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:31,551
Anyway, you did something good.

460
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:34,041
Good job.

461
00:30:40,468 --> 00:30:41,679
About Han Segye,

462
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,176
there's something going
on between you two, right?

463
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:52,767
You two look equally confident.
Seems like both of you have the key.

464
00:30:53,763 --> 00:30:55,475
If you aren't going to work, just go.

465
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,281
What's wrong? I'm here to help you.

466
00:30:59,465 --> 00:31:01,974
Do you want me to help you with
the problem between you and her?

467
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,076
If you're here to help,
then wash the dishes.

468
00:31:10,921 --> 00:31:11,728
Oh, my.

469
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:13,626
It just slipped.

470
00:31:17,715 --> 00:31:18,523
Clean it up.

471
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:19,713
And apologize.

472
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:22,010
If you're keep being like that,
I'm going to break everything!

473
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:23,215
Go ahead.

474
00:31:24,195 --> 00:31:26,910
What's up with your response? It's no fun.

475
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:28,484
What's there to response?

476
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,188
It's not what I did.

477
00:31:30,282 --> 00:31:32,996
You should clean up for what you did.

478
00:31:33,284 --> 00:31:34,183
You need...

479
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:38,180
...to learn that.

480
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,400
He's so annoying.

481
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,071
Gosh, he's really annoying!

482
00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:17,245
Okay, little bit more!

483
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:19,541
Stand under the sun.

484
00:32:20,134 --> 00:32:23,657
Okay, nice! You look really nice today!

485
00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:26,350
Act as if you're tired.

486
00:32:28,443 --> 00:32:29,748
How pretty.

487
00:32:51,726 --> 00:32:53,746
He is so refreshing.

488
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:57,254
I regret I didn't make
him an entertainer.

489
00:32:57,745 --> 00:32:59,549
It's not too late.

490
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:01,934
I think he can go to
Cannes faster than I do.

491
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:10,716
Hold.

492
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:25,751
It's now. Stop acting cute and help me.

493
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:28,964
-When did I act cute?
-Look what you're doing.

494
00:33:29,062 --> 00:33:31,572
Why are you washing these with your
feet when there's washing machine.

495
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:33,166
You're still attacking
me even though I help.

496
00:33:33,463 --> 00:33:35,772
-What are you going to do?
-I'll take care of everything...

497
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,065
Do you see that woman?

498
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,340
You should take care of her.

499
00:33:42,442 --> 00:33:45,147
-She looks scary.
-No worries. She's not scary as I am.

500
00:33:45,826 --> 00:33:47,240
Well, that relieves me.

501
00:33:51,326 --> 00:33:52,039
Sorry.

502
00:33:54,521 --> 00:33:55,422
Where did she go?

503
00:33:56,613 --> 00:33:57,418
Straight.

504
00:33:57,897 --> 00:33:58,704
Run.

505
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,035
What are you doing?

506
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,439
This feels so familiar.

507
00:34:26,532 --> 00:34:28,443
I wondered where have I seen it before...

508
00:34:29,425 --> 00:34:33,023
...and Kingkang does it when
she distinguishes humans' faces.

509
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:41,750
You've done this several times to me.

510
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,760
You did to distinguish me, right?

511
00:34:46,845 --> 00:34:49,153
How did you know that the old
lady was different lady, just now?

512
00:34:51,743 --> 00:34:54,238
So there's an issue with
distinguishing people well?

513
00:34:54,332 --> 00:34:57,441
Yes, there is. A big issue, actually.

514
00:34:57,543 --> 00:35:00,936
They look similar, if you see them
roughly. But you can differentiate.

515
00:35:01,528 --> 00:35:03,036
And why do you think you can?

516
00:35:04,321 --> 00:35:06,831
Because you can't see them roughly.

517
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,522
If you see them roughly,
you can never differentiate. Why?

518
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:14,622
Because you can't recognize the face.

519
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,436
She doesn't know yet, does she?

520
00:35:30,736 --> 00:35:31,637
Let's talk.

521
00:35:47,468 --> 00:35:48,882
Can you help me?

522
00:35:49,474 --> 00:35:51,487
I'm bit busy.
Please look for another person.

523
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:53,377
Please help me.

524
00:35:57,487 --> 00:35:58,685
Please.

525
00:36:18,013 --> 00:36:19,520
You must have forgotten,

526
00:36:20,105 --> 00:36:22,420
but I'm the one who's
superior in our relationship.

527
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,620
I have more than one weakness of yours.

528
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:27,914
Are you nervous?

529
00:36:29,998 --> 00:36:32,003
You're doing this because you're nervous.

530
00:36:32,118 --> 00:36:33,015
Fine.

531
00:36:33,506 --> 00:36:34,819
Let's just say I am.

532
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:38,014
Let's just say I have the
disease that you think I have.

533
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:39,623
If so, what changes?

534
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:42,220
If so, I'll be at ease.

535
00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:44,923
Then that'll make us having
each other's weaknesses.

536
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:49,337
Do you really think so?

537
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,721
You're more naive than I thought.

538
00:36:56,419 --> 00:37:00,609
I don't care who you are or what you are.
I can still pull you down.

539
00:37:01,223 --> 00:37:02,926
The reason why I'm being quiet...

540
00:37:04,124 --> 00:37:07,514
...is because every moments that I
shut my mouth become a debt to you.

541
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:08,627
And how do you...

542
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,328
...think I'll make you pay the debts?

543
00:37:15,826 --> 00:37:19,134
I'm telling you to be afraid.

544
00:38:06,227 --> 00:38:09,528
How can a man be this weak?

545
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:11,930
I just acted like I'm weak for fun.

546
00:38:21,863 --> 00:38:22,966
I feel afraid.

547
00:38:40,473 --> 00:38:41,382
I feel afraid.

548
00:38:43,164 --> 00:38:44,376
I feel very afraid.

549
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,184
I've been living like this every day.

550
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:53,283
I'm always afraid
after I turned like this.

551
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:56,479
So I hid from fear.

552
00:38:57,872 --> 00:38:59,781
But you found me.

553
00:39:00,475 --> 00:39:01,888
You recognized me.

554
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:06,101
Why did you say you trust me?

555
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:09,802
Why did you ask me to trust you?

556
00:39:11,094 --> 00:39:12,897
That makes me mad.

557
00:39:13,493 --> 00:39:16,090
I hate myself getting
caught by someone like you.

558
00:39:18,096 --> 00:39:20,096
I regret I expected something from you.

559
00:39:25,855 --> 00:39:27,456
Fine, I misunderstood.

560
00:39:27,954 --> 00:39:30,064
But you saved me because
you didn't know? No way.

561
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:32,561
I didn't misunderstand that.

562
00:39:32,857 --> 00:39:35,058
No matter how I think, you...

563
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:38,262
...saved me because you knew.

564
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,558
Maybe...

565
00:39:41,642 --> 00:39:43,446
...that's what you want to believe.

566
00:39:45,748 --> 00:39:48,059
You lost your chance.

567
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:00,992
A change to be honest with someone else.

568
00:40:01,185 --> 00:40:02,576
As I know it well,

569
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:05,873
that chance doesn't come
as often as you think.

570
00:40:09,526 --> 00:40:13,039
Mom, mom, mom!

571
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:16,234
Mom, mom!

572
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:21,734
Mom, mom, mom!

573
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,130
Mom!

574
00:41:18,004 --> 00:41:20,810
What do you think you're doing?
Your child is watching!

575
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:22,709
Mom, mom!

576
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:26,508
If it weren't me, if it weren't this
man, we would've all died!

577
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,385
Mr. Seo, wake up.

578
00:41:35,586 --> 00:41:36,691
Mr. Seo Dojae.

579
00:41:56,792 --> 00:41:57,895
Mr. Seo.

580
00:41:58,689 --> 00:41:59,699
Are you okay?

581
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:04,501
Mr. Seo, Mr. Seo.

582
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:05,800
Mr. Seo.

583
00:42:15,347 --> 00:42:16,054
Blood.

584
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,761
You're bleeding.

585
00:42:47,261 --> 00:42:49,376
That's where she lost her first child.

586
00:42:50,574 --> 00:42:52,574
She sits there everyday,

587
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:55,175
then she finally goes
back home when sun sets.

588
00:43:01,566 --> 00:43:04,380
With the face as if she
just survived the day.

589
00:43:13,643 --> 00:43:16,254
-Where's Mr. Seo?
-He left.

590
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:19,951
He left?

591
00:43:20,153 --> 00:43:22,251
He told me that you did a good job today.

592
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:25,947
-He did?
-No, his secretary did.

593
00:43:26,032 --> 00:43:28,739
I didn't see him after the accident.

594
00:43:37,605 --> 00:43:38,513
Joohwan.

595
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:40,518
Yes.

596
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,610
-Can you drop by the office?
-Sure.

597
00:44:05,077 --> 00:44:08,490
Sunho Group hotline is different.

598
00:44:08,786 --> 00:44:10,488
The reactions are already good.

599
00:44:11,491 --> 00:44:13,388
You even got an offer for commercial.

600
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:15,294
Okay.

601
00:44:15,382 --> 00:44:17,899
Eunho will take care of
Kingkang for one more night.

602
00:44:19,392 --> 00:44:20,207
Okay.

603
00:44:22,594 --> 00:44:24,405
Have you gotten his weakness?

604
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,495
No.

605
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:36,080
Are you unwell? Do you want me to stay?

606
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:39,774
I'm just tired.

607
00:44:40,272 --> 00:44:41,671
You should go. I want to go to bed.

608
00:44:43,549 --> 00:44:45,759
Okay, take some rest.

609
00:44:45,861 --> 00:44:47,166
-Bye.
-Bye.

610
00:45:43,858 --> 00:45:46,072
Why did he act nice out of sudden?

611
00:45:48,568 --> 00:45:50,176
He's making me mad.

612
00:46:29,421 --> 00:46:31,434
It's been a while.

613
00:46:34,633 --> 00:46:38,750
It's nice to see myself.

614
00:46:59,391 --> 00:47:02,803

Everything didn't make
sense from the beginning.

625
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,322
The situation Han Segye is in...

626
00:48:00,008 --> 00:48:01,624
...and the person who knows Han Segye.

627
00:48:02,395 --> 00:48:04,398
Even though you understand the situation,

628
00:48:04,803 --> 00:48:06,621
understanding a person is...

629
00:48:07,711 --> 00:48:09,197

-I agree.

...sticks with an actress
who causes trouble.

638

I didn't know there was an inside story.

00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,672
You should've given me a word.

640
00:48:49,021 --> 00:48:50,421
Ms. Han Segye is...

641
00:48:50,912 --> 00:48:53,523
...the best scandal maker in Korea.

642
00:48:53,718 --> 00:48:55,832
She always get malicious comments
whenever article comes up.

the clothes she wore run out of stock.

646
00:49:05,448 --> 00:49:08,554
The cosmetics she advertises
become the best seller.

647
00:49:08,835 --> 00:49:13,253
Even the snack she ate, they had
to create another producing line.

648
00:49:14,537 --> 00:49:17,731
It'll be faster to not look for
her name in every year's hit.

649
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:22,114
By now, her greatest hit is
herself, Han Segye.

650
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:26,108
You're driving me nuts.

651
00:49:28,987 --> 00:49:31,687
Mr. Chairman, Ms. Vice chairwoman...

652
00:49:31,782 --> 00:49:34,083
...and all other directors
will attend the ceremony.

653
00:49:34,177 --> 00:49:36,888
Of course, our model, Ms. Han as well.

654
00:49:37,487 --> 00:49:41,399
I'm telling you many people are watching.

655
00:49:41,991 --> 00:49:43,698
Don't make any mistake.

656
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,003
Thank you for your concern.

657
00:49:47,805 --> 00:49:49,509
Having said that,

658
00:49:50,101 --> 00:49:53,513
I'll be much more grateful, if you could
return the card that I gave you last time.

659
00:49:59,193 --> 00:50:03,084
You asked me to buy a meal and plane.

660
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:07,670
I haven't used it for once.

661
00:50:10,368 --> 00:50:11,176
Well, then,

662
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,070
I'll see you at the ceremony.

663
00:50:13,864 --> 00:50:14,874
Director Kim.

664
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,859
I'll see you at the ceremony.

665
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:30,916
Why do I have to get in
trouble because of her?

666
00:50:44,891 --> 00:50:47,604
Here's two cups of ice americano.

667
00:50:47,893 --> 00:50:49,097
Enjoy your drinks.

668
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:55,391
-Would you like to order?
-One caffe latte, please.

669
00:50:55,493 --> 00:50:57,795
One caffe latte? What size?

670
00:50:57,889 --> 00:50:59,591
-Small.
-Small it is.

671
00:50:59,888 --> 00:51:01,092
It's 4000 won.

672
00:51:03,684 --> 00:51:05,199
Please wait for a while.

673
00:51:10,272 --> 00:51:12,685
One hot vanilla latte to go, please.

674
00:51:14,979 --> 00:51:15,686
Hey?

675
00:51:20,158 --> 00:51:22,372
-Hello.
-Hey.

676
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,866
Do you have a coupon?

677
00:51:25,064 --> 00:51:26,279
No.

678
00:51:32,245 --> 00:51:34,748
I stamped twice since
you're doing something good.

679
00:51:37,354 --> 00:51:37,959
Thanks.

680
00:51:39,455 --> 00:51:41,056
Caffe latte and vanilla latte.

681
00:51:46,907 --> 00:51:48,609
I bet you're working near by.

682
00:51:49,201 --> 00:51:50,016
No.

683
00:51:51,495 --> 00:51:52,916
Please come again.

684
00:52:04,982 --> 00:52:07,485
Kids nowadays are so reckless.

685
00:52:17,139 --> 00:52:18,449
What he does is cute.

686
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:21,450
Did you make sure each latte
was give to the right person?

687
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,242
Yes, I drew heart for vanilla latte.

688
00:52:24,629 --> 00:52:25,737
Would you like to order?

689
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:41,675
Have it,

690
00:52:42,173 --> 00:52:44,288
the eternal beauty.

691
00:52:47,966 --> 00:52:50,880
The eternal beauty my ass...

692
00:52:50,974 --> 00:52:53,773
Why? You were doing so great.

693
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:57,179
It's so funny.

694
00:52:58,976 --> 00:53:01,780
Sometimes,
it's so funny that I get scared.

695
00:53:03,274 --> 00:53:05,876
Why am I living so shamelessly?

696
00:53:06,663 --> 00:53:09,881
Why am I doing this tenaciously?

697
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:13,989
-Don't you dare say you want to retire.
-Retire?

698
00:53:15,594 --> 00:53:17,390
I want to.

699
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:20,883
But I can never choose that path.

700
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:25,791
I keep saying I want to
because I know I can't.

701
00:53:26,492 --> 00:53:30,494
Like how people say they want to die
but in the end, they keep on living.

702
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,680
Why can't I give up?

703
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:40,084
Why do I...

704
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:43,172
...keep liking this job?

705
00:53:44,649 --> 00:53:45,557
I...

706
00:53:50,642 --> 00:53:53,443
I'm confused and tired.

707
00:53:54,136 --> 00:53:56,638
Like how I became old overnight.

708
00:54:00,317 --> 00:54:03,504
(Prosopagnosic)

709
00:54:05,512 --> 00:54:08,715
Kingkang, it's me.

710
00:54:09,018 --> 00:54:10,813
You were fine when my face changed.

711
00:54:10,908 --> 00:54:13,014
Gee, why can't recognize me
when I put on the facial mask.

712
00:54:13,108 --> 00:54:15,020
Gosh, foolish dog.

713
00:54:15,094 --> 00:54:16,811
(Prosopagnosic)

714
00:54:17,302 --> 00:54:18,406
Quiet.

715
00:54:18,493 --> 00:54:19,984
(It's a cognitive disorder
of face perception.)

716
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:21,593
(Definition)

717
00:54:21,688 --> 00:54:23,188
(Cause)

718
00:54:23,275 --> 00:54:25,375
Face blindness...

719
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:28,383
It's called face blindness.

720
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,761
"Usually,it caused by
brain damage such as..."

721
00:54:30,853 --> 00:54:33,964
"...head injury,
stroke and Degenerative changes."

722
00:54:38,352 --> 00:54:39,956
"These patients..."

723
00:54:40,663 --> 00:54:45,067
"...have difficulty to recognize the
person's face whom they see everyday."

724
00:54:45,153 --> 00:54:46,764
"In most case, they have
difficulty to recognize..."

725
00:54:46,856 --> 00:54:49,953
"...the faces of their partner and
child whom they spent time with."

726
00:54:51,447 --> 00:54:56,555
"They even have difficulty
to recognize themselves."

727
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:04,840
"These patients use other information such
as hair style, walk, clothes or voice..."

728
00:55:04,925 --> 00:55:08,133
"...to distinguish people."

729
00:55:13,946 --> 00:55:15,158
What's so pitiful about him?

730
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,763
I don't pity him. I don't pity him.

731
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:25,778
I don't pity him. I don't pity him...

732
00:55:28,165 --> 00:55:30,466
Kingkang!

733
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:35,162
"One of the difficulties for them is..."

734
00:55:35,247 --> 00:55:38,351
"...understanding the story
of movies or series..."

735
00:55:47,784 --> 00:55:49,490
About Han Segye,

736
00:55:51,488 --> 00:55:53,688
-is she pretty?
-Well...

737
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:55,386
She is.

738
00:55:56,981 --> 00:55:58,587
But she's not my type.

739
00:56:01,873 --> 00:56:03,987
How is she not your type?

740
00:56:04,074 --> 00:56:07,878
Well, she kind of reminds me
of Joseon white porcelain.

741
00:56:08,275 --> 00:56:10,064
Anyway, she isn't my type.

742
00:56:10,172 --> 00:56:12,085
She's too pale.

743
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:14,394
And her lips are too red.

744
00:56:14,481 --> 00:56:15,981
What's your type?

745
00:56:17,471 --> 00:56:18,373
It's a secret.

746
00:56:19,564 --> 00:56:20,378
What is it?

747
00:56:20,465 --> 00:56:22,673
Would you know, even if I tell you?

748
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:25,083
Hey,

749
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:28,092
you shouldn't look down on me
because I can't recognize people.

750
00:56:28,186 --> 00:56:29,487
I get hurt.

751
00:56:29,877 --> 00:56:32,878
Stop acting pitiful.
It doesn't work on me.

752
00:56:52,224 --> 00:56:55,832
Well, she kind of reminds me
of Joseon white porcelain.

753
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:20,264
Let's get used to it.

754
00:58:21,361 --> 00:58:22,769
I have to see you for long time.

755
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:25,266
So let's...

756
00:58:26,464 --> 00:58:27,775
...get to know each other.

757
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:44,487
Honey,

758
00:58:45,273 --> 00:58:46,875
why are you so dolled up todya?

759
00:58:50,476 --> 00:58:52,784
Because there's a person
I don't want to beat.

760
00:58:55,677 --> 00:58:56,479
(Take off ceremony)

761
00:58:56,573 --> 00:58:57,980
(T'way)

762
00:59:35,532 --> 00:59:37,826
Director Kim Hongwoo,
Head of department Baek Sangyong,

763
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,409
Head of department Seo Mooseok, Ms.
Vice chairwoman, Mr. Chairman...

764
00:59:41,604 --> 00:59:43,415
...and vice president Kyla.

765
00:59:43,509 --> 00:59:46,710
Next is director of a local aviation
office of Seoul Kang Kyungkoo.

766
00:59:46,811 --> 00:59:48,514
He's a VIP you need to be cautious with.

767
00:59:48,608 --> 00:59:50,209
He's an attention seeker.

768
00:59:50,294 --> 00:59:52,294
Also he's a person who can strike...

769
00:59:52,386 --> 00:59:54,795
...a fatal and fastest
blow to T'road Airline.

770
00:59:58,182 --> 00:59:59,386
It's Ms. Han Segye.

771
01:01:10,707 --> 01:01:12,106
You escaped.

772
01:01:20,655 --> 01:01:24,164
I found a good marriageable
bride and send him to meet her.

773
01:01:24,258 --> 01:01:26,759
And seems like he didn't
like her that much.

774
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:30,166
I suffered for so long
apologizing to her parents.

775
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:33,059
He's too picky.

776
01:01:33,145 --> 01:01:35,557
Of course because he grew
up seeing his mother.

777
01:01:35,642 --> 01:01:37,945
-It's not like that.
-If that's not the case,

778
01:01:38,046 --> 01:01:41,748
how could you pretend that you're
talking to you lover in front of her?

779
01:01:42,543 --> 01:01:43,357
Wait.

780
01:01:44,043 --> 01:01:46,647
Does he really have a lover, Joohwan?

781
01:01:47,442 --> 01:01:49,442
Not that I know of, ma'am.

782
01:01:50,637 --> 01:01:53,241
You pathetic bastard.
You don't even have a lover.

783
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:55,646
Are you sure he doesn't?

784
01:01:58,237 --> 01:02:00,031
We're in trouble, if you aren't sure.

785
01:02:00,132 --> 01:02:03,429
Don't make those false rumors as a truth.

786
01:02:03,523 --> 01:02:04,729
I'm sure.

787
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:07,427
I'm sure, so don't scold him.

788
01:02:07,521 --> 01:02:08,920
Well, that's good.

789
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:11,313
Let's go, Dad.

790
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:27,163
Oh, I have that. I'll get it for you.
I'll be right back.

791
01:02:28,354 --> 01:02:29,660
Oh, my!

792
01:02:29,754 --> 01:02:31,965
Oh, my. I'm so sorry. What should I do?

793
01:02:32,167 --> 01:02:33,877
-I'm so sorry.
-Are you okay?

794
01:02:33,957 --> 01:02:36,568
-It's fine.
-I'm sorry.

795
01:02:37,753 --> 01:02:40,367
Ribbon cutting ceremony will be held.

796
01:02:40,452 --> 01:02:43,055
So please sit down your seat.

797
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:46,861
And for the honored guests,
please come up to the stage.

798
01:03:04,953 --> 01:03:05,955
About that day...

799
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:09,660
Congratulations, sir!

800
01:03:09,774 --> 01:03:12,477
Congratulations, chief Seo!

801
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:17,450
Please understand my outfit.

802
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:18,756
Someone poured on my blazer.

803
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,451
It was so hectic, so I couldn't say hello.

804
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:26,133
Oh, yes.

805
01:03:29,615 --> 01:03:31,335
I hope you aren't recognizing me!

806
01:03:37,114 --> 01:03:38,016
Who is he?

807
01:03:39,308 --> 01:03:40,310
What's wrong with him?

808
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:55,372
Don't tell me, you really...

809
01:03:59,472 --> 01:04:00,569
Hello!

810
01:04:01,161 --> 01:04:03,476
Can't believe I met you here!

811
01:04:03,563 --> 01:04:05,575
It's so nice to see you.

812
01:04:05,771 --> 01:04:08,567
Do we know each other?

813
01:04:08,769 --> 01:04:09,476
Pardon?

814
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,481
-Don't you know me?
-Of course, I do, Ms. Han Segye.

815
01:04:13,566 --> 01:04:16,776
Exactly. When did you come?
Have you eaten?

816
01:04:16,861 --> 01:04:17,564
Pardon?

817
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:21,164
By the way, what was your name?

818
01:04:21,762 --> 01:04:23,876
Kim? Lee...

819
01:04:24,966 --> 01:04:25,571
Park...

820
01:04:28,169 --> 01:04:29,569
How foolish of me.

821
01:04:29,663 --> 01:04:32,960
I'm good at memorizing
lines but I suck at names.

822
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:34,654
I'm Jang Kyungkoo.

823
01:04:34,748 --> 01:04:37,150
Oh, right! I now remember
after hearing your name.

824
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:39,845
-We don't know each other.
-Pardon?

825
01:04:40,747 --> 01:04:42,349
But why did you look so familiar?

826
01:04:42,941 --> 01:04:44,855
Maybe I've seen at the economic magazine.

827
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:46,644
You read economic magazine?

828
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:47,849
No.

829
01:04:59,018 --> 01:05:00,930
We'll proceed the ribbon
cutting ceremony to...

830
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:05,136
...celebrate new take off of T'road
and wish for the growth of it.

831
01:05:05,223 --> 01:05:10,024
For honored guests, please cut the
ribbon in count one, two, three.

832
01:05:16,409 --> 01:05:19,712
-Ms. Han Segye.
-You don't need to thank me.

833
01:05:21,704 --> 01:05:22,513
One!

834
01:05:22,598 --> 01:05:25,213
I wouldn't care whether it was you or not.

835
01:05:25,912 --> 01:05:26,827
Two!

836
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,517
I would've helped even if
I didn't know it was you.

837
01:05:31,812 --> 01:05:32,724
Three!

838
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:11,077
I feel afraid.

839
01:06:12,466 --> 01:06:13,870
I feel very afraid.

840
01:06:14,282 --> 01:06:16,084
So I hid from fear.

841
01:06:16,268 --> 01:06:18,084
But you found me.

842
01:06:21,165 --> 01:06:22,482
You recognized me.

843
01:06:25,673 --> 01:06:27,587
Even so, you were still...

844
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:30,889
I wouldn't care whether it was you or not.

845
01:06:31,286 --> 01:06:33,786
I would've helped even if
I didn't know it was you.

846
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,699
You really aren't scared.

847
01:06:53,261 --> 01:06:54,570
You should've left it be.

848
01:06:54,666 --> 01:06:57,474
You should've let that snob get doomed.

849
01:06:57,768 --> 01:07:01,371
-I was being nosy again.
-No, you did great.

850
01:07:01,766 --> 01:07:05,167
If he has conscience, he wouldn't
hurt the person who saved him.

851
01:07:11,567 --> 01:07:12,678
Hello?

852
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:16,283
A document? What document?

853
01:07:16,974 --> 01:07:19,879
Hey, he says I forgot to get the document.

854
01:07:20,371 --> 01:07:22,188
I'll be right back so stay here.

855
01:07:22,473 --> 01:07:24,290
-Come back quickly.
-Okay.

856
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:27,782
What document have I left?

857
01:07:29,878 --> 01:07:30,973
You're right.

858
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:33,973
I should've let him get doomed.

859
01:07:35,163 --> 01:07:37,983
And why did I...

860
01:07:40,277 --> 01:07:42,388
But I pity him.

861
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,794
Mr. Seo Dojae.

862
01:07:53,683 --> 01:07:56,000
-What are you doing?
-You told me last time.

863
01:07:56,592 --> 01:07:59,608
I was the one who found
you hiding from fear.

864
01:08:00,204 --> 01:08:03,711
I threw away my chance to be honest.

865
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:05,814
That's why I'm telling you this.

866
01:08:06,307 --> 01:08:08,417
I want to find out about you more.

867
01:08:08,901 --> 01:08:11,218
I want to have my chance to be honest.

868
01:08:12,814 --> 01:08:15,317
-What are you talking about...
-Are you busy later?

869
01:08:16,809 --> 01:08:19,125
No, I'm not busy, but...

870
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:20,131
Good.

871
01:08:21,115 --> 01:08:24,519
Then, let's sleep together with me later.

872
01:08:28,609 --> 01:08:31,913
-Pardon?
-Let's sleep together with me.

873
01:09:06,668 --> 01:09:09,381
(Beauty Inside)

874
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,468
-Let's make a contract.
-I won't run away.

875
01:09:12,563 --> 01:09:14,364
I know that well, Ms. Han.

876
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:16,158
What does he mean he
wants to sleep with me?

877
01:09:16,246 --> 01:09:18,150
I just need to stay beside you, right?

878
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,755
Good. Just sleep with him.

879
01:09:19,843 --> 01:09:22,160
Why are you keep showing up?
Are you following me?

880
01:09:22,248 --> 01:09:24,155
No way. You're older than me.

881
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,663
Are you really following me?

882
01:09:25,751 --> 01:09:27,560
Aren't I better than her?

883
01:09:27,656 --> 01:09:30,456
-You're better.
-Tell me one more time.

884
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,861
You are the only actress
that I can distinguish.
