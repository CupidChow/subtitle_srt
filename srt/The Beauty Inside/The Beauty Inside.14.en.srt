1
00:00:02,016 --> 00:00:03,376
Seo Dojae...

2
00:00:05,907 --> 00:00:07,154
Please listen carefully.

3
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:15,345
What happened to you was my fault.

4
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:18,106
What are you saying?

5
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:21,922
It's my fault you ended up like this.

6
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,091
The first time I changed...

7
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,816
...I got into an accident.

8
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:48,448
It was during my trip
to Europe with Woomi.

9
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:54,288
It was ten years ago.

10
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:56,404
Now...

11
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,071
Now I know...

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,376
Now I remember everything...

13
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:04,250
Oh my god, what happened?

14
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:07,509
He's still breathing. Someone call
an ambulance. He got hit by a car.

15
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:08,690
Call 911.

16
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:19,461
The face of the man
that I saw before I fell...

17
00:01:24,202 --> 00:01:25,214
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:26,325 --> 00:01:27,701
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,937
It was all my fault.

20
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:34,761
It's all because of me.

21
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:55,235
Segye!

22
00:02:58,017 --> 00:02:59,084
Han Segye!

23
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:01,715
Segye.

24
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:03,284
Open the door.

25
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:05,747
Open the door!

26
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:10,997
Han Segye!

27
00:03:13,017 --> 00:03:14,574
Talk to me face-to-face.

28
00:03:14,782 --> 00:03:16,096
Whatever it is...

29
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,074
...say it to me clearly, face-to-face.

30
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:20,751
Stop avoiding me.

31
00:03:23,886 --> 00:03:25,127
Han Segye!

32
00:03:56,263 --> 00:03:57,283
Did you get hurt?

33
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,840
The old lady you saved...

34
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:12,153
...was me.

35
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,136
So...

36
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:17,912
...what does that even mean?

37
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:20,393
Why is that you?

38
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,036
The person you saved...

39
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,402
...by ruining yourself over.

40
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:33,872
The person responsible
for your 10 years of misery....

41
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:37,057
...was me.

42
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:43,735
But I wasn't even aware of that...

43
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:47,449
...and laughed with you
as if everything was okay.

44
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:51,677
I was happy by your side.

45
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,886
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:00,252
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:03,442 --> 00:05:05,415
I promised to make you happy...

48
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:10,427
...but I can't.

49
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:14,586
I don't have the rights.

50
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,233
I...

51
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:21,713
I'm...

52
00:05:24,465 --> 00:05:25,992
I'm okay with everything.

53
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:31,098
Can we...

54
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:34,733
...be okay...

55
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:40,018
...for the rest of our lives?

56
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:45,295
Can we really put it behind us...

57
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:48,251
...and forget about it?

58
00:05:50,578 --> 00:05:52,285
Can we really move on?

59
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:58,065
Do you think...

60
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,941
...you can do that?

61
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:08,835
Even if you can...

62
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,721
...I can't.

63
00:06:14,137 --> 00:06:16,309
I don't have the guts to do that.

64
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:18,573
Then what?

65
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:20,543
What do you want to do?

66
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,602
Dojae...

67
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:29,364
-We should...
-Hold on.

68
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:32,616
Hold on.

69
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,029
Just hold on a second.

70
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,698
I'll come back.

71
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:45,338
I'll come again later.

72
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:48,218
Let's talk again then.

73
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:15,675
Don't cry too much.

74
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:19,784
Don't be...

75
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,109
...so heartbroken.

76
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,433
There is way to cure him.

77
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,344
Really?

78
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:44,139
That's great. I'm so happy.

79
00:09:45,214 --> 00:09:49,577
There's a doctor who's been achieving
successful results in this field.

80
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:53,026
He's interested in your case.

81
00:09:53,257 --> 00:09:54,595
Let me meet with him.

82
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:56,296
Where is he now?

83
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:58,850
Wherever he is, I will go.

84
00:09:58,934 --> 00:09:59,994
However...

85
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:02,066
...the chances are slim.

86
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:04,904
It's about...

87
00:10:05,132 --> 00:10:06,441
...five percent.

88
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:10,359
Five percent?

89
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,232
I can't guarantee that you'll be
completely cured.

90
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:14,155
It could...

91
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,302
...actually get worse.

92
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:18,241
Worse how?

93
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,794
You could...

94
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:24,242
...die after or during the procedure.

95
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:28,795
Do you still want to go for it?

96
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,211
No.

97
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:33,099
Absolutely not.

98
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:36,636
Your life comes first.

99
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,818
Unless you cling onto such hope…

100
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:43,076
...there is no other way.

101
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,678
It's a terminal disorder.

102
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,214
If you move on with that in mind...

103
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,342
...it will be easier for you.

104
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,641
(Dr. Oh)

105
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,449
(Dr. Oh)

106
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:38,571
What brings you here in the morning?

107
00:11:41,922 --> 00:11:44,602
Is there a problem at the company?

108
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:46,041
There is no problem.

109
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:47,543
I assume you haven't had lunch.

110
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,287
I wanted us to have lunch together...

111
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,945
...since it's been a while.

112
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:56,269
I didn't know...

113
00:11:56,644 --> 00:12:00,660
...that you would announce your disorder
during the family get-together.

114
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:04,726
I'm sorry...

115
00:12:05,404 --> 00:12:06,953
...for not telling you in advance.

116
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:08,031
No.

117
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,163
I'm the one who's sorry.

118
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:12,396
I thought...

119
00:12:13,261 --> 00:12:16,904
...hiding it was the only way.

120
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,672
I thought hiding it completely...

121
00:12:19,946 --> 00:12:23,040
...was the way to keep
you completely safe.

122
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:27,680
I made that judgement on my own...

123
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,084
...like a fool.

124
00:12:29,168 --> 00:12:30,717
Please don't say that.

125
00:12:31,455 --> 00:12:32,560
You have...

126
00:12:33,575 --> 00:12:35,626
...done your best to keep me safe.

127
00:12:40,497 --> 00:12:42,662
How are things with you and Segye?

128
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,305
Ten years ago...

129
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:51,819
If I hadn't had that accident
ten years ago...

130
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:55,044
...how would I have turned out?

131
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:00,030
Dojae...

132
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,114
But...

133
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,285
I don't regret...

134
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:08,111
...saving that person.

135
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:14,350
I regret it.

136
00:13:16,436 --> 00:13:22,069
I raised you to be someone who helps
those in need and lead by example.

137
00:13:23,816 --> 00:13:26,917
I keep regretting that.

138
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:40,253
Joohwan.

139
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,263
Yes.

140
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,539
Do you want something?

141
00:13:44,276 --> 00:13:46,032
Do you remember...

142
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:48,123
...the first time you met me?

143
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:51,298
Why are you suddenly...

144
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:52,764
...bringing that up?

145
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:55,094
I was wondering if my memory is correct.

146
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:03,222
Should I give you
the exaggerated version, or...

147
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,239
...the simplified version?

148
00:14:05,813 --> 00:14:07,684
Just tell it like it was.

149
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,047
You were unbelievable.

150
00:14:11,638 --> 00:14:13,857
Back then, you were young...

151
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,388
...sick...

152
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:17,528
...and sad.

153
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,108
You were oversensitive...

154
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:25,264
...that you'd get angry and shout
when your exercise didn't go so well.

155
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:28,620
At times, you tried not to see...

156
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:31,410
...or tell apart anything.

157
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:33,511
Yes.

158
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,202
I used to be like that.

159
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:39,385
When you recognized me
for the first time...

160
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:41,514
...it was quite touching.

161
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:44,817
I had a feeling that you will survive.

162
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,253
I thought you won't die at least.

163
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:50,323
Were things...

164
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:53,972
...that bad for me back then?

165
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:58,092
If there was a bet on who had
the hardest time, you wouldn't lose.

166
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:00,495
I find it remarkable...

167
00:15:01,056 --> 00:15:02,842
...that you lived like that
for ten years.

168
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:05,874
Ten years...

169
00:15:07,943 --> 00:15:08,975
Yeah.

170
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:11,224
It's been ten years.

171
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,024
You've done well.

172
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:15,348
Don't you think it's nice to be alive?

173
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,219
You even found love.

174
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:22,147
That one's name...

175
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:23,681
...is Han Segye, right?

176
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:26,981
That's how love is.

177
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:29,629
In a world where everything's the same...

178
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,131
...only the one you love stands out.

179
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:52,857
You're watching that again?

180
00:15:53,947 --> 00:15:55,027
Gosh.

181
00:15:57,777 --> 00:15:59,269
Did you watch all of these?

182
00:16:00,023 --> 00:16:00,960
Yeah.

183
00:16:01,513 --> 00:16:03,734
Do you love yourself that much?

184
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:08,144
Does it make you happy
when you see yourself on TV?

185
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:11,571
I'm so sick of it.

186
00:16:11,656 --> 00:16:13,600
I'm watching it for the last time.

187
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:15,338
Yeah right.

188
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:17,956
I've heard you say that for years.

189
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,080
How could you watch your debut film
over and over again for ten years?

190
00:16:21,944 --> 00:16:23,249
Will the company...

191
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,949
...struggle if I'm gone?

192
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:26,867
Why?

193
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:31,991
Are you planning to get married?

194
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,670
No. I'm not getting married.

195
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,470
I just asked out of curiosity.

196
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,172
Good to know that.

197
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:46,629
Why?

198
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:48,511
Is it hard?

199
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:50,039
Do you need a break?

200
00:16:50,514 --> 00:16:52,714
Don't worry about it.

201
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,574
I can manage things
even if you take a break.

202
00:16:55,874 --> 00:16:57,666
If you want a break, just say the word.

203
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:02,036
Do we have any commercials left?

204
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:02,954
What?

205
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:05,368
-We do. Why?
-Let's do them all.

206
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:06,948
Out of the blue?

207
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,066
What's gotten into you?

208
00:17:09,156 --> 00:17:10,971
Do we have anything else?

209
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,761
Let's do those too.

210
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:15,203
Whatever comes, I'll do them all.

211
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:17,970
Are you really going to get married?

212
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:20,306
You're so greedy for money.

213
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,461
Then...

214
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:26,120
...let's deal with your
boyfriend's company first.

215
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:32,352
I won't hold back even if it's
your boyfriend's company.

216
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:35,458
I'll shut them out
after fulfilling the contract...

217
00:17:35,606 --> 00:17:38,338
...and if they ask for renewal,
I'll ask for more payment.

218
00:17:39,718 --> 00:17:41,318
Why? You don't want that?

219
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,533
No. I'm in.

220
00:17:47,427 --> 00:17:49,577
I should do a better job
for that company in particular.

221
00:17:49,662 --> 00:17:53,327
I know you will.
It's your boyfriend's company.

222
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,987
(Up-do hairstyle.
Almost didn't recognize.)

223
00:17:58,072 --> 00:18:00,012
(Nothing made sense from the start.)

224
00:18:04,879 --> 00:18:06,839
Understanding the situation is one thing.

225
00:18:07,661 --> 00:18:09,609
Understanding the person...

226
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:12,224
...is another matter.

227
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:22,055
(Understanding the person is one thing.)

228
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:28,474
(Understanding the situation is
a different matter.)

229
00:18:29,865 --> 00:18:31,056
We have an emergency.

230
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:33,262
Director Kim has gathered
the board of directors.

231
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:37,788
He's not the type to stay quiet.

232
00:18:38,216 --> 00:18:39,529
What should we do?

233
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,703
Let's go.

234
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:45,114
I was looking for someone
to take my anger out on anyway.

235
00:18:57,939 --> 00:19:00,518
I've always suspected
that something was wrong.

236
00:19:00,602 --> 00:19:01,796
This is serious...

237
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:05,346
How can he not recognize people's faces?

238
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:07,516
I've never heard of such disorder.

239
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,686
Now, now.

240
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:16,447
I heard that face blindness...

241
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,215
...is a serious disorder.

242
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:20,834
We can't let someone like that...

243
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:23,645
...take on such big responsibility
in our company.

244
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:26,409
This is about being considerate.

245
00:19:27,755 --> 00:19:30,387
Imagine how hard it must have been
for Chief Seo.

246
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:33,252
A sick man...

247
00:19:34,402 --> 00:19:36,134
...should take a break.

248
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:40,066
You said it.

249
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:42,639
You are absolutely right.

250
00:19:58,523 --> 00:20:01,065
What funny story were you
all talking about?

251
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:07,584
Goodness. Director Seo is here.

252
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:09,055
We didn't gather here...

253
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,724
...to talk about something fun.

254
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:15,997
We were talking about a very sad story.

255
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,946
Since you're not fit for work...

256
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:23,874
...how can we serve you better?

257
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,934
What can we do to help you?

258
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:31,425
I was asking for some advices.

259
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:41,219
Chief Seo.

260
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,671
It's me, Director Kim.

261
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:47,196
I'm over here.

262
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:50,049
You can recognize me, right?

263
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,820
I'm sick of you getting on
my nerves all the time.

264
00:21:03,423 --> 00:21:04,619
Were you...

265
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:06,443
...talking to me just now?

266
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:07,539
Mr. Kim...

267
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:10,249
...don't show up for work from now on.

268
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:11,167
What...?

269
00:21:14,585 --> 00:21:15,808
It's so unfortunate.

270
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:19,529
You just have to show off
whenever I'm in a bad mood.

271
00:21:24,593 --> 00:21:26,130
My dear Chief Seo...

272
00:21:26,604 --> 00:21:28,943
...you don't seem to know
how the company works.

273
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:33,206
You can't just sack a director like that.

274
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:36,974
There's a procedure to follow
when it comes to firing a director.

275
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:40,699
I'm going to skip the procedure
and fire you right away.

276
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,069
I can make up a reason.

277
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:46,357
Bribery or secret deals...

278
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,707
...I'll find something and make it stick.

279
00:21:48,984 --> 00:21:50,543
So forget about the procedure...

280
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,909
...and get the hell out of my sight.

281
00:21:54,886 --> 00:21:55,901
Chief Seo!

282
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:59,084
If you're ambitious,
you should've chosen the right side.

283
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:01,618
I've warned you several times.

284
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:03,654
Why do you keep messing with me?

285
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,445
What? Mess with...?

286
00:22:07,985 --> 00:22:10,861
Do you think the chairman
will let that happen?

287
00:22:10,945 --> 00:22:11,778
Yes.

288
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:14,179
I think he'll let it happen.

289
00:22:22,392 --> 00:22:23,328
Mr. Chairman...

290
00:22:23,731 --> 00:22:24,564
Mr. Chairman!

291
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,132
Mr. Chairman.

292
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:28,444
Mr. Chairman.

293
00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:31,735
Look at this.

294
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:35,376
The company's completely
falling apart, sir.

295
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,147
Who might you be?

296
00:22:39,963 --> 00:22:44,565
I don't want to be addressed
as "Chairman" by someone...

297
00:22:44,895 --> 00:22:47,399
...who doesn't work for my company.

298
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:49,647
Mr. Chairman...

299
00:22:49,892 --> 00:22:51,542
I want to drink coffee.

300
00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:54,273
Just settle this and come in.

301
00:22:55,153 --> 00:22:56,513
Sir...

302
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:57,820
Mr. Chairman!

303
00:22:59,079 --> 00:22:59,936
Mr. Chairman!

304
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:12,475
Wait, Director Park.

305
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:14,410
Director Choi!

306
00:23:17,492 --> 00:23:19,057
Baek, Seo!

307
00:23:19,236 --> 00:23:21,043
What's wrong with you?

308
00:23:21,996 --> 00:23:23,463
Who are you?

309
00:23:24,155 --> 00:23:25,254
Hey, let's go.

310
00:23:25,713 --> 00:23:26,546
Hey.

311
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:28,322
You punks!

312
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,405
Hey, Director Choi...

313
00:23:32,012 --> 00:23:32,975
Director Park!

314
00:23:33,952 --> 00:23:34,785
Director Park!

315
00:24:00,755 --> 00:24:02,690
You came at the perfect time.

316
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:04,751
What made you come here?

317
00:24:08,497 --> 00:24:14,151
Do you think I've set the company
aside and been fooling around?

318
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,956
I have put least...

319
00:24:17,274 --> 00:24:18,991
...100 pairs of eyes here.

320
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:21,045
So you're here to keep tabs on things.

321
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:26,321
How did you know it was me?

322
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:29,601
I didn't even say it was me.

323
00:24:29,686 --> 00:24:32,725
I can recognize my own grandfather
even from far away.

324
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:37,534
There aren't that many fashionable
old gentlemen in this country.

325
00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:42,596
Is that actress...

326
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,683
...doing well?

327
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,071
I don't know.

328
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:53,652
Goodness. No wonder you were dumped.

329
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:54,739
Tell me about it.

330
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:59,431
Since I'm done with my coffee,
I'll get going now.

331
00:25:00,097 --> 00:25:04,753
You're not calling me "chucklehead" today.

332
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:11,199
Hey.

333
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:15,235
You're not a chucklehead at all.

334
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:20,190
No, wait.

335
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,337
Maybe you are a bit of a chucklehead.

336
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,383
Nepotism isn't so bad after all.
I guess I've chosen the right side.

337
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,415
Director Kim doesn't know
how to choose sides.

338
00:25:49,788 --> 00:25:51,835
He's hopeless.

339
00:25:54,906 --> 00:25:56,294
He didn't finish his coffee.

340
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:59,258
I made it with my heart and soul.

341
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,795
It's almost inedible.

342
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:10,035
Your girlfriend has as shoot today.
Aren't you going?

343
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,673
Look the other way too.

344
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:16,542
Okay, good.

345
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,912
Segye, try smiling a little more.

346
00:26:21,028 --> 00:26:21,861
Okay.

347
00:26:23,752 --> 00:26:25,684
Look this way, please.

348
00:26:28,494 --> 00:26:32,073
One more time. Okay!

349
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:34,726
We'll continue later.

350
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,209
Here.

351
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:39,722
Chae Yoori is not coming?

352
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:44,447
How can the lead actress miss
the premiere?

353
00:26:46,244 --> 00:26:52,522
I guess the rumors about her going
mental was true. That's so sad.

354
00:26:53,665 --> 00:26:56,981
Sure, we'll be on time. Okay.

355
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,037
Mr. Seo Dojae.

356
00:27:16,356 --> 00:27:17,892
It's me, CEO Yoo.

357
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:19,367
Hello.

358
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,108
Are you here to see Segye?

359
00:27:21,983 --> 00:27:23,567
You two are so silly.

360
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:25,351
-Should I go get her?
-No.

361
00:27:25,837 --> 00:27:26,778
I'm just...

362
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,649
...here to watch.

363
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:34,319
I see.

364
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:37,972
Has she been...

365
00:27:39,497 --> 00:27:41,272
...making that face all day?

366
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:48,142
She certainly doesn't look happy.

367
00:27:48,227 --> 00:27:49,868
Is the shoot too hard?

368
00:28:06,711 --> 00:28:08,906
You don't use your phone these days.

369
00:28:11,894 --> 00:28:13,757
You're not meeting Seo Dojae today?

370
00:28:15,503 --> 00:28:16,379
No.

371
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:20,103
Right. He doesn't mix
business with pleasure.

372
00:28:20,652 --> 00:28:22,204
Was it because you were working?

373
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:24,670
He came by, but didn't even say hi to you.

374
00:28:28,647 --> 00:28:29,952
What are you talking about?

375
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:33,399
Seo Dojae didn't call you?

376
00:28:34,068 --> 00:28:36,915
He came by the set earlier
and watched you work.

377
00:28:39,855 --> 00:28:41,455
Woomi, just drop me off here.

378
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,373
What?

379
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:43,408
Here.

380
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:44,482
Okay.

381
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,173
What am I doing here?

382
00:30:10,245 --> 00:30:11,610
Why?

383
00:30:31,904 --> 00:30:32,998
Does God...

384
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,884
...exist?

385
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,705
He exists to those who have faith.

386
00:30:38,982 --> 00:30:40,269
If God does exist...

387
00:30:42,055 --> 00:30:45,010
...am I allowed to hate Him?

388
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:53,066
I shouldn't have said
something like that...

389
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:56,534
...in front of someone who loves God.

390
00:30:58,551 --> 00:31:01,760
You have a good reason to hate the Lord.

391
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:10,012
When I look at Segye...

392
00:31:10,716 --> 00:31:12,237
...I couldn't help but hate Him a bit.

393
00:31:13,431 --> 00:31:15,619
"Why must He do this to her?"

394
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,213
That's what I thought.

395
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,779
But...

396
00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:23,348
When I look at you...

397
00:31:23,836 --> 00:31:25,250
...I feel the same way.

398
00:31:27,814 --> 00:31:29,988
"Why must He do this to him?"

399
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:32,707
I...

400
00:31:34,945 --> 00:31:37,729
...can't even recognize my own
reflection in the mirror.

401
00:31:39,755 --> 00:31:40,973
Han Segye is...

402
00:31:42,227 --> 00:31:43,569
...like my mirror.

403
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:49,040
"Why me? Why me of all people?"

404
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:52,043
"Why did I get this disorder?"

405
00:31:53,236 --> 00:31:55,135
"What have I done so wrong?"

406
00:31:57,581 --> 00:31:59,535
Everything that Han Segye says...

407
00:32:01,246 --> 00:32:02,425
I've said it before...

408
00:32:04,346 --> 00:32:05,930
...and I say it now.

409
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:09,528
Maybe that's also...

410
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:11,528
...part of His plan for you.

411
00:32:15,544 --> 00:32:16,840
I resent Him...

412
00:32:18,555 --> 00:32:20,349
...if that is His plan.

413
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:31,551
Feel free to resent Him.

414
00:32:33,606 --> 00:32:36,054
I'll pray for repentance on your behalf.

415
00:32:36,602 --> 00:32:37,553
I owe it to you...

416
00:32:38,495 --> 00:32:40,867
...for buying me a drink, bro.

417
00:32:42,745 --> 00:32:43,873
You shouldn't call me "bro."

418
00:32:44,557 --> 00:32:45,462
Call me "big bro."

419
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,648
Big bro.

420
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:11,691
Don't cry.

421
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:15,515
Don't you dare cry.

422
00:33:18,517 --> 00:33:20,432
You don't deserve to cry.

423
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:26,150
You ruined him.

424
00:33:28,562 --> 00:33:30,424
How dare you cry?

425
00:33:34,714 --> 00:33:35,707
Don't ever cry again...

426
00:33:41,556 --> 00:33:42,821
...for the rest of your life.

427
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:54,151
I drank with Seo Dojae last night.

428
00:33:55,361 --> 00:33:56,194
What?

429
00:33:56,944 --> 00:34:00,090
He suddenly asked me to have a drink
saying that he has no friends.

430
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,523
Why?

431
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,050
He didn't tell you?

432
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:06,545
I don't want you to meet up with him.

433
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,355
Right. He's different when he's drunk.

434
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,827
He wouldn't let go of me.

435
00:34:12,265 --> 00:34:13,098
No.

436
00:34:13,831 --> 00:34:15,196
Not just for drinks.

437
00:34:16,711 --> 00:34:18,460
Don't meet him again, period.

438
00:34:22,499 --> 00:34:23,375
Hey.

439
00:34:24,055 --> 00:34:25,602
I thought something was up.

440
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:27,528
Did you break up with Seo Dojae?

441
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:29,871
They couldn't have.

442
00:34:30,005 --> 00:34:31,712
He's so into her.

443
00:34:31,926 --> 00:34:35,322
He seems to loves her
so much that it's hurting him.

444
00:34:40,452 --> 00:34:41,413
Hey.

445
00:34:41,632 --> 00:34:42,747
I'll get going now.

446
00:34:43,163 --> 00:34:45,031
Where are you going?

447
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,391
Are you going to your part time job?

448
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:48,687
Do you need money that much?

449
00:34:49,497 --> 00:34:51,109
If you need money, I'll give it to you.

450
00:34:52,045 --> 00:34:53,062
Really?

451
00:34:53,682 --> 00:34:55,805
Can you transfer about
100 million won to my account?

452
00:34:56,646 --> 00:34:57,586
Okay.

453
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:02,360
What's up with you?

454
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:05,557
-You don't have to.
-No. I want you to have it.

455
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:07,339
If you really need it, just tell me.

456
00:35:08,335 --> 00:35:10,542
You're being really weird.

457
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,499
Is that day around the corner?

458
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:15,173
You get mood swings
when it's almost that day.

459
00:35:15,258 --> 00:35:17,148
No, it's still a long time away.

460
00:35:17,786 --> 00:35:18,730
Anyway...

461
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:20,295
...something's strange about her.

462
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:22,030
Keep an eye on her.

463
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:24,616
-Bye.
-Pay first.

464
00:35:25,276 --> 00:35:26,778
Gosh...

465
00:35:29,198 --> 00:35:30,733
What's my next schedule?

466
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:32,119
Hey.

467
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,846
Aren't you working too much?

468
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:37,794
What's going on? Did you really break up?

469
00:35:38,225 --> 00:35:40,609
Are you trying to get over
the pain by working?

470
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:50,865
It seems like you don't want to talk,
so I'll let it slide.

471
00:35:51,461 --> 00:35:54,204
You have one schedule left.
The movie premiere.

472
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:56,041
Chae Yoori won't be coming.

473
00:35:56,126 --> 00:35:59,357
They're begging you to come
because they'll be screwed if you don't.

474
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,094
I guess she must be scared to death.

475
00:36:04,722 --> 00:36:06,722
So, I'm free for now?

476
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:08,402
Why? Are you going somewhere?

477
00:36:08,503 --> 00:36:10,806
Yeah. To my mom.

478
00:36:11,975 --> 00:36:13,080
Do you want to go together?

479
00:36:13,495 --> 00:36:14,533
It's okay.

480
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:17,042
I want to talk to her alone.

481
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,019
Okay. Go.

482
00:36:19,356 --> 00:36:21,026
Call me if you're having a hard time.

483
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:23,999
I'm your standby crew.
You know what I mean?

484
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,267
(Medicine)

485
00:36:42,352 --> 00:36:43,626
You're here.

486
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:47,169
Sorry for asking you to come
just for this.

487
00:36:47,254 --> 00:36:48,303
Let's go to the hospital.

488
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:53,424
I don't need to go to the hospital
over something like this.

489
00:36:54,203 --> 00:36:55,290
It's fine.

490
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,836
Let's go to the hospital. Together.

491
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:02,741
If I go to the hospital,
the company will be in trouble.

492
00:37:04,676 --> 00:37:06,332
More specifically...

493
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:08,093
...the company's stock price.

494
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,831
You're rich, so why don't you call...

495
00:37:13,126 --> 00:37:14,427
.. a family doctor or something?

496
00:37:16,449 --> 00:37:18,334
You watched way too much TV.

497
00:37:18,807 --> 00:37:22,378
It's not like I need surgery.
I'll be fine.

498
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:24,335
I just need medicine.

499
00:37:28,436 --> 00:37:29,620
But...

500
00:37:31,692 --> 00:37:34,062
...I had no one else to call.

501
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,545
So I asked you to come.

502
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,095
(Medicine)

503
00:37:49,563 --> 00:37:50,625
Thank you.

504
00:37:51,178 --> 00:37:52,213
You can leave now.

505
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,190
Did you eat?

506
00:38:01,778 --> 00:38:04,289
The pharmacist said
to take it after meals.

507
00:38:04,969 --> 00:38:05,802
The medicine...

508
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:15,338
Seriously, I'm not sure
if you're good at your job...

509
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:18,830
...or completely lack flexibility.

510
00:38:55,597 --> 00:38:58,536
Someone watching me while I eat...

511
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:01,495
Are you uncomfortable?

512
00:39:04,495 --> 00:39:05,427
No.

513
00:39:08,151 --> 00:39:09,686
I feel less lonely.

514
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:18,223
I'm good at doing things alone...

515
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:23,561
...but when I'm sick,
I feel a bit miserable.

516
00:39:33,564 --> 00:39:34,483
I've just...

517
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,193
...had this thought.

518
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:41,746
"This woman"...

519
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,655
..."can't do without me."

520
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,057
"The one I need to save"...

521
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,361
..."is this woman."

522
00:40:13,647 --> 00:40:16,214
You look beautiful when you smile.

523
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,743
Mom...

524
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,065
Since you're here, does it mean
you're in Seoul?

525
00:40:30,613 --> 00:40:31,596
I...

526
00:40:33,496 --> 00:40:36,213
...came here because I can't
come back for a while.

527
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:41,989
You said I can do it...

528
00:40:46,037 --> 00:40:47,660
...but I wasn't able to.

529
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,355
I'm sorry, Mom.

530
00:40:59,113 --> 00:41:00,217
I'm sorry.

531
00:41:09,356 --> 00:41:12,678
I was a little surprised
when you asked to see me.

532
00:41:13,485 --> 00:41:14,806
What is this about?

533
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:16,784
Yes.

534
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:18,828
Well...

535
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:21,668
I got something for you. Please, hold on.

536
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:33,660
Isn't it interesting?

537
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:37,058
Whenever I go shopping these days,
I think about you.

538
00:41:37,148 --> 00:41:39,900
I think, "this will look good on her,"
"she'll look pretty in this."

539
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,000
Ma'am...

540
00:41:43,149 --> 00:41:43,988
I can't...

541
00:41:44,431 --> 00:41:45,387
...accept this.

542
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,756
Don't feel pressured.

543
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,112
You will see that it's
not that expensive.

544
00:41:49,196 --> 00:41:50,075
I mean...

545
00:41:51,611 --> 00:41:53,393
...I really can't take this.

546
00:41:59,797 --> 00:42:01,704
I'm just grateful.

547
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,089
You embraced Dojae's disorder...

548
00:42:05,477 --> 00:42:08,926
...kept his side and love him.

549
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,923
I'm so thankful for that.

550
00:42:19,923 --> 00:42:21,033
Han Segye?

551
00:42:21,782 --> 00:42:23,269
What are you doing?

552
00:42:24,713 --> 00:42:25,546
I'm...

553
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:28,531
...going to break up with Dojae.

554
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,135
That's what I came here to tell you.

555
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,638
Why...?

556
00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:36,179
Is it...

557
00:42:36,768 --> 00:42:39,508
...because of Dojae's disorder?

558
00:42:39,945 --> 00:42:40,778
Yes.

559
00:42:42,572 --> 00:42:43,967
It's because of his disorder.

560
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,596
Because of his disorder...

561
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:48,757
...I can't stay with him.

562
00:42:53,347 --> 00:42:56,494
Please don't leave him. You can't.

563
00:42:57,361 --> 00:42:59,681
He's finally smiling and he's happy.

564
00:43:00,296 --> 00:43:02,270
He embraces himself now.

565
00:43:02,688 --> 00:43:03,881
Please.

566
00:43:07,946 --> 00:43:08,887
I'm...

567
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:13,745
...nothing but his weakness,
just like you've said.

568
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,546
Please take good care of him
so he can pull through.

569
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,300
So he doesn't get hurt...

570
00:43:23,202 --> 00:43:24,859
I'm sorry. For everything...

571
00:43:26,225 --> 00:43:27,492
I'm sorry.

572
00:43:29,068 --> 00:43:30,351
I'm sorry.

573
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,082
Dojae.

574
00:43:49,506 --> 00:43:50,789
I apologize, Mother.

575
00:43:51,341 --> 00:43:52,964
I will explain later.

576
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:55,484
Come with me.

577
00:44:17,106 --> 00:44:18,979
I wanted to apologize...

578
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:20,658
...to Mrs. Im.

579
00:44:24,727 --> 00:44:27,115
Although I can't explain
everything to her...

580
00:44:27,473 --> 00:44:28,678
But...

581
00:44:29,993 --> 00:44:31,564
...I wanted to apologize somehow.

582
00:44:34,178 --> 00:44:36,274
How your life turned out...

583
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,209
And how your mother's life turned out...

584
00:44:41,796 --> 00:44:43,276
I'm responsible for that.

585
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:47,854
It's all my fault.

586
00:44:49,514 --> 00:44:50,759
How could I?

587
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,424
I'm not even worth it.

588
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,930
I ruined a man's life...

589
00:44:58,158 --> 00:45:00,464
I ruined your life...

590
00:45:08,399 --> 00:45:10,031
I'm sorry for not going back...

591
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:13,092
...when I told you I would.

592
00:45:15,566 --> 00:45:17,299
I did go, actually.

593
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:20,710
I went to see you.

594
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,973
I was afraid you would...

595
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,340
...say the things
that I've been avoiding.

596
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:30,720
So I couldn't go closer to you.

597
00:45:32,653 --> 00:45:34,165
I couldn't...

598
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:36,748
...say hi to you.

599
00:45:39,542 --> 00:45:40,938
If I could...

600
00:45:42,758 --> 00:45:44,996
...I would make everything right.

601
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,913
But I can't return to the past...

602
00:45:50,454 --> 00:45:52,544
...or undo the things
that already happened.

603
00:45:53,991 --> 00:45:56,517
I can't make you forget everything...

604
00:45:57,453 --> 00:45:59,494
...and I can't make myself
forget everything.

605
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,777
There's...

606
00:46:06,137 --> 00:46:07,398
...nothing I can do.

607
00:46:10,587 --> 00:46:12,503
There is something you can do.

608
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:26,788
Just...

609
00:46:28,648 --> 00:46:29,481
...forget about me.

610
00:46:31,524 --> 00:46:32,513
Forget...

611
00:46:34,646 --> 00:46:35,524
...us.

612
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,458
Even if I stay by your side...

613
00:46:40,903 --> 00:46:42,961
...you won't be completely happy.

614
00:46:44,917 --> 00:46:48,607
You won't be able to look away
when I'm suffering from guilt.

615
00:46:49,036 --> 00:46:51,044
Then we will suffer together.

616
00:46:52,765 --> 00:46:53,598
If we...

617
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:56,847
...stay together...

618
00:46:58,463 --> 00:47:00,082
...we cannot be happy.

619
00:47:01,682 --> 00:47:02,670
The past...

620
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:06,066
...the present and the future,
I've ruined them all.

621
00:47:07,475 --> 00:47:08,940
So I'm asking you...

622
00:47:11,256 --> 00:47:13,154
I know it's shameless of me, but please...

623
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,734
We should...

624
00:47:18,904 --> 00:47:19,995
...break up.

625
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,981
Forget...

626
00:47:24,878 --> 00:47:25,758
...about me.

627
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,784
I can't remember...

628
00:47:58,421 --> 00:48:00,010
...the smile on your face...

629
00:48:01,889 --> 00:48:03,139
...when you looked at me.

630
00:48:08,145 --> 00:48:09,661
I want to picture it in my head...

631
00:48:14,882 --> 00:48:16,213
...but I can't remember.

632
00:48:31,814 --> 00:48:35,807
We have the stars of "Beauty Man,"
Go Younger and Jung Hyewon.

633
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:40,136
Please look over here.

634
00:48:42,405 --> 00:48:43,774
Thank you...

635
00:48:44,513 --> 00:48:49,534
Next, Kim Joonhyuk and Han Hyeyeon
are here together. Over here, please.

636
00:48:52,723 --> 00:48:54,185
Yes, thank you.

637
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:57,307
Please welcome Kim Dohyun. Hello.

638
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:59,034
Please look over here.

639
00:48:59,724 --> 00:49:01,661
-So handsome.
-Over here, please.

640
00:49:07,768 --> 00:49:09,228
Yes, thank you.

641
00:49:09,566 --> 00:49:12,913
Chae Yoori couldn't make it
due to a personal matter.

642
00:49:12,998 --> 00:49:14,379
We hope you understand.

643
00:49:15,238 --> 00:49:17,572
And right now,
Han Segye is making her entrance.

644
00:49:28,253 --> 00:49:30,590
-Segye!
-Segye, look over here.

645
00:49:31,341 --> 00:49:32,712
You're so beautiful!

646
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:37,269
Can you try another pose? Thank you!

647
00:49:38,615 --> 00:49:40,059
Segye, over here!

648
00:50:14,082 --> 00:50:15,546
I'm looking forward to your movie.

649
00:51:00,277 --> 00:51:01,110
Your hand...

650
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,163
It looks like...

651
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,219
...your hand hasn't healed yet.

652
00:51:36,295 --> 00:51:37,227
Han Segye.

653
00:51:46,087 --> 00:51:48,593
I would've saved that person
even if it wasn't you.

654
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:51,053
It just happened...

655
00:51:51,884 --> 00:51:53,316
...to be you.

656
00:51:54,898 --> 00:51:56,297
Saving you...

657
00:51:58,293 --> 00:52:00,453
...is the best thing I've ever done.

658
00:52:03,009 --> 00:52:05,820
You said you get what you want
after you're done resenting.

659
00:52:07,186 --> 00:52:08,909
That's what you mean to me.

660
00:52:08,994 --> 00:52:11,362
But I'm the one you should resent.

661
00:52:11,697 --> 00:52:12,928
I'm fine.

662
00:52:13,447 --> 00:52:15,144
-It's all...
-Don't be fine.

663
00:52:16,571 --> 00:52:19,434
Don't smile at me. Don't worry about me!

664
00:52:20,385 --> 00:52:22,193
Why are you so nice?

665
00:52:22,522 --> 00:52:24,121
-Why are you...
-I know.

666
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:26,517
If we're together...

667
00:52:28,244 --> 00:52:30,596
...we'll be happy sometimes
and suffer often.

668
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,454
I will work everything out.

669
00:52:34,478 --> 00:52:36,176
I will make it work.

670
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:37,889
I promise.

671
00:52:38,988 --> 00:52:40,446
Fate brought us together.

672
00:52:42,334 --> 00:52:43,827
A terrible fate.

673
00:52:46,117 --> 00:52:47,522
I resent that, too.

674
00:52:49,455 --> 00:52:51,268
I resent it so much.

675
00:52:54,472 --> 00:52:55,872
If you really want to break up...

676
00:52:57,915 --> 00:52:59,510
...look at me straight...

677
00:53:01,409 --> 00:53:02,718
...and tell me...

678
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:05,634
...you don't like me.

679
00:53:09,468 --> 00:53:10,316
You see?

680
00:53:11,976 --> 00:53:13,022
You...

681
00:53:14,866 --> 00:53:16,441
You do love me.

682
00:53:33,365 --> 00:53:34,334
No.

683
00:53:39,472 --> 00:53:40,577
I don't...

684
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:43,832
I don't like you.

685
00:53:47,784 --> 00:53:49,326
I didn't like you from the beginning.

686
00:53:50,807 --> 00:53:52,714
From the first time we met...

687
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:54,918
...and the second time we met.

688
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:57,484
It's always...

689
00:53:58,642 --> 00:53:59,481
...been like that.

690
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:01,603
To me...

691
00:54:03,688 --> 00:54:05,527
...it all sounds like a love confession.

692
00:54:35,636 --> 00:54:36,563
I'm...

693
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,922
...going to retire.

694
00:54:41,597 --> 00:54:42,430
What?

695
00:54:51,734 --> 00:54:52,923
All of a sudden?

696
00:54:53,272 --> 00:54:55,881
Is that why you asked to advance
all your schedules?

697
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:57,127
So you can retire?

698
00:54:59,675 --> 00:55:02,559
Why? What's wrong?

699
00:55:02,643 --> 00:55:03,926
I'm what's wrong.

700
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:06,537
Woomi...

701
00:55:07,913 --> 00:55:10,143
Remember when I changed
for the first time?

702
00:55:14,165 --> 00:55:15,279
That time...

703
00:55:17,571 --> 00:55:19,411
...I got into an accident.

704
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:21,940
I've told you, right?

705
00:55:25,451 --> 00:55:26,564
That man...

706
00:55:29,307 --> 00:55:31,621
The man who nearly died because of me...

707
00:55:36,738 --> 00:55:38,091
...was Seo Dojae.

708
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:41,254
What?

709
00:55:43,334 --> 00:55:44,486
He...

710
00:55:46,899 --> 00:55:49,227
...ended up that way
trying to save me.

711
00:55:50,993 --> 00:55:52,477
Because he got into an accident...

712
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:55,116
...while trying to save me...

713
00:55:57,179 --> 00:55:58,580
...he spent 10 years...

714
00:56:00,635 --> 00:56:01,930
...he spent all his life...

715
00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:05,607
...living like that.

716
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:17,221
Han Segye.

717
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:20,310
Get it together.

718
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:23,495
That wasn't your fault.

719
00:56:24,034 --> 00:56:25,354
That was an accident.

720
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:28,577
Don't blame it on yourself.

721
00:56:30,076 --> 00:56:31,792
Woomi, that's why...

722
00:56:34,237 --> 00:56:37,105
...I can no longer smile
in front of people.

723
00:56:38,906 --> 00:56:40,506
I hate myself so much.

724
00:56:42,627 --> 00:56:45,035
I'm so repulsed at myself.

725
00:56:45,683 --> 00:56:47,738
Okay, let's do it.

726
00:56:48,576 --> 00:56:51,711
If it makes you happy, then let's do it.

727
00:56:52,222 --> 00:56:53,585
Leaving the entertainment world?

728
00:56:53,826 --> 00:56:55,917
That's not a big deal at all.

729
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,994
You need to live your life.

730
00:56:58,214 --> 00:56:59,898
Your life should come first.

731
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,435
All right. Let's quit everything.

732
00:57:06,024 --> 00:57:07,423
I'll help you with everything.

733
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,794
Mr. Seo Dojae...

734
00:57:45,274 --> 00:57:46,925
Is Han Segye inside?

735
00:57:48,114 --> 00:57:49,633
I have to see her.

736
00:57:53,714 --> 00:57:54,972
I'm sorry.

737
00:57:55,858 --> 00:57:58,175
I can't let you see her.

738
00:57:58,273 --> 00:57:59,368
Ms. Yoo.

739
00:57:59,945 --> 00:58:01,480
I've already heard.

740
00:58:03,621 --> 00:58:05,893
It must be so hard for you too.

741
00:58:06,848 --> 00:58:07,725
I know.

742
00:58:08,893 --> 00:58:09,870
But...

743
00:58:11,009 --> 00:58:12,923
...Segye needs to move on with her life.

744
00:58:14,803 --> 00:58:16,393
It's eating her up from the inside.

745
00:58:18,575 --> 00:58:20,019
I'm so sorry.

746
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:08,512
Good bye.

747
00:59:12,569 --> 00:59:13,702
Farewell.

748
00:59:45,445 --> 00:59:46,701
-Hey.
-What?

749
00:59:46,786 --> 00:59:48,159
Han Segye is going to retire.

750
00:59:48,244 --> 00:59:49,134
Really?

751
00:59:49,224 --> 00:59:50,308
-This is huge.
-My gosh.

752
00:59:50,393 --> 00:59:51,502
Look, Han Segye is retiring.

753
00:59:51,587 --> 00:59:53,632
Han Segye is retiring!

754
00:59:53,937 --> 00:59:55,583
-She's retiring?
-She's retiring.

755
00:59:55,668 --> 00:59:56,735
Seriously? What the...

756
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:58,575
Is she going to marry that rich guy?

757
00:59:58,732 --> 01:00:01,104
-Did she get pregnant?
-Why would she retire?

758
01:00:05,521 --> 01:00:06,626
Big news!

759
01:00:08,868 --> 01:00:11,111
Han Segye...is going to retire.

760
01:00:12,012 --> 01:00:13,627
What happened to her?

761
01:00:13,712 --> 01:00:15,716
Why would she retire
when she's so popular these days?

762
01:00:15,801 --> 01:00:16,850
Is she getting married?

763
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:18,526
All of a sudden? With whom?

764
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:22,289
Jeez. There were rumors
that she's dating Chief Seo again.

765
01:00:22,374 --> 01:00:24,522
But there was no press release about it.

766
01:00:25,403 --> 01:00:28,094
Whatever it is,
I hope it's not a big deal.

767
01:00:28,179 --> 01:00:31,496
I hope so too. I'm so worried.

768
01:00:32,014 --> 01:00:33,649
He's already going through a tough time.

769
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,719
(Dr. Oh)

770
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,302
You could...

771
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,709
...die after or during the procedure.

772
01:00:44,235 --> 01:00:45,842
Do you still want to go for it?

773
01:00:49,534 --> 01:00:52,670
Chief. Have you read about Han Segye?

774
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:58,021
(Han Segye Suddenly Announces Retirement)

775
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,931
(Auntie)

776
01:01:10,412 --> 01:01:11,699
Where are you now?

777
01:01:12,274 --> 01:01:14,191
I'm sorry for not keeping our promise...

778
01:01:15,198 --> 01:01:16,871
...of not running away.

779
01:01:17,317 --> 01:01:18,878
Where are you?

780
01:01:19,113 --> 01:01:19,972
You're not...

781
01:01:20,713 --> 01:01:22,172
...going to find me.

782
01:01:23,642 --> 01:01:25,584
I won't be Han Segye anymore.

783
01:01:26,209 --> 01:01:28,885
I will live as the different faces
that will disappear.

784
01:01:31,186 --> 01:01:32,608
It should be like this.

785
01:01:33,394 --> 01:01:34,910
This is the right thing to do.

786
01:01:35,265 --> 01:01:36,645
I'll go right away.

787
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,186
I'll go to where you are.

788
01:01:41,539 --> 01:01:43,036
Just tell me where.

789
01:01:43,604 --> 01:01:45,292
Do you remember the contract?

790
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:47,498
The last clause.

791
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:51,790
When the business relationship
between the two parties is over…

792
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,798
...this contract will be terminated.

793
01:01:53,883 --> 01:01:59,971
Forget every detail in the contract
as soon as it's terminated.

794
01:02:02,841 --> 01:02:03,754
You have to forget.

795
01:02:05,224 --> 01:02:07,049
That was our deal.

796
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:09,568
How can I forget?

797
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:11,461
How can I?

798
01:02:13,106 --> 01:02:15,465
I have one last thing
to tell you as Han Segye.

799
01:02:19,533 --> 01:02:20,690
I love you...

800
01:02:23,692 --> 01:02:24,834
...very very much.

801
01:02:38,593 --> 01:02:39,484
Chief!

802
01:03:08,969 --> 01:03:09,850
Han Segye...

803
01:03:13,868 --> 01:03:14,927
Han Segye!

804
01:04:30,591 --> 01:04:32,296
I'm going to...

805
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:35,569
...take a photo of my real face
and hang it up before I die.

806
01:04:36,853 --> 01:04:37,841
Over there.
