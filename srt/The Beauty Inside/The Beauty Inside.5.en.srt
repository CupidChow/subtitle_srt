1
00:00:00,075 --> 00:00:01,495
Are you on a date?

2
00:00:02,224 --> 00:00:04,241
Were you on a date just now?

3
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:15,232
Segye, please say something.

4
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:18,742
Do you admit that you're dating?

5
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:21,761
Smile.

6
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,039
Like you're happy.

7
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,014
-What's the relationship between you two?
-Are you dating?

8
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:45,595
You said it's a business relationship.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,649
Making excuses would be absurd
since we got caught in the act.

10
00:00:48,828 --> 00:00:51,824
And it's strange to discuss business
in a movie theater.

11
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:54,022
It's exactly what it looks like.

12
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:56,223
Write your articles as you see it.

13
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,105
"Getting to know each other
with mutual attraction."

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,125
Is that really true?

15
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:04,849
-Can you look over here?
-Segye, please say something.

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,765
When did this all start?

17
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:08,590
Segye, please share a word.

18
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:12,036
-When did it begin?
-What do you like about each other?

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,575
When did you start going out?

20
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:16,129
-Please look over here.
-Segye, please say something.

21
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,840
Tell us when you started dating.

22
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:30,842
I'll reveal more details later
in another interview.

23
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:34,828
We won't allow any interviews
from medias that follow us.

24
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,451
Keep that in mind.

25
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,765
Hold on!

26
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,090
-One moment.
- Segye!

27
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:42,605
Please say something.

28
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,959
Keep shooting them!

29
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:06,093
What do I do...

30
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:08,868
This is crazy.

31
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:14,825
-Are you crying?
-No!

32
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:16,234
Do you think I cry all the time?

33
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,246
I thought you did.

34
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:19,182
Why did you say that back there?

35
00:02:20,289 --> 00:02:22,544
It's you who wanted to watch a movie.

36
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:24,051
You're the one to blame.

37
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:27,380
So listen to me.

38
00:02:27,643 --> 00:02:30,069
You did me wrong. So, do as I say.

39
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:34,755
Denying only works the first time.
It won't work the second time.

40
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:37,022
It will make you look ridiculous.

41
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:39,422
If I look ridiculous, then so will you.

42
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:42,447
I'd hate for that to happen,
so let's try to leave a good impression.

43
00:02:43,012 --> 00:02:47,645
We'll have a beautiful relationship,
and then a beautiful break-up.

44
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,178
You're pretty smart
in the midst of all this.

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,783
Let's just do this.

46
00:02:57,457 --> 00:02:58,660
Couple of the century.

47
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,090
(Reporter Park)

48
00:03:09,174 --> 00:03:11,158
Why is he calling me out of the blue?

49
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:13,036
Hello?

50
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:16,112
I'm just on my way home...

51
00:03:18,995 --> 00:03:20,910
-It's CEO Yoo.
-Han Segye's representative?

52
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:23,673
-Ms. Yoo, is it true that Segye is dating?
-Take her pictures!

53
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:27,816
Please say something, Ms. Yoo.

54
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:36,053
What? Who are you?

55
00:03:41,706 --> 00:03:43,882
Hey! What's going on?

56
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,111
This is crazy!

57
00:03:47,481 --> 00:03:49,503
Why are you all doing this?

58
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:54,622
What's going on?

59
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:56,405
What do you think?

60
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,706
Running away in love.

61
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,568
-Us?
-Are you inane?

62
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:02,146
I mean Segye.

63
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:06,526
Since when did Sunho Group became
a name that everyone can take in vain?

64
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:08,714
Are the secretaries just going
to watch while the press...

65
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,346
...writes whatever stories they want?

66
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,825
Apparently, Secretary Jung Joohwan is
the one feeding the story to the press.

67
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:19,055
So they do have something going on.

68
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:23,408
Do some digging on Han Segye.

69
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:24,965
How much should I find out?

70
00:04:25,049 --> 00:04:29,626
Her family, friends, and boyfriends.
Every single relationship she has.

71
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,119
Find out everything
whether it's trivial or big.

72
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,388
(Chief of Strategic Planning)

73
00:04:37,473 --> 00:04:38,415
You're here.

74
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,333
What are you doing?

75
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,857
I have something important to do.

76
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:44,930
And why do you need to use
my computer to take care of it?

77
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,090
-Hey!
-You have to deal with what you did.

78
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:53,773
Does it have to be dealt this way?

79
00:04:57,532 --> 00:04:58,365
Huh?

80
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,107
Things are just perfect around here.

81
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:04,938
You came earlier than I expected.

82
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,106
Would you like some coffee?

83
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:09,732
Do you think I gave you that job
to make coffee?

84
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:12,012
I told you to get rid of her,
but you let her in the picture.

85
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:15,154
Why are you nagging at him?
I created this mess.

86
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,374
Break up right now.

87
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:19,099
A woman like her is no good
for your business or your life.

88
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:20,303
It'll look ridiculous.

89
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,797
Releasing a breakup article
when we've just started dating.

90
00:05:23,307 --> 00:05:26,086
Do you know how many men she had before?

91
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:30,197
Changing boyfriends is easier for her
than changing lipstick color.

92
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:33,176
The whole world knows that.
Are you the only one who doesn't?

93
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:34,230
That's why.

94
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:37,194
That's why I want to be good to her.

95
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:39,610
You've always wanted me to date.

96
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:42,928
I never told you to date just anybody.

97
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:44,740
Love doesn't pay the bills.

98
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:49,190
You don't want to inherit
the company, do you?

99
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:51,859
I do want to. That's why I'm doing this.

100
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:54,629
I think...

101
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:57,459
...this love will pay the bills.

102
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:01,682
Is he crazy?

103
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:04,919
Crazy in love.

104
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:08,571
I'm going to kill you!

105
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:11,530
Hey! Let me go!

106
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:15,024
You said you were going take
some time off to think about it!

107
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,658
-Hey.
-Didn't I tell you to take some time off?

108
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:20,058
Did I tell you that or not!

109
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:21,339
Calm down.

110
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,207
One moment of patience may
ward off great disaster.

111
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:25,908
I've had 30 moments of patience!

112
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:28,131
-Let go of me!
-Woomi, calm down.

113
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:29,695
Take some deep breathes!

114
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,989
I went to the movies to take a break.

115
00:06:33,073 --> 00:06:35,030
Gosh, seriously!

116
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:37,980
Hide. Do not show yourself.
You'll piss her off even more.

117
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,446
Why did you have to go with a guy?

118
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,278
Why did it have to be Seo Dojae?

119
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:44,869
We're not dating, I swear!

120
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:46,737
It's not my fault.

121
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:49,837
I had no idea that he'd come
to the airport…

122
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:50,806
Airport?

123
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:54,828
You went somewhere behind my back?

124
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,675
-I can explain...
-I don't want to be your manager.

125
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:01,012
Let go.

126
00:07:04,378 --> 00:07:06,693
Is it so difficult to give me
one phone call?

127
00:07:07,398 --> 00:07:09,545
Is it so difficult to stay put?

128
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,631
Why don't you do it alone?

129
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:13,867
I don't want to manage you.

130
00:07:15,997 --> 00:07:17,137
Woomi.

131
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:20,843
Don't you know Woomi?
Give her some space.

132
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:22,162
Following her will make things worse.

133
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:42,008
Hello?

134
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,564
This is Seo Dojae's mother.

You know we need to talk, don't you?

-She's asking to meet.
-Who?

141
00:08:05,728 --> 00:08:07,358
Seo Dojae's mom.

142
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:08,632
Your mother-in-law?

143
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:11,125
She's not my mother-in-law.

I'll ask you one more time just in case.

146
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,686
Do you want to be a member of our family?

147
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,296
Step aside if you're going to
talk nonsense. My arms hurt.

148
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,528
That's right. Your brother's
a bit of a jerk.

149
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:33,446
It's not possible.

150
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,129
They can't be dating.

151
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:39,669
What are they thinking?

(First Celebrity to Marry
Into Sunho Group?)

It's quiet in this cafe.

158
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:48,788
Is it because it's a weekday?

159
00:09:49,777 --> 00:09:51,601
I asked them to clear the whole place.

160
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:54,944
I guess it runs in the family.

161

00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:09,111
It happened occasionally before.

165
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,509
If you want to say something,
please do it now.

166
00:10:11,594 --> 00:10:14,259
I need to go catch someone
who's very important to me.

167
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:17,072
Who?

168
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:18,493
A man?

169
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:22,494
-Excuse me?
-I heard you don't care about nationality.

170
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:23,761
And you have a kid, too.

171
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:27,069
Break up with my son immediately.

172
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:30,043
You'll only be a vulnerability to him.

173
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:36,992
You're smiling?

174
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:41,088
I've been wondering why your son
gets scared so easily.

175
00:10:41,715 --> 00:10:43,218
He takes after you.

176
00:10:44,373 --> 00:10:45,206
What?

177
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:46,951
You're spot on.

178
00:10:47,402 --> 00:10:49,430
I am a vulnerability.

179
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:52,373
Attacking someone's vulnerability
is a low thing to do.

180
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,844
I take it that you won't
break up with him?

181
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:58,297
Not for the time being.

182
00:10:58,382 --> 00:10:59,430
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:04,797
Very well.

184
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,034
You'll be compensated handsomely.

185
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:10,370
I don't need money.

186
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,842
You're getting far too cheeky.

187
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,684
You will accept my money
whether you need it or not.

188
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:22,887
I've already paid you.

189
00:11:23,398 --> 00:11:25,518
So you'd better make my money worth it.

190
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,413
Jackpot.

191
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:50,818
(Im Jungyeon: 100 Million Won)

192
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:53,297
He learned how to make threats
from his mom.

193
00:11:54,283 --> 00:11:55,314
I'm scared.

194
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:57,210
How did she get my account number?

195
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,603
Did you sell my information?

196
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,694
How much can I make
by selling your information?

197
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:09,949
Forget it. It's just 100 million.

198
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:13,066
-Right. Just donate it.
-Enough!

199
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:16,130
Then? Are you going to accept
the money and break up?

200
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:18,171
I don't know.

201
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:21,125
100 million is not the problem here.
What about Woomi?

202
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,235
You guys have been together
for too long anyway.

203
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:25,450
It's about time you guys grew apart.

204
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:26,552
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

205
00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:28,469
Sooner the better, then.

206
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,826
Here. Our friendship is over
if this comes apart.

207
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,144
Is that a new nail polish? Looks good.

208
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:38,559
No one's on my side. They all left!
Only the weirdo's still here.

209
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:40,575
Woomi... Yoo Woomi...

210
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,843
You shouldn't have gone
overseas by yourself.

211
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,452
Break it off right now.

212
00:12:44,537 --> 00:12:45,523
I'm going to work.

213
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:49,061
Let's do that about 100 years later.

214
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:52,140
Are you seriously thinking
about making money right now?

215
00:12:52,828 --> 00:12:55,441
You ingrate.
After everything I've done for you?

216
00:12:55,938 --> 00:12:58,574
Woomi...

217
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:01,588
So noisy. You brought it all on yourself.

218
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:04,005
Just do what you're most good at.

219
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:06,892
-What am I good at?
-Begging for forgiveness.

220
00:13:09,058 --> 00:13:10,049
Am I good at that?

221
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:14,222
How do you do?

222
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:15,948
Not so good.

223
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:18,898
Who said you can feed
stories to the press?

224
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,580
Take them down immediately.

225
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:24,898
Who said she's Seo Dojae's woman?
Segye's way too good for that.

226
00:13:24,982 --> 00:13:27,657
Mr. Seo is way too good to be her man.

227
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,560
He is the heir of Sunho Group.

228
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:30,847
Enough.

229
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,712
Start taking down the photos first.

230
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:37,164
Segye wasn't even wearing makeup.

231
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,319
While he's dressed up in a nice suit.

232
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,664
Even if it's a fake relationship,
this is wrong.

233
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:44,007
I'm so glad to hear you say that.

234
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,949
We've taken enough risk
over a fake relationship.

235
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,569
How much more do you want from us?

236
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:51,540
Don't make me laugh.

237
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,246
Let's get something straight.

238
00:13:53,404 --> 00:13:56,243
You people need Segye for your business.

239
00:13:56,646 --> 00:13:58,986
You got that right.

240
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,886
Did you call me here to fight?

241
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,861
We can step outside
if that's what you want.

242
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:05,025
I'm more of a white-collar guy.

243
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:07,246
I'm not cut out for field works.

244
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:12,066
You have a knack
for getting on people's nerves.

245
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:13,832
I get that a lot.

246
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:17,140
But I didn't invite you
to get on your nerves.

247
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,236
I want to ask for your cooperation.

248
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,113
-Cooperation?

249
00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:27,272
We need theatrics to display
a good relationship and a good breakup.

250
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,550
One moment.

251
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:36,466
Hello?

252
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:39,112
Director Lee?

253
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:47,359
What's all this?

254
00:14:48,947 --> 00:14:49,933
Oh my gosh.

255
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,860
(If you're lucky, by next year...)

256
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,793
What's this?

257
00:15:13,457 --> 00:15:18,142
If you're lucky, you'll be working
with one of them next year.

258
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:26,025
I can work with them now.

259
00:15:26,377 --> 00:15:29,769
Of course. You can do that right now.

260
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,898
But remember...

261
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,975
You're still a perfect friend to me.

262
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:45,894
Will you accept my apology?

263
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:54,378
Kingkang.

264
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:05,231
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:08,166
It was wrong of me.

266
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,773
Please forgive me.

267
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:20,738
What's all this?

268
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,195
What are you two doing?

269
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,263
Why did you take out all these candles?

270
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:26,454
Is there a blackout?

271
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:31,390
If you play with fire, you'll pee the bed.

272
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:34,019
It's an event.

273
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:36,988
Tell your friend you're sorry
and that you love her.

274
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,953
Yeah, just get it over with and then go.

275
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,202
-This is my house.
-Come on. Don't.

276
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:45,584
Who will clean up all this?

277
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:49,037
Don't worry and go in inside.
I'll clean it all up.

278
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:51,495
I'm sorry. Goodnight.

279
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:52,461
Good night.

280
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,318
Let's go inside.

281
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:00,494
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:03,361
It was wrong of me.

283
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,236
Please accept my apology.

284
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:17,463
Hey Kingkang.

285
00:17:18,476 --> 00:17:20,203
You just accepted my apology.

286
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,699
You accepted.

287
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:27,339
I wish I can be you just for one day.

288
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:29,321
To know what's on your mind all the time.

289
00:17:29,409 --> 00:17:31,154
No. It'll be too much for you.

290
00:17:33,075 --> 00:17:35,299
I hate you. I'm sick of it.

291
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:38,357
If there's anything you want
to say, just go ahead.

292
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:39,648
You can cuss at me.

293
00:17:39,737 --> 00:17:42,551
Say anything you want.

294
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:44,147
Good.

295
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:46,198
I do have something to say.

296
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:51,158
I'm ready to hear it.

297
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,459
You...

298
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:56,842
...got an audition call
from Director Lee.

299
00:18:00,093 --> 00:18:00,926
What?

300
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,225
He said you can come if you're
willing to accept even a minor role.

301
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:05,662
Without your manager, all by yourself.

302
00:18:05,746 --> 00:18:08,826
Prepare to leave everything behind
like an aspiring new actress.

303
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,799
I heard you went there
to talk to Director Lee.

304
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:15,744
Why didn't you tell me?
You made me feel awkward.

305
00:18:17,321 --> 00:18:18,693
Start packing.

306
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:21,028
There are no more reporters
in front of your house.

307
00:18:21,678 --> 00:18:25,502
-Woomi!
-Hey. Be careful with Kingkang.

308
00:18:25,586 --> 00:18:27,648
Where should I start? What should I do?

309
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:28,799
-Dating in public?

310
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:30,443
What did you expect?

311
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:32,780
A relationship needs to start
before the breakup.

312
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:35,694
I don't have time for dates.

313
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,004
I need to work.

314
00:18:37,088 --> 00:18:38,502
This is work.

315
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:40,818
To go on a fake date.

316
00:18:41,175 --> 00:18:43,405
I need a break.
I've been overworking myself.

317
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,965
I didn't cause this to happen.

318
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:50,316
You caused this to happen.

319
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:54,355
So? When, where and how?

320
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,503
First, I need to check something.

321
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,585
Have you ever...

322
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:04,013
...went out on a date before?

323
00:19:04,991 --> 00:19:06,886
What do you take me for?

324
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:35,133
Have you been waiting long?

325
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,363
Dojae.

326
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:49,538
Who is this chick?

327
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:52,313
It's not what you think.

328
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:53,230
Semi?

329
00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:55,442
Who's this guy?

330
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:03,836
It's just not a sweet memory, that's all.

331
00:20:06,222 --> 00:20:08,525
We both agreed to stay out of it.

332
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:10,379
You two are not kids.

333
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:13,216
It'll look funny if I followed
you on a date.

334
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:15,212
Dating...

335
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,609
...in public?

336
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:19,351
With him, in public...?

337
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:21,908
No, in public is fine.

338
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,537
But, a date...?

339
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:28,124
Why? You don't want to go?

340
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,132
No...

341
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:36,470
I can totally do this. This is also work.

342
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:37,953
I'm good at work.

343
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:41,243
I'll do it perfectly.

344
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,002
Yeah, right.

345
00:20:43,196 --> 00:20:44,773
"Perfectly"?

346
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:48,029
Have you ever been on a date?

347
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,316
What do you take me for?

348
00:20:59,135 --> 00:21:01,821
How come you disappear
every time we have a date?

349
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:03,473
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:06,076
The thing is...

351
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:08,588
I have a situation.

352
00:21:08,676 --> 00:21:11,551
If this is how you're going to be,
don't date at all.

353
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:14,720
Or date someone who's okay
with you disappearing.

354
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,129
I doubt you can find someone.

355
00:21:26,866 --> 00:21:28,887
But most of the time...

356
00:21:29,503 --> 00:21:32,358
...it ends before the next level.

357
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,664
Just remember this.

358
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:37,168
Dating is nothing.

359
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:40,478
If you start sweating on it,
that's when the problem starts.

360
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,663
How to have a great date.

361
00:21:45,043 --> 00:21:47,310
Do not make your answers short.

362
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:49,691
Solely concentrate on the date.

363
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:52,276
Tell him about yourself.

364
00:21:53,116 --> 00:21:54,378
You just need to...

365
00:21:54,536 --> 00:21:57,029
...treat your date like someone
you're familiar with.

366
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:00,002
How to be a great date.

367
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:03,372
One, make a plan.
Two, don't get nervous.

368
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:07,526
Three, hold hands.
Four, you must have a sense of humor.

369
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,947
Five, listen to what the lady says.

370
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,071
There's nothing to it.

371
00:22:33,496 --> 00:22:34,527
There's nothing to it.

372
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:36,592
-I can hear everything.
-"I can hear everything."

373
00:22:36,676 --> 00:22:38,086
This way, please.

374
00:22:41,723 --> 00:22:43,248
Hey, it's Han Segye.

375
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:52,398
Have a seat.

376
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:53,876
I already have.

377
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:29,924
What?

378
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,285
The situation's getting serious.
I want to take this to the next level.

379
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:36,348
I'm going to act like someone
whom you're familiar with.

380
00:23:42,438 --> 00:23:44,256
Just eat it and smile.

381
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,063
It will end earlier that way.

382
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:51,800
Look over there.

383
00:23:56,331 --> 00:23:57,953
You picked a nice spot
with lots of sunlight.

384
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:00,678
I'm going to look good in photos today.

385
00:24:08,118 --> 00:24:10,668
-Again?
-The last one was probably lame.

386
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:12,911
Smile.

387
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:16,109
A pretty smile while you look at me.

388
00:24:20,578 --> 00:24:22,303
And you should balance your diet.

389
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:26,591
Looks like you've picked up some skills.

390
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:31,427
This is nothing.

391
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:33,631
It's not a big deal.

392
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:01,046
By the way...

393
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:03,869
...do you know your mother's
bank account number?

394
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,842
You've met my mother?

395
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,675
Don't worry. Nothing bad happened.

396
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,422
You're still alive after meeting her?

397
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:11,795
How is this possible?

398
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:15,598
Is that supposed to be a joke?

399
00:25:15,683 --> 00:25:16,516
No.

400
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:17,985
I'm serious.

401
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,699
(Im Jungyeon)

402
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:38,203
(100,000,100 won deposited by Han Segye.)

403
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:41,719
This girl...

404
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,362
Hello.

405
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,554
(200,000,100 won deposited by Im Jungyeon)

406
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:32,441
Just a moment.

407
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,967
(Magnetic Ceramics)

408
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:47,072
This is about my account transfer limit.

409
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:52,065
So what can I do to increase
the transfer limit?

410
00:26:52,852 --> 00:26:54,274
Increase the limit to a billion won.

411
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:57,520
I've maxed the transfer limit...

412
00:26:57,605 --> 00:27:00,910
...and I'm in an embarrassing situation
where I can't send the money back.

413
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:05,478
Visit the bank in person?

414
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,908
Can't you take care of it right now?

415
00:27:09,882 --> 00:27:10,913
I see.

416
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:14,661
Okay.

417
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,531
Do you want it?
Shall I buy you one?

418
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:39,806
No.

419
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:43,912
Your taste is like that of an elderly.
Why do you like this kind of thing?

420
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:45,371
Well...

421
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,639
...it stays the same
even if time passes by.

422
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,203
But it's a replica.

423
00:27:53,676 --> 00:27:55,210
I'll take this one.

424
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:24,809
How unfortunate is Mr. Park?

425
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:27,239
He takes photos of other people dating.

426
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:32,716
People don't swarm around you
like I thought they would.

427
00:28:33,223 --> 00:28:35,238
They're all busy with their own dates.

428
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:38,601
Why would they be interested in
someone else's date on a weekday noon?

429
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:40,535
You're letting your guard down again.

430
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:42,126
Don't you remember what happened?

431
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:48,228
It seems like you've dated
a lot of women.

432
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:51,145
Is this what I think it is?

433
00:28:51,234 --> 00:28:53,810
"No running away from questions."

434
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,131
-Well...
-Let's just say it is.

435
00:28:56,642 --> 00:28:59,539
Why would you think so?
I can't recognize a girlfriend's face.

436
00:29:01,647 --> 00:29:03,243
Now, I'll ask you something.

437
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,011
It's a little overdue.

438
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,396
Do you have a boyfriend?

439
00:29:09,023 --> 00:29:12,046
Why would you think so?
I always disappear without a word.

440
00:29:12,642 --> 00:29:13,475
Why?

441
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,960
Someone said you're seeing someone.

442
00:29:15,224 --> 00:29:18,490
Those are all gossips. Don't believe them.
Were you born yesterday?

443
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:20,326
Then what about you?

444
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:21,847
Why did you ask?

445
00:29:24,227 --> 00:29:25,107
You know...

446
00:29:26,335 --> 00:29:28,300
You seem to be familiar with this place.

447
00:29:29,628 --> 00:29:31,403
This is a popular dating spot.

448
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:35,462
I've been here many times.

449
00:29:36,222 --> 00:29:37,055
With a girl?

450
00:29:37,494 --> 00:29:38,648
By myself.

451
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:42,452
I used to watch people walking by.

452
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:29,621
I practiced as I watched them.

453
00:30:30,215 --> 00:30:31,825
I practiced distinguishing people.

454
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,185
Although it was no use.

455
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:49,518
What are you doing here all the time?

456
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:51,017
Pardon?

457
00:30:53,082 --> 00:30:53,915
Here.

458
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:56,069
Drink this.

459
00:30:57,204 --> 00:30:58,037
Thank you.

460
00:30:58,512 --> 00:30:59,871
Hang in there.

461
00:31:00,432 --> 00:31:01,265
Good luck.

462
00:31:24,276 --> 00:31:25,964
I saw her every day,
but I couldn't recognize her...

463
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:27,395
...when she wore different clothes.

464
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:31,005
I felt hopeless.

465
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:32,973
Poor you.

466
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:34,164
That's right.

467
00:31:35,554 --> 00:31:36,659
I am a poor soul.

468
00:31:37,265 --> 00:31:39,112
Was that too rude of me?

469
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:43,805
It's okay if someone who's poor as me
calls me a poor soul.

470
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,769
Now it's my turn.

471
00:31:48,244 --> 00:31:49,384
That necklace...

472
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,211
Is it an ID badge of some kind?

473
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:56,195
This one?

474
00:31:56,837 --> 00:32:00,590
One day I woke up, and I felt scared.

475
00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:05,042
I wasn't sure if I was myself.

476
00:32:06,814 --> 00:32:08,593
Like the parable,
"Dream of the Butterfly."

477
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,797
"Did I dream that I was a butterfly?"

478
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:14,472
"Or am I now a butterfly
dreaming that I'm a man?"

479
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,109
(Han Segye)

480
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:03,484
You'll feel better when you put
this on your kid.

481
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:06,884
(Han Segye)

482
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:08,033
Is your kid big?

483
00:33:12,344 --> 00:33:14,456
He looks big on some days...

484
00:33:16,091 --> 00:33:18,247
And on some days he looks small.

485
00:33:18,685 --> 00:33:20,842
-You know...
-That's how kids are.

486
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,891
They look like they’ve all grown up.
But sometimes they're still kids.

487
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:40,819
(Han Segye)

488
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:45,556
I was trying not to forget.

489
00:33:47,866 --> 00:33:48,733
Also...

490
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:53,965
...I may not come back to myself.

491
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:01,280
Aren't I more pitiful than you are?

492
00:34:03,235 --> 00:34:04,643
When are we sleeping together?

493
00:34:18,904 --> 00:34:20,625
This house is so...

494
00:34:20,984 --> 00:34:22,510
...big.

495
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:26,392
She's looking for a strong maid.
She has a lot to move around.

496
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:29,676
You're stronger than
the middle aged ladies.

497
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:49,249
Not only the house is big...

498
00:34:49,334 --> 00:34:51,588
...it needs a lot of work, too.

(Kang Sara)

500
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:11,543
-Hello?
-Are those two really dating?

501
00:35:11,962 --> 00:35:12,814
They're not, right?

502
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:14,526
There's something between them.

503
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:16,835
Just answer me.

504
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,925
Are Han Segye and Seo Dojae
hiding something together?

505
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,258
Why are you asking me
that out of the blue?

506
00:35:22,343 --> 00:35:23,345
Well...

507
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:26,531
I thought my brother could
be causing you trouble.

508
00:35:26,616 --> 00:35:29,129
You must be upset because of him.

509
00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:35,212
That's true.

510
00:35:35,354 --> 00:35:38,203
Your brother's not exactly
the pleasant type.

511
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:42,095
But if you have questions,
you should ask Segye yourself.

512
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:44,139
Don't try to seduce me like this.

513
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,083
Seduce you?

514
00:35:49,123 --> 00:35:51,680
You're very freewheeling
for a gentle looking guy.

515
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:53,963
Okay.

516
00:35:54,591 --> 00:35:55,798
If you answer me...

517
00:35:56,163 --> 00:35:58,210
...I'll allow you to meet me once.

518
00:35:58,538 --> 00:36:00,115
You said you're desperate.

519
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,590
The desperation's all gone now.
I'm busy working at the moment.

520
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:04,508
Bye now.

521
00:36:11,005 --> 00:36:14,397
Okay, where should I... begin?

522
00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:20,812
Sure.

523
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:24,549
Why would he be in a good mood
When his girl's seeing another man?

524

(Han Segye and Seo Dojae's Sweet Date)

525

(T'road Stocks Status)

526
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:44,502
This is ridiculous.

527
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,259
-Pardon...
-Eunho's not in today.

528
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:06,391
I've said that like 50 times today.

529
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:30,766
You want one?

530
00:38:35,204 --> 00:38:36,054
No.

531
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,352
It's a new perfume.

532
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:42,899
Please try a sample.

533
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:14,484
Why put an empty bottle in the fridge?

534
00:39:21,502 --> 00:39:23,148
She must be living on bread.

535
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:30,618
You didn't have to give me a ride home.

536
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,586
Reporter Park left a while ago.

537
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:34,917
I didn't give you a ride home
because of that.

538
00:39:36,705 --> 00:39:38,349
I've picked up some skills.

539
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:41,212
Go inside. You had a rough day.

540
00:39:45,127 --> 00:39:46,069
Can I...

541
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:48,422
...ask you a favour?

542
00:39:50,356 --> 00:39:53,892
Can you not say things like that
so easily in public?

543
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,577
"Go inside. You had a rough day"?

544
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:57,879
Not that one.

545
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:03,191
Never mind.

546
00:40:10,462 --> 00:40:11,814
We'll start from tomorrow night.

547
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,426
-What?
-"It." We'll do it tomorrow night.

548
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:20,754
I have an audition early tomorrow.
I'll call you when I'm finished.

549
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,499
Would you like to come in?

550
00:40:41,677 --> 00:40:43,577
I need to let you know something
before we sleep together.

551
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:46,112
First, no clothes that shows
too much skin.

552
00:40:46,197 --> 00:40:47,751
You didn't have to tell me that.

553
00:40:47,835 --> 00:40:50,219
Second, don't get any indecent ideas.

554
00:40:50,303 --> 00:40:52,101
I just have to avoid getting caught.

555
00:40:53,614 --> 00:40:54,528
What?

556
00:40:54,613 --> 00:40:55,661
It was a joke.

557
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:59,085
Smile when you make jokes.

558
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:02,790
No touching whatsoever.

559
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:04,474
My bed's wide.

560
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,851
So it's already been decided
that I'll go over to your place?

561
00:41:08,935 --> 00:41:09,768
Roughly.

562
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:12,286
And...

563
00:41:16,669 --> 00:41:18,720
So you can be ready.

564
00:41:19,963 --> 00:41:22,449
I might change into someone
who wears this...

565
00:41:24,461 --> 00:41:28,462
...or something like this.

566
00:41:28,546 --> 00:41:30,321
Whose decision is that?

567
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:34,253
Age and gender doesn't matter
when it comes to clothes.

568
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:36,058
I would know better.

569
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,663
Just because someone's wearing
men's clothes...

570
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,669
...doesn't mean that person's
actually a man.

571
00:41:41,072 --> 00:41:42,776
And vice versa.

572
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:44,950
Aren't you afraid?

573
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:45,885
No.

574
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,038
To me...

575
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:50,862
...even if you wear
different kinds of clothes...

576
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,167
...you're still Han Segye.

577
00:42:14,745 --> 00:42:17,531
I thought I could show you
since you're not afraid.

578
00:42:18,938 --> 00:42:20,360
These are my housemates.

579
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,213
This man had a scandal with me.

580
00:42:30,262 --> 00:42:32,483
And this is the boy who was
rumored to be my son.

581
00:42:33,783 --> 00:42:35,799
This man came during the film award.

582
00:42:38,062 --> 00:42:39,060
And this...

583
00:42:41,063 --> 00:42:42,844
It's someone you know.

584
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:44,981
You helped her.

585
00:42:55,957 --> 00:42:57,362
Everyone here...

586
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,163
...is me.

587
00:43:04,734 --> 00:43:06,095
It's my way of honoring their memories.

588
00:43:08,047 --> 00:43:08,880
Honoring?

589
00:43:10,102 --> 00:43:11,626
I'm the only one who remembers.

590
00:43:15,678 --> 00:43:18,255
The lives of these faces
that lasted a week.

591
00:43:25,673 --> 00:43:27,332
I'm going to take a photo
of my real face...

592
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:30,606
...and hang it up before I die.

593
00:43:31,019 --> 00:43:31,957
Over there.

594
00:43:51,802 --> 00:43:52,635
So...

595
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:54,745
See you again tomorrow.

596
00:43:57,338 --> 00:43:59,147
I feel sad when I hear that.

597
00:44:00,925 --> 00:44:03,908
Because I don't know
if I can see you tomorrow.

598
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:06,844
See you again.

599
00:44:09,698 --> 00:44:10,833
We'll see each other again.

600
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:12,923
Because I'll recognize you.

601
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:18,386
Sleep tight.

602
00:44:44,624 --> 00:44:45,685
I must be crazy.

603
00:44:48,527 --> 00:44:49,869
Why is my heart beating?

604
00:45:01,994 --> 00:45:05,351
Does he think he's Cinderella?

605
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:07,672
He shows up everywhere out of the blue.

606
00:45:08,267 --> 00:45:09,999
And he disappears when I need him.

607
00:45:50,218 --> 00:45:51,716
What a delicious smell...

608
00:46:10,526 --> 00:46:12,331
I'm going to get fat...

609
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:36,441
Where could this guy be hiding?

610
00:46:51,617 --> 00:46:53,155
Sending you alone...

611
00:46:53,783 --> 00:46:55,073
...makes me think of the old days.

612
00:46:55,158 --> 00:46:58,417
Don't talk like that.
It makes me think we're old.

613

right after the audition?

616
00:47:09,366 --> 00:47:10,349
Okay.

617
00:47:11,025 --> 00:47:12,801

-You bet.

-It's an audition for minor roles.

You're here for the audition?

-Yeah.
-Really?

-She got on her knees.
-She bent her knees?

I would give up if I were here.

No. He didn't cast me.

You don't have to talk to him.

658
00:49:29,586 --> 00:49:31,189
I'll get my own role.

659
00:49:36,047 --> 00:49:36,880
Okay then.

660
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:39,116
I'm looking forward to it.

661
00:49:49,075 --> 00:49:50,819
What's going on between them?

662
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,742
So you came all the way here by yourself?

663
00:50:04,005 --> 00:50:06,253
I heard you received other offers.

664
00:50:06,524 --> 00:50:07,524
As the heroine.

665
00:50:07,749 --> 00:50:09,940
I want to be in your project.

666
00:50:11,871 --> 00:50:12,704
Why?

667
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:15,900
Oops.

668
00:50:16,582 --> 00:50:18,482
Did I offend you again?

669
00:50:19,132 --> 00:50:21,326
I was just curious.

670
00:50:21,614 --> 00:50:26,122
How come you always have
so much passion for acting and films?

671
00:50:27,632 --> 00:50:30,995
Because I want to work with you.

672
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:37,166
Now that you've mentioned it,
try reading together.

673
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:38,624
Scene Two.

674
00:50:47,964 --> 00:50:49,190
Why me?

675
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:51,365
Why did it have to be me?

676
00:50:51,623 --> 00:50:53,255
Because you're dysfunctional.

677
00:50:54,366 --> 00:50:55,709
You're imperfect.

678
00:50:56,664 --> 00:50:58,029
And useless.

679
00:50:58,132 --> 00:51:00,457
I never asked to be born this way.

680
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:04,028
You know that you can't be happy
looking like that.

681
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:08,569
I will have a happy life.

682
00:51:11,262 --> 00:51:13,606
Don't live reproaching yourself.

683
00:51:15,727 --> 00:51:17,894
Just die hating me.

684
00:51:18,232 --> 00:51:19,109
Don't come near me.

685
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:21,556
Stay away!

686
00:51:28,096 --> 00:51:29,920
I'll take it all away from you.

687
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:33,891
I'll put you to rest.

688
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:36,876
Wait.

689
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,373
Why are you crying?

690
00:51:40,879 --> 00:51:43,458
That line should be said in a cold tone.

691
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,161
I'm sorry.

692
00:51:45,934 --> 00:51:47,504
But I felt compassionate towards her.

693
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:52,590
And you want to kill her?

694
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:57,184
Her heartfelt sympathy
could've blinded her.

695
00:53:17,746 --> 00:53:18,922
Don't move.

696
00:53:19,978 --> 00:53:22,996
I'm doing this in case
you didn't recognize me.

697
00:53:24,946 --> 00:53:27,532
It seems like you finally
believe my weakness.

698
00:53:27,616 --> 00:53:29,583
It's been a long time
since I started believing.

699
00:53:30,892 --> 00:53:31,923
What are those flowers?

700
00:53:32,007 --> 00:53:33,128
A prop.

701
00:53:33,845 --> 00:53:35,079
Since I came here to pick you up...

702
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:37,466
...I thought we could do
the couple of the century thing.

703
00:53:37,616 --> 00:53:39,669
You are so good at your job.

704
00:53:40,373 --> 00:53:41,777
Don't you have anything else to say?

705
00:53:43,138 --> 00:53:45,668
What about the audition? Did it go well?

706
00:53:48,138 --> 00:53:49,059
Of course.

707
00:53:49,657 --> 00:53:50,666
Don't you know me?

708
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:52,257
I'm Han Segye.

709
00:53:55,143 --> 00:53:56,548
I guess this was worth buying.

710
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:09,145
Don't you think
that director's indecisive?

711
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:12,208
If he said he wouldn't cast you,
he should've kept his word.

712
00:54:12,341 --> 00:54:14,752
My acting was too awesome
for him to refuse.

713
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,620
I made quite an impression.

714
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:19,299
I totally crushed Chae Yoori...

715
00:54:20,545 --> 00:54:21,435
Where are you going?

716
00:54:22,632 --> 00:54:23,971
I'm going to cook some ramyeon.

717
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:26,682
I'm hungry.

718
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:48,096
This is cooked perfectly.
You're a professional.

719
00:54:49,209 --> 00:54:50,383
I never said you could have some.

720
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:52,301
Okay. I'll pay you back for this.

721
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:54,760
Forget about all this...

722
00:54:55,665 --> 00:54:57,652
...and help me practice the lines.

723
00:54:58,673 --> 00:54:59,506
Me?

724
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:03,606
My success means your success.

725
00:55:03,819 --> 00:55:04,902
Don't you want to succeed?

726
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:12,361
"We are broken. You and me..."

727
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,687
You lack emotion.

728
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,898
Let's go gain. Do it right.

729
00:55:25,729 --> 00:55:27,287
-Here I go.
-Okay, go.

730
00:55:29,105 --> 00:55:29,949
"But"...

731
00:55:31,751 --> 00:55:33,913
..."now I know that you exist."

732
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:38,101
"That's why I went out into the world."

733
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:39,680
"Perhaps"...

734
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,263
"You could've been"...

735
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:45,317
..."waiting for me too."

736
00:55:52,423 --> 00:55:53,623
Aren't you going to read your lines?

737
00:55:56,627 --> 00:55:57,875
I forgot.

738
00:55:58,646 --> 00:55:59,621
What was the line again?

739
00:56:01,065 --> 00:56:02,070
When are we going to bed?

740
00:56:02,154 --> 00:56:03,126
Oh jeez...

741
00:56:04,331 --> 00:56:05,829
Is that all you can think about?

742
00:56:52,207 --> 00:56:54,639
It's a razor blade. What razor do you use?

743
00:56:56,355 --> 00:56:59,031
I feel weird talking about this
with a woman.

744
00:56:59,423 --> 00:57:02,546
I cut myself shaving last time
and spilled like a liter of blood.

745
00:57:10,108 --> 00:57:12,302
You're very good at shaving.

746
00:57:13,021 --> 00:57:14,992
I'll teach you, if I get the chance.

747
00:57:15,772 --> 00:57:16,670
Are you serious?

748
00:57:18,486 --> 00:57:20,447
There's one more thing I want to learn.

749
00:57:27,476 --> 00:57:29,408
Why do you have so many clothes?

750
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:33,920
I know you're rich but
this is far too extravagant.

751
00:57:34,446 --> 00:57:35,816
Do you sell clothes?

752
00:57:37,094 --> 00:57:38,903
To me, these are like my face.

753
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:40,891
I can't recognize my own face...

754
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,200
...but I can recognize my clothes.

755
00:57:50,632 --> 00:57:51,465
Try it on.

756
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:12,644
I can't get used to this
no matter how much I try.

757
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:29,324
Oh, like this...

758
00:58:47,225 --> 00:58:48,678
Your eyes are full of desires.

759
00:58:49,674 --> 00:58:51,468
That's ridiculous.

760
00:58:57,218 --> 00:58:58,685
How can men wear this?

761
00:59:05,815 --> 00:59:07,011
I'm warning you.

762
00:59:08,457 --> 00:59:10,514
If you invade my side of the bed,
I'll take you to hell.

763
00:59:10,882 --> 00:59:12,885
I'll call the cops immediately.

764
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,764
It's a big bed indeed.

765
00:59:21,101 --> 00:59:21,934
Why?

766
00:59:22,515 --> 00:59:23,834
Does that disappoint you?

767
00:59:27,948 --> 00:59:30,174
I really don't know how I'll change.

768
00:59:31,644 --> 00:59:33,532
Even if you say that...

769
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:35,427
I still don't...

770
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,784
...believe you completely.

771
00:59:38,797 --> 00:59:40,722
I could change into an old man.

772
00:59:40,807 --> 00:59:42,123
I'll treat you like a senior citizen.

773
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,947
It may not happen today.

774
00:59:44,032 --> 00:59:45,580
Then let's sleep together again tomorrow.

775
00:59:47,638 --> 00:59:50,727
Can you please think before you speak?

776
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:53,349
Why? Are you getting indecent ideas?

777
00:59:53,787 --> 00:59:56,059
What the hell are you talking about?

778
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,759
It's okay.

779
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:59,619
Just don't let me find out.

780
01:00:03,826 --> 01:00:05,702
You can't even remember my original face.

781
01:00:06,029 --> 01:00:07,992
How will you recognize my new face?

782
01:00:09,456 --> 01:00:10,725
So I'd like to ask you...

783
01:00:12,545 --> 01:00:13,994
Can I touch it?

784
01:00:14,887 --> 01:00:15,720
Your face.

785
01:00:22,676 --> 01:00:24,472
I won't close my eyes.

786
01:00:27,385 --> 01:00:28,888
It'll be awkward if I do.

787
01:00:57,636 --> 01:00:58,911
You're ugly.

788
01:01:01,216 --> 01:01:02,172
You're the one to talk.

789
01:01:10,843 --> 01:01:11,807
So it's...

790
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:16,276
Was Joohwan correct?

791
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,617
Is he crazy?

792
01:02:31,522 --> 01:02:33,000
You're awake.

793
01:02:36,248 --> 01:02:37,994
It's still the same, isn't it?

794
01:02:39,054 --> 01:02:40,557
And your voice hasn't changed, either.

795
01:02:47,808 --> 01:02:48,736
You're right.

796
01:02:49,033 --> 01:02:50,204
What is this?

797
01:02:50,722 --> 01:02:52,201
You didn't change.

798
01:02:52,506 --> 01:02:54,204
Have you been lying to me?

799
01:03:03,271 --> 01:03:06,216
Why are you provoking me
so early in the morning?

800
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:12,783
I told you over and over last night
that I might not change.

801
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:15,699
I guess it's not happening today.

802
01:03:17,897 --> 01:03:21,273
Did you lie to me on purpose
so you can stay with me?

803
01:03:21,357 --> 01:03:22,433
What the hell?

804
01:03:23,357 --> 01:03:25,773
I didn't ask to sleep together.
You did.

805
01:03:25,857 --> 01:03:27,767
You can come clean. It's okay.

806
01:03:27,852 --> 01:03:30,307
Since when did you start deceiving me?

807
01:03:30,397 --> 01:03:31,721
I didn't...

808
01:03:33,857 --> 01:03:35,534
I'm going to lose my mind.

809
01:03:36,916 --> 01:03:40,354
Why did it miss the right time...

810
01:03:44,263 --> 01:03:47,863
I refused over and over again...

811
01:03:48,486 --> 01:03:50,769
But you kept insisting
that we should sleep together.

812
01:03:50,853 --> 01:03:52,862
I wasn't expecting this.

813
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,875
You're such a bad man.

814
01:03:56,829 --> 01:03:58,326
Don't you think about
what will happen later?

815
01:03:58,411 --> 01:03:59,778
Is today the only chance?

816
01:03:59,929 --> 01:04:01,588
"Then let's sleep together
again tomorrow."

817
01:04:02,025 --> 01:04:03,624
Don't you remember
who said that last night?

818
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:06,927
You two!

819
01:04:08,937 --> 01:04:09,770
Mother?

820
01:04:12,644 --> 01:04:16,167
-What brings you here?
-What brings me here?

821
01:04:16,576 --> 01:04:17,926
Are you insane?

822
01:04:18,402 --> 01:04:20,170
You brought her to your house?

823
01:04:20,255 --> 01:04:22,078
Why don't you just move in with her?

824
01:04:22,162 --> 01:04:23,600
I can explain.

825
01:04:23,934 --> 01:04:24,767
You...

826
01:04:25,242 --> 01:04:26,414
Lower your covers.

827
01:04:27,733 --> 01:04:29,423
-You don't want to?
-Mother.

828
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:31,167
Please listen to me.

829
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:33,233
I know what it looks like, but...

830
01:04:33,317 --> 01:04:35,564
I gave her money and she accepted.
200 million won.

831
01:04:35,649 --> 01:04:37,633
Did she tell you? I guess not.

832
01:04:37,718 --> 01:04:39,143
You gave her money?

833
01:04:40,457 --> 01:04:42,512
I want her to answer that question.

834
01:04:42,823 --> 01:04:43,656
Wait...

835
01:05:04,586 --> 01:05:05,419
What...

836
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,915
What on earth...

837
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:10,548
Hello.

838
01:05:14,843 --> 01:05:15,676
You...

839
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,671
So, you two were...?

840
01:05:20,661 --> 01:05:22,979
You two were talking just now...?

841
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:30,635
My son is... Ga...

842
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:32,028
-No.
-Oh, no!

843
01:05:34,871 --> 01:05:37,246
He looks like he's in high school...

844
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:38,735
-No!
-It's not like that.

845
01:05:45,101 --> 01:05:45,934
Mother!

846
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,324
Mother!

847
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:10,928
(Beauty Inside)

848
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:12,017
How old is that kid?

849
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:13,972
About 18? 19?

850
01:06:14,056 --> 01:06:15,495
What are you doing?

851
01:06:15,579 --> 01:06:17,774
We're both men. What's the big deal?

852
01:06:17,951 --> 01:06:19,455
-He wasn't surprised when he saw?
-What?

853
01:06:19,544 --> 01:06:21,328
Did he say your name?

854
01:06:21,413 --> 01:06:22,446
Ms. Han.

855
01:06:22,544 --> 01:06:24,931
You haven't forgotten about your promise
to not run away, right?

856
01:06:25,015 --> 01:06:26,614
You'd better not run away either.

857
01:06:26,698 --> 01:06:27,831
So it is you.

858
01:06:31,124 --> 01:06:32,120
Were you crying?

859
01:06:33,325 --> 01:06:34,376
Is this okay?

860
01:06:34,461 --> 01:06:35,594
Of course it's okay.

861
01:06:36,303 --> 01:06:37,223
It's mine.
