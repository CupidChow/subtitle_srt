1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:02,912
Your movie,
"Runner" has been nominated for

2
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:05,990
an award at Cannes Film
Festival this year.

3
00:00:06,189 --> 00:00:08,408
It must feel quite special to you.

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:13,514
People are even saying that you might win
the best actress award. What do you think?

5
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:15,716
As it's my first time going
to Cannes Film Festival,

6
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:19,620
so I feel so nervous, I don't even have
time to think about winning an award.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,923
I'm already honored with just
participating in the Festival.

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,312
I heard that the cast of "Runners"
had great harmony. Is this true?

9
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,731
Actually, to be honest...

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,733
...it wasn't that bad.

11
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,335
At least we didn't grab each other
by the hair.

12
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,105
You're really honest.

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,807
Out of all the actors
you've worked with before,

14
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:43,544
who would be the person that
leave the biggest impression on you?

15
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:49,249
Chae Yoori?

16
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,352
Too bad we don't see
Chae Yoori on TV lately.

17
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:56,056
Exactly. She's probably doing well, right?

18
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:11,004
It's okay. It's okay.

19
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,411
I'm sorry, I was wrong.
Please don't kill me!

20
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:23,016
Thank you.

21
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,524
Congratulations.

22
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:32,326
About going to Cannes.

23
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:33,828
What brings you here?

24
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,630
What else? To see you, of course.

25
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,534
You've been so busy that I can't set up
a meeting with you.

26
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:41,635
So, I just came in person.

27
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:46,640
I heard your contract with
T'Road will end soon?

28
00:01:47,537 --> 00:01:48,839
Sign with One Air.

29
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,545
What do you think?

30
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:55,148
I knew this would happen.

31
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,852
Why are you here?

32
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,754
To protect my company's model.

33
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:04,558
Are you following me?

34
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,326
Of course I should.

35
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,429
You're so desperate to steal my model.

36
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,600
Gosh, my goodness!

37
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,807
Save your siblings fight for later.

38
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,105
Bring me both of your proposals first.

39
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:22,209
Excuse us then,
we have schedules to attend.

40
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,311
I'll call you.

41
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:38,925
Nothing special about your girlfriend.

42
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:45,252
That's right.

43
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,168
Well, she is normal.

44
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,377
Get rid of the flowers.

45
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:50,871
Why? I bought this to give it to you.

46
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,473
Exactly. That's why I
told you to get rid of it.

47
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:54,975
Anyway, let's have lunch together.

48
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:57,377
Gosh, I hate both the flower
and what you said.

49
00:02:57,461 --> 00:02:58,679
Hey, Jung Joohwan.

50
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:01,281
Don't you have anything to do?
Why are you always looking for me?

51
00:03:02,072 --> 00:03:03,583
Who else should I look for then?

52
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:06,687
Stop acting pitiful.
It won't work on me anymore.

53
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,690
At least accept the flower if you
won't have lunch with me.

54
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,991
Mr. Jung?

55
00:03:13,682 --> 00:03:14,995
Oh my! Mr. Seo, you're here as well!

56
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,099
Mr. Jung, I've prepared the
documents you requested.

57
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,901
Okay. Please send it to me then.

58
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:22,302
Okay.

59
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:26,306
Wow!

60
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,208
What do you mean by that?

61
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:31,178
Wow, Mr. Jung!

62
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,687
Seriously!

63
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,981
Seriously wow!

64
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:40,353
(Director Jung Joohwan)

65
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:42,155
I'm busy.

66
00:03:42,586 --> 00:03:44,891
Sure. Go ahead and work.

67
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:48,895
Gosh! You've been bothering
me since just now!

68
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,364
That's why, you should have just
went lunch with me.

69
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,169
You need to take care of your health even
when you're busy.

70
00:03:56,254 --> 00:03:59,773
Refill your daily dose of vitamin
with "Han Segye" for today.

71
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,179
What are the side-effects of being
overdose with vitamin?

72
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:08,281
You're always slacking off whenever
I look at you.

73
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,183
Other are working so hard at their job.

74
00:04:10,302 --> 00:04:12,285
Be the President of the company then.

75
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,992
Hello Chairman. It's me, Mr. Jung.

76
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:20,894
I'm leaving. Continue your work.

77
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,913
Why do you choose this place?

78
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,610
I've always wanted to come here once.

79
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:40,714
It's a bit weird for a man to come alone.

80
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:43,416
But you think it's okay for two man
to come her together?

81
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,107
Since we both have busy girlfriends.

82
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:48,299
So, let's help each other.

83
00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:49,890
You can just leave if you don't want to.

84
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:54,182
Wait!

85
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,798
You have a long way to go.

86
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,600
Dessert need to be eaten
with your eyes first.

87
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,011
What?

88
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:13,547
Okay. You can eat now.

89
00:05:14,643 --> 00:05:18,051
If only my girlfriend is not busy.

90
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,953
I guess being a President
gives you a lot of free time.

91
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:20,870
Not that much.

92
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,963
Well, now I only need to approve things.

93
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:25,926
You sure earn money easily.

94
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:30,330
My girlfriend stays up
late just to beat you.

95
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,012
She didn't even glance at me because she's
so busy looking at documents!

96
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:36,837
What do you mean by that?

97
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,105
So, she looks at documents all night long.

98
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:40,927
Yet, you're with her?

99
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:43,109
All night long? Besides her?

100
00:05:43,528 --> 00:05:44,729
She doesn't glance at you?

101
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,049
I need to go to the library to study.

102
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,151
Excuse me then.

103
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,648
The dessert was delicious.

104
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,232
I should step up my game too.

105
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,604
Hey, Kingkang!

106
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,792
Good girl.

107
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:21,815
Okay.

108
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:34,327
(Aunt)

109
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:39,633
Please don't ignore it.

110
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,736
(Aunt)

111
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:48,041
Kingkang...

112
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,378
I'm lonely.

113
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,886
Lee Sangyeong, I have a question for you.

114
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:03,456
Who do you think is the flower on the set?

115
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,559
Well, the flower on the set...

116
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,361
...would be the actress of course.

117
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,398
You feel good just looking at them.

118
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:15,101
Han Segye is a big senior in the industry.

119
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,771
So she's no longer a flower at the set.

120
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,774
So, Yoonsol is like the flower on the set.

121
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,177
Are you jealous?

122
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:26,479
Excuse me?

123
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,250
If you're jealous,
you should have been a flower too.

124
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,451
Me?

125
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,453
How can a man be a flower.

126
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:35,055
Oh my, it's nothing special.

127
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,425
All you need to do is
smile and shut your mouth.

128
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,728
Then, everyone would feel
happy at the filming site.

129
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:43,867
-What?
-All I'm saying is just shut up...

130
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:45,732
...if you're going to spout nonsense.

131
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,135
Is that so hard to understand?

132
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:54,325
So Sangyeong, just be the flower.

133
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:57,010
-We'll be the actors.
-Okay.

134
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:13,293
All I'm saying is just shut up if
you're going to spout nonsense.

135
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:16,896
Your sister got herself in trouble again.

136
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,271
(Grandpa)

137
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,074
Hello, grandpa.

138
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,477
Why is our stock price dropping?

139
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,379
I'll settle it soon.

140
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,781
My goodness!

141
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,252
You crazy wench! It was live just now!

142
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:41,669
When have I ever care about how I act,
live or not?

143
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:45,258
Gosh! Are you bragging right now?
Fine! Go ahead and be proud of it!

144
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:48,028
Of course! I'm your forever pride.

145
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:51,031
But I really can't help myself.

146
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:54,734
I tried so hard to held it in but the
words just come out of my mouth!

147
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,004
You must be trending after so long!

148
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:00,440
Gosh, just look at that.

149
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,742
"Han Segye", "Han Segye disharmony",

150
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,012
-"Han Segye dating...rumors?"
-Dating rumors?

151
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:07,313
With who?

152
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,515
With Seo Dojae?

153
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:15,422
So, you dated with Lee
Sangyeong while filming.

154
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:18,725
Then, you two broke up after it ended,
and that's why you're acting that way?

155
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,827
What the heck? Who do they think I am?

156
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,634
My gosh!

157
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,538
That's right. A scandal gets
buried by another scandal.

158
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:34,029
This is so you.

159
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,208
Give it back!

160
00:09:35,715 --> 00:09:36,810
My goodness.

161
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:43,183
Hello, Reporter Park. Well...

162
00:09:43,402 --> 00:09:44,084
Go away.

163
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,087
Reporter Park,
is there anything that you...

164
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,388
Gosh, seriously!

165
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,003
It was not that way.

166
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:52,811
(Han Segye, Lee Sangyeong, Did Their
Love in the Movie Become True?)

167
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:54,111
(Han Segye, Lee Sangyeong, dating rumors)

168
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,867
Is this why she hasn't
checked her messages?

169
00:10:01,652 --> 00:10:04,747
It's not because she's busy,
but because she's avoiding me?

170
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:08,959
Have I been dumped?

171
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:22,856
-Ta-da!
-Han Segye!

172
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,462
My King Kang! Did you have fun?

173
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,569
What are you doing?

174
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,672
-What?
-What about me?

175
00:10:40,162 --> 00:10:40,974
What?

176
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,988
-What's with the dating rumors?
-Can't you tell?

177
00:10:55,481 --> 00:10:57,757
I knew it, I've been dumped!

178
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:04,052
Look carefully.

179
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:11,237
-That was you from last time.
-Yes, this is me.

180
00:11:13,162 --> 00:11:14,262
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:16,976
I'm too blindly in love.

182
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:19,766
Fine. I'll accept your apology.

183
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,683
This seems weird.

184
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,386
Well, when actors act so well,

185
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:28,488
it's possible for dating rumors to start!

186
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:32,091
How can an actor's boyfriend
not understand that?

187
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:34,093
Okay.

188
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,096
Okay.

189
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,100
Weirdly,

190
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:44,103
there were no dating rumors
with those I actually dated.

191
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,006
Have you dated your co-stars before?

192
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,714
You've never seen my phone
wallpaper, have you?

193
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:58,017
Look at that, the photo set of
the ones I love.

194
00:11:58,126 --> 00:11:59,728
My boyfriend and Kingkang.

195
00:11:59,812 --> 00:12:01,421
The picture turn out well.

196
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:02,822
Who was it?

197
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,123
Who was that man?

198
00:12:05,251 --> 00:12:06,326
I'm hungry.

199
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,328
Is there anything to eat?

200
00:12:09,351 --> 00:12:10,430
Han Segye!

201
00:12:11,721 --> 00:12:13,199
There's nothing to eat!

202
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:20,199
Will this be enough for you?

203
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,195
-Should I make some ramyeon?
-No, I can't!

204
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,212
I need to wear a dress,
so I need to go on a diet.

205
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,615
I have a new movie project.

206
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:29,816
Again?

207
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:34,787
Why? You told me to make movies.
You don't like it?

208
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,189
I mean...

209
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,175
I like it...

210
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:40,994
-It's great but...
-It's great, right?

211
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,894
I'm a bit nervous, as it's been a while
since I last film a romantic comedy movie.

212
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:47,700
If it's romance...

213
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:49,802
Will there be kiss scene as well?

214
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,105
Of course! It's romantic comedy after all.

215
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:54,374
-Of course?
-Have you finished eating?

216
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:56,576
If you're finished, help me with my lines.

217
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:59,284
All right, over here. From page 30.

218
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,683
(Kiss)

219
00:13:06,512 --> 00:13:08,187
You're nothing to me.

220
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,291
You're like a passing wind.

221
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:14,111
How can...

222
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,919
...love change?

223
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:17,312
Don't be ridiculous!

224
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,198
I never loved you.

225
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,995
What's the next line?

226
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,253
This is the next line.

227
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:46,025
What a liar.

228
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:47,827
Are you sure?

229
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,731
-There's one more down there.
-I see.

230
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:55,935
It says kiss.

231
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,738
No wonder! I made a big mistake!

232
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,948
No, wait!

233
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:01,341
-Focus.
-No, it's okay.

234
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,141
Focus!

235
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:12,876
Am I not pretty?

236
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,389
-So suddenly?
-Because you're suddenly doing this.

237
00:14:16,474 --> 00:14:18,071
You're pretty.

238
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:20,580
I'm only doing this to
make you look prettier.

239
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,396
I knew it! I'm not pretty.

240
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,799
Gosh, seriously!

241
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,401
I'm going home if you keep this up.

242
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,902
I knew it!

243
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:32,405
You're going home because I'm not pretty.

244
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:35,708
Gosh! You're pathetic!

245
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,910
You're really ugly!

246
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:39,612
You're one to talk.

247
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:47,186
By the way, do you remember that time?

248
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:49,889
When you touched my face.

249
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,694
If you compare my face when touched
it back then, and right now,

250
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:55,895
how does it feel?

251
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,097
Does it feel the same?

252
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,399
I don't know.

253
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,722
What can I know by touching your face?

254
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:05,037
Well, it was just...

255
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,900
...because I wanted to touch your face.

256
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:10,610
-Unbelievable!
-Exactly.

257
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:12,595
It's fine as long as I don't get caught.

258
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:14,781
So sneaky!

259
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:19,105
Should I show you...

260
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:21,416
...what being sneaky is all about?

261
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:24,190
No, you don't have to. It's fine.

262
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,692
-I'm fine.
-No.

263
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:28,876
-There's a second step...
-You said I'm sneaky?

264
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:30,763
-No, I take it back.
-I haven't even started yet.

265
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,874
Please lie down and look at the ceiling.

266
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,167
Yes, please lie down
and look at the ceiling.

267
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:37,770
Okay, fine.

268
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,249
Sleep more if you're tired.

269
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:00,560
I will after sending you off.

270
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:05,187
Do you want to go to work with me
if it's too boring by yourself?

271
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:09,902
I have place to go.

272
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,505
I need to meet someone.

273
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,187
-No.
-What?

274
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,211
This is how you do it.

275
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:20,913
Who are you going to meet?

276
00:16:21,192 --> 00:16:22,315
Just someone.

277
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:25,017
Why? Is it an actor?

278
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,919
A co-star you acted with?

279
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,521
No, it's not.

280
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,224
I'm meeting a woman.

281
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:45,838
Did you break up with my brother?

282
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,341
No way.

283
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:49,542
I knew it.

284
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:55,715
Well, it's not an easy job.

285
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,731
There's no end to rumors.

286
00:16:58,822 --> 00:16:59,928
Exactly.

287
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,923
Gosh, I don't even like younger guys.
Why did that rumor even happen?

288
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:05,725
Younger guys.

289
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:10,022
Is it because he's young?

290
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,600
Why? Is there any problem with Eunho?

291
00:17:15,322 --> 00:17:17,003
He's too considerate to me.

292
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:22,341
When you like someone, don't you
tend to fight all the time?

293
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,056
He doesn't even call me, in case I'm busy.

294
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,347
He only calls me after work.

295
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:32,818
It's not like I can
explain everything to him.

296
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,623
Are you bragging right now?

297
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:38,824
No, I'm not.

298
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,427
I'm really concerned right now.

299
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,899
I don't have friends,
so I can't talk about this to anyone.

300
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,702
That's why I called you.

301
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,806
You called a busy person just to listen to
love advice.

302
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,218
That's just how he usually is.

303
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,437
He's usually nice and kind to everyone...

304
00:18:00,528 --> 00:18:01,814
Don't say that.

305
00:18:04,326 --> 00:18:07,320
I guess I have trauma about him
being kind to everyone.

306
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:08,712
Also,

307
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,691
he also smiles to everyone.

308
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,615
This is so frustrating!

309
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,332
He can't just simply smile to everyone!

310
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:21,734
This brat need some lesson!

311
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,136
(Criminal Procedure Cases)

312
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:50,402
Excuse me.

313
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:53,399
Well...

314
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:57,182
I have a girlfriend.

315
00:18:57,287 --> 00:18:58,004
Excuse me?

316
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,140
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:05,778
No, but...

318
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,381
You dropped this.

319
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:11,684
What is he even thinking?

320
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:22,695
Excuse me.

321
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,898
You dropped something.

322
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,203
Your charm. You dropped your charm.

323
00:19:31,992 --> 00:19:33,706
Do you have a boyfriend?

324
00:19:35,232 --> 00:19:38,110
-Yes, she does.
-I'm sorry.

325
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,718
Are you the legendary senior, Ryu Eunho?

326
00:19:43,802 --> 00:19:44,917
Leave.

327
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,519
It's an honor.

328
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,622
Honor my foot.

329
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,097
Why are you upset?

330
00:19:58,203 --> 00:19:59,598
No, I'm not.

331
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:04,503
Is it my fault that I'm charming?

332
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,406
Well, it's not my fault.

333
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,658
We've arrived.

334
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:33,532
Now that I need to get off,
I feel bad for being upset.

335
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:38,437
It's true you're upset then.

336
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:44,510
You always pick up and send me off.

337
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:46,812
You must be tired.

338
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,016
I'm not doing it for you convenience.

339
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:55,421
I'm doing it for myself,
so don't worry about it.

340
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,990
Well, I won't be...

341
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,993
...able to do it for a while anyway.

342
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,895
You wont be able to do it for a while?

343
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,131
Why can't you?

344
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,399
Because I'll be busy.

345
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:12,549
While we're on the topic...

346
00:21:22,137 --> 00:21:24,917
-What is this?
-Don't feel too burdened by it.

347
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:26,852
It's a used car.

348
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:29,655
Grandpa always gives me a new car.

349
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:31,457
So, I have a lot of extra cars.

350
00:21:32,052 --> 00:21:33,459
You know how to drive, right?

351
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,363
When I can't pick you up,
just drive the car yourself.

352
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:38,964
My goodness.

353
00:21:39,651 --> 00:21:43,636
I asked my secretary to
park the car over there.

354
00:21:47,562 --> 00:21:48,631
What are you doing?

355
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,643
Aren't you getting down?

356
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,245
Yes. Sure.

357
00:22:08,782 --> 00:22:09,762
Go ahead.

358
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:11,864
Okay.

359
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:41,193
In a lot of way,

360
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,396
I realized that I really
met an incredible woman.

361
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:54,607
-Hello?
-You brat! Come here this instant!

362
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,412
How dare you make a
woman wait for your call?

363
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:03,315
Can't you call her more often?
Did I raise you that way?

364
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,417
No, that's not it.

365
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:08,027
She's just a very busy person.

366
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,255
Be quiet!

367
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:10,637
How dare you give excuses!

368
00:23:10,742 --> 00:23:12,342
Did I taught you that way?

369
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,827
Do things properly!

370
00:23:14,952 --> 00:23:16,528
Who told you to smile at just anyone?

371
00:23:16,621 --> 00:23:18,097
Smile?

372
00:23:18,421 --> 00:23:20,199
To just anyone?

373
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,980
You've totally lost your mind!

374
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:26,586
If you were my boyfriend,
I'd make sure you won't ever smile again.

375
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,072
What can I do when I
naturally smile a lot?

376
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,076
He said he smiles a lot.

377
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,378
Hey, be honest!

378
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:35,080
You smile in front of money!
You never do that in front of us.

379
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:38,984
Fine. Let's say I don't smile.

380
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:41,987
Even if I don't smile,
people still likes me...

381
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:44,490
He has lost it.

382
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,191
We need to make him sit at
the thinking chair.

383
00:23:46,282 --> 00:23:48,594
He need some spanking. Where's the lash?

384
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,062
I raised my hand.

385
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,563
I'm sorry. Don't hit me!

386
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,267
You're worse than Kingkang.

387
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,282
What are you doing here when you're way
too busy to eat lunch together?

388
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:13,585
Be honest.

389
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,988
Don't act serious with
a puppy in your hand.

390
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,556
You have another girlfriend, don't you?

391
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,337
-What the heck are you saying?
-I'm right!

392
00:24:20,452 --> 00:24:21,560
Seeing how you suddenly get all serious.

393
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:24,267
Can't you see that I'm being serious
because it's obviously wrong?

394
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,022
Don't try to avoid it.

395
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:28,233
A reporter took a photo of you and
wanted to write an article about it.

396
00:24:28,321 --> 00:24:31,022
-But I've took care of it.
-Photo?

397
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,648
Oh, this one.

398
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,750
"Oh, this one"?

399
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:48,220
Look at how he acts like it's nothing.

400
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,623
Fine.

401
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,327
I guess that's why Han Segye is meeting
another man too.

402
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,729
-That's not it...
-Then, why is it here?|

403
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:00,799
I get it now.

404
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:03,502
So, you guys can't break up
because of Kingkang, right?

405
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:08,574
-Well, Kingkang is cute.
-I told you that's not it.

406
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:20,915
It's also difficult for
me to tell you about this.

407
00:25:21,211 --> 00:25:24,590
Yes, I roughly heard about
why you want to meet.

408
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,026
Yes. I guess you've heard about it.

409
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,030
I think Mr. Seo cheated on her first.

410
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,238
And I think that's why Han Segye met
that actor.

411
00:25:34,322 --> 00:25:35,634
No, that's not true.

412
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,036
It might not be the case for Han Segye.

413
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:39,938
But I think it's different with Mr. Seo.

414
00:25:40,391 --> 00:25:41,907
I have no excuse.

415
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:47,413
I saw a picture of him being with
another woman.

416
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:48,814
Another woman?

417
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:52,317
Is her hair around this long?

418
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:55,721
And is her height around this?

419
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,323
I guess you know about it too.

420
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:01,527
As you know,
Mr. Seo is quite good-looking.

421
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:04,730
I have no excuse.

422
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,533
The way you speak is quite weird.

423
00:26:08,022 --> 00:26:11,036
Segye is good looking too, you know?

424
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,438
Exactly!

425
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:14,540
I am very worried...

426
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,341
...that someone like her
would be very hurt by it.

427
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:20,245
Why are you speaking as
if Segye has been dumped?

428
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,245
Gosh, I apologized.

429
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,117
I should have been more careful with
my words in this situation.

430
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,518
My goodness!

431
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:31,023
I guess we should be considerate of
Han Segye's position first, right?

432
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:33,525
-It's not true!
-Yes, I understand.

433
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:37,129
I also desperately hope it's not true.

434
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,065
This is driving me nuts.

435
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,435
I can't even tell him what's going on!

436
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,437
You don't have to, I understand.

437
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:48,774
It must be hard. Which is why...

438
00:26:49,661 --> 00:26:52,827
...I came up with an excellent plan
for the two of them.

439
00:26:53,332 --> 00:26:54,633
Excellent plan?

440
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:58,328
I'm asking for your cooperation
after so long.

441
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,141
Cooperation?

442
00:27:03,742 --> 00:27:05,452
Mr. Seo, you're here!

443
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:09,261
Hey, I almost came empty-handed
to your sudden invitation...

444
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:16,568
I said "almost".

445
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:21,240
Welcome.
It must be hard finding the place.

446
00:27:21,336 --> 00:27:23,041
Oh my, please come in.

447
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:28,013
Yes, to your left.

448
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,527
Come here.

449
00:27:44,107 --> 00:27:46,298
Why are you late?

450
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,334
Why did you invite me late?

451
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:54,540
You disguised it as the excellent plan.

452
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,042
But it's all scheme to
get housewarming gifts.

453
00:27:57,131 --> 00:28:00,145
-What?
-You don't have to know.

454
00:28:00,831 --> 00:28:04,216
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

455
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,622
You said your dream was to buy a house.

456
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,524
Your promotion made it came true.

457
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:15,093
Dojae, you must have paid him a lot.

458
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:17,796
He request fora raise every time
there's an issue.

459
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,698
I'm jealous.

460
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,034
-Do you want a raise too?
-No.

461
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,803
What are you going to ask me to do
by giving me a raise?

462
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:29,741
Last time, she told me to commit theft.

463
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:33,127
-Theft?
-It's nothing.

464
00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:34,929
I jokingly told him...

465
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,616
...to go look for my phone
that fell into someone's hand.

466
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:39,351
Oh, that one.

467
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,053
She wasn't joking.

468
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:44,356
She was being serious back then.

469
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,961
She said her cell phone is with you.

470
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,563
So, she told me to go and steal it.

471
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:53,332
So, did you stole it?

472
00:28:54,022 --> 00:28:57,236
By the way, why do you have someone
else's cell phone?

473
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:00,305
Well, she dropped it.

474
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,709
-So, I only keep it safe for her...
-They're all memories.

475
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:06,011
We fought a lot because of it.

476
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:13,118
Do you enjoy it?

477
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:16,421
I think my plan works.

478
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:18,624
They look so good together.

479
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:22,350
They need to overcome a crisis
to strengthen their relationship.

480
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:24,730
I told you it's not true.

481
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:26,632
I don't need anymore crisis.

482
00:29:27,452 --> 00:29:28,267
Excuse me.

483
00:29:30,762 --> 00:29:34,573
Since everyone's here,
I have something to say too.

484
00:29:34,658 --> 00:29:35,757
All right.

485
00:29:39,171 --> 00:29:40,379
I'm getting married.

486
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,484
What do you want for your wedding gift?
Just tell me.

487
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,287
A dryer, washing machine...

488
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:48,487
Congratulations.

489
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:50,689
-Refrigerator.
-Congratulations.

490
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,291
A house.

491
00:29:53,581 --> 00:29:55,927
(The marriage of Kang Hanul & Yoo Woomi)

492
00:29:58,121 --> 00:30:00,732
-A car.
-Congratulations.

493
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,402
-Hold on a minute.
-What?

494
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:04,603
Why aren't you congratulating me?

495
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:08,206
Why do you have to go this far?

496
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,509
There's no turning back after the wedding.

497
00:30:11,931 --> 00:30:15,213
Do you want to get beaten up
in front of your girlfriend?

498
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,785
Don't worry about me.

499
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,387
I'm cool when it comes to friends.

500
00:30:24,149 --> 00:30:25,650
I saw Woomi's boyfriend.

501
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,136
-What?
-He looks fine.

502
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,028
-Real?
-Yes.

503
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,330
What do you mean by "fine"?

504
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,731
How can he be fine?

505
00:30:32,822 --> 00:30:34,726
My honey is so good-looking!

506
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,235
Hey, how come you never
introduce him to me?

507
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,939
Was it the one we met by chance last time?

508
00:30:41,931 --> 00:30:42,941
Oh, him?

509
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,347
What's going on?
How come you never showed him to me?

510
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:55,253
Okay!

511
00:30:56,951 --> 00:30:58,657
Please!

512
00:31:00,952 --> 00:31:03,962
-It's not working.
-You should have put that down.

513
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:05,364
Gosh!

514
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:15,173
So charming.

515
00:31:19,202 --> 00:31:21,580
Han Segye, you need to pay me double.

516
00:31:21,702 --> 00:31:23,782
Be easy on me.

517
00:31:24,972 --> 00:31:26,072
Let's go!

518
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,086
So tough.

519
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,357
Are you perhaps cheating?

520
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,659
Did you leave nail marks
on the cards or something?

521
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:36,962
Seo Dojae!

522
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,464
Bring me the sledgehammer.

523
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:41,366
Where is the sledgehammer?

524
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:46,462
You all have money to pay me, right?

525
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,674
Hey, stop her! Make sure you do!

526
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:52,978
If you lose again,
our company will go bankrupt!

527
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,161
-Eunho.
-Yes?

528
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,962
-Do you have cash?
-Yes.

529
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,169
It's mine! Mine!

530
00:32:14,377 --> 00:32:15,467
Sledgehammer.

531
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,137
Seo Dojae!

532
00:32:19,262 --> 00:32:22,340
I miss you so much.

533
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,166
We don't have a choice.

534
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:25,562
Hold on for a bit.

535
00:32:25,671 --> 00:32:30,549
But I miss you so much!

536
00:32:31,671 --> 00:32:33,385
I feel the same way.

537
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:37,489
When will we meet again?

538
00:32:37,941 --> 00:32:39,357
I know it's hard.

539
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,059
I'll be there soon.

540
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,961
I'm doing my best.

541
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:45,174
Seo Dojae...

542
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:49,267
-Promise me that you'll be back soon.
-Yes.

543
00:32:51,161 --> 00:32:52,337
Hey!

544
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:56,041
He only went to buy alcohol because
we're out of it!

545
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,843
Hurry up!

546
00:32:57,943 --> 00:33:00,445
Come back!

547
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,848
The world is too cruel.

548
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:06,928
Why are they trying to break us apart?

549
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,019
Why?

550
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,357
I'm so embarrassed to
look at Sara right now.

551
00:33:14,656 --> 00:33:18,035
I miss you, Ryu Eunho.

552
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:22,167
This is so sickening.

553
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,869
So scary.

554
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:31,176
Be honest, you did get another girlfriend!

555
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:32,948
Did you got another girlfriend?

556
00:33:33,032 --> 00:33:34,346
No, I didn't.

557
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,648
It was that day. The day Segye's change.

558
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:37,849
That's why he's like this.

559
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:39,341
Oh, that day.

560
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:42,521
He's driving me crazy by
overreacting about it.

561
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,923
Be more careful.

562
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:49,222
If you simply roam around like that
with her, you'd get a witness like him.

563
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,330
What the heck are you two talking about?

564
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:59,237
Actually, Segye's face changes once
every month.

565
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,542
Come to think of it,
it hasn't happened recently.

566
00:34:03,762 --> 00:34:05,348
It has been about two months now.

567
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,645
Yes, that's right.

568
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:08,446
She was fine for about
two months last time too.

569
00:34:08,572 --> 00:34:12,058
Both of you are so drunk. Gosh!

570
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,488
If you can't even drink well,

571
00:34:14,572 --> 00:34:17,756
why do you even drink at all?

572
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:21,593
Han Segye!

573
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:25,897
Seo Dojae! You bad man!
What took you so long?

574
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:27,465
I'm sorry.

575
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:31,257
The traffic signals
took forever to change.

576
00:34:31,492 --> 00:34:33,787
We're back.

577
00:34:33,886 --> 00:34:35,173
The traffic light.

578
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:39,577
Go and buy the traffic light tomorrow!

579
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,280
You missed me, right?

580
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,983
Well, not really.

581
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,585
What a mess!

582
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:47,788
Do you understand?

583
00:34:47,872 --> 00:34:48,954
Sounds great!

584
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:50,658
It won't happen again.

585
00:34:50,742 --> 00:34:53,358
Please buy the elevator too.

586
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,027
Elevator, my foot. What a mess!

587
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,930
Go back, everyone. The housewarming ended!

588
00:35:13,523 --> 00:35:15,313
What time does your work end today?

589
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:19,150
I don't know. I'll call when it ends.

590
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:22,420
I might not call too.

591
00:35:27,952 --> 00:35:28,727
Okay.

592
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,345
Excuse me. For you.

593
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,715
You look like this drink.

594
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:01,126
I still got it.

595
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:12,704
-Get in.
-What?

596
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,206
I said, get in.

597
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:17,876
We have somewhere to go.

598
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,972
-Okay.
-You can't get in holding that.

599
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,915
Put it there and get in.

600
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,199
-Put on your seat belt.
-Okay.

601
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:04,856
Please give your son to me.

602
00:37:04,963 --> 00:37:05,957
What?

603
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,064
No, mom. Don't get it wrong.

604
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:15,166
What are you saying all of a sudden?

605
00:37:15,297 --> 00:37:17,875
He makes me anxious
because he's too handsome.

606
00:37:17,992 --> 00:37:19,359
So, I need to do something.

607
00:37:19,762 --> 00:37:22,540
So, I think of signing
an official contract...

608
00:37:24,762 --> 00:37:25,944
I mean...

609
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,546
Make a promise...

610
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:30,841
But...

611
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,651
Even if we give our son,

612
00:37:33,742 --> 00:37:39,357
we should at least know who and
what kind of person you are.

613
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,751
My job.

614
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,562
Well, my job is...

615
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:47,766
...being a chaebol.

616
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:50,268
Chaebol? There's a job called that?

617
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:53,872
-Chaebol.
-He won't have to do any work.

618
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:57,675
I will fulfill Eunho's dream
of becoming a priest.

619
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,477
What? Priest?

620
00:37:59,932 --> 00:38:02,447
What do you even mean by that?

621
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:03,748
Yes.

622
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,242
Not priest, but bride.

623
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,726
And I'll be the groom.

624
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,030
Gosh, that was confusing!

625
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:24,030
I totally agree with it!

626
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,339
Kang Sara.

627
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,245
I agree as well.

628
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:41,512
Thank you for your clear
answer to my proposal.

629
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,648
It had been a satisfying transaction.

630
00:39:44,742 --> 00:39:47,619
I will keep my promise. Forever.

631
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,891
Please continue to look after me.

632
00:40:06,835 --> 00:40:08,835
Look at the camera and smile!

633
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,542
Okay, nice!

634
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,044
Okay, stay. A subtle smile.

635
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,133
Your eyes. A gentle gaze.

636
00:40:15,843 --> 00:40:17,003
Okay!

637
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,017
Let's check the pictures.

638
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:24,022
-You must be tired.
-It's okay.

639
00:40:25,247 --> 00:40:27,553
Han Segye,
I think you need to come outside.

640
00:40:27,653 --> 00:40:29,761
-What?
-Something came for you.

641
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:31,663
Okay.

642
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:37,064
What's going on?

643
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:40,371
One, two, three.

644
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:41,940
(Han Segye, be happy.
From Han Segye's boyfriend, Seo Dojae)

645
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:45,057
(Han Segye, be happy.
From Han Segye's boyfriend, Seo Dojae)

646
00:40:45,163 --> 00:40:47,078
Han Segye, be happy.

647
00:40:47,463 --> 00:40:49,774
From Han Segye's boyfriend, Seo Dojae.

648
00:40:50,774 --> 00:40:55,186
The dating rumors must
have bothered him a lot.

649
00:40:56,176 --> 00:40:57,388
My goodness!

650
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:02,193
Thanks to him,
I need to make some call now.

651
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,001
Reporter Park, please block it.

652
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,003
Please.

653
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:22,128
(President Seo Dojae)

654
00:41:52,725 --> 00:41:54,555
(Aunt)

655
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,151
Hello?

656
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,854
Come out. Let's go on a date with me.

657
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:04,856
I guess you're Han Segye's boyfriend.

658
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:06,157
Right now?

659
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,159
The weather is so good.

660
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,261
I'll pick you up. Just wait for me.

661
00:43:02,856 --> 00:43:04,348
Are you okay?

662
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:05,850
Hold on a minute.

663
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,653
I'm sorry.

664
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:11,956
Walk slowly.

665
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,364
Walk slowly.

666
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:22,567
Here you go.

667
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:24,735
You're okay, right?

668
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:27,138
Please be careful.

669
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,440
Excuse me, miss.

670
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,576
What's your name?

671
00:43:31,661 --> 00:43:34,363
I'm just very thankful to you.

672
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:37,515
My name is Han Segye.

673
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,716
What did you say?

674
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,819
My name is Han Segye, ma'am.

675
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,721
It's Han Segye.

676
00:43:44,483 --> 00:43:47,091
Thank you, Han Segye.

677
00:44:03,232 --> 00:44:04,632
Why me?

678
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,713
Why does it have to be me?

679
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:14,185
For so long, I resented it.

680
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,189
It's been a honor to be with you.

681
00:44:20,172 --> 00:44:21,364
The honor is mine.

682
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,702
Only now...

683
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:36,207
...I realize that what I resented was
my different selves.

684
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:43,948
The fate has always been
teaching me a lesson.

685
00:44:45,244 --> 00:44:46,350
That...

686
00:44:47,943 --> 00:44:49,554
...it has to be me.

687
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:55,259
The many faces will surely come to me.

688
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,929
That they will be useful for me.

689
00:45:01,454 --> 00:45:02,633
Therefore,

690
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,336
just love for now.

691
00:45:36,481 --> 00:45:37,501
To love myself.

692
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:40,204
As well as...

693
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,307
...you.

694
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:27,184
I heard that your ideal type
is a woman wearing red dress?

695
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,086
So, I specially prepared this for you.

696
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:34,358
Are you really going
to wear that to Cannes?

697
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:35,359
Yes.

698
00:46:38,553 --> 00:46:40,264
Why? Is it weird?

699
00:46:41,624 --> 00:46:44,335
This won't do.
I need to buy a flight ticket too.

700
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,539
It's too dangerous right now.

701
00:46:49,834 --> 00:46:54,045
It's going to be globally dangerous if
you wear this dress.

702
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:55,746
To that extend?

703
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:59,550
Gosh, I'm such a bad person.

704
00:46:59,744 --> 00:47:01,152
You sinful woman.

705
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:04,855
Is the dress uncomfortable?

706
00:47:04,983 --> 00:47:07,653
No, it's not that uncomfortable. Why?

707
00:47:07,753 --> 00:47:09,860
Because I want to take you
somewhere in that dress.

708
00:47:25,303 --> 00:47:26,711
What is all this?

709
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:29,704
When did you prepare this? Why?

710
00:47:29,814 --> 00:47:31,115
To make a promise.

711
00:47:32,213 --> 00:47:35,986
I feel like something will happen
if you wear that to Cannes.

712
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,196
You can run if you don't want to do it.

713
00:48:35,903 --> 00:48:39,116
It's your last chance to run away.

714
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:41,414
I won't run away.

715
00:48:42,414 --> 00:48:43,921
I can't run away.

716
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,423
I'm glad to hear that.

717
00:49:11,443 --> 00:49:13,651
If we're going to make a promise,

718
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:16,053
aren't we supposed to say something?

719
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:22,259
-Here I go.
-Okay, go ahead.

720
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:26,063
Are you confident?

721
00:49:27,954 --> 00:49:29,533
To grow old together.

722
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:32,536
Even when you wake up young one day?

723
00:49:33,455 --> 00:49:35,473
Are you confident you'll stay with me?

724
00:49:38,147 --> 00:49:40,277
And even if you suddenly became old too,

725
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,582
are you confident that
you won't give up on yourself?

726
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:49,086
Yes, I'm confident.

727
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,690
I'm confident, so put it on.

728
00:50:10,903 --> 00:50:12,810
I'll buy the real ones.

729
00:50:15,913 --> 00:50:18,916
Even if it's just a promise,
we need to do everything well.

730
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,520
We need to go on a honeymoon.

731
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:37,621
Let's...

732
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,824
...breakup.

733
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:43,906
Please...

734
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,630
...leave me.

735
00:52:57,824 --> 00:52:59,543
I hate Seo Dojae.

736
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,747
Ever since we first met.

737
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:06,250
Even on our second meeting.

738
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:08,652
Always.

739
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:10,754
Always that way.

740
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:12,556
Why does it...

741
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,259
...sound like a confession to me?

742
00:53:29,914 --> 00:53:31,508
We've already gone through this.

743
00:53:32,229 --> 00:53:35,012
Bet your life on me.

744
00:53:50,284 --> 00:53:51,695
Do you remember?

745
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:53,664
What?

746
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:56,567
When we were at my house,

747
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,571
I asked you who is it in the photo?

748
00:54:04,662 --> 00:54:05,676
Who is it?

749
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,845
Which of them is me?

750
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:11,148
Over here.

751
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,350
I was really curious.

752
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,452
How did you guess it?

753
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:18,155
It was nothing.

754
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:27,431
I went out, and there was a
photo of you in the same dress.

755
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:30,934
Unbelievable!

756
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:33,036
I couldn't even think of that.

757
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,030
Then, what about in the elevator?

758
00:54:35,729 --> 00:54:38,522
Do you have anything to say, Han Segye?

759
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:39,810
Well, for that one...

760
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:43,247
-I just guessed it.
-Really?

761
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:45,349
You seemed fishy.

762
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:50,354
You were the only one who would
act fishy around me back then.

763
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:54,658
I thought that it must be you
in such a dramatic situation.

764
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:57,961
-What if you were wrong?
-I can just apologize.

765
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:00,161
-Was it that simple?
-What else can they do?

766
00:55:00,245 --> 00:55:03,133
I'm Seo Dojae and that's my company.

767
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:05,530
Gosh, seriously.

768
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:07,938
What a scammer!

769
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,941
What do you mean by scammer?
It's destiny.

770
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,148
I have something to ask you too.

771
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,619
Why didn't you return my handkerchief?

772
00:55:28,987 --> 00:55:30,928
Here. Use this.

773
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:35,632
At the hospital, at the alley,
and in front of your house.

774
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,302
I gave you three of my handkerchief.

775
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:40,504
Have you been keeping count?

776
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:42,606
It was very expensive.

777
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,576
No, I won't return it to you.

778
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:09,833
Han Segye.

779
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:15,038
Yes?

780
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:17,241
I love you.

781
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,409
I love you too.

782
00:58:04,946 --> 00:58:07,584
By the way, will it be fine during Cannes?

783
00:58:09,272 --> 00:58:10,473
Won't you change that day?

784
00:58:10,568 --> 00:58:12,055
I think it's going to be fine.

785
00:58:12,255 --> 00:58:15,476
It's been weird these days.
It changes on it's own.

786
00:58:15,577 --> 00:58:18,295
Sometimes it's once every two months,
then it would be three months.

787
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:24,067
Won't I suddenly just not change at all?

788
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,869
It's not totally impossible.

789
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:28,972
Something that happen suddenly,
can disappear suddenly too.

790
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:30,073
Is it done?

791
00:58:41,793 --> 00:58:44,788
-It's the end of...
-It's the end of...

792
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:46,390
-...today's Han Segye's.
-...today's Seo Dojae.

793
01:02:06,135 --> 01:02:07,224
I love you.

794
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:08,959
I love you too.

795
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:12,462
