1
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,601
Mr. Seo.

2
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:14,348
What is it?

3
00:00:15,152 --> 00:00:16,344
Are you going to be busy later on?

4
00:00:17,414 --> 00:00:19,472
No, I'm not so busy.

5
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:20,463
Good.

6
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:22,490
Then...

7
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:24,855
...sleep with me later.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,833
What?

9
00:00:30,674 --> 00:00:32,191
Sleep with me.

10
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:39,365
Why...

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,046
...should I...

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,330
...sleep with you, Mr. Seo?

13
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:51,918
-I've been thinking...
-And?

14
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:53,887
That time, on the plane...

15
00:00:54,294 --> 00:00:56,004
-It happened while you were sleeping.
-Yes.

16
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,651
-That's why.
-That's why, what?

17
00:00:57,736 --> 00:00:59,615
I just don't get it no matter
how much I think about it.

18
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:01,649
No, I do get it...

19
00:01:03,826 --> 00:01:05,610
To be exact...

20
00:01:06,628 --> 00:01:09,397
...there's no other
possible explanation to it.

21
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,607
So I want to see it for myself
when you change.

22
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:24,475
I was wondering what that meant.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,441
I almost called the police just now.

24
00:01:27,827 --> 00:01:30,457
You're a chief. You should add
some context to what you say.

25
00:01:30,764 --> 00:01:32,394
If my face changes every time I sleep...

26
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,587
...does that mean I dozed off
at the film award?

27
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:35,511
You didn't?

28
00:01:37,907 --> 00:01:40,076
I didn't think you were so simple-minded.

29
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:43,327
But I'm proud of you
for trying to understand.

30
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:44,886
It was an opportunity to be honest.

31
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:46,803
I couldn't pass up that opportunity.

32
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:52,440
I want to be sure that you're not
fooling me and that I'm not crazy.

33
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:54,684
I'm afraid too.

34
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:03,535
It's a confirmation stating
that you no longer owe any debt.

35
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:07,377
So that means there will be
no charge or news release...

36
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:13,481
...exposing that the 100 million won was
actually donated by your chief, right?

37
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,073
(Payer: Han Segye)

38
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:23,376
I'm speechless.

39
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:24,915
Any problem?

40
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,493
You got her name wrong. It's "Han Segye."

41
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:31,210
It's not "gae," but "Gye."

42
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:32,457
Oh...

43
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:34,466
-Oh?
-I gave you the wrong copy.

44
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:53,553
-Mr. Jung...
-"Gye." It's correct, isn't it?

45
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:58,436
The letter before that.

46
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:04,059
It's not "Sae" as in
"puppy" or "goatling."

47
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,622
It's "Se" as in "three meals a day,"
"you little punk"...

48
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:10,222
Oh wait. "Sae" is correct in this case.

49
00:03:11,263 --> 00:03:13,255
Anyway, it should be "Se."

50
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:28,751
Pick one.

51
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:30,562
Ms. Yoo just left.

52
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,245
I'll rephrase.

53
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:35,399
Since you're not busy,
I need you to come with me.

54
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:38,051
-To where?
-Ms. Yoo will be here soon.

55
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:39,209
First, I want your answer.

56
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,242
Go ahead and call the police if you want.

57
00:03:41,327 --> 00:03:42,684
Or come with me.

58
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:58,705
Look at you acting all cool.

59
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,004
After all that denial.

60
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:04,212
Serves you right.

61
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,421
What are you doing?

62
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:07,062
I'm packing.

63
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,979
You are really something else.

64
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:11,323
What are you standing around for?

65
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:12,757
You leave me no choice but to help you.

66
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:15,455
-I can hear you.
-"I can hear you."

67
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:16,822
Of course I wanted you to hear that.

68
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:21,499
The technical term
for this is "stage whisper."

69
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:26,065
I'm so ticked off. Why am I so nice?
Nobody knows that I'm nice.

70
00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:28,495
I do know.

71
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,472
Now I know that you are nice.

72
00:04:33,254 --> 00:04:35,813
You realize that now? I'm nice by nature.

73
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,566
Did you get home okay that day?

74
00:05:07,214 --> 00:05:08,238
When?

75
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,085
You mean when I almost got hit
by a car and fell down?

76
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,280
That day when my arm was bleeding
but someone just left without goodbye?

77
00:05:18,962 --> 00:05:20,314
Is your arm okay?

78
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,475
You had a band-aid on earlier.

79
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,408
No, I wasn't okay.

80
00:05:24,492 --> 00:05:27,504
I scraped my elbow and there was
like a liter of blood running out.

81
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:32,467
If a band-aid was enough to stop a liter
of blood, you must heal very fast.

82
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:35,034
Or was it a good band-aid?

83
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:42,708
(Yoo Woomi)

84
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:49,123
What do you think you're doing?
That's my phone.

85
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,788
(Secretary Jung)

86
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:00,736
Now we're even, right?

87
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:04,871
We are now.

88
00:06:19,183 --> 00:06:20,914
This is ridiculous.

89
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:24,593
Hey, Segye?

90
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:26,501
Where is she?

91
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:32,206
Han Segye that witch...

92
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:33,941
Did you look under the seat?

93
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:36,607
She could have turned into a baby.

94
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:39,155
No! Do you think I'm an idiot?

95
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:40,841
That's good.

96
00:06:42,806 --> 00:06:44,287
Or maybe it's not good?

97
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:47,723
Anyway, I don't know where she is.
Try looking for her somewhere else.

98
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,640
Hey!

99
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:50,261
Hey, hey!

100
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,949
Where did she go?

101
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,391
I'm sorry. I'll go again.

102
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:05,378
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit...

103
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,228
...Amen.

104
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:10,746
Put your faith in the grace
and mercy of the Lord...

105
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,492
...repent of your sins and confess
everything honestly.

106
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:17,733
I'm telling lies to my mom.

107
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:20,698
Even the word "seminary" upsets her.

108
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:23,510
I couldn't dare to tell her the truth.

109
00:07:24,472 --> 00:07:26,536
Both the Lord and my mother...

110
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:29,741
...are calling me towards their way.

111
00:07:30,227 --> 00:07:31,856
Where should I go?

112
00:07:32,176 --> 00:07:33,637
There are too many places...

113
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:35,593
...that are calling for me.

114
00:07:35,677 --> 00:07:38,732
The Lord never shows you the wrong path.

115
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:41,737
Wherever you go,
the Lord will always be with you.

116
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:42,796
Of course.

117
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:44,391
Amen.

118
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:55,709
I must head to a place
that's calling for me.

119
00:07:56,187 --> 00:07:57,092
Where?

120
00:07:57,456 --> 00:07:58,576
My part time job.

121
00:07:59,922 --> 00:08:04,290
The Lord has forgiven your sins.
You may leave in peace.

122
00:08:06,424 --> 00:08:07,400
Thank you.

123
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,093
(Confessional)

124
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:44,907
You brought me here?

125
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,277
It's simple.

126
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:48,533
People keep looking for you
because you hide.

127
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:51,210
But above all...

128
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,111
...I'm in charge here.

129
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:58,323
But still, it's too public.

130
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:21,473
Hey, Mr. Jung.

131
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:23,779
I'm heading to my office now.

132
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,266
Right, a memorial is important.

133
00:09:26,874 --> 00:09:30,218
I'll wrap up the contract
with Ms. Han. Don't worry.

134
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:31,748
All right.

135
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:44,576
Did you bring your seal?

136
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,295
My seal?

137
00:09:58,343 --> 00:10:01,966
Can't I just put my signature?

138
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:05,130
It's a pretty big contract.

139
00:10:05,214 --> 00:10:07,135
Which is why I brought you here.

140
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,991
Right, it is a big contract.

141
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:14,330
Can I put a big signature?

142
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:27,594
Yes, Mr. Jung. I I told you it's okay.

143
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:32,352
Ms. Han will leave right after
she signs the contract.

144
00:10:32,895 --> 00:10:35,406
Right, she forgot her seal.

145
00:10:36,275 --> 00:10:39,258
Don't worry about it.
Just do your thing at the memorial.

146
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:46,022
You can't act at all.
Or maybe you're incapable of lying.

147
00:10:46,107 --> 00:10:50,454
You know very well that I'm a good liar.

148
00:10:50,538 --> 00:10:53,708
You're bad at lying.
Which is why I'm here.

149
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:55,556
That's exactly what I want to say.

150
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:00,864
So...

151
00:11:02,257 --> 00:11:04,469
Let's pick up where we left off.

152
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:07,604
You want to...

153
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:09,996
...sleep with me, right?

154
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:11,573
Eventually, yes.

155
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:13,567
I want to get to know you.

156
00:11:14,685 --> 00:11:16,443
But you said sleeping
doesn't trigger the change.

157
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:18,366
I never said that I don't change
when I sleep either.

158
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:22,660
It happens once a month on a relatively
regular basis and lasts about a week.

159
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:24,922
Sometimes when I'm asleep,
sometimes right after I wake up.

160
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:26,423
It's unpredictable.

161
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:27,960
Without any kind of sign?

162
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:29,343
I can tell from my mood.

163
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:33,225
If it’s time and I feel a little strange,
then it happens most of the time.

164
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,125
Sometimes it doesn't happen.

165
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:37,205
It's random and it's irritating.

166
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:39,951
Then it's simpler than I thought.

167
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:42,278
We just have to stay
together at all times.

168
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,394
From the moment we wake up
until we fall asleep.

169
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,545
How do you expect me to trust you?

170
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:50,536
What if you change your words again?

171
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:51,911
Let's make a contract.

172
00:11:52,226 --> 00:11:56,249
For you to get to know me
before you decide to sleep with me.

173
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:02,851
What...?

174
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,262
(Confidentiality Agreement)

175
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,363
If you can't trust me,
then trust the contract.

176
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:16,469
Documents are more reliable than people.

177
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:18,185
I know that better than anyone else.

178
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:22,055
Write the contract and I'll
share my weaknesses.

179
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,931
And then, it'll be your turn.

180
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:25,093
You still don't trust me?

181
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:28,023
Hold on. I need to think about this.

182
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:31,823
I've already thought through everything.
You just need to sign.

183
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:34,506
-What's the rush?
-You might run away.

184
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:37,523
You like running away
at the most critical moment.

185
00:12:38,996 --> 00:12:42,473
Didn't I tell you that I don't
run away because I want to?

186
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,798
I'm not running away.

187
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:48,387
That's good.

188
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:49,746
Then...

189
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,239
...shall we start
with "No running away"?

190
00:12:54,898 --> 00:12:55,731
"One."

191
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:59,577
"No running away."

192
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,239
"Two."

193
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:05,780
"All secrets must be kept."

194
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:11,171
With that being said, please change
my name saved on your phone.

195
00:13:11,426 --> 00:13:12,775
And also the passcode.

196
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:16,763
Isn't "1004" too old-fashioned?

197
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,875
Who cares? It's easy to remember.

198
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:21,601
And it's true that I'm like an angel.

199
00:13:22,073 --> 00:13:23,943
It's also easy to remember for strangers.

200
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:28,691
Choose a passcode that has nothing
to do with an angelic person like you.

201
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:32,110
When's your birthday?

202
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,612
-January 16th.
-"0116" sounds good.

203
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:36,595
It has absolutely nothing to do with me.

204
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:37,945
As you wish.

205
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,792
"Three."

206
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:41,699
"Calls must be answered
within three seconds."

207
00:13:41,784 --> 00:13:43,564
That's ridiculous.
I'm a very busy person.

208
00:13:43,653 --> 00:13:45,170
And do you think I have a lot of time?

209
00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:47,492
And finally, "Four."

210
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,963
"When the business relationship
between the two of us is over"…

211
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,998
..."this contract will be terminated."

212
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:58,805
Let’s decide on the details
of our bed-sharing...

213
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,007
...after you learn all of my weaknesses.

214
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,209
(Confidentiality Agreement)

215
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:08,590
After...

216
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,218
...you decide to trust me.

217
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,166
Why are we the only ones
on field duty all the time?

218
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:18,383
I feel like dying.

219
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:20,908
I can't even go home
and there's no glory...

220
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,944
...in the life of a salary worker.

221
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,625
Anyway, isn't Han Segye so pretty?

222
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,967
Indeed. She is pretty.

223
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:30,144
She's not that pretty.

224
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:32,539
My gosh. Are you jealous?

225
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:34,965
Of course you are.
She is prettier than you.

226
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,871
What? Why do I have to be pretty?

227
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:42,529
It's actually good if a man's pretty.
You're so old-fashioned.

228
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:44,711
Is that Han Segye over there?
Who's prettier than you?

229
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:47,094
Why do you keep saying that she's
prettier than me...

230
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:48,702
Han Se... Han Segye!

231
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:51,328
My gosh. Han Segye...

232
00:14:55,577 --> 00:14:58,515
Your staffs are back.
Why don't you draw the blinds?

233
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:01,556
I'm keeping them open on purpose.

234
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:07,217
Why? Because we might looks suspicious?

235
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:10,830
What's wrong with looking suspicious?

236
00:15:13,623 --> 00:15:15,256
Are you okay with looking suspicious?

237
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:16,815
Nope.

238
00:15:19,412 --> 00:15:20,913
Then let's stop looking suspicious.

239
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:22,408
Go home.

240
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:25,300
I'll call you when
the next schedule is set.

241
00:15:25,753 --> 00:15:27,403
You're telling me to leave?

242
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:30,055
Take the documents and take
some time to think it over.

243
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:32,984
Please try to give me an answer
before your next outbreak.

244
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:36,018
Are you serious right now?
It's just me and I didn't bring my car.

245
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,202
After you sign the contract,
please send it by express delivery.

246
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:40,408
It'll look suspicious if we meet.

247
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:47,535
All right, then, goodbye.

248
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:09,158
I expect to hear good news from you.

249
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:10,769
Ms. Han Segye.

250
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:38,202
I'm so busy by myself today because
my manager's at a memorial.

251
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:42,568
What time's the next meeting?
Is it 7 PM or 8 PM...?

252
00:16:46,976 --> 00:16:49,262
What a busy day.

253
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:53,646
She is beautiful.

254
00:16:55,485 --> 00:16:57,876
She came by herself because
her manager's at a memorial.

255
00:16:57,978 --> 00:16:58,950
Right.

256
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:02,921
There's no other reason for him to bring
her to this company full of people...

257
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:04,716
...only to make her leave by herself.

258
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,855
She sure is pretty, though.

259
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:08,077
She's prettier than you, Mr. Lee.

260
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,604
I wish I could live with that face
just for one day.

261
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:12,710
Gosh, she's even pretty from the back.

262
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:15,752
Go home if there's no work.

263
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:19,187
Even if there's work to do...

264
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:21,792
...just go home.

265
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,542
Is that Han Segye? Han Segye!

266
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,657
Oh my gosh!

267
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:41,932
Yeah. That's me every single day.

268
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:43,953
When I open the waiting room...

269
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:47,400
...or the van's door,
or the Internet.

270
00:17:47,563 --> 00:17:48,943
"Oh my gosh..."

271
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,458
"Where the hell did she run off to again?"

272
00:17:52,816 --> 00:17:55,153
-Woomi.
-Let's terminate our contract.

273
00:17:56,172 --> 00:17:58,188
I can't take this anymore.

274
00:17:58,605 --> 00:17:59,603
Hold on.

275
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,391
I ask for a peace talk over tteokbokki
before you get angry.

276
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,417
Spicy tteokbokki?

277
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:21,804
So... You were with that guy
all this time?

278
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,521
Did he apologize?

279
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:26,039
Did he say thank you?

280
00:18:26,124 --> 00:18:27,711
Well, something like that.

281
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:32,319
By the way, what does a man really mean...

282
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:34,764
...when he asks you to sleep with him?

283
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,683
Is it just something they say
without giving it a thought?

284
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,509
That prick asked you to sleep with him?

285
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:42,569
No...

286
00:18:45,202 --> 00:18:46,193
It's just...

287
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:48,055
I was...

288
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:52,384
I was just curious if something
like that can be said so easily...

289
00:18:52,469 --> 00:18:53,866
...so I asked.

290
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:55,612
That's good. Just sleep with him.

291
00:18:55,697 --> 00:18:56,702
What?

292
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,487
You're not at that age
where you save yourself.

293
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:02,420
What does age have to do with saving?

294
00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:03,681
It does.

295
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:06,673
When you get older,
you can't save even if you want to.

296
00:19:06,758 --> 00:19:08,280
Because there will be nothing left.

297
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:09,882
Use those assets
when you still have them.

298
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,424
It's not like that.

299
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:14,320
Have lots of fun while you still can.

300
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:16,317
There's no time like the present.

301
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:17,867
I told you, it's not like that.

302
00:19:17,952 --> 00:19:20,664
If it's not like that, then what?

303
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:25,172
I'm going to take some time off
to think about that.

304
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:27,309
That's a good idea.

305
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:31,492
Take some time off no matter what.
Don't run off again, okay?

306
00:19:31,576 --> 00:19:32,555
I got it.

307
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,796
Yeah?

308
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,059
Okay...

309
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,690
(A Relationship and Not Marriage)

310
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:58,277
He's so bad.

311
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:00,333
Did he really..

312
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:02,941
...have to say it like that?

313
00:20:03,692 --> 00:20:04,870
"Sleep with me."

314
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:10,752
My heart almost sank.

315
00:20:19,648 --> 00:20:22,221
One. No running away.

316
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,275
You always run away when I ask questions.

317
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:30,056
"No running away from questions either."

318
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:34,853
"Two. All secrets must be kept."

319
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,413
"Accept retaliation
for failing to keep secrets."

320
00:20:41,668 --> 00:20:43,705
I'm risking my life.

321
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:45,485
Of course there should be retaliation.

322
00:20:45,573 --> 00:20:46,406
Pardon?

323
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:50,590
I'm going over my lines.

324
00:20:52,645 --> 00:20:54,221
Yeah, it turned out to be like that.

325
00:20:55,345 --> 00:20:56,826
It used to be your...

326
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:24,983
(Wrong passcode)

327
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:37,160
Seo Dojerk.

328
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:42,187
Uncle.

329
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,304
(Uncle)

330
00:21:59,163 --> 00:22:00,719
Three seconds? Yeah right.

331
00:22:01,202 --> 00:22:02,721
You didn't even call me.

332
00:22:07,203 --> 00:22:09,495
Calls must be answered
as fast as possible.

333
00:22:14,998 --> 00:22:16,235
Calls are a must.

334
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,850
Respond to calls actively and show
a cooperative attitude

335
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:22,241
Four.

336
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,154
"When the business relationship
between the two of us is over"…

337
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:27,203
..."this contract will be terminated."

338
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:34,119
Forget every detail in the contract
as soon as it's terminated.

339
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:45,968
Delivery for you.

340
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:47,981
From whom?

341
00:22:49,145 --> 00:22:50,422
(Sender: Auntie)

342
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:51,492
"Auntie"?

343
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:54,082
Is your aunt also coming
to your family gathering?

344
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:01,180
(Confidentiality Agreement)

345
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,304
Check all the plants.

346
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,530
(Prof. Kang Daeshik)

347
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,561
28.

348
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,749
The red ones here...

349
00:23:27,944 --> 00:23:32,028
Just like how viruses are injected
to develop a vaccine...

350
00:23:32,174 --> 00:23:34,431
...we used crop protectant.

351
00:23:35,072 --> 00:23:37,578
18, 23...

352
00:23:42,518 --> 00:23:44,268
Gosh, look at the time.

353
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,292
Give me all of them.

354
00:23:58,377 --> 00:24:00,236
Could you please wait a moment?

355
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:02,341
No. I don't have time.

356
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:04,301
Please give them to this lady
after you wrap them up.

357
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:05,640
I'll take a look around upstairs.

358
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:06,558
Yes, Ms. Kang.

359
00:24:26,186 --> 00:24:27,128
Are you following me?

360
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:29,698
No. I just wanted you try this sample.

361
00:24:29,783 --> 00:24:31,249
It's a new perfume.

362
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:33,850
Why do you keep showing up?

363
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,219
To be exact, you showed up at my work.

364
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:41,341
So you're saying that I'm following you?

365
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:44,110
It's okay. I've been through that a lot.

366
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:45,751
Since you showed up...

367
00:24:46,467 --> 00:24:47,419
...take it.

368
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:49,488
I hope you enjoy your shopping.

369
00:24:57,084 --> 00:24:58,530
It's a new perfume.

370
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,404
Please try a sample.

371
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,474
Thank you.

372
00:25:04,232 --> 00:25:05,604
It's a new perfume.

373
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:08,045
Please try a sample. Thank you.

374
00:25:09,198 --> 00:25:11,057
The staffs are badly trained here.

375
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:12,189
Try a sample.

376
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:16,050
And it doesn't suit my taste.

377
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:18,617
Thank you.

378
00:25:47,552 --> 00:25:51,619
When it comes to pork belly...

379
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:56,294
...the whole family should eat
together like this.

380
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:58,886
Okay, let's eat.

381
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,678
This is too extravagant.

382
00:26:04,383 --> 00:26:05,983
-What?
-Don't you think so?

383
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:08,667
We could have just eaten
at a barbecue place.

384
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:11,407
All these first-class chefs and helpers.

385
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,168
I feel so beholden by their troubles.

386
00:26:16,957 --> 00:26:20,765
He's just happy that the whole family's
eating comfort food together...

387
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,430
...after such a long time.

388
00:26:22,923 --> 00:26:26,016
You know that's his own way
of expressing joy, Dad.

389
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:28,387
You snotty jerk.

390
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:31,965
It's delicious, Grandpa.

391
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,336
Oh really?

392
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:35,211
Eat up.

393
00:26:37,324 --> 00:26:40,844
Aren't you making her work too much?

394
00:26:40,928 --> 00:26:43,135
She looks so thin in the face.

395
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:47,239
I'm just motivated to work.
It's not Mother's fault.

396
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:55,022
Professor Kang grew these himself.
Have some.

397
00:26:56,004 --> 00:26:57,015
Is that right?

398
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:03,654
It's pretty good.

399
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,459
It's a good run for my money.

400
00:27:08,242 --> 00:27:10,590
Was it "Smart Farm"?

401
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:13,067
Where my donation was used?

402
00:27:13,152 --> 00:27:16,878
Yes. My students can focus
on their research thanks to you.

403
00:27:17,397 --> 00:27:18,928
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Chairman.

404
00:27:19,026 --> 00:27:22,183
There you go again with "Mr. Chairman."

405
00:27:22,268 --> 00:27:26,047
When will you start treating me
like your father-in-law?

406
00:27:26,132 --> 00:27:29,376
I gave you all that money
and you still can't call me "Father"?

407
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,794
He's like that by nature.
You like him for that.

408
00:27:34,878 --> 00:27:38,357
That's why I want him to call me "Father."

409
00:27:40,295 --> 00:27:43,284
What about you?
How did things go with that model?

410
00:27:44,652 --> 00:27:47,406
Why do you always talk about
models when you see me?

411
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:52,866
Then what else should I talk about?
Shall we talk about business?

412
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:56,682
You couldn't even handle one guest
at the launch ceremony.

413
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,430
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

414
00:28:00,698 --> 00:28:07,307
If it weren't for that model,
you would've been humiliated.

415
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,723
You haven't heard about
the joint mileage agreement...

416
00:28:11,808 --> 00:28:14,448
...between T'road Airlines
and Dashi Tour, right?

417
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:16,662
Dojae worked hard on that.

418
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:18,192
What did he do?

419
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:22,141
If he failed, Sara would have done it.

420
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:26,095
Does One Air even have a plane
big enough to fly there?

421
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,924
I was saving this for later.

422
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:35,026
But I'll just say it now
while we're at it.

423
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:40,589
We got a 50 billion won airplane
from an auction at half the price.

424
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:45,918
Did you hear that?
She's a professional at saving money.

425
00:28:46,003 --> 00:28:47,436
What about the certificate
of airworthiness?

426
00:28:47,969 --> 00:28:48,825
Done.

427
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:51,371
It was issued right away.

428
00:28:51,658 --> 00:28:54,703
The plane's still strong
just like Grandpa.

429
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:56,296
And the slots?

430
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,294
I'll take some from T' Road.

431
00:29:00,588 --> 00:29:03,378
I can't have flights going to
vacation spots take off at dawn.

432
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:07,089
Right. Not everyone can handle a red-eye.

433
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:10,195
How could you say something so mean?

434
00:29:10,323 --> 00:29:12,166
We have veteran pilots.

435
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,954
No doubt. You've recruited them
from our company.

436
00:29:16,412 --> 00:29:20,079
I'm not concerned about the pilots.
I'm concerned about the in-flight service.

437
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:24,029
My brother's so concerned about me.

438
00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:26,714
Thank you, Brother.

439
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:29,201
I should be thanking you.

440
00:29:29,823 --> 00:29:32,077
I got to learn about the joy of giving.

441
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:35,278
Since I'm always giving things to One Air.

442
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:46,430
Speaking of joy of giving...

443
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:54,974
This one's for Grandpa.

444
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:57,546
This one's for you, Mother.

445
00:29:58,126 --> 00:29:59,917
And this one's for you, Dad.

446
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,005
I thought I should practice
the deed of giving.

447
00:30:04,273 --> 00:30:05,243
Oh, my...

448
00:30:05,328 --> 00:30:07,912
You really shouldn't have.

449
00:30:07,997 --> 00:30:08,847
Thank you.

450
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,067
And...

451
00:30:16,411 --> 00:30:17,396
...this one's for Dojae.

452
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,515
You like fish.

453
00:30:25,086 --> 00:30:26,825
Please don't kill it.

454
00:30:31,732 --> 00:30:36,617
Since I'm done eating, got a gift
and had a little chat...

455
00:30:37,077 --> 00:30:38,199
...I'll be on my way now.

456
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:41,173
-Why are you leaving so soon?
-This guy will die soon like this.

457
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:43,024
She asked me not to kill it.

458
00:30:43,532 --> 00:30:47,312
When you go out,
take one of the cars in the front.

459
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,083
I didn't even get to ride
the last one ten times.

460
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:53,518
Did you buy more cars
just for kicks again?

461
00:30:54,074 --> 00:30:57,481
The car dealer was so pleasant.

462
00:30:57,566 --> 00:31:00,895
I couldn't just buy one.
My manhood was at stake.

463
00:31:00,979 --> 00:31:03,854
What's the point of making money
when you waste it like this.

464
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:06,865
You little shit!

465
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:11,481
Scram already. You killed my appetite.

466
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,981
Leave him be.
Dad's mood changes every minute.

467
00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:20,331
I'll see Dojae out
and take a walk as well.

468
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:21,847
I'm so full.

469
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:24,783
Son, shall we go for a walk?

470
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:42,251
Do you have to be like that?

471
00:31:42,613 --> 00:31:44,265
-What?
-Must you really...

472
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:47,788
Never mind. Just eat.

473
00:31:50,328 --> 00:31:51,161
Why?

474
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:55,787
Does it bother you to see me
act up in someone else's family?

475
00:31:57,811 --> 00:31:58,499
Kang Sara!

476
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,492
You're happy living
with the woman you love, right?

477
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:05,991
It's been 10 years since I came
into this house as your baggage.

478
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:14,274
It's my own way of being a member...

479
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:17,030
...of a family that I'm not
actually related to.

480
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,200
So just let me be.

481
00:32:21,462 --> 00:32:22,806
Sara...

482
00:32:23,815 --> 00:32:29,948
You don't have to beat your family
or seek approval from them.

483
00:32:30,322 --> 00:32:31,783
Then that's not family.

484
00:32:37,132 --> 00:32:38,256
Was it amusing for you?

485
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:40,742
Of course it was amusing.

486
00:32:41,337 --> 00:32:45,432
I haven't seen you try so hard
not to lose in a long time.

487
00:32:46,468 --> 00:32:50,749
You and Grandpa both have
have a meanstreak.

488
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:54,143
You have no idea how hard I try everyday.

489
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,852
Why wouldn't I know that?

490
00:32:57,997 --> 00:33:00,979
But you have to be patient
and put up with it.

491
00:33:03,263 --> 00:33:05,714
Are you happy with your new husband?

492
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:09,988
I am happy.

493
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:15,947
Your father was always busy loving
his sculptures and pottery instead of me.

494
00:33:16,563 --> 00:33:22,127
He even gave his favorite porcelain
to you instead of me.

495
00:33:22,808 --> 00:33:25,871
I give zero points
to your father as a husband.

496
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:28,507
He gets zero points as a father, too.

497
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:32,004
After neglecting his son all his life...

498
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:34,250
...he tried to make it up
with a porcelain.

499
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:38,137
And it was a Joseon white porcelain.

(Party A: Seo Dojae,
Party B: Han Segye)

502
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:03,075
We’ve invited the top star, Han Segye,
to “Entertainment Inside.”

503
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,141
-Hello, Ms. Han.
-Hello.

504
00:34:05,225 --> 00:34:07,479
Please say a word to our viewers.

505
00:34:07,632 --> 00:34:11,414
I've always wanted to return
the love you've given me.

506
00:34:11,499 --> 00:34:15,554
I'm happy for the opportunity today.

507
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:21,481
The fans will be most happy to hear
about your next film project.

508
00:34:21,566 --> 00:34:25,565
Are you planning to impress
everyone in a new movie?

509
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:28,289
I'm waiting for something good
to come up.

510
00:34:28,374 --> 00:34:31,334
But, from what we've heard...

511
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:34,691
...you'll appear in Director Lee Heesub's
first movie project in more than 10 years.

512
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:35,609
Is that true?

513
00:34:36,729 --> 00:34:37,308
Pardon?

514
00:34:37,566 --> 00:34:40,025
You made your debut
in Director Lee's “Okjeong”...

515
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:44,521
...and became famous
for being his persona.

516
00:34:44,606 --> 00:34:48,239
You must be so excited
to see him again after 10 years.

517
00:34:48,324 --> 00:34:49,757
Oh, yes...

518
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:53,713
We look forward to see a maestro and
a great movie star work together.

519
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:54,993
Thank you.

520
00:34:58,111 --> 00:35:00,360
-Good job, everyone.
-Good job.

521
00:35:00,445 --> 00:35:02,772
-Good job.
-Thank you.

522
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,088
Did Director Lee make a return?

523
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,006
What?

524
00:35:09,558 --> 00:35:10,391
Yeah.

525
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,292
Why didn't you tell me?

526
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,756
I had to keep it from you.

527
00:35:15,386 --> 00:35:16,948
Call Director Lee.

528
00:35:17,234 --> 00:35:20,133
Segye, there are many other projects.

529
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,153
Call him.

530
00:35:22,427 --> 00:35:24,522
I did call him.

531
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:27,906
He said he doesn't want to see you.

532
00:35:34,254 --> 00:35:36,155
What's the point of putting
that one in there?

533
00:35:36,691 --> 00:35:38,347
You can recognize it right away.

534
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:41,181
It was from Sara.

535
00:35:43,966 --> 00:35:46,011
Did you check for bombs
and bugging device?

536
00:35:46,543 --> 00:35:48,652
Sorry to say I didn't.

537
00:35:50,052 --> 00:35:51,873
Just to be clear...

538
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,871
...will I be compensated
if something happens to me?

539
00:35:54,003 --> 00:35:54,836
No.

540
00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:58,808
Don't you even think about
letting something happen to you.

541
00:36:03,389 --> 00:36:05,196
What are you going to name that one?

542
00:36:06,305 --> 00:36:07,161
Not sure.

543
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,481
I should've put a bug in that fish.

544
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,778
Ms. Kang Sara's inside, right?

545
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:33,682
-No, you can't just go in.
-Express delivery, Ms. Kang!

546
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:37,454
Wait, you can just give it to me.
I will give it to her.

547
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:40,799
I can't. I was told to give
this to her directly.

548
00:36:42,922 --> 00:36:45,683
I'm Kang Sara. That's mine.

549
00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:47,364
Then please show me your ID.

550
00:36:49,348 --> 00:36:51,142
Well...

551
00:36:51,227 --> 00:36:52,146
Your ID card.

552
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,435
Sir, you can't just go in like that.

553
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,350
I'm sorry.

554
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:01,861
I'm sorry.

555
00:37:02,703 --> 00:37:03,866
What brings you to my office?

556
00:37:03,951 --> 00:37:07,796
Express delivery. I was told
to give this to you directly.

557
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:13,483
Leaving it to my secretary
is just like giving it to me.

558
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:17,258
Do you lack flexibility
or are you good at your job?

559
00:37:19,096 --> 00:37:20,138
Put it over there.

560
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:21,542
First, I need to check your ID.

561
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,244
If you want this, you must show
me an ID with your name on it.

562
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,013
That's how the procedure is.

563
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,891
Happy now? Leave the package and go.

564
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,394
(Identification Card, Kang Sara)

565
00:37:44,207 --> 00:37:45,143
So you're older.

566
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,576
Are you really following me?

567
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:03,982
It may seem like that,
but this is really a mere coincidence.

568
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:08,019
Your signature, please.

569
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:25,680
Bye now.

570
00:38:34,976 --> 00:38:36,859
He takes all sorts of jobs.

571
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:38,716
What a busy man he must be.

572
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,095
Is this a protest?

573
00:38:51,368 --> 00:38:53,464
Something like that...

574
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:56,500
("Six," Director Lee Heesub)

575
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:00,423
What?

576
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:04,812
What else? It's the script.

577
00:39:04,897 --> 00:39:06,994
Where did you get this?
You said he didn't answer his phone.

578
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,405
I stole it. Why do you ask?

579
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:12,383
You rock, Ms. Yoo.

580
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,004
I heard he chose Chae Yoori.

581
00:39:16,196 --> 00:39:17,989
There will be better projects.

582
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:23,449
Where's Director Lee?

583
00:39:23,534 --> 00:39:26,991
He's going abroad soon
to finish writing the script.

584
00:39:27,249 --> 00:39:30,489
It was because of him
that I started acting.

585
00:39:31,014 --> 00:39:32,985
You know what that means to me.

586
00:39:33,069 --> 00:39:34,491
You'll get another chance.

587
00:39:34,576 --> 00:39:37,838
He comes back to work every ten years.
When will I get another chance?

588
00:39:39,323 --> 00:39:40,928
God knows what will happen to me then.

589
00:39:42,277 --> 00:39:44,865
Ms. Han! Hold on a minute.

590
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:45,782
Segye.

591
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:48,526
Please don't. You didn't schedule
an appointment.

592
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,965
He's in a meeting right now.

593
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:52,323
You don't know me? I'm Han Segye.

594
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:54,379
-Mr. Lee!
-Wait.

595
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:57,695
It's Han Segye, Mr. Lee.

596
00:40:02,288 --> 00:40:03,665
Hello, Segye.

597
00:40:08,613 --> 00:40:10,808
It seems like she's here to talk to you.

598
00:40:10,912 --> 00:40:12,522
Should I leave the room, sir?

599
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:14,681
No. Stay here.

600
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:17,183
It's fine.

601
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:20,968
If you want to say something, go ahead.

602
00:40:25,078 --> 00:40:26,230
Mr. Lee...

603
00:40:26,856 --> 00:40:30,452
Why didn't you call me
when you were back in Korea?

604
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:35,528
If I don't give you a call,
or not answer your calls...

605
00:40:36,773 --> 00:40:38,204
There must be a reason for that, right?

606
00:40:38,942 --> 00:40:42,408
It's me, Segye.
Why are you being so formal?

607
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:45,830
I'm overdressed today, aren't I?

608
00:40:45,915 --> 00:40:48,851
I haven't seen you in a long time,
so I wanted to look good.

609
00:40:49,278 --> 00:40:50,782
We don't know each other.

610
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:55,549
I don't think the actress
that I knew exists anymore.

611
00:40:58,663 --> 00:41:00,283
She's changed too much.

612
00:41:02,907 --> 00:41:05,087
Do you have to make it
awkward for everyone?

613
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:07,649
What is the meaning of this?
I have a guest right now.

614
00:41:09,127 --> 00:41:11,719
Do you think you can do this
just because you're Han Segye?

615
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:15,293
I'm sorry.

616
00:41:15,967 --> 00:41:17,374
I was in a rush.

617
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:21,609
I thought I'd lose the opportunity
if you leave the country...

618
00:41:21,694 --> 00:41:23,118
Are you kidding?

619
00:41:24,087 --> 00:41:27,185
There was no opportunity
for you to begin with.

620
00:41:28,038 --> 00:41:30,435
If you're done talking, you can leave.

621
00:41:36,142 --> 00:41:37,809
You don't even listen
when I ask you to leave?

622
00:41:38,284 --> 00:41:39,117
Why not?

623
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:43,153
Don't you like hearing the word “leave”?

624
00:41:47,092 --> 00:41:49,240
Or do you leave only when you want to?

625
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:51,957
It's up to you.

626
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:54,068
You can stand there or leave.

627
00:41:55,626 --> 00:41:58,578
An ordinary director like me
can't talk to an actress like you.

628
00:42:12,854 --> 00:42:14,293
I'm sorry, sir.

629
00:42:16,363 --> 00:42:19,419
You're right.
I know that I've changed.

630
00:42:19,555 --> 00:42:20,738
But I...

631
00:42:26,406 --> 00:42:28,513
I didn't change because I wanted to.

632
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,528
Your acting has improved in a way.

633
00:42:33,401 --> 00:42:36,254
Sir... Please give me one more chance.

634
00:42:36,373 --> 00:42:37,780
Please, trust me this time.

635
00:42:38,148 --> 00:42:40,702
No one can play this role better than me.

636
00:42:41,641 --> 00:42:43,628
I disagree.

637
00:42:43,796 --> 00:42:45,615
I will do my best.

638
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:47,259
I'll do a good job.

639
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:50,948
You know me.
You know me better than anyone.

640
00:42:53,394 --> 00:42:55,087
I thought I did.

641
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:00,083
Your movie's going to be out soon, right?

642
00:43:00,886 --> 00:43:03,554
I apologize for taking up your time.

643
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:04,891
Where were we?

644
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:08,882
In my opinion, the character...

645
00:43:09,569 --> 00:43:11,175
...can show more love in this scene...

646
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,371
Let's go, Segye.

647
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:14,574
Get up, let's go.

648
00:43:30,185 --> 00:43:31,309
It's my profile.

649
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,470
Please take this at least.

650
00:43:53,273 --> 00:43:54,106
Put it away.

651
00:44:01,098 --> 00:44:03,842
I shouldn't have brought you there.

652
00:44:06,336 --> 00:44:09,825
I should have dragged you away
from the door.

653
00:44:09,937 --> 00:44:11,483
Stop it...

654
00:44:12,043 --> 00:44:14,750
Hey, it's uncomfortable out here.
Go drink at home.

655
00:44:14,835 --> 00:44:15,892
I'll prepare drinks and snacks.

656
00:44:15,976 --> 00:44:18,775
I feel like drinking outside tonight.

657
00:44:20,573 --> 00:44:22,134
I was so pathetic today.

658
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,933
Let me do whatever I want.

659
00:44:29,636 --> 00:44:30,469
Alright.

660
00:44:35,193 --> 00:44:36,640
He said I've changed.

661
00:44:38,597 --> 00:44:40,487
It's funny how everyone says
that I've changed.

662
00:44:48,308 --> 00:44:52,933
In the past, I used to think it's
because people didn't know me.

663
00:44:54,904 --> 00:44:56,827
But today, it occurred to me.

664
00:45:01,463 --> 00:45:02,469
The truth is...

665
00:45:03,433 --> 00:45:06,871
...maybe the person they see me as
is the real me.

666
00:45:07,701 --> 00:45:08,974
Maybe...

667
00:45:10,254 --> 00:45:11,978
...it has to be like that.

668
00:45:12,564 --> 00:45:14,779
Don't think like that.

669
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,777
It doesn't matter what other people think.

670
00:45:16,862 --> 00:45:18,735
It should matter.

671
00:45:19,538 --> 00:45:21,619
My job is showing myself to others.

672
00:45:22,878 --> 00:45:24,509
Then I'll tell you something
as a stranger.

673
00:45:24,998 --> 00:45:27,913
I look at you and I see the same person.

674
00:45:28,232 --> 00:45:29,580
You haven't changed at all.

675
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:34,730
That was awesome.

676
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:37,688
Enough of this.

677
00:45:37,938 --> 00:45:40,866
Just wash it away with alcohol.
There are other movies.

678
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:43,417
Right. It's not the only movie.

679
00:45:43,777 --> 00:45:45,174
The scenario wasn't that great, either.

680
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,494
I just wanted it more
because he didn't give me a chance.

681
00:45:50,746 --> 00:45:52,624
I'm telling the truth.

682
00:45:53,031 --> 00:45:55,920
Honestly, I think the movie will fail.

683
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,456
That's right. Here.

684
00:46:01,104 --> 00:46:02,104
Raise your glasses.

685
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:04,528
Fail!

686
00:46:06,016 --> 00:46:06,849
Fail!

687
00:46:07,901 --> 00:46:09,682
Forgive me Lord.

688
00:46:10,885 --> 00:46:12,956
-Fail!
-Fail!

689
00:46:16,746 --> 00:46:17,864
Let's have one more drink.

690
00:46:17,948 --> 00:46:18,812
Are you buying?

691
00:46:18,897 --> 00:46:20,792
I'm in a good mood. I'll buy today.

692
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:24,633
Auntie.

693
00:46:24,718 --> 00:46:28,040
We'll have a stir-fried cartilage
and three bottles of soju.

694
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,387
Soju? Which one?

695
00:46:29,472 --> 00:46:30,852
Han Segye or Chae Yoori?

696
00:46:31,126 --> 00:46:33,109
Pick the prettier one.

697
00:46:34,238 --> 00:46:35,212
Chae Yoori.

698
00:46:35,297 --> 00:46:39,593
Chae Yoori? Hey, I told you
to pick the prettier one.

699
00:46:39,677 --> 00:46:42,326
Hey, you don't know anything.

700
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:44,203
That's why you never get lucky.

701
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:46,875
Did you hear about Han Segye
donating 100 million won...

702
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,023
...to help unfortunate children?

703
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,958
Indeed, a pretty face is
the portrait of a pretty heart.

704
00:46:55,108 --> 00:47:00,040
Oh, that is so true.
Isn't that what real beauty is?

705
00:47:01,906 --> 00:47:04,894
I told you, Han Segye's the best.

706
00:47:04,978 --> 00:47:08,020
She has a pretty face, a pretty heart
and she's rich...

707
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:10,334
So which one do you want?
Hurry up and choose.

708
00:47:10,418 --> 00:47:13,505
Auntie, we'll change to Han Segye.

709
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:15,115
Han Segye? Okay.

710
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,676
Auntie. Give that table a plate of eel.

711
00:47:18,896 --> 00:47:21,072
Just because I'm drunk.

712
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:25,976
Thank you pretty lady!

713
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:28,979
(Confidentiality Agreement)

714
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:36,153
(Auntie)

715
00:47:44,138 --> 00:47:46,479
Calls must be answered
as fast as possible.

716
00:47:51,262 --> 00:47:52,095
Yes?

717
00:47:56,722 --> 00:47:59,190
Is she that pretty?

718
00:47:59,428 --> 00:48:01,947
Is her acting so much better than mine?

719
00:48:02,032 --> 00:48:04,297
Why her and not me?

720
00:48:05,628 --> 00:48:09,396
I really wanted that movie...

721
00:48:09,564 --> 00:48:12,244
I really really wanted it!

722
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:13,434
Ms. Han?

723
00:48:14,247 --> 00:48:15,957
That movie won't fail.

724
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,403
Right? It won't fail, right?

725
00:48:20,305 --> 00:48:22,047
How would I know?

726
00:48:22,272 --> 00:48:27,012
Right? I knew you'd think that way...

727
00:48:27,246 --> 00:48:29,290
I can see it going to the Cannes.

728
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:32,054
Cannes!

729
00:48:33,209 --> 00:48:36,013
I really wanted to go to the Cannes...

730
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:37,730
Are you drunk?

731
00:48:38,691 --> 00:48:41,708
The title is "Six."

732
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:43,762
You know about human clones?

733
00:48:44,944 --> 00:48:47,536
The movie's about six human clones...

734
00:48:48,124 --> 00:48:50,578
...who are living
their own separate lives.

735
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,429
I can totally nail the character.

736
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,668
I'm the only one who can!

737
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:03,151
I'm not kidding. Watch.

738
00:49:03,242 --> 00:49:04,920
No. You don't have to show me...

739
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:19,552
Sit.

740
00:49:20,606 --> 00:49:21,439
Honey...

741
00:49:22,618 --> 00:49:26,337
I can't live in this cruel house
of yours anymore.

742
00:49:26,759 --> 00:49:28,827
I have to leave now.

743
00:49:30,943 --> 00:49:33,220
You're silent as usual.

744
00:49:33,926 --> 00:49:35,439
You bad man...

745
00:49:40,354 --> 00:49:43,413
Nothing like a gun for a quiet man.

746
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:46,030
The moment they're held
at gunpoint…

747
00:49:46,302 --> 00:49:49,386
..."Don't kill me!"
And they start talking.

748
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:51,789
It's so boring.

749
00:49:58,585 --> 00:49:59,456
How was it?

750
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:03,984
It's astounding. Can I hang up now?

751
00:50:10,654 --> 00:50:14,478
Director Lee was astonished
when he saw me for the first time.

752
00:50:17,023 --> 00:50:20,311
I started my acting career
through his movie.

753
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:22,111
So he's...

754
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:25,404
He...

755
00:50:26,394 --> 00:50:28,220
...gave birth to the actress, Han Segye.

756
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:30,985
I don't understand
why I'm listening to this.

757
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:33,079
I don't have a dad.

758
00:50:36,045 --> 00:50:37,835
I didn't have one since I was born.

759
00:50:39,755 --> 00:50:40,949
My mom...

760
00:50:41,737 --> 00:50:44,101
...gave birth to me when she was 18.

761
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,147
She went through so many hardships...

762
00:50:47,216 --> 00:50:48,175
No, that's not it...

763
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:52,099
Anyway, Director Lee was
like a dad to me.

764
00:50:53,173 --> 00:50:55,553
He made me the person I am today.

765
00:50:59,319 --> 00:51:00,676
So...

766
00:51:03,409 --> 00:51:06,163
I feel like I've been abandoned by my dad.

767
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:12,843
Do you know how that feeling?

768
00:51:16,426 --> 00:51:17,818
Do you?

769
00:51:19,887 --> 00:51:20,753
I do.

770
00:51:21,608 --> 00:51:23,486
You know nothing!

771
00:51:28,378 --> 00:51:29,344
Are you crying?

772
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:32,472
Wasn't my acting awesome?

773
00:51:32,558 --> 00:51:33,992
I had you fooled there, didn't I?

774
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:37,715
-Good bye.
-Hold on.

775
00:51:50,883 --> 00:51:52,454
You bad man.

776
00:51:55,909 --> 00:51:57,414
You bad man...

777
00:52:42,146 --> 00:52:43,227
Do me a favor.

778
00:52:43,312 --> 00:52:44,145
Yes.

779
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:46,165
Okay. Got it

780
00:52:51,159 --> 00:52:52,736
Are you attending to the chief again?

781
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:55,343
What else can a salaried worker do?

782
00:52:55,867 --> 00:52:58,609
Don't you think you're underpaid
compared to your devotion?

783
00:52:59,097 --> 00:53:01,222
How will you buy a house in Seoul?

784
00:53:01,568 --> 00:53:04,181
Buying a house is your dream.
A big house.

785
00:53:05,592 --> 00:53:08,549
If I continue to save,
maybe I'll buy one someday.

786
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:10,089
Not someday.

787
00:53:10,542 --> 00:53:12,389
You could buy one right now.

788
00:53:15,327 --> 00:53:17,430
How about One Air?

789
00:53:18,307 --> 00:53:21,028
What about One Air?
To me, it's just a subsidiary.

790
00:53:21,742 --> 00:53:22,990
Not a competitor?

791
00:53:23,822 --> 00:53:26,437
Does One Air have
about 14 slots per hour?

792
00:53:26,922 --> 00:53:28,934
It's too small to be a competitor.

793
00:53:29,596 --> 00:53:32,243
How can a business prosper
with a number that small?

794
00:53:34,148 --> 00:53:35,913
Look at you being cute.

795
00:53:37,586 --> 00:53:40,434
Only a competent person
can play hard to get.

796
00:53:40,772 --> 00:53:43,949
I like competent people
and people who play hard to get.

797
00:53:44,436 --> 00:53:47,472
Being an introvert, I don't like
change of environment.

798
00:53:47,556 --> 00:53:48,508
Then why are you here?

799
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:50,085
You said you're buying breakfast.

800
00:53:50,406 --> 00:53:53,330
I'm here to get a free meal
from my college senior.

801
00:53:53,737 --> 00:53:56,280
But this is too much for a breakfast.

802
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:57,511
Hey, Jung Joohwan!

803
00:53:57,595 --> 00:53:58,635
Oh my gosh, I'm scared.

804
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,372
I'm leaving for work out of fear.

805
00:54:08,322 --> 00:54:10,314
That fish reminds me.

806
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:14,345
You didn't plant a bug
in the fish, did you?

807
00:54:16,593 --> 00:54:17,961
I should have.

808
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:18,952
Yes, you should have.

809
00:54:19,511 --> 00:54:21,792
I would've served you
if you were that ballsy.

810
00:54:23,723 --> 00:54:24,884
Why did it have to be Dojae?

811
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:28,969
As children can't choose their parents,
subordinates can't choose bosses.

812
00:54:29,053 --> 00:54:31,551
So I'm giving you a choice.

813
00:54:34,903 --> 00:54:35,923
Go.

814
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:38,138
I had my first breakfast
after a month because of you.

815
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:39,872
It was good.

816
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,035
I can see it going to the Cannes.

817
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,791
The Cannes!

818
00:55:08,493 --> 00:55:10,741
You're silent as usual.

819
00:55:11,479 --> 00:55:13,010
You bad man...

820
00:55:15,403 --> 00:55:18,420
Nothing like a gun for a quiet man.

821
00:55:21,562 --> 00:55:23,086
I am really...

822
00:55:23,957 --> 00:55:25,064
...a dog.

823
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,095
Dog.

824
00:55:28,836 --> 00:55:31,311
Han Se... dog.

825
00:55:40,698 --> 00:55:44,027
3:00 PM. Store D, third floor
of the Royal Department Store.

826
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:45,475
Bring your passport with you.

827
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:48,350
My head...

828
00:55:51,354 --> 00:55:53,383
What does he want now?

829
00:55:56,508 --> 00:56:00,234
"Respond to calls actively and show
a cooperative attitude."

830
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,336
This clause was written by you, Auntie.

831
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:14,710
You know, people make mistakes sometimes.

832
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,800
Did you have to call me out
when I drank last night?

833
00:56:17,884 --> 00:56:19,743
I haven't relieved my hangover.

834
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:22,613
A person can make mistakes.

835
00:56:23,238 --> 00:56:25,716
But you didn't look human last night.

836
00:56:29,663 --> 00:56:32,770
You don't look that human today either.

837
00:56:33,568 --> 00:56:34,724
Did you vomit?

838
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:35,642
No.

839
00:56:35,917 --> 00:56:37,043
I haven't.

840
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:40,180
It's so empty.
Perfect to vomit on someone.

841
00:56:40,268 --> 00:56:41,602
Perhaps because it's a weekday?

842
00:56:41,792 --> 00:56:43,331
I had the mall cleared.

843
00:56:51,821 --> 00:56:55,879
I'm hungover and worn out,
but people can still recognize me.

844
00:56:56,418 --> 00:56:58,749
It's the charm of a star.

845
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:03,224
Chief Seo.

846
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:06,456
Thank you for visiting.

847
00:57:07,601 --> 00:57:08,434
Sure.

848
00:57:09,665 --> 00:57:12,079
This one, this one, this one.

849
00:57:12,254 --> 00:57:13,167
And this one.

850
00:57:13,893 --> 00:57:17,383
Also, from here to here.

851
00:57:18,597 --> 00:57:19,735
Send them all to me.

852
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,696
The clothes this season look great.

853
00:57:22,013 --> 00:57:24,908
Sure. I'll have them ready
to be delivered to your house.

854
00:57:25,068 --> 00:57:26,153
I'll also...

855
00:57:29,744 --> 00:57:32,015
...take everything from here to here.

856
00:57:34,883 --> 00:57:37,117
Miss, are you...

857
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:38,515
That's right.

858
00:57:38,652 --> 00:57:39,905
I'm Han Segye.

859
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,256
But you don't have to be nervous.

860
00:57:42,867 --> 00:57:44,109
No, it's not that.

861
00:57:44,496 --> 00:57:46,410
Did you reserve the items?

862
00:57:46,557 --> 00:57:47,188
Reserve?

863
00:57:47,273 --> 00:57:51,775
Too many customers reserve
ladies' clothes on layaway.

864
00:57:51,913 --> 00:57:54,034
You need to install a layaway
if you haven't.

865
00:57:54,118 --> 00:57:55,372
And then wait for your turn.

866
00:57:56,684 --> 00:58:01,645
The designer of this brand personally
gave me a new outfit as a gift.

867
00:58:03,687 --> 00:58:06,082
I see. Good for you.

868
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:07,006
So...

869
00:58:07,227 --> 00:58:09,223
...would you like to make
a reservation, Miss?

870
00:58:09,307 --> 00:58:12,128
I don't think she has time
for reservations.

871
00:58:12,478 --> 00:58:15,052
I'm sorry, but can you take care
of mine first?

872
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:18,527
Yes, Chief Seo. I'll get to it.

873
00:58:23,098 --> 00:58:25,259
Why do you get to decide
if I have time or not?

874
00:58:34,504 --> 00:58:36,261
What's this...?

875
00:58:37,907 --> 00:58:40,088
I wonder if you'll have enough time.

876
00:58:40,762 --> 00:58:43,763
It's not my fault since you were late.

877
00:58:45,854 --> 00:58:48,475
Director Lee Heesub will be
taking this flight.

878
00:58:48,868 --> 00:58:51,809
Fortunately, he uses T'road.

879
00:58:52,877 --> 00:58:54,356
There's no profound meaning to this.

880
00:58:55,072 --> 00:58:58,963
If you're successful,
then T'road benefits from it.

881
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:20,543
To the airport as fast as possible.

882
00:59:20,627 --> 00:59:22,237
I'm doomed if I'm late.

883
00:59:33,896 --> 00:59:35,695
Are you Mr. Lee Heesub?

884
00:59:36,142 --> 00:59:38,501
-I am.
-Your seat's been upgraded.

885
00:59:39,197 --> 00:59:40,058
This way.

886
00:59:46,828 --> 00:59:48,649
Take any seat you like.

887
00:59:49,248 --> 00:59:51,529
-Okay.
-Have a pleasant flight.

888
01:00:15,326 --> 01:00:18,059
You followed me all the way here?

889
01:00:18,638 --> 01:00:22,085
Technically, I got here before you.

890
01:00:24,757 --> 01:00:26,447
You're finally talking to me casually.

891
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,365
What you're doing now
won't make a difference.

892
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:33,897
Did you see my profile?

893
01:00:33,981 --> 01:00:34,884
I threw it away.

894
01:00:35,397 --> 01:00:38,710
It should be somewhere between
the profiles of aspiring actors.

895
01:00:39,214 --> 01:00:40,304
You did the right thing.

896
01:00:41,069 --> 01:00:43,087
That's exactly where I want it to be.

897
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,963
The aspiring actress Han Segye.

898
01:00:46,546 --> 01:00:48,214
The Han Segye you've met
for the first time.

899
01:00:49,071 --> 01:00:50,731
That's still who I am.

900
01:00:51,027 --> 01:00:52,391
I haven't changed.

901
01:00:52,487 --> 01:00:53,320
No.

902
01:00:54,452 --> 01:00:56,814
I'm afraid you've changed.

903
01:00:59,328 --> 01:01:00,948
That's what everyone says.

904
01:01:03,501 --> 01:01:05,152
Then during your journey...

905
01:01:05,854 --> 01:01:10,240
...find out if I've really changed,
and how I've changed.

906
01:01:15,307 --> 01:01:18,285
And if you don't trust me, trust yourself.

907
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:23,333
I am the actress that you've made.

908
01:01:25,322 --> 01:01:27,417
If I made you who you are today...

909
01:01:28,175 --> 01:01:29,145
Then, I'm...

910
01:01:30,778 --> 01:01:32,275
...deeply disappointed in myself.

911
01:02:14,282 --> 01:02:15,500
Look who it is.

912
01:02:15,585 --> 01:02:16,854
Aren't you Han Segye?

913
01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:18,275
Did you run away again?

914
01:02:20,227 --> 01:02:21,238
No.

915
01:02:21,927 --> 01:02:23,888
I came here to catch
someone who ran away.

916
01:02:23,993 --> 01:02:25,030
Did you catch him?

917
01:02:25,293 --> 01:02:26,407
I lost him.

918
01:02:26,905 --> 01:02:30,677
You keep running away.
That's why people around you runs away.

919
01:02:30,762 --> 01:02:32,549
Exactly!

920
01:02:32,881 --> 01:02:33,850
Tell me about it.

921
01:02:34,006 --> 01:02:36,759
Gosh, your shoulders are down.

922
01:02:36,843 --> 01:02:39,889
Cheer up. Don't do it again next time.

923
01:02:40,618 --> 01:02:42,994
-Aren't you pretty.
-I'm a fan.

924
01:02:43,078 --> 01:02:44,686
Me too. I'm your fan.

925
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:45,916
Me too.

926
01:02:46,002 --> 01:02:47,372
She's so pretty.

927
01:02:48,507 --> 01:02:51,375
I think I'll do it again next time.

928
01:02:51,749 --> 01:02:54,034
I can't do anything about it.

929
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:17,786
Hello?

930
01:03:18,246 --> 01:03:21,152
We have a mortgage where you can loan...

931
01:03:21,237 --> 01:03:23,059
...up to 10 million won
with low interest!

932
01:03:23,408 --> 01:03:24,969
I have a lot of money.

933
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:28,612
But you sound very young.
Why don't you...

934
01:03:28,696 --> 01:03:30,957
Yes, I'm young and I'm loaded.

935
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:32,298
Miss, wait...

936
01:03:45,835 --> 01:03:47,338
I told you I have money.

937
01:03:47,422 --> 01:03:48,255
I know.

938
01:03:49,841 --> 01:03:51,163
How do you know?

939
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,142
You made a donation that time.

940
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:00,487
Who's this?

941
01:04:00,572 --> 01:04:03,842
I'm the laundry, coffee, perfume
and express delivery guy.

942
01:04:05,896 --> 01:04:06,819
How did you get my number?

943
01:04:06,903 --> 01:04:08,978
It was written on
the confirmation receipt.

944
01:04:09,598 --> 01:04:11,647
Is that a right way
to get a woman's number?

945
01:04:11,917 --> 01:04:15,221
I know I shouldn't have,
but I'm really desperate.

946
01:04:15,712 --> 01:04:16,686
I apologize.

947
01:04:17,113 --> 01:04:19,737
That's your problem. Goodbye.

948
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:20,976
Wait!

949
01:04:25,131 --> 01:04:28,220
That little kid thinks he's charming.

950
01:04:34,727 --> 01:04:37,440
Will someone invent
a machine that removes make-up?

951
01:04:38,005 --> 01:04:39,713
I got turned down.

952
01:04:39,812 --> 01:04:41,746
-By whom?
-Someone who's rich.

953
01:04:42,437 --> 01:04:43,748
I thought it was a girl.

954
01:04:44,477 --> 01:04:45,552
It is a girl.

955
01:04:49,643 --> 01:04:51,565
-What?
-She's a regular contributor.

956
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,105
Someone who does good work.

957
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:55,973
There's a place that needs urgent help.

958
01:04:57,029 --> 01:04:58,330
Of course.

959
01:04:59,043 --> 01:05:00,719
I wouldn't expect anything less from you.

960
01:05:00,804 --> 01:05:01,893
"You"?

961
01:05:02,286 --> 01:05:04,711
-Is that how you call your older brother?
-Yes, sir.

962
01:05:05,857 --> 01:05:07,184
Where are your manners?

963
01:05:07,338 --> 01:05:08,758
Are you nuts?

964
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,879
(Passenger Terminal 2, Departures)

965
01:05:21,212 --> 01:05:23,736
Get in quick before people sees you.

966
01:05:40,533 --> 01:05:41,994
That was amazing.

967
01:05:42,078 --> 01:05:43,865
How did you know it was me with this on?

968
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:46,340
The same clothes.
And the way you walk.

969
01:05:47,362 --> 01:05:48,201
How did the meeting go?

970
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:51,414
I guess it wasn't my place to begin with.

971
01:05:52,392 --> 01:05:54,115
But I feel much better.

972
01:05:54,457 --> 01:05:56,085
I tried my best until the very end.

973
01:05:58,151 --> 01:05:59,974
Thank you for helping me try.

974
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:01,574
No need to thank me.

975
01:06:01,696 --> 01:06:03,070
You owe me more debt.

976
01:06:05,177 --> 01:06:07,561
You just had to ruin the moment
by mentioning debt.

977
01:06:11,265 --> 01:06:14,408
This is the final version of the contract.
Please check and sign.

978
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:16,338
(Confidentiality Agreement)

979
01:06:17,697 --> 01:06:19,101
This is why I came.

980
01:06:19,837 --> 01:06:21,281
Sure.

981
01:06:23,046 --> 01:06:24,480
(Confidentiality Agreement)

982
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:26,958
(Party A: Seo Dojae,
Party B: Han Segye)

983
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:32,006
Why are you continuing your acting career?

984
01:06:32,751 --> 01:06:34,508
When you have that unusual condition?

985
01:06:35,786 --> 01:06:37,999
Are you invoking clause number one
of the contract?

986
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,881
"No running away from questions
and must answer them."

987
01:06:42,966 --> 01:06:43,799
In a way.

988
01:06:45,388 --> 01:06:47,232
Okay. Let's put it that way.

989
01:06:49,986 --> 01:06:52,008
I'm signing this so I won't forget.

990
01:06:52,161 --> 01:06:53,546
So I won't forget myself.

991
01:06:54,697 --> 01:06:55,661
Someday...

992
01:06:57,206 --> 01:06:59,550
...I might forget everything
about myself.

993
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:07,126
Is it my turn now?

994
01:07:10,297 --> 01:07:12,395
Wait. Pull up over there.

995
01:07:23,671 --> 01:07:25,241
I've done some research.

996
01:07:25,456 --> 01:07:28,130
People with face-blindness have
a hard time watching a movie.

997
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:29,769
So...

998
01:07:30,403 --> 01:07:34,050
...since we're here,
I want to check if it's true.

999
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:36,953
Do you have to check that
at noon, on a weekday?

1000
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:38,535
Isn't that too careless?

1001
01:07:38,624 --> 01:07:40,728
You really don't know what you're saying.

1002
01:07:40,966 --> 01:07:43,957
A noon on a weekday is the safest time.
Less people, too.

1003
01:07:44,042 --> 01:07:46,671
On a weekday noon, the safest time
with the least people...

1004
01:07:46,756 --> 01:07:49,197
...why would you watch
a Chae Yoori movie?

1005
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:54,049
Since you paid for the plane ticket,
I'll buy the movie tickets.

1006
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:10,068
See? I told you so.

1007
01:08:21,091 --> 01:08:22,553
Are you looking for something?

1008
01:08:22,637 --> 01:08:23,800
Do you need help?

1009
01:08:29,878 --> 01:08:30,763
I see.

1010
01:08:35,006 --> 01:08:36,346
Can I help you?

1011
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:38,633
Don't I look better than her?

1012
01:08:41,532 --> 01:08:42,629
You can't tell?

1013
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,789
I can tell.

1014
01:08:47,572 --> 01:08:48,747
You can?

1015
01:08:53,472 --> 01:08:54,897
Did you fall asleep?

1016
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,079
When people change
their clothes and hairstyles...

1017
01:08:58,407 --> 01:09:00,909
...I can't tell them apart.

1018
01:09:02,097 --> 01:09:03,657
It's better if I don't look.

1019
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:06,210
It's easier to distinguish them
by their voices.

1020
01:09:06,598 --> 01:09:07,713
Sushi?

1021
01:09:08,454 --> 01:09:11,207
Okay. I love sushi too.

1022
01:09:11,291 --> 01:09:14,774
Unfortunately,
I have to clear the inventory today.

1023
01:09:14,873 --> 01:09:16,590
You look better than her

1024
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:21,644
It's already time for dinner...

1025
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:23,493
Say that one more time.

1026
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:25,899
You look better than her

1027
01:09:27,265 --> 01:09:28,121
Why?

1028
01:09:29,661 --> 01:09:31,442
Because you're the only actress...

1029
01:09:32,948 --> 01:09:34,404
...who I can recognize.

1030
01:09:57,447 --> 01:10:00,896
This is really hard.

1031
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,584
So you were for real.

1032
01:10:08,267 --> 01:10:10,083
You're just like me.

1033
01:10:11,477 --> 01:10:13,009
You're sick.

1034
01:10:23,183 --> 01:10:25,756
I'll accept your thoughts.
Enjoy your meal.

1035
01:10:25,841 --> 01:10:27,356
Wait, hold on.

1036
01:10:34,267 --> 01:10:35,282
Are you sleeping?

1037
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:43,673
That trip must have tired me out.

1038
01:10:44,353 --> 01:10:45,808
I'm sorry.

1039
01:10:50,313 --> 01:10:51,559
Thank you.

1040
01:10:52,662 --> 01:10:54,851
I'll return the favor.

1041
01:10:55,821 --> 01:10:56,654
I swear.

1042
01:11:01,809 --> 01:11:03,627
Wake me up when it's over.

1043
01:11:05,709 --> 01:11:08,106
I just can't watch
because of her bad acting.

1044
01:11:30,526 --> 01:11:32,038
Honestly, I...

1045
01:11:32,739 --> 01:11:35,624
I practiced again and again...

1046
01:11:36,819 --> 01:11:38,439
...to ask you out for dinner.

1047
01:11:43,289 --> 01:11:45,301
But why today?

1048
01:11:52,022 --> 01:11:54,391
What a great ending, am I right?

1049
01:11:54,678 --> 01:11:56,095
You didn't even watch.

1050
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,127
Han Segye... It's Han Segye!

1051
01:12:11,903 --> 01:12:13,072
It's Han Segye!

1052
01:12:13,791 --> 01:12:15,469
-Is it her?
-It's Han Segye!

1053
01:12:15,554 --> 01:12:16,750
Han Segye!

1054
01:12:17,563 --> 01:12:20,171
-Who's that guy next to her? Is he...
-Seo Dojae?

1055
01:12:20,265 --> 01:12:21,640
Seo Dojae!

1056
01:12:21,739 --> 01:12:24,110
-It is Seo Dojae.
-But why are they coming out together?

1057
01:12:24,195 --> 01:12:26,368
-Take their photos!
-What's your relationship?

1058
01:12:26,452 --> 01:12:27,764
Did you just come out together?

1059
01:12:27,849 --> 01:12:31,248
Do you follow the cameras,
or do they follow you?

1060
01:12:31,648 --> 01:12:32,939
I am not sure...

1061
01:12:34,848 --> 01:12:37,756
...but it seems like you're destined
to be in front of cameras.

1062
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:40,863
Is there a way?

1063
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:57,837
-It is her.
-Ms. Han! Please say something!

1064
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:01,213
Ms. Han, does this mean you admit
your relationship?

1065
01:13:06,136 --> 01:13:06,969
Smile.

1066
01:13:15,717 --> 01:13:17,026
Smile as if you're happy.

1067
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:51,295
(The Beauty Inside)

1068
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:52,934
What were you thinking?

1069
01:13:53,018 --> 01:13:55,406
Let's try this
couple of the century thing.

1070
01:13:55,491 --> 01:13:59,463
The director didn't cast you
even after you bent your knees?

1071
01:13:59,857 --> 01:14:02,203
You'll only hold him back.

1072
01:14:02,288 --> 01:14:04,135
You must break up with my son immediately.

1073
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:05,003
Are you crying?

1074
01:14:05,097 --> 01:14:08,911
Don't move. You might not recognize me.

1075
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:11,601
"No running away from questions."

1076
01:14:11,936 --> 01:14:13,560
Then I'll ask you something.

1077
01:14:13,737 --> 01:14:15,497
It's a little overdue.

1078
01:14:16,932 --> 01:14:18,259
Do you have a boyfriend?
