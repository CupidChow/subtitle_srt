1
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:12,536
Mom?

2
00:00:16,903 --> 00:00:18,719
Just as I expected.

3
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:20,354
No, it's not...

4
00:00:20,642 --> 00:00:21,719
Oh my gosh!

5
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,521
Yes. Your mom's right here.

6
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:32,768
You...

7
00:00:32,852 --> 00:00:34,852
Don't scold him. Scold me.

8
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:36,728
You're my future son-in-law?

9
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:38,572
Never mind what she said.

10
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:40,415
Yes, Mother.

11
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:42,108
Mother...?

12
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,338
Since when was she your mother-in-law?

13
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:47,657
Do you have another daughter besides me?

14
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:56,509
What happened was...

15
00:00:56,843 --> 00:01:00,111
We were just pretending
to be dating at first.

16
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:04,485
But then we ended our fake relationship
and had the article released...

17
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,072
...but during that time
we decided to date for real.

18
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:10,205
What does that even mean?
Why is it so complicated?

19
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,303
Long story short.

20
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:13,366
I...

21
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,523
...love Segye.

22
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:19,283
Now I understand.

23
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:23,817
My daughter is great,
except that she is very shy.

24
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:29,544
If she starts babbling
out of embarrassment...

25
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:32,503
...please clear it up
like you did just now.

26
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:33,594
Mom...

27
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:36,057
I will not let you down.

28
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:40,294
If you have any questions,
you can ask them all.

29
00:01:40,638 --> 00:01:43,331
Ask what? I just wanted to have a drink.

30
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:45,072
Mom!

31
00:01:52,744 --> 00:01:54,088
-Cheers.
-Okay.

32
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:01,867
How did you...

33
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:03,139
...like my mom?

34
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:10,607
She has a high-pitch laughter,
she speaks softly in a middle-range voice.

35
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:13,695
She's a cheerful character
and she has pretty fingers.

36
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:15,216
Her gait...

37
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:17,756
...is just like yours.

38
00:02:21,014 --> 00:02:22,190
I'm sorry...

39
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,411
...for suddenly putting
you in that situation.

40
00:02:26,182 --> 00:02:28,024
She and I have something in common, too.

41
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,428
We both love you very much.

42
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,416
Bye now.

43
00:02:45,963 --> 00:02:46,909
Segye?

44
00:02:58,423 --> 00:02:59,855
We weren't done earlier.

45
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:09,589
Jeez...

46
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:11,792
Is he a player?

47
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:20,378
Did you guys kiss?

48
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:23,837
No.

49
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:25,411
What kiss?

50
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:27,307
Then what was that earlier?

51
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:32,910
That... was...

52
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:36,301
I slipped and fell down.

53
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:39,698
Goodness. You didn't even kiss?

54
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:42,133
You're so pathetic.

55
00:03:42,788 --> 00:03:44,534
What kind of mom are you?

56
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:46,159
What about you?

57
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:48,194
When did you kiss Dad?

58
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:52,099
I kissed him before we decided to date.

59
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:56,204
That's so naughty of you.

60
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:03,643
How did you two first meet?

61
00:04:04,464 --> 00:04:05,868
We were introduced by a friend.

62
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:08,248
Why did you want to date Dad?

63
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,685
Was it a crush at first sight?

64
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,653
It wasn't a crush at all.

65
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:20,017
I didn't want to
but your dad kept pushing.

66
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:23,230
What was it like dating Dad?

67
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:25,549
It was somewhat sweet...

68
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:28,528
...and somewhat heart-racing.

69
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:36,037
Why did you want to marry him?

70
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,295
I liked how things weren't too much.

71
00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:43,951
When it's too hot, it boils over...

72
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:46,968
...or it gets boiled dry.

73
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:52,459
I thought our relationship will be
at the right temperature forever.

74
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,749
But it didn't turn out that way.

75
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:02,275
It's really difficult.

76
00:05:08,198 --> 00:05:09,031
Segye.

77
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:10,878
Yes?

78
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,657
You can do this.

79
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:15,582
I couldn't do it...

80
00:05:15,963 --> 00:05:17,250
...but you can.

81
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:20,322
But aren't you going home?

82
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:22,571
You said you need to water your plants.

83
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,361
The plants are not the problem right now.

84
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:26,593
I don't care if they all die.

85
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:28,842
Out of all the things I've raised...

86
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:30,461
...you are the best.

87
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:48,381
-It's free.
-Thank you.

88
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,086
It's amazing how you guys
always know my payday.

89
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,345
Don't you have a shoot?

90
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:58,404
Are you not going to work at all
because you're dating?

91
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:00,117
Do you like having a rich boyfriend?

92
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:02,077
-Ask one question at a time.
-Okay.

93
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,974
She got busted by her mom.

94
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,339
-And their relationship is so dull.
-Hey.

95
00:06:08,424 --> 00:06:10,889
You always get busted.

96
00:06:10,973 --> 00:06:12,906
Why don't you go public
with your relationship?

97
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:14,908
You're the one to talk.

98
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:16,715
Do you like having a rich girlfriend?

99
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:18,845
She's not my girlfriend.

100
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,995
You two make a big fuss
when you can't even do it right.

101
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:30,090
Hey, sweetie.

102
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,292
Did you sleep well?

103
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:37,197
Of course I can meet you.

104
00:06:37,903 --> 00:06:40,377
-I'm free these days.
-Did you hear her ringtone?

105
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,906
-I didn't.
-Segye's not working these days.

106
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:44,777
Maybe she's pretending
to be on the phone?

107
00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:47,279
Okay, I'll call you.

108
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:52,367
Hey. I had my cell on vibrate.

109
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:54,431
Did you...

110
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,446
...hear her phone vibrate?

111
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:00,619
I should play only supporting roles
from now on...

112
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:02,041
...so Woomi can have a love life.

113
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:04,551
As a woman, I'd like that...

114
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:06,508
...but as your CEO, I oppose.

115
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:09,204
But it's nice to be out of work.

116
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:11,197
I get to spend time
with you guys like this.

117
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:14,968
Excuse me, but I have work to do.

118
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:46,231
Chief. Did you get married
without me knowing?

119
00:07:46,316 --> 00:07:47,149
Why?

120
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:48,736
Is there an article about it?

121
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:51,063
No, there are no articles.

122
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,764
Your mother-in-law is here.

123
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:56,980
Your mother-in-law is
looking for her son-in-law.

124
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:13,308
I didn't know what you like
and don't like...

125
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,004
...so I prepared red meat,
seafood, and poultry.

126
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:17,668
Is it too much?

127
00:08:18,986 --> 00:08:22,335
I should be the one treating you.

128
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:25,572
No, I wanted to do this.

129
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,208
Enjoy.

130
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:28,917
Thank you.

131
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:45,892
It's good.

132
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:51,211
I'll cook for you
whenever I get the chance.

133
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,528
So...

134
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:58,972
...please look after my Segye.

135
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:05,519
Are you free after lunch?

136
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:08,848
The food is really good.

137
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:11,994
It's my turn to treat you.

138
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:15,742
Am I required to work out of the office now?

139
00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:17,339
-Joohwan.
-Yes?

140
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,701
I'll give you an incentive.

141
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:20,336
Just smile, okay?

142
00:10:03,622 --> 00:10:05,107
-Mom.
-Oh my gosh!

143
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:06,885
You went to see him?

144
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:08,198
Yes.

145
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,825
Why? Can't I go visit him?

146
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:13,796
Fine.

147
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:17,651
Let's just say it's okay to visit him
even if it's really not.

148
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:19,046
But what is that?

149
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:25,492
What about them?

150
00:10:26,228 --> 00:10:28,798
I brought some lunch
and the bought these to thank me.

151
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:30,695
You're driving me nuts!

152
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,261
Stop shouting.

153
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:34,220
How can I not shout right now?

154
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:37,903
I wanted some gifts from my son-in-law.
When will I get another chance?

155
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:40,311
Who are you calling a son-in-law?

156
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:42,977
He already sacrificed
so much by dating me.

157
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:44,211
Why do you have to make it worse?

158
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:45,578
Do you hear yourself right now?

159
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:48,721
What did he sacrifice?
Where will he find another girl like you?

160
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:51,909
He should be thankful. You're flawless.

161
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,508
You don't know anything.

162
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:55,274
You don't.

163
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,668
I don't know what's gotten into my mom.

164
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:40,437
-Why?
-How could she visit your office?

165
00:11:40,522 --> 00:11:43,226
I liked it. The food was delicious, too.

166
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:45,872
A lot of people must've seen her.

167
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:48,497
Sorry for putting you
in an awkward position.

168
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,005
It wasn't awkward.

169
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:51,762
The food was delicious, too.

170
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,148
I guess you really enjoyed the food.

171
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:57,777
The food was delicious...

172
00:11:58,254 --> 00:12:01,104
...and it was nice to buy gifts
for the mother of the woman I love.

173
00:12:02,198 --> 00:12:03,101
Come on...

174
00:12:04,093 --> 00:12:05,702
Do you feel better now?

175
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:07,439
No.

176
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:09,213
No?

177
00:12:09,387 --> 00:12:11,333
I'm far from feeling better.

178
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:13,055
So meet me tomorrow.

179
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,202
All of a sudden?

180
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:17,281
Let's spend the whole day together.

181
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:21,891
There's so much I want to tell you.

182
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:23,376
I'll tell you when I see you tomorrow.

183
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:25,910
Yes or no? Yes, right? Okay bye.

184
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:32,218
I think it's all an excuse.

185
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:50,036
My mom's feeding me too well
that I'm gaining so much weight.

186
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:51,935
I should eat low-calorie food.

187
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:54,153
Rice noodles are very low in calories

188
00:12:54,464 --> 00:12:55,753
It sounds like you're bragging.

189
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,803
Guilty as charged.

190
00:12:57,499 --> 00:12:58,986
I was bragging to be honest.

191
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:01,130
And you should.

192
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,253
Thank you for being nice to my mom.

193
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:09,718
I appreciate it.

194
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:12,504
And for the gifts.

195
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:15,642
If my mom did anything wrong...

196
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:16,944
She didn't do anything wrong.

197
00:13:18,438 --> 00:13:20,093
There's no way she could have.

198
00:13:20,653 --> 00:13:21,882
She's your mother.

199
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:32,271
My mom's always like that.

200
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:36,178
When I had a boyfriend at 15,
she met him without me knowing...

201
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:38,650
How could you suddenly
talk about your ex?

202
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:41,074
It was just an example...

203
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,260
Does the example have to be your ex?

204
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:47,103
He doesn't count as my ex.
I met him when I was 15.

205
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:51,014
Okay, fine.

206
00:13:51,746 --> 00:13:52,832
It was a fling.

207
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:53,949
A fling...

208
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:58,971
A steamy fling.

209
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:01,785
I was 15.

210
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,091
I won.

211
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:20,477
For real?

212
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:21,852
500 million won.

213
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:27,922
Just because...

214
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,958
..."500 million" is written on it,
doesn't mean you actually won.

215
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:34,277
There has to be a matching picture...

216
00:14:34,645 --> 00:14:36,298
...for you to win.

217
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:39,412
You've never tried a lottery before?

218
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:44,096
You plutocrats are unbelievable.

219
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:46,119
Keep scratching the rest.

220
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:50,977
It's not about the money anymore.

221
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:52,688
It's a matter of pride.

222
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,223
Looks like you lost.

223
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,674
Three bird cards.

224
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,726
I'm getting bad cards today.

225
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:08,901
Go.

226
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,889
What do you think you're you doing?

227
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:18,453
I'm getting the chills.

228
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,602
It's like a dagger to the heart.

229
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,168
But don't worry.

230
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:26,459
The hand is faster than the eye.

231
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:29,919
It's just a game.

232
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:31,527
Do you have to do that?

233
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:35,009
It's not about the money.
It's a matter of pride.

234
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:37,669
Drop it.

235
00:15:39,702 --> 00:15:40,835
How many did you leave?

236
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:43,496
I left about ten.

237
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:45,509
Why are you so slow at typing?

238
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:48,143
How many have you left?

239
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:49,849
I left about 50.

240
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:53,653
(Han Segye rocks.)

241
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:57,841
Write at least 30 more.

242
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:03,284
"I love you, Han Segye."

243
00:16:03,374 --> 00:16:04,591
"Times 30."

244
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:06,311
"Han Segye rocks."

245
00:16:06,396 --> 00:16:07,843
"She's beautiful. The goddess of acting."

246
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:10,827
-"Han Segye's so pretty."
-"You're so pretty. You rock."

247
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:12,772
"She's talented and she's gorgeous"

248
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:14,325
Shave with the grain.

249
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:16,539
From the cheek...

250
00:16:17,627 --> 00:16:18,460
...to the neck.

251
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,346
And around the lips.

252
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,079
Don't laugh. You might get cut.

253
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:39,265
-Will it be done within today?
-Yes, it'll be done soon.

254
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:48,297
After you're done,
run your face with your fingers.

255
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,075
Check if there's a missing spot.

256
00:16:51,852 --> 00:16:52,691
All done.

257
00:16:54,158 --> 00:16:54,991
Just a moment.

258
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,101
There we go.

259
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:01,284
Again.

260
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:02,880
Again.

261
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:33,274
Do you have any schedule for tomorrow?

262
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,241
I'm playing a supporting role,
so I don't have that many scenes.

263
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:39,458
There's only one scene.

264
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:41,826
I got excited for a moment.

265
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,744
Why?

266
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:47,033
Should we meet again tomorrow?
Would you like that?

267
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:51,789
Hey, that's me.

268
00:17:57,853 --> 00:17:59,913
You said you exercise here every day.

269
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:01,550
I guess you see me every day.

270
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,294
That one's photoshopped too much.

271
00:18:15,982 --> 00:18:18,460
I didn't know that was me at first.

272
00:18:38,655 --> 00:18:39,788
I'm sorry.

273
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:48,127
I got too excited.

274
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:51,731
I got excited like an idiot.

275
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:56,268
I'm so sorry.

276
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,420
I'm okay.

277
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:05,692
I'm okay with everything

278
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:09,504
-Even if you don't recognize me...
-I'm not okay.

279
00:19:11,546 --> 00:19:12,952
It's not okay for me.

280
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:15,048
I...

281
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,309
...want to see you.

282
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:21,727
I want to recognize you.

283
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:28,808
So this is what it's like.

284
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:32,782
Sharing the burdens I have to bear...

285
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:36,809
... with someone else.

286
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:42,896
That makes two of us.

287
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,552
(Han Segye as Seo Woojoo)

288
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,803
(Han Segye)

289
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,559
(Sharp nose and red lips that stands out.)

290
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:36,602
(Is it Han Segye or not?)

291
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,991
(Slightly wavy hair)

292
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,078
(The woman from the hospital.)

293
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:53,897
(Updo. Almost didn't recognize.)

294
00:20:53,982 --> 00:20:55,354
(Please help me...)

295
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:29,082
What's this?

296
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:30,982
Did you come here to see me?

297
00:21:32,842 --> 00:21:33,675
Yes.

298
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,864
You go ahead.

299
00:21:44,622 --> 00:21:45,455
Why?

300
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,224
You want me to do another good deed?

301
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,109
No. I'm going to do a good deed.

302
00:21:53,863 --> 00:21:54,696
Ta-da.

303
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,656
I figured you haven't had a cake yet.

304
00:21:58,178 --> 00:21:59,783
You skip meals often.

305
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,516
But it's your birthday.

306
00:22:14,357 --> 00:22:16,704
I brought one candle to make it simple.

307
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,683
I'll skip the song
since you won't like it.

308
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:33,554
Blow the candles out.

309
00:22:40,531 --> 00:22:41,683
I got...

310
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:45,397
...flowers for my birthday.

311
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:49,466
And those flowers mean...

312
00:22:50,276 --> 00:22:52,060
"Happiness surely to come."

313
00:22:56,392 --> 00:22:58,611
I know I shouldn't do this.

314
00:22:59,202 --> 00:23:02,195
But if there's my share of happiness...

315
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,777
...I think it would be you.

316
00:23:08,446 --> 00:23:09,279
Pardon?

317
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:12,960
I like you.

318
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:20,605
It seems like I do.

319
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:29,270
I...

320
00:23:30,863 --> 00:23:32,337
I'm always kind.

321
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:34,895
So you might misunderstand.

322
00:23:35,963 --> 00:23:39,109
But I love God.

323
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,607
I want to follow
the footsteps of the Lord.

324
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:49,322
I understand.

325
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:56,735
I've been through that
a lot since elementary school.

326
00:23:57,534 --> 00:23:59,159
You don't have to blame yourself...

327
00:23:59,243 --> 00:24:00,791
You said don't like a bad person.

328
00:24:01,662 --> 00:24:02,495
Then...

329
00:24:06,097 --> 00:24:07,713
...why are you so bad to me?

330
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,057
Also...

331
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:19,892
I don't like cake.

332
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,981
I don't have a religion...

333
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,133
...but I'm in a hurry.

334
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:21,787
Please give this man up to me.

335
00:25:23,473 --> 00:25:26,258
If you do, I'll make
big donations to the church.

336
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:30,662
Whatever amount you're thinking,
it'll be a lot more than that.

337
00:25:32,194 --> 00:25:33,027
I'm...

338
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:35,314
...trying to negotiate with you.

339
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:37,970
So please...

340
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:41,977
...give me that man, Ryu Eunho.

341
00:25:44,193 --> 00:25:46,779
I look forward to hearing
good news from you.

342
00:26:05,707 --> 00:26:07,599
Why am I such a mess?

343
00:26:08,822 --> 00:26:10,500
Why am I such a mess?

344
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:13,117
Why are you two such a mess?

345
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:16,792
Why? What's up with you guys?

346
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:19,027
Why do I regret later all the time?

347
00:26:19,887 --> 00:26:21,547
I should've done better.

348
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,755
I should've tried to do better.

349
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:26,485
Yeah...

350
00:26:27,303 --> 00:26:29,656
Why do I always regret it later?

351
00:26:30,475 --> 00:26:32,456
I should've done less.

352
00:26:32,812 --> 00:26:35,397
I should've tried to do less.

353
00:26:35,482 --> 00:26:37,606
What the hell is this?

354
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:39,820
Is this a secret code game?

355
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,434
(Mom)

356
00:26:44,706 --> 00:26:45,731
Why don't you take it?

357
00:26:45,997 --> 00:26:48,790
It's not that I don't want to, I can't.

358
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:51,780
And what's the point?
She'll repeat the same thing again.

359
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:53,175
What thing?

360
00:26:53,304 --> 00:26:55,468
"Get married," or whatever.

361
00:26:55,902 --> 00:26:56,831
Already?

362
00:26:57,143 --> 00:26:57,976
No way.

363
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:02,721
Are you saying that as my friend
or as the CEO?

364
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,723
Both.

365
00:27:06,943 --> 00:27:09,220
Just get it over with.

366
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:11,396
Do it while I'm still here.

367
00:27:11,487 --> 00:27:14,533
Once I enter the seminary,
I won't be able to attend your wedding.

368
00:27:15,097 --> 00:27:16,439
You're really going this time?

369
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:18,153
I've already submitted
the application form....

370
00:27:18,515 --> 00:27:19,348
...yesterday.

371
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,820
-What!
-What!

372
00:27:21,153 --> 00:27:22,338
Why tell us that now?

373
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:23,483
Please don't move.

374
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:25,844
She said you can't move.

375
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:27,497
I can move my foot, right?

376
00:27:29,283 --> 00:27:31,418
Now this is like a comedy.

377
00:27:31,503 --> 00:27:34,067
You're one to talk.
Your life's a soap opera.

378
00:27:34,268 --> 00:27:35,236
I can move my foot, right?

379
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,594
Your nails are done..

380
00:27:38,175 --> 00:27:40,084
Why is yours done now?

381
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,623
Who's this?

382
00:27:45,183 --> 00:27:46,099
Hello?

383
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:48,073
Are you the guardian of Han Sookhee?

384
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:51,528
What?

385
00:28:10,137 --> 00:28:10,986
Mom.

386
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:12,774
Hey.

387
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:14,960
You're here.

388
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:16,683
Mom...

389
00:28:17,877 --> 00:28:18,884
What are you doing here?

390
00:28:20,147 --> 00:28:21,624
Don't you have work today?

391
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:23,936
I didn't think you would come
because you're busy.

392
00:28:24,263 --> 00:28:25,875
What are you doing here?

393
00:28:26,253 --> 00:28:28,173
Why are you in the hospital?

394
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:32,442
Pancreatic cancer is...

395
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:34,863
...difficult to be found
in the early stage.

396
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:39,891
The early symptoms are
similar to stomachaches.

397
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:41,876
When the symptoms start showing...

398
00:28:42,392 --> 00:28:44,690
... it means the cancer's
already advanced.

399
00:28:45,713 --> 00:28:48,800
When she came to the emergency room...

400
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:51,482
...she was already aware
about her cancer.

401
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:54,815
What are the chances
of her pulling through?

402
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,398
In your mother's case...

403
00:28:59,622 --> 00:29:01,298
... it's less than 10 percent.

404
00:29:06,695 --> 00:29:07,629
Then...

405
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:10,418
How...

406
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,862
How long does she have?

407
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:22,667
About one month...

408
00:29:23,772 --> 00:29:25,065
... at best.

409
00:29:35,829 --> 00:29:36,954
No way...

410
00:29:41,575 --> 00:29:43,215
It can't be...

411
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,149
Mom.

412
00:30:03,695 --> 00:30:04,528
Yeah?

413
00:30:05,313 --> 00:30:06,479
What's that for?

414
00:30:07,092 --> 00:30:10,342
For Kingkang to wear
when the weather gets cold.

415
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:15,524
Do you...

416
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:18,421
...have to make that right now?

417
00:30:19,172 --> 00:30:21,155
If not now, then when?

418
00:30:24,773 --> 00:30:26,139
Doesn't it make you angry?

419
00:30:27,307 --> 00:30:28,941
Don't you feel wronged?

420
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,075
I am angry.

421
00:30:37,914 --> 00:30:38,874
I do feel wronged.

422
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:43,250
But it's just one of those things.

423
00:30:44,533 --> 00:30:45,462
Do you know...

424
00:30:47,756 --> 00:30:49,431
...what I was doing?

425
00:30:51,855 --> 00:30:53,385
Before I got here...

426
00:30:55,342 --> 00:30:57,227
...I was getting nail care.

427
00:30:59,989 --> 00:31:03,751
When you were on the floor in agony...

428
00:31:06,713 --> 00:31:08,967
...I was getting my stupid nails done.

429
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:11,779
Segye...

430
00:31:11,864 --> 00:31:14,374
I got your call when I was
at the nail shop.

431
00:31:16,848 --> 00:31:17,781
I...

432
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:22,887
... didn't even know you were like this.

433
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,052
I thought you were going to nag again.

434
00:31:30,368 --> 00:31:32,324
So I didn't pick up your call.

435
00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:36,895
It's okay.

436
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:38,562
You didn't know.

437
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:41,245
So why did you keep me in the dark?

438
00:31:45,846 --> 00:31:48,494
Why didn't you say anything
and make me a bad daughter?

439
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:50,713
How much would I...

440
00:31:53,176 --> 00:31:57,110
How much would I resent myself
if that was the last moment?

441
00:31:59,562 --> 00:32:00,935
How could I...

442
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:06,342
How could I live with myself?

443
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:08,902
I'm sorry.

444
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:11,543
I just...

445
00:32:12,273 --> 00:32:13,106
I didn't...

446
00:32:14,387 --> 00:32:16,278
...want you to be heartbroken.

447
00:32:21,445 --> 00:32:23,120
You're only thinking about me again.

448
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,957
You and I both make it all about me.

449
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:32,217
Why did you spend your entire life
thinking about me?

450
00:32:34,473 --> 00:32:36,300
Because you're my daughter.

451
00:32:37,854 --> 00:32:40,377
You're my only child.

452
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:29,058
The weather today is so nice.

453
00:33:32,115 --> 00:33:33,036
Yes it is.

454
00:33:33,894 --> 00:33:35,134
The weather is...

455
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:36,866
...so nice.

456
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,119
Don't get sick.

457
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:45,487
I like you.

458
00:33:47,434 --> 00:33:49,620
It's not because you're with my daughter.

459
00:33:50,247 --> 00:33:52,272
I just like you.

460
00:33:52,842 --> 00:33:56,837
So I hope you stay healthy.

461
00:33:58,391 --> 00:34:00,496
I hope you have a happy life.

462
00:34:06,618 --> 00:34:08,169
Thank you for the presents.

463
00:34:09,272 --> 00:34:10,865
It wasn't much.

464
00:34:12,571 --> 00:34:14,371
I just wanted to receive gifts.

465
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:18,030
I thought I won't get another chance.

466
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,892
So I accepted them
even though I shouldn't have.

467
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:22,522
You did good.

468
00:34:28,158 --> 00:34:29,824
When I let go of her hand...

469
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:32,428
...please hold it for me.

470
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:35,907
I've passed on...

471
00:34:36,396 --> 00:34:37,842
...the baton over to you now.

472
00:34:39,474 --> 00:34:40,307
Yes.

473
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,160
Is Segye's movie almost done filming?

474
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:49,921
We should...

475
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,082
...go watch the movie together.

476
00:34:53,688 --> 00:34:55,462
Will you buy the popcorn?

477
00:34:56,376 --> 00:34:57,563
I'll buy the tickets...

478
00:34:57,823 --> 00:34:59,368
...and the drinks.

479
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:03,828
I'll be happy to go since my
son-in-law will treat everything.

480
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:18,847
Even though we knew
that we cannot keep them...

481
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,591
...we still made promises.

482
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,584
Is it because we want to be sadder?

483
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,264
Or because we want to be less sad?

484
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,776
I'm not sure about that.

485
00:35:31,782 --> 00:35:32,615
But...

486
00:35:33,563 --> 00:35:35,270
...maybe it's because...

487
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,636
...we hope to keep that promise.

488
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:40,444
Mom, look over here.

489
00:35:40,528 --> 00:35:42,979
Death may seem far away...

490
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:45,143
...but it's always near us.

491
00:35:45,538 --> 00:35:47,201
It's actually a video.

492
00:35:47,286 --> 00:35:50,749
You should've told me.
I didn't even wear lipstick.

493
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:52,469
You're pretty without it anyway.

494
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:54,163
I look prettier when I apply lipstick.

495
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:56,598
Sure you do.

496
00:35:56,683 --> 00:35:59,057
-Zooming in...
-Stop recording!

497
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:03,133
When we become aware of its existence...

498
00:36:03,646 --> 00:36:05,324
...it's already right next to us.

499
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,850
And we can't run away from it.

500
00:36:10,594 --> 00:36:14,096
It's so cute and adorable.

501
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,174
It's way too cute.

502
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:18,420
That goes without saying.

503
00:36:18,658 --> 00:36:21,046
I don't make things that aren't cute.

504
00:36:21,153 --> 00:36:24,347
Sure, of course you don't.

505
00:36:25,169 --> 00:36:26,751
It's a gift for Kingkang...

506
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:32,187
...so she can live with you
for a long time without catching cold.

507
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,033
I have to tell her.

508
00:36:43,848 --> 00:36:45,319
I love you, Mom.

509
00:36:57,386 --> 00:36:58,614
Mom, I love you.

510
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:01,991
-I love you.
-Love you, Mom.

511
00:37:02,712 --> 00:37:05,911
-I love you a hundred times.
-Mommy loves you too.

512
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,142
I love you, Mom.

513
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:36,570
Mom, I love you.

514
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:44,230
Because time always...

515
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:47,172
...passes by faster than we think.

516
00:37:48,192 --> 00:37:50,568
I'll be out of the country for a while.

517
00:37:50,705 --> 00:37:52,621
-I'm sorry.
-Enjoy your trip.

518
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:09,749
Already?

519
00:39:16,972 --> 00:39:17,840
Why...

520
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:23,316
Why now?

521
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:27,135
Why...?

522
00:39:49,142 --> 00:39:50,221
Segye.

523
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:52,464
Don't worry too much.

524
00:39:53,788 --> 00:39:55,360
You don't have to be sorry.

525
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:56,825
Okay.

526
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:03,801
Ma'am.

527
00:40:08,162 --> 00:40:09,297
Where's Segye?

528
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,442
She's filming right now.
It was too important for her to miss.

529
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:22,232
My daughter's a star. It is what it is.

530
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:26,550
She'll be here any minute.

531
00:41:12,547 --> 00:41:14,072
Time's passing by.

532
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:20,963
Night falls, morning rises.

533
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:22,360
Noon comes around...

534
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,543
… then evening and night falls again.

535
00:41:37,093 --> 00:41:39,158
Heartbreaking days...

536
00:41:40,145 --> 00:41:42,097
...passes by meaninglessly.

537
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,774
When you get sick...

538
00:41:49,076 --> 00:41:50,575
...I feel like it's all my fault.

539
00:41:51,513 --> 00:41:54,579
I feel like you're taking punishment
for my wrongdoings.

540
00:42:00,448 --> 00:42:01,281
Please...

541
00:42:02,075 --> 00:42:05,661
If there is God, please help
me change as soon as possible.

542
00:42:06,115 --> 00:42:08,526
Even if it's just one day earlier...

543
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,902
(Uncle)

544
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:26,848
Hello?

545
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,090
Your voice...

546
00:42:29,352 --> 00:42:30,451
...is different.

547
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:33,080
I've changed again...

548
00:42:33,581 --> 00:42:34,769
...in the midst of everything.

549
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:36,453
I'm sorry...

550
00:42:37,256 --> 00:42:38,971
...for not being there for you.

551
00:42:41,056 --> 00:42:43,617
You're keeping me company now.

552
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,863
Ms. Han...

553
00:42:48,614 --> 00:42:52,115
Can you please call me, "Segye"?

554
00:42:54,061 --> 00:42:56,173
I'm desperate to hear that.

555
00:42:58,298 --> 00:42:59,243
Segye...

556
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:02,561
Can you...

557
00:43:03,611 --> 00:43:04,913
...say that one more time?

558
00:43:06,603 --> 00:43:07,594
Segye.

559
00:43:15,423 --> 00:43:16,256
Now...

560
00:43:17,155 --> 00:43:18,911
...I feel like myself again.

561
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:24,969
(Yoo Woomi)

562
00:43:26,677 --> 00:43:31,275
I have another call. I'll call you again.

563
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:36,908
Who...?

564
00:45:09,743 --> 00:45:10,659
Segye?

565
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:14,025
Mom...

566
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:16,135
Mom...

567
00:45:20,524 --> 00:45:21,357
Segye...

568
00:45:23,224 --> 00:45:24,387
You came.

569
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:29,208
I thought you'd be too busy to come.

570
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,784
I'm so sorry...

571
00:45:35,048 --> 00:45:36,862
I'm so sorry...

572
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,146
I'm...

573
00:45:41,335 --> 00:45:42,936
I'm sorry...

574
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,427
It must've been so hard for you...

575
00:45:50,185 --> 00:45:52,504
...and I didn't know.

576
00:45:55,435 --> 00:45:56,387
I...

577
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,224
My heart aches so much.

578
00:46:02,752 --> 00:46:04,541
It's not your fault.

579
00:46:06,286 --> 00:46:08,933
It's not your fault at all.

580
00:46:10,418 --> 00:46:12,323
I thought I would never...

581
00:46:12,563 --> 00:46:14,238
...see you old.

582
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,993
It's nice to see you like this.

583
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:27,826
It feels like we're friends.

584
00:46:28,802 --> 00:46:29,635
How nice.

585
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:31,589
Mom...

586
00:46:32,612 --> 00:46:34,108
Mom...

587
00:46:37,064 --> 00:46:38,529
Next time...

588
00:46:39,928 --> 00:46:41,499
I will...

589
00:46:45,111 --> 00:46:48,764
...recognize you sooner.

590
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:53,244
So...

591
00:46:54,622 --> 00:46:55,980
...when we're born again...

592
00:46:59,732 --> 00:47:00,833
Let's...

593
00:47:02,392 --> 00:47:03,929
...live together.

594
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:06,204
Okay.

595
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:10,658
Be my daughter again...

596
00:47:13,385 --> 00:47:14,874
...in your next life.

597
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:16,921
Next time...

598
00:47:18,228 --> 00:47:19,458
I will...

599
00:47:22,716 --> 00:47:25,648
...be a better mom.

600
00:47:30,939 --> 00:47:31,836
Mom...

601
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:33,493
No, don't go.

602
00:47:35,147 --> 00:47:37,566
You have to see me before you go.

603
00:47:39,072 --> 00:47:41,726
You have to see my face!

604
00:47:43,423 --> 00:47:44,565
I can...

605
00:47:46,824 --> 00:47:48,138
Even when I close my eyes...

606
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:51,754
I see...

607
00:47:53,795 --> 00:47:54,723
...your face.

608
00:48:09,037 --> 00:48:10,126
Mom?

609
00:48:12,117 --> 00:48:13,265
Mom?

610
00:48:15,294 --> 00:48:16,141
Mom...

611
00:48:16,872 --> 00:48:18,437
Open your eyes!

612
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:20,798
Mom!

613
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:22,234
Mom...

614
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:25,136
Mom, open your eyes!

615
00:48:25,582 --> 00:48:26,513
Mom!

616
00:48:27,457 --> 00:48:28,412
Mom!

617
00:48:29,062 --> 00:48:30,602
Mom!

618
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:34,256
Mom!

619
00:48:34,341 --> 00:48:36,432
-Excuse me.
-Mom...

620
00:48:37,909 --> 00:48:41,400
Mom! Mom...

621
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,254
Mom...

622
00:48:50,648 --> 00:48:52,496
I will confirm her death.

623
00:48:52,853 --> 00:48:55,105
On October 30th, 2018.

624
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:57,270
At 11:20 AM.

625
00:48:57,652 --> 00:48:59,726
Han Sookhee passed away.

626
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:00,971
Mom...

627
00:49:01,526 --> 00:49:04,917
Mom... Mom!

628
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:07,712
Mom!

629
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,173
Segye...

630
00:49:10,258 --> 00:49:11,120
Mom...

631
00:49:11,652 --> 00:49:12,485
Mom...

632
00:49:12,748 --> 00:49:13,612
Let's go.

633
00:49:13,847 --> 00:49:14,728
Mom.

634
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:25,670
Just wait here for a moment. I'll...

635
00:49:26,788 --> 00:49:28,125
I got it covered.

636
00:49:29,307 --> 00:49:30,650
Just wait here.

637
00:50:13,181 --> 00:50:14,291
I'm sorry...

638
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:17,615
...I'm late.

639
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,413
I'm sorry.

640
00:50:38,218 --> 00:50:39,690
The food you made for me...

641
00:50:41,078 --> 00:50:42,406
...was really good.

642
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,613
Your daughter...

643
00:50:46,936 --> 00:50:48,201
I will love her...

644
00:50:50,337 --> 00:50:51,734
...even more.

645
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,395
Please rest in peace.

646
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:24,941
What is this?

647
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:28,485
What is all this?

648
00:52:20,962 --> 00:52:22,046
Where's Segye?

649
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:26,064
She went out to calm down.

650
00:54:25,571 --> 00:54:26,740
Why not sooner...

651
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,606
Why couldn't I change...

652
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,374
...a little sooner.

653
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:40,844
So my mom could see
my face before she left...

654
00:55:01,406 --> 00:55:02,239
Lipstick...

655
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,975
No one was there.

656
00:55:31,384 --> 00:55:33,230
I didn't see her go in.

657
00:55:52,378 --> 00:55:53,304
Are they back together?

658
00:55:53,638 --> 00:55:55,093
He came to the funeral, they must be...

659
00:55:55,178 --> 00:55:57,963
I thought they broke up.
Are they back together?

660
00:56:00,259 --> 00:56:01,532
You didn't have to do this.

661
00:56:03,364 --> 00:56:04,493
You'll get in trouble...

662
00:56:05,817 --> 00:56:07,231
...because of me.

663
00:56:21,913 --> 00:56:24,853
You're the saddest person here right now.

664
00:56:26,124 --> 00:56:27,184
It's silly of you...

665
00:56:28,466 --> 00:56:30,302
...to care about me right now.

666
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:15,766
What are you going to do now?

667
00:57:16,275 --> 00:57:17,671
Your mom's gone.

668
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,223
-Hey.
-After a hard time...

669
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,482
...all those refined words...

670
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:26,109
...didn't console me at all.

671
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:31,281
That's how it was for me.

672
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,400
"Cheer up" or "you will pull through"...

673
00:57:36,493 --> 00:57:37,756
Instead of words like that...

674
00:57:39,674 --> 00:57:42,792
"How will you live your life from now on?"

675
00:57:44,245 --> 00:57:45,845
I felt those who said that...

676
00:57:46,926 --> 00:57:48,472
...were more sincere.

677
00:57:50,886 --> 00:57:52,342
That's why I'm asking you.

678
00:57:53,229 --> 00:57:54,062
I thought...

679
00:57:55,352 --> 00:57:57,146
...you didn't like me.

680
00:58:00,905 --> 00:58:03,160
My brother likes you.

681
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:09,086
That's why I'm here.

682
00:58:12,567 --> 00:58:13,408
He's still...

683
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:17,220
...my brother.

684
00:58:18,741 --> 00:58:19,637
Thank you...

685
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:21,591
...for coming.

686
00:58:23,609 --> 00:58:25,735
I will remember
that you were here for me...

687
00:58:26,541 --> 00:58:27,704
...when I was sad.

688
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,763
Don't remember petty things like that.

689
00:58:38,025 --> 00:58:39,139
Seriously...

690
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,225
I really didn't want to...

691
00:58:43,972 --> 00:58:45,443
...but now I'm about to say this.

692
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:55,565
Hang in there.

693
00:58:56,724 --> 00:58:57,789
I mean it.

694
00:59:28,053 --> 00:59:30,760
She will pretend like everything's okay.

695
00:59:32,681 --> 00:59:36,288
She might even bring up her pain first.

696
00:59:36,835 --> 00:59:39,876
She might try to use her pain
as a joke to laugh.

697
00:59:41,897 --> 00:59:42,846
But...

698
00:59:45,267 --> 00:59:47,735
...they're all fake.

699
00:59:51,442 --> 00:59:52,725
I was like that.

700
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,082
When my mom...

701
00:59:55,537 --> 00:59:57,539
...was gone.

702
01:00:02,881 --> 01:00:04,362
Take care of your friend.

703
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:06,225
With love.

704
01:00:10,912 --> 01:00:12,987
As you'll be serving the Lord.

705
01:00:18,883 --> 01:00:19,850
I'll leave now.

706
01:00:21,331 --> 01:00:23,284
I didn't come here to hit on you.

707
01:00:24,811 --> 01:00:26,500
I came here to console her.

708
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:29,267
Keep up the good work.

709
01:00:30,524 --> 01:00:32,456
I enjoyed the coffee.

710
01:01:05,586 --> 01:01:08,049
Segye, you should get some sleep.

711
01:01:09,631 --> 01:01:11,311
How can I?

712
01:01:13,304 --> 01:01:14,835
I can't sleep.

713
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:18,456
Then just cry.

714
01:01:19,993 --> 01:01:22,283
The chief mourner can't cry.

715
01:01:24,117 --> 01:01:25,348
If I start crying...

716
01:01:26,306 --> 01:01:27,951
...everyone else will.

717
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:29,234
Just cry.

718
01:01:29,933 --> 01:01:32,088
I'll be the chief mourner
and you can cry.

719
01:01:35,186 --> 01:01:37,360
I'll hold my tears until it's over.

720
01:01:39,048 --> 01:01:40,929
Just go ahead and cry, you idiot.

721
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,069
I won't cry.

722
01:01:47,123 --> 01:01:48,538
You guys can cry.

723
01:02:43,101 --> 01:02:44,116
Shall we...

724
01:02:46,623 --> 01:02:47,650
...go out for a second?

725
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:57,825
Could my mom...

726
01:03:00,471 --> 01:03:02,212
...have known already?

727
01:03:05,504 --> 01:03:07,387
Even though I had that face...

728
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,796
...she recognized me instantly.

729
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:17,827
I don't think she knew.

730
01:03:21,302 --> 01:03:22,626
She didn't know...

731
01:03:24,151 --> 01:03:25,437
...but right at that moment...

732
01:03:27,618 --> 01:03:29,146
...she must have figured it out.

733
01:03:34,302 --> 01:03:35,645
It was like that for me.

734
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:39,528
You were standing there and crying...

735
01:03:41,856 --> 01:03:43,968
...and I was able to recognize
you immediately.

736
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:51,728
"You're standing there and crying"...

737
01:03:52,068 --> 01:03:52,901
...I thought.

738
01:03:56,395 --> 01:03:58,167
Your mother would've thought
the same thing.

739
01:04:03,151 --> 01:04:04,908
"Segye is crying."

740
01:04:06,681 --> 01:04:07,721
"My daughter"...

741
01:04:09,156 --> 01:04:10,486
..."is crying."

742
01:04:17,003 --> 01:04:18,788
My mom's pretty sharp.

743
01:04:22,218 --> 01:04:24,799
"What would I do without my mom?"

744
01:04:28,131 --> 01:04:31,083
"I'm going to be alone from now on"
That's what I was thinking.

745
01:04:33,238 --> 01:04:35,086
But I wasn't alone.

746
01:04:38,711 --> 01:04:40,758
I have Woomi by my side.

747
01:04:42,995 --> 01:04:44,724
I have Eunho.

748
01:04:46,308 --> 01:04:47,917
And I have you.

749
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,832
Your people also came for me.

750
01:04:54,819 --> 01:04:56,558
And other people...

751
01:05:00,456 --> 01:05:03,566
And more others came for me.

752
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:09,655
I am not alone.

753
01:05:12,484 --> 01:05:13,782
I know that.

754
01:05:16,247 --> 01:05:17,514
I know that very well.

755
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:21,863
But...

756
01:05:25,434 --> 01:05:26,717
And yet...

757
01:05:31,128 --> 01:05:32,962
...I still miss my mom.

758
01:05:36,914 --> 01:05:38,435
Why me?

759
01:05:41,011 --> 01:05:42,839
Why me of all people?

760
01:05:46,011 --> 01:05:48,450
What did I do so wrong...

761
01:05:51,355 --> 01:05:53,358
What could I have done so wrong...

762
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:57,427
...that I couldn't...

763
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:03,055
...show my real face to my mom
until she passed away?

764
01:06:08,027 --> 01:06:09,074
Segye...

765
01:06:09,158 --> 01:06:10,996
What if one day...

766
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:16,139
...I don't come back to my real face?

767
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:22,178
What if I suddenly get into an accident
when I have a different face?

768
01:06:26,704 --> 01:06:30,207
What if I suddenly die
with a different face?

769
01:06:33,725 --> 01:06:36,198
And what if nobody knows that it's me?

770
01:06:41,344 --> 01:06:42,935
That scares me.

771
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:49,772
Isn't it funny?

772
01:06:53,517 --> 01:06:55,144
My mom's dead...

773
01:06:58,541 --> 01:07:00,250
...and that's the first thing
I thought of.

774
01:07:06,438 --> 01:07:07,757
If you do...

775
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:11,531
I will find you.

776
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,273
I will find you...

777
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:24,814
...and hold your hand...

778
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,511
...like this.
