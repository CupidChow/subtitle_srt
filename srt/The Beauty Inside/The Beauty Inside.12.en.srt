1
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:20,846
(Aunt)

2
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:28,670
Are you okay?

3
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:30,421
I heard from Woomi.

4
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:32,059
I'll explain to Woomi...

5
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,292
Hello?

6
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:37,758
Hello?

7
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:57,056
What are you doing?

8
00:00:57,353 --> 00:00:58,537
Is it true?

9
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:02,080
Tell me if it's true.

10
00:01:04,693 --> 00:01:06,479
That you can't recognize people's faces.

11
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:15,582
I'm sorry. I'll call you again.

12
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:19,798
What's this?

13
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:23,653
Proof that you're ill.

14
00:01:24,463 --> 00:01:26,180
Records of your accident.

15
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:29,714
I'm sure...

16
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:31,142
...I've already...

17
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:32,772
Already got rid of them?

18
00:01:35,272 --> 00:01:36,809
Is that what you care about, right now?

19
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,674
No matter how you use my weakness...

20
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,386
Do you think that low of me?

21
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,955
Why are you making me a cheap coward?

22
00:01:53,343 --> 00:01:54,387
Who do you think you are?

23
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,363
Who are you to go easy on me?

24
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:02,845
Let's go in.

25
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:04,303
We can talk when we get inside.

26
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:32,681
(Medical Record Seo Dojae)

27
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:45,742
All this time...

28
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:49,866
...I thought you've been
ignoring me on purpose.

29
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:56,820
But it was all a misunderstanding.

30
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,360
You're ill...

31
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:02,733
...and here I thought...

32
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:06,237
I did recognize you.

33
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:10,116
Though there were times that I couldn't,

34
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:12,669
but I do recognize you most of the time.

35
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:18,134
You walk very straight.

36
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:19,590
And you're always...

37
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:21,470
...bold.

38
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,466
You're usually mad at me
when we run into each other.

39
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:27,970
And when you do...

40
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,598
...I get to hear your voice first.

41
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:33,454
The reason I was mad...

42
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:34,702
It's because of me, right?

43
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:36,714
I know.

44
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:42,381
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,200
What about Dad?

46
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:58,559
How do you recognize Dad?

47
00:03:59,842 --> 00:04:00,985
As for Dad...

48
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:03,178
...I didn't really...

49
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,243
...have to try hard to tell him apart.

50
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,154
Whenever I see him, he's usually
the one to greet me first.

51
00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:14,168
And he also held my hand first.

52
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:17,237
Even though...

53
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:20,461
...he had no idea about my condition.

54
00:04:28,676 --> 00:04:30,159
To tell you the truth,
I'm a little surprised.

55
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:33,014
I've imagined...

56
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:35,184
...situations like this a lot of times.

57
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,046
It's always the worst-case scenario
every single time.

58
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,720
I didn't expect for you to say that.

59
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:45,291
What do you mean?

60
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:46,929
You sound like...

61
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:50,355
...a real younger sister.

62
00:04:58,035 --> 00:05:00,135
You're really making me feel horrible.

63
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,093
You better tell me the truth.

64
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:27,327
What is there to tell you?

65
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:29,921
He just made a mistake.

66
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:32,511
He definitely made eye contact with me.

67
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:34,122
Well...

68
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,870
...that's because it's too dark.

69
00:05:35,955 --> 00:05:39,282
Not that dark enough
that he couldn't see my face.

70
00:05:43,764 --> 00:05:44,731
All right.

71
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:47,312
Last time, you said
that he wasn't even shocked...

72
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:49,343
...when he saw you change, right?

73
00:05:50,344 --> 00:05:51,917
Why wasn't he shocked?

74
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,679
Woomi...

75
00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:57,917
I know...

76
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,952
You would've told me
if it's something you can tell people.

77
00:06:05,604 --> 00:06:06,736
I don't even know anymore.

78
00:06:07,262 --> 00:06:08,220
I'm so dumbfounded.

79
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:10,929
Why is everyone being so careless?

80
00:06:12,654 --> 00:06:13,911
Just go get some sleep.

81
00:06:14,316 --> 00:06:15,402
I'm leaving.

82
00:06:32,707 --> 00:06:33,705
(Uncle)

83
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,750
(Uncle)

84
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:50,349
Dr. Oh.

85
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:53,013
Is it possible for Mr. Seo's
condition to get worse?

86
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:56,834
Regarding that illness,
there's no such thing as "getting worse".

87
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:59,976
It doesn't get worse nor better.

88
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:00,933
But...

89
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:03,143
...he's been receiving treatment
from you for years.

90
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:05,031
That illness is incurable.

91
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:07,405
There is no way to cure it.

92
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:08,635
All this time...

93
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:12,728
...I've only been helping Seo Dojae
with the things that he needs to do.

94
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,224
Like what?

95
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,412
Coming to terms with it.

96
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:19,491
Even though it won't...

97
00:07:19,576 --> 00:07:21,817
...improve or deteriorate his condition...

98
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,527
...it makes his life better.

99
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,593
I've simply been helping Seo Dojae...

100
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:31,602
...so that he won't torture himself.

101
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,881
Sara knows about my condition now.

102
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,387
I'll resign.

103
00:08:00,544 --> 00:08:01,720
It's my fault.

104
00:08:02,268 --> 00:08:03,701
I'll take responsibility for it.

105
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,269
Why is my condition your responsibility?

106
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:11,822
I didn't take you as someone
who runs away when things get bad.

107
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:13,785
I thought wrong of you.

108
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,750
What happened?

109
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:19,758
She found my medical records.

110
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:21,935
That's impossible. We've already...

111
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,866
...got rid of the records.
Or so we thought.

112
00:08:24,486 --> 00:08:26,718
But looks like someone
made the effort to find it.

113
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:29,071
Do you think Director Kim did it?

114
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:30,190
I don't know...

115
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,098
I'm not sure yet.

116
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:35,311
I will keep an eye on him for now.

117
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:41,054
Joohwan.

118
00:08:43,884 --> 00:08:44,919
Thanks.

119
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:49,504
Give me a raise then.

120
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,066
I think Woomi had it figured out.

121
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:10,444
There's nothing I can do
because I'm so worried.

122
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:14,455
I have a girlfriend
who is worried about me.

123
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,686
I like it.

124
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:19,227
I'm being really serious right now.

125
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:21,595
I'm also being serious about liking you.

126
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:24,925
Well, of course
I seriously like you too...

127
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:27,379
I like you, but...

128
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:28,394
What does...

129
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:30,965
...she mean to you?

130
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:34,676
What does she mean to me?

131
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,488
Well...

132
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,578
...we've always been there for each other.

133
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:45,560
And we'll continue to be
there for each other.

134
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:47,286
You'll be friends forever?

135
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:50,081
Yes.

136
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:52,809
Even if Woomi runs away
because she hates me...

137
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll hold on to her so she won't leave me.

138
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:57,818
I have no choice then.

139
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:01,974
I'll have to hold on to her as well.

140
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,720
If I want to stay with you forever.

141
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:14,769
I'm seriously so done with drinking.

142
00:10:14,854 --> 00:10:16,910
I refuse to drink even a drop of alcohol
for the time being.

143
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:18,592
Goodness.

144
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:20,824
The hangover must have been terrible.

145
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:24,715
Geez. You always went on
about being a priest.

146
00:10:32,688 --> 00:10:33,844
Hi. You're here?

147
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,552
What's going on?

148
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:40,673
I don't think we can do this sober.

149
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:58,984
Sit down. What are you waiting for?

150
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:04,501
Drink up! Drink up!

151
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:06,322
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

152
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,064
Let me pour you a shot.

153
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,571
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

154
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:17,682
You drank it all up.

155
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:20,690
So that's what happened.

156
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,822
That's why you're such a jerk.

157
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,692
-Hey!
-What?

158
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:29,172
You're the one who called him a jerk
in the first place.

159
00:11:29,873 --> 00:11:32,700
Did I really come across as a jerk?

160
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,027
No. No.

161
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:36,403
It's okay.

162
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:39,450
That's how people are.

163
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:41,373
When you're in that situation...

164
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:46,398
...you tend to become very passive
and sensitive.

165
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,629
I understand you.

166
00:11:48,814 --> 00:11:50,548
I mean, you also know, right?

167
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:53,859
Segye is also like that.

168
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:55,891
She's really like that.

169
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:58,537
What do you mean by "really like that?"

170
00:11:58,825 --> 00:11:59,938
You're really...

171
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:01,938
You can be...

172
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:04,555
...really mean.

173
00:12:04,846 --> 00:12:05,764
You get what I mean, right?

174
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:06,838
Geez.

175
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:08,782
Do you want to see
how mean I can really be?

176
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:10,417
Sorry.

177
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:12,655
I'm sorry...

178
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,035
...for hating you...

179
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:16,961
...this whole time.

180
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,676
You hated me?

181
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:23,591
Well, we weren't exactly
fond of you anyway.

182
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:26,672
Geez. How can you say that to his face?

183
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:30,720
You should've told him that long ago.

184
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,702
Oh my.

185
00:12:36,832 --> 00:12:38,665
You must be drunk. You're laughing.

186
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:41,176
I'm not drunk. I'm just...

187
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:43,947
...in a good mood.

188
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:46,833
That's exactly what it means to be drunk.

189
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:50,163
What about tomorrow?
Do you have anything on your schedule?

190
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:52,013
Of course, she does.

191
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:53,817
But that's okay.

192
00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:55,508
Drink up! Drink up!

193
00:12:55,593 --> 00:12:57,073
What are you talking about?

194
00:12:57,158 --> 00:12:58,298
Hey!

195
00:12:58,617 --> 00:13:00,780
Just because you're going to change
your hairstyle a little bit,

196
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:03,444
it doesn't mean you can't get drunk.

197
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,308
You're changing your hairstyle?

198
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:09,314
She has a commercial to shoot.

199
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,961
It'll just be a tiny change.

200
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:15,587
It's going to be a tiny change to us,

201
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:19,417
but it's going to look
totally different on camera.

202
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:20,703
That's right.

203
00:13:20,807 --> 00:13:23,910
You might get confused
if she changes her hairstyle.

204
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:30,614
Then, should I send you a picture of her,
whenever she changes her hairstyle?

205
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:32,251
-Would that be helpful?
-Great idea.

206
00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:34,784
Why would you send
pictures to my boyfriend?

207
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,765
Geez... you lovesick fool.

208
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,799
I didn't raise her to be like that.

209
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:46,903
There's something I've always
been curious about.

210
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:51,168
When you answered her phone last time...

211
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:54,806
...why did you tell me
that she's taking a shower?

212
00:13:55,296 --> 00:13:56,135
Oh no.

213
00:13:57,774 --> 00:13:58,938
What should we do?

214
00:13:59,023 --> 00:14:02,884
This guy, he may be an adult,
but he doesn't know anything.

215
00:14:02,969 --> 00:14:04,781
That's not true. I do know a little.

216
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:06,531
You do?

217
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,301
Is that so?

218
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:09,398
Then, why did you...

219
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:10,531
It's true.

220
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:11,644
I know stuff.

221
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:12,796
Oh my. Really?

222
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:13,974
What do you know?

223
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:17,136
-Why did you tell me that...
-I know how babies are made!

224
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:18,333
What?

225
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:21,236
You know how babies are made?

226
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:23,697
Babies come out of your belly button.

227
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:26,441
That's how you become a parent.

228
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:28,481
The baby will come out
of your belly button like this...

229
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,239
That's okay.

230
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:32,204
I don't really care.

231
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,665
-Our Eunho is all grown up.
-That's correct.

232
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:39,809
Are you feeling better after this walk?

233
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,494
That's what I want to ask you.

234
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:44,260
Are you sober now?

235
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,098
I'm not drunk.

236
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:49,241
Yet, you were smiling all the time.

237
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:50,709
That's because...

238
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:51,985
...I was happy.

239
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,547
I was happy and surprised.

240
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:58,474
Thank you for being nice to my friends.

241
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:00,514
I'm more thankful to you.

242
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:04,935
I thought I won't be able
to do this my whole life.

243
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:07,521
I thought...

244
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:10,446
...I will never have any friends.

245
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:14,199
Isn't it interesting?

246
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,006
I found love...

247
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:19,219
...but I've also got friendship.

248
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:21,576
Actually...

249
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,774
...those two come together.

250
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:26,722
Friendship is a type of love.

251
00:15:35,898 --> 00:15:37,492
I couldn't find any information on her.

252
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:39,244
She doesn't have any children.

253
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,198
It seems like she has a boyfriend...

254
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:42,401
...but that's Seo Dojae.

255
00:15:42,486 --> 00:15:45,513
Well, that's something you can find
on the Internet though.

256
00:15:48,618 --> 00:15:51,333
You called me over at this hour
to tell me that?

257
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:53,644
You're not doing enough
for the amount I paid you.

258
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:54,640
There's one more thing.

259
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:57,769
This might seem strange in a way.

260
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,977
You don't see her entering the toilet.
You only see her coming out.

261
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,111
What's this?

262
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:31,716
Does it make sense?

263
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:35,574
Why don't we...

264
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:38,394
...have a mom?

265
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:42,652
Where did that kid suddenly pop out from?

266
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:46,725
Five days before and after
have always been risky.

267
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:48,262
It's okay.

268
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:52,125
"Five days before and after"?

(Han Segye Disappeared During
an Award Ceremony Again)

275
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:19,839
Am I going crazy because
I'm digging too deep into this?

276
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:22,310
Wait a second.

277
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,752
There is a reasonable explanation.

278
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:31,973
-I'll be in the waiting room.
-Okay.

279
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:35,323
Oh my. Segye.

280
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:37,327
How have you been?

281
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:39,273
Fancy to meet you here.

282
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:41,167
See?

283
00:17:41,251 --> 00:17:43,843
I told you we might see
each other again soon.

284
00:17:43,928 --> 00:17:45,524
Are you here to get your hair done?

285
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:47,113
I'm starting a reality show soon.

286
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:49,590
It's a show where they'll film me 24/7.

287
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:50,859
Is that so?

288
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:52,719
I think I've seen an article or two.

289
00:17:52,804 --> 00:17:54,325
By the way...

290
00:17:54,622 --> 00:17:59,609
...do you remember the child actor
that suddenly show up at our filming set?

291
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,387
A child actor?

292
00:18:04,828 --> 00:18:05,728
Who?

293
00:18:07,331 --> 00:18:09,561
You probably don't know...

294
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:13,724
...after you suddenly disappeared.
A little boy suddenly appeared.

295
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:16,951
It was as if he was replacing you.

296
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:22,404
Do you think this is some kind of magic?

297
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:24,942
A person doesn't disappear or appear
suddenly like that.

298
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:27,284
My point exactly.

299
00:18:27,714 --> 00:18:29,426
It sounds like magic right?

300
00:18:30,312 --> 00:18:34,532
No matter how hard I try to find.
I don't know his name nor his number.

301
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:36,538
He's my relative.

302
00:18:37,736 --> 00:18:39,940
His name is Yoo Woojoo. He's 10 years old.

303
00:18:40,096 --> 00:18:42,249
He's not in Korea now, though. Why?

304
00:18:42,596 --> 00:18:43,898
Do you want to meet him?

305
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,360
Ms. Yoo...

306
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:47,923
Can I really meet him?

307
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,300
He was so cute.

308
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:52,385
I want him to appear in my reality show.

309
00:18:54,077 --> 00:18:56,241
It's so noisy.

310
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:04,506
You.

311
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:05,530
Over there.

312
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,920
Why are you being so loud?

313
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:12,685
Are you...

314
00:19:13,258 --> 00:19:15,375
...talking to me?

315
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:17,662
Then...

316
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:20,345
...does this shop belong to you?

317
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:22,969
Even if it's yours...

318
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:26,400
...you're bothering the customers
by being so loud.

319
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:31,032
Don't you know who I am?

320
00:19:38,814 --> 00:19:40,016
This is my first time seeing you.

321
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,203
I don't know who you are.
So do you want to introduce yourself?

322
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:50,303
Who is this person?

323
00:19:51,043 --> 00:19:52,323
Who is she?

324
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,416
Huh?

325
00:19:54,043 --> 00:19:56,043
You said only VIPs come here.

326
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,687
That's why I started coming here.

327
00:19:57,772 --> 00:19:58,618
VIP?

328
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:00,974
Who?

329
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:05,877
That person?

330
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:09,691
I know her though.

331
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,953
Geez. I should go to another salon.

332
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:20,622
Let's go.

333
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:21,986
Okay.

334
00:20:27,195 --> 00:20:28,563
I owe you another one.

335
00:20:29,756 --> 00:20:31,254
I wasn't helping you.

336
00:20:31,823 --> 00:20:33,367
She was really being loud.

337
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:35,954
Do you come here often?

338
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:37,237
No.

339
00:20:37,895 --> 00:20:39,332
This is my first time.

340
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:40,860
But...

341
00:20:41,852 --> 00:20:43,383
...I don't think I'll be coming back.

342
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:45,989
It's been unpleasant.

343
00:20:48,532 --> 00:20:49,372
Eunho...

344
00:20:51,324 --> 00:20:52,904
...must be waiting for your call.

345
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:01,671
Tell him to wait a little longer.

346
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,928
That's...

347
00:21:06,513 --> 00:21:07,836
...the least he could do.

348
00:21:16,348 --> 00:21:18,623
Did Eunho really find
himself a rich girlfriend?

349
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:20,465
We don't know that yet.

350
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:24,634
Ryu Eunho, that brat. Seriously.

351
00:21:24,972 --> 00:21:26,760
I'm so proud of him.

352
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,564
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

353
00:22:18,173 --> 00:22:19,375
What's going on?

354
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:26,564
I've made up my mind.

355
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:29,033
I'm going to let you do whatever you want.

356
00:22:30,061 --> 00:22:31,037
Today...

357
00:22:31,297 --> 00:22:33,355
...a day to celebrate.

358
00:22:33,638 --> 00:22:36,099
We're celebrating your rebirth.

359
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:37,480
Eunho...

360
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,163
...you're one year old today.

361
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,159
Treat me as your older sister from now on.

362
00:22:43,786 --> 00:22:45,294
Blow the candle.

363
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:50,424
Should I...

364
00:22:51,363 --> 00:22:52,994
...not be a priest?

365
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:54,087
What?

366
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,027
What?

367
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,872
I'm going to work.

368
00:23:07,963 --> 00:23:09,665
What has gotten into him all of a sudden?

369
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:11,758
What do you think?

370
00:23:11,907 --> 00:23:15,087
The Lord has answered my prayers.

371
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:20,273
I've seen that kind of look a lot before.

372
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,876
Guys stare at me like that when...

373
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:27,043
Hey! Ryu Eunho!

374
00:23:27,128 --> 00:23:28,649
-Why?
-What's wrong?

375
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:32,129
I think...

376
00:23:33,097 --> 00:23:34,543
...he has a girlfriend.

377
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:35,999
What?

378
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:37,696
Nonsense.

379
00:23:40,192 --> 00:23:41,737
I know that look though.

380
00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:49,030
Did it go well with Ms. Kang?

381
00:23:49,115 --> 00:23:50,464
Was there any problem?

382
00:23:50,588 --> 00:23:53,944
Weren't you the one
who has a problem with her?

383
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,537
Don't say something upsetting like that.

384
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:02,217
I was just encouraging her to do better.

385
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:05,677
I'm just giving her a slight nudge.
Don't take it the wrong way.

386
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:09,175
By the way...

387
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:14,302
...did Ms. Kang change her mind?

388
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,406
Is she on the same page as you?

389
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:18,451
Why does her opinion matters?

390
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:20,968
What's more important
is to bring Seo Dojae down...

391
00:24:21,315 --> 00:24:23,363
...and put Ms. Kang in his position.

392
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:25,042
And after that...

393
00:24:25,127 --> 00:24:26,103
Shh...

394
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:30,505
We don't need to go over
what happens next.

395
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,242
I will help you out.

396
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:35,711
Okay?

397
00:24:37,202 --> 00:24:38,853
By the way...

398
00:24:40,236 --> 00:24:42,604
...about Seo Dojae's weakness...

399
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,721
Tell me about it too, Mr. Choi.

400
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:53,895
We're in this big scheme together...

401
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:55,787
...how can you hide it from me?

402
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,982
There will be time for this.

403
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,652
You're right.

404
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:05,151
There's time for everything.

405
00:25:07,684 --> 00:25:08,909
You changed your hairstyle.

406
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,738
Did you do it for me?

407
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:14,007
I don't change my hairstyle for others.

408
00:25:15,823 --> 00:25:17,823
Do you like the gift I gave you?

409
00:25:19,338 --> 00:25:22,252
I'm not sure if it's a gift or a bomb.

410
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:25,661
It depends on how you use it.

411
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:29,194
It also depends on who I send it to.

412
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:31,949
Have you forgotten?

413
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,910
You came to me first.

414
00:25:35,294 --> 00:25:36,969
You said you wanted
to take over the company.

415
00:25:37,893 --> 00:25:38,744
You're right.

416
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,794
I did say that.

417
00:25:43,173 --> 00:25:45,453
I can't believe I used to be that person.

418
00:25:48,348 --> 00:25:49,763
Is it because of that guy?

419
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
That jerk from the other day?

420
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,590
Are you okay?

421
00:25:55,748 --> 00:25:56,608
Excuse me...

422
00:26:00,823 --> 00:26:01,764
Is this enough?

423
00:26:03,511 --> 00:26:04,396
Go.

424
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:07,492
What? Do you want more?

425
00:26:07,577 --> 00:26:08,946
-Geez. You...
-Let's go.

426
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,250
Let's just leave.

427
00:26:13,055 --> 00:26:15,103
Do you not know how to apologize?

428
00:26:15,188 --> 00:26:16,547
Apologize for what?

429
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,741
Just go buy another pair of shoes.

430
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:36,914
I guess...

431
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:39,928
...I did change my hair for him to see.

432
00:26:43,706 --> 00:26:45,428
You two are pathetic.

433
00:26:55,774 --> 00:26:57,424
Why didn't you call me?

434
00:26:58,885 --> 00:26:59,982
You said you would.

435
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:02,595
I'll call you now.

436
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:07,890
I can't leave right now.

437
00:27:10,676 --> 00:27:12,034
I have to sell those.

438
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,384
That shouldn't be a problem.

439
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,099
I'll buy them all.

440
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,815
Do you mind drinking here?

441
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,694
That's what I should ask.

442
00:27:49,405 --> 00:27:52,070
Don't you mind being here?

443
00:27:57,845 --> 00:28:00,497
Is it really okay to bring me
to your favorite hangout?

444
00:28:04,004 --> 00:28:04,952
I've just...

445
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:08,673
...taken one more step
into your personal life.

446
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:09,701
Right now.

447
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:13,366
Well...

448
00:28:14,884 --> 00:28:18,233
Why did you have to appear
and wipe my shoes?

449
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:22,704
Your shirt got dirty, right?

450
00:28:27,595 --> 00:28:28,493
I can just wash it.

451
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:31,042
I don't think it'll come off.

452
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:33,883
Then, I'll just throw it away.

453
00:28:36,676 --> 00:28:39,062
Aren't you spending too
much money because of me?

454
00:28:40,716 --> 00:28:41,754
It's fine.

455
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,793
I'll just earn more.

456
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:02,777
What made you want to become a priest?

457
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:07,627
No reason.

458
00:29:10,047 --> 00:29:10,920
No reason?

459
00:29:12,314 --> 00:29:14,717
What made you want to become a cool lady?

460
00:29:15,862 --> 00:29:17,958
What made you want to do well?

461
00:29:19,895 --> 00:29:21,691
As for me, it's just my gut feeling.

462
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,563
A reason?

463
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:25,606
I don't have one.

464
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,489
It's my dream.

465
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,919
One I've had for a long time.

466
00:29:35,414 --> 00:29:36,328
That's nice.

467
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,100
To not have a reason.

468
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,357
As for me...

469
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:51,334
...I've always had a reason.

470
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,465
I wanted to survive.

471
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,549
I don't want to be looked down upon.

472
00:29:59,414 --> 00:30:01,116
Those are the reasons...

473
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,951
...that made me who I am.

474
00:30:05,614 --> 00:30:07,699
That became my habit.

475
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:13,783
Fine.

476
00:30:14,435 --> 00:30:15,551
I understand now.

477
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:18,487
I'll step back.

478
00:30:20,104 --> 00:30:22,646
I'll let God have you.

479
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:27,271
Why are giving me away?

480
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,465
I also want to find it.

481
00:30:31,335 --> 00:30:32,393
The reason...

482
00:30:33,068 --> 00:30:34,622
...why my dream has changed...

483
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:35,835
...to you.

484
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:41,457
You said you like nice people.

485
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,069
I do.

486
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:47,834
I'm a bad person.

487
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:49,979
I even lied to you.

488
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:51,593
I know.

489
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:56,234
What can a nice person
and a bad person...

490
00:30:56,861 --> 00:30:58,460
...do together?

491
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:06,480
Should we become friends?

492
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:11,048
There's no such thing as friends
between a man and a woman.

493
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:35,075
Why do you have a white porcelain vase
from the Joseon dynasty in your house?

494
00:31:43,856 --> 00:31:45,611
Why? Why are you smiling?

495
00:31:46,131 --> 00:31:47,119
It's nothing.

496
00:31:48,229 --> 00:31:50,288
Don't try to fool me.

497
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:51,676
What is it?

498
00:31:52,588 --> 00:31:54,299
Come on. What is it?

499
00:31:55,461 --> 00:31:57,946
If you don't tell me, I'm going to
imagine something very weird.

500
00:31:58,123 --> 00:32:01,497
Then, I'm going to go home and
bury my face in my pillow, and cry.

501
00:32:01,582 --> 00:32:02,623
Do you like that?

502
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:03,593
I just thought...

503
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:05,510
...you look similar.

504
00:32:05,703 --> 00:32:06,626
"Look similar"?

505
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:09,027
Me..

506
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:10,228
...and that thing?

507
00:32:12,484 --> 00:32:13,335
In what way?

508
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:16,348
Do I have a round face or something?

509
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:18,004
Well...

510
00:32:18,515 --> 00:32:19,359
...sort of.

511
00:32:19,444 --> 00:32:21,191
Unbelievable.

512
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:28,727
Then, you would think of me
every day when you see this?

513
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:31,328
-Not every day.
-Not every day, but very often?

514
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:35,122
When did you start thinking of me?

515
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,614
Since we first met?

516
00:32:40,187 --> 00:32:42,060
Since the day...

517
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,251
...I started to understand your condition.

518
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:46,569
And that's the day...

519
00:32:47,018 --> 00:32:48,631
...I started wanting to understand...

520
00:32:49,328 --> 00:32:51,434
...this person named Han Segye.

521
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:54,289
So did you come to understand her?

522
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:55,865
I've come to love you.

523
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:01,230
I went from being afraid of everything

524
00:33:01,774 --> 00:33:03,800
...to not being afraid of anything.

525
00:33:05,439 --> 00:33:06,820
I feel like I've transformed.

526
00:33:08,455 --> 00:33:09,988
Because you met me.

527
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:11,909
Because I met you.

528
00:33:13,211 --> 00:33:14,745
I'm so glad...

529
00:33:15,803 --> 00:33:16,982
...that we found each other.

530
00:33:19,128 --> 00:33:20,510
It'll be that day soon, right?

531
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:23,924
Wow. You have a great memory.

532
00:33:25,321 --> 00:33:27,551
When the day comes, you have
to be with me all day. Okay?

533
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:29,003
Don't go anywhere.

534
00:33:39,948 --> 00:33:41,101
Come on.

535
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,776
Let's go home, Kingkang.

536
00:33:46,288 --> 00:33:48,212
Let's head inside. Are you tired?

537
00:33:48,297 --> 00:33:50,178
Let's get you to bed... Oh my god!

538
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,670
Who are you?

539
00:33:53,726 --> 00:33:54,579
It's me.

540
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,894
You...

541
00:33:58,557 --> 00:33:59,400
Hey.

542
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:01,423
Is it that day already?

543
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,213
It's not supposed to be today.

544
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:04,151
What?

545
00:34:05,483 --> 00:34:06,402
Yes.

546
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,931
Is it because you're tired?

547
00:34:08,544 --> 00:34:10,443
Why did this happen so suddenly?

548
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,077
Do you have any other symptoms?

549
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,771
Not really.

550
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,623
Where are you going right now?

551
00:34:17,175 --> 00:34:18,581
Just over there.

552
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:20,402
Are you going to see Seo Dojae?

553
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:21,329
Gosh...

554
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,343
Of course. You still have your boyfriend.

555
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,644
Good for you.

556
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:28,547
You still have someone to call you fondly
even when you look like that.

557
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:32,980
Kingkang, what's wrong?

558
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:34,311
I think she's cold.

559
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:35,697
I'm going inside.

560
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:38,584
Don't take too long. You shouldn't
be walking around looking like that.

561
00:34:38,726 --> 00:34:40,947
Gosh. Good times.

562
00:34:54,939 --> 00:34:56,713
Kingkang, it's your friend.

563
00:35:05,457 --> 00:35:07,814
- What on earth?!
- My gosh! What?

564
00:35:07,899 --> 00:35:09,180
Why did you change again?

565
00:35:09,265 --> 00:35:10,428
Did I change?

566
00:35:14,188 --> 00:35:15,028
No.

567
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,292
I didn't change.

568
00:35:16,773 --> 00:35:17,625
You...

569
00:35:17,806 --> 00:35:19,014
Earlier...

570
00:35:20,235 --> 00:35:21,413
I'm sure I saw you...

571
00:35:25,346 --> 00:35:26,617
We're in trouble.

572
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:53,651
What the?

573
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:56,619
Who are you?

574
00:35:56,704 --> 00:35:57,900
Darn it.

575
00:36:03,189 --> 00:36:04,538
Who hired you?

576
00:36:08,552 --> 00:36:11,265
Chae Yoori, I could kill her...

577
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:17,074
-You're reporting her to the police?
-No.

578
00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:20,866
It's me.

579
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,447
Can we meet?

580
00:36:28,259 --> 00:36:29,421
Have you lost your mind?

581
00:36:30,172 --> 00:36:31,960
You hired someone to tail me?

582
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:33,802
Do you want to get sued?

583
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:35,955
Sue me if you want.

584
00:36:36,076 --> 00:36:38,870
But I need to know what this is
before I go to jail.

585
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:55,093
Are you my fan?

586
00:36:55,462 --> 00:36:57,084
You even have a video of me on your phone.

587
00:36:57,443 --> 00:36:59,209
It's weird, you know.

588
00:36:59,657 --> 00:37:01,593
I don't see you going in.

589
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,513
But I see you leaving.

590
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:09,213
I watched the footage
from the very beginning.

591
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:12,748
But you never went into that washroom.

592
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:14,449
I could only see you walking out of there.

593
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,074
On top of that...

594
00:37:16,561 --> 00:37:20,350
...your manager, who never leaves
your side, saw a stranger...

595
00:37:20,435 --> 00:37:22,195
...and calls him by your name.

596
00:37:23,173 --> 00:37:24,635
Doesn't it sound weird to you?

597
00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:26,349
What are you trying to say?

598
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:28,484
I think you're the one
who has something to say.

599
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:30,005
I have no idea what you're talking about.

600
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:31,043
Right.

601
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:34,821
I have no idea
what this is all about either.

602
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:37,387
But then, I remembered something...

603
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:39,972
Every time you sign a contract,

604
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,728
you ask for a week of break
every month without exception.

605
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:45,990
If they don't let you, you run away.

606
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:51,672
Is this your secret?

607
00:37:53,253 --> 00:37:54,899
You must have gone crazy.

608
00:37:55,058 --> 00:37:56,768
You've been watching too many movies.

609
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,376
I don't watch movies that often.

610
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:00,561
I don't even watch the ones I starred in.

611
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,391
I'll know if I'm crazy or
not in a few days.

612
00:38:07,747 --> 00:38:08,614
Yeah.

613
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:12,419
I've been doing some calculations,

614
00:38:12,504 --> 00:38:16,388
since the day you disappeared on set,
and the boy appeared.

615
00:38:18,461 --> 00:38:19,610
It's coming up soon, right?

616
00:38:26,623 --> 00:38:27,791
Are you scared?

617
00:38:29,129 --> 00:38:31,685
Then, you should just spill it to me now.

618
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:35,560
I might be nice and keep your secret
after hearing it.

619
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,654
Why are you running away?

620
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:58,753
It's not worth my time
to hear more of your nonsense.

621
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:01,610
I see. So you are running away.

622
00:39:01,695 --> 00:39:03,490
Do you think people will believe you?

623
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:05,604
Whether they believe it or not, I'm right.

624
00:39:05,689 --> 00:39:07,108
That you change appearances.

625
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,853
Wow, this is so fascinating.

626
00:39:11,733 --> 00:39:13,600
Is it a virus or something?

627
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,146
What is this?

628
00:39:22,847 --> 00:39:24,180
What are you doing right now?

629
00:39:24,265 --> 00:39:25,860
We should find out, then.

630
00:39:26,252 --> 00:39:28,908
We both can't leave this elevator
until I change.

631
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:31,404
We'll stay here together all night.

632
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:33,169
Wow.

633
00:39:33,497 --> 00:39:35,591
I really have to give you credit.

634
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:38,708
You really are good at acting.

635
00:39:38,872 --> 00:39:41,292
Why waste your energy on this?

636
00:39:41,427 --> 00:39:43,271
There are easier ways.

637
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:45,858
I'm starting a reality show soon.

638
00:39:46,924 --> 00:39:48,254
Have I told you that before?

639
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:50,771
You should appear on the show.

640
00:39:51,377 --> 00:39:53,889
The cameras will be recording
24 hours a day.

641
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:55,988
Why?

642
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,739
Are you turning me down?

643
00:39:59,756 --> 00:40:00,812
Sure. Let's do it.

644
00:40:01,547 --> 00:40:03,000
If you really don't believe me.

645
00:40:05,192 --> 00:40:07,304
Our ratings points are going to skyrocket.

646
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:09,412
Thank you, Segye.

647
00:40:11,822 --> 00:40:13,040
(In case of an emergency, ring bell)

648
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:14,551
Hello?

649
00:40:14,636 --> 00:40:16,250
-Hello?
-Yes?

650
00:40:16,335 --> 00:40:17,910
We're stuck in the elevator.

651
00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:19,205
We'll be right there.

652
00:40:20,689 --> 00:40:22,905
The press release
has already been sent out.

653
00:40:23,848 --> 00:40:26,924
That witch. It's as if she's
been waiting for this moment.

654
00:40:27,832 --> 00:40:31,198
It's a miracle that I managed to
keep this a secret all there years.

655
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,212
Don't worry.

656
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,439
I'll sort it out no matter what.

657
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:37,950
You?

658
00:40:39,384 --> 00:40:41,013
What are you planning to do?

659
00:40:41,631 --> 00:40:42,541
Han Segye.

660
00:40:43,779 --> 00:40:44,876
You trust me, right?

661
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,298
Dojae...

662
00:41:23,331 --> 00:41:25,033
I get that you don't like me,

663
00:41:25,209 --> 00:41:27,187
but how can you ignore me like this?

664
00:41:27,272 --> 00:41:29,162
-It's not that...
-Director Kim.

665
00:41:30,676 --> 00:41:32,661
Are you also going to ignore me?

666
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:34,771
When we haven't seen
each other in a while.

667
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:37,531
It's not that.

668
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:40,055
My eyesight is getting worse these days.

669
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,163
I didn't recognize you for a second.

670
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:43,594
But still...

671
00:41:43,807 --> 00:41:46,895
...it's an honor to be greeted
by such a beauty.

672
00:41:48,129 --> 00:41:50,949
Director Kim, maybe it's
time for you to retire.

673
00:41:51,034 --> 00:41:51,999
No way.

674
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:56,412
What are you doing? Let's go.

675
00:42:10,024 --> 00:42:11,781
Something is fishy.

676
00:42:12,286 --> 00:42:14,296
But I don't know what.

677
00:42:26,138 --> 00:42:27,133
Thank you.

678
00:42:30,665 --> 00:42:31,647
It's nothing.

679
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:35,209
I don't like the sight of
someone else beating up...

680
00:42:36,072 --> 00:42:37,592
...something I'm already beating.

681
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:49,042
It's the fish I gave you.

682
00:42:51,399 --> 00:42:52,987
It's still alive.

683
00:42:53,514 --> 00:42:55,387
It's my favorite fish.

684
00:42:59,352 --> 00:43:01,582
I thought it wasn't you
since you called my name.

685
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:05,262
You're not dressed as usual, either.

686
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:10,843
Did you come to check
if my illness is real or not?

687
00:43:11,528 --> 00:43:12,406
No.

688
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:18,174
I came to check how I would feel.

689
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:22,169
Whether I would feel okay
or uncomfortable.

690
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:24,898
So how do you feel?

691
00:43:34,921 --> 00:43:36,285
I think I'll be uncomfortable.

692
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,519
I got your medical records...

693
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,412
...from Kiho.

694
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,837
Choi Kiho and Director Kim
are conspiring...

695
00:43:49,567 --> 00:43:51,043
..to take you down.

696
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:56,065
What's your reason for telling me this?

697
00:44:00,553 --> 00:44:02,438
To be frank, I used to be on their side.

698
00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:05,244
But I just decided to betray them.

699
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,991
Why?

700
00:44:07,509 --> 00:44:08,650
Because you pity me?

701
00:44:08,735 --> 00:44:09,606
No.

702
00:44:13,912 --> 00:44:15,596
Because the person I like...

703
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,968
...doesn't like bad people.

704
00:44:21,729 --> 00:44:22,582
Hey.

705
00:44:22,789 --> 00:44:23,975
Are you in a relationship?

706
00:44:24,202 --> 00:44:25,499
With whom?

707
00:44:26,194 --> 00:44:27,581
What does he do?

708
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,285
Oh, no.

709
00:44:59,388 --> 00:45:01,669
(Chae Yoori)

710
00:45:17,794 --> 00:45:18,815
What do we do?

711
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,808
Segye isn't picking up the phone.

712
00:45:21,227 --> 00:45:22,387
This is crazy.

713
00:45:22,549 --> 00:45:25,065
We arranged everything
because she said she's come.

714
00:45:25,231 --> 00:45:26,429
I know.

715
00:45:27,078 --> 00:45:28,429
Why isn't she here yet?

716
00:45:29,066 --> 00:45:30,275
She must have run away again.

717
00:45:32,016 --> 00:45:33,153
I'm sorry.

718
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:36,467
I wanted to take this chance to
resolve my misunderstanding with her,

719
00:45:36,552 --> 00:45:38,243
and make up with her.

720
00:45:38,328 --> 00:45:40,204
But I guess the feeling wasn't mutual.

721
00:45:40,809 --> 00:45:43,035
I wasn't being considerate
of her feelings.

722
00:45:43,131 --> 00:45:44,811
No. Don't say that.

723
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,976
It's not your fault, Yoori.

724
00:45:47,672 --> 00:45:50,711
You didn't know
Han Segye would run off again.

725
00:45:50,909 --> 00:45:52,604
Get ready to pack up, everyone.

726
00:45:52,689 --> 00:45:54,599
I did know.

727
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:01,131
(If you're not coming here,
then I'll come to you)

728
00:46:03,498 --> 00:46:06,528
Wait! Segye says to
come over to her house.

729
00:46:06,613 --> 00:46:08,855
She has it all set up over there.

730
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:29,183
If you're not coming here,
then I'll come to you.

(Yoo Woomi)

732
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:46,383
I'll take care of it.

733
00:46:46,468 --> 00:46:48,809
Go over to my place for now.

734
00:46:57,058 --> 00:46:58,182
You trust me, right?

735
00:46:58,862 --> 00:47:00,619
Wait for me over there.
I'll be right there.

736
00:47:03,304 --> 00:47:05,214
Mister, please take care of him.

737
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:32,459
(Ryu Eunho)

738
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:35,742
Yes. What is it?

739
00:47:35,827 --> 00:47:36,680
Hey.

740
00:47:36,983 --> 00:47:38,211
Listen to me.

741
00:47:38,296 --> 00:47:40,692
I can hear you fine. What is it?

742
00:47:41,186 --> 00:47:42,905
Go over to my place later.

743
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:43,706
Why?

744
00:47:43,791 --> 00:47:44,998
Segye...

745
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:48,966
Just go there.

746
00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:52,449
What was that?

747
00:48:00,722 --> 00:48:01,777
Reporter Park...

748
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,831
...I was in a car accident.

749
00:48:05,406 --> 00:48:06,305
Alright.

750
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:08,360
I need to think rationally.

751
00:48:08,984 --> 00:48:10,295
I made a mistake.

752
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:13,960
This situation is happening because of me.

753
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,949
I am Han Segye's manager.

754
00:48:19,126 --> 00:48:20,519
I am Han Segye's friend.

755
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:28,295
So I have to take responsibility.

756
00:48:53,943 --> 00:48:55,930
The CEO of World Entertainment
had a car accident.

757
00:48:56,015 --> 00:48:57,195
She's been hospitalized.

758
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,685
So Han Segye's scheduled appointments
are canceled for the day.

759
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:01,840
She can't make it.

760
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:04,256
And here I thought she ran away.

761
00:49:04,643 --> 00:49:07,549
Wow. So this is how she's
getting herself out of this?

762
00:49:11,714 --> 00:49:13,188
Don't you think it's a lie?

763
00:49:13,273 --> 00:49:15,185
No way. It can't be a lie.

764
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:17,579
It doesn't seem like a serious accident...

765
00:49:17,751 --> 00:49:19,717
...but the manager is
unconscious from the shock.

766
00:49:25,409 --> 00:49:27,572
Excuse me, what number
is Yoo Woomi's room?

767
00:49:38,064 --> 00:49:39,095
Yoo Woomi.

768
00:49:43,173 --> 00:49:44,027
Woomi.

769
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:47,893

was in a car accident)

770

775
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:19,989
I'm at the hospital where Woomi is.

776
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:23,492
I'm on my way. Stay at Woomi's house
and wait for me.

777
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,939
It's my fault.

778
00:50:28,657 --> 00:50:30,115
This is all because of me.

779
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,227
Excuse me, do you have any records
of a patient named Han Segye?

780
00:50:43,187 --> 00:50:44,025
No, we don't.

781
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,236
Then, what about...

782
00:50:45,484 --> 00:50:47,568
...an unidentified man?

783
00:50:47,887 --> 00:50:49,620
I mean, a woman...

784
00:50:50,697 --> 00:50:52,385
Or maybe a child.

785
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:56,879
Was anyone admitted
with the patient Yoo Woomi?

786
00:50:56,964 --> 00:50:58,019
Whoever it is.

787
00:50:58,367 --> 00:50:59,513
Was there anyone?

788
00:51:04,217 --> 00:51:05,623
No, there are no records of anyone.

00:51:25,966 --> 00:51:27,105
I'm worried.

793
00:51:28,067 --> 00:51:30,353
I'm on the way to Woomi's house.

794
00:51:30,437 --> 00:51:33,009
Before Woomi got into the accident,
she told me to go there.

795
00:51:33,702 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm sure Segye will be there.

796
00:51:36,118 --> 00:51:37,558
I'll call you when I'm there.

had some slight issues,
