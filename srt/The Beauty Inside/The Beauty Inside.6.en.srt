1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,587
I showed up and announced
that I am the boyfriend.

2
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:10,911
But this awkward feeling
that won't go away…

3
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:16,705
That's because he's upset.

4
00:00:16,988 --> 00:00:18,242
What else could it be?

5
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:21,062
Am I right?

6
00:00:22,543 --> 00:00:24,391
How could you miss my wedding?

7
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:26,337
I bragged to the in-laws
that you were coming.

8
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:29,625
I watched your debut
film over and over again.

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,834
Are you ignoring me now that
you're a big-time celebrity?

10
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:33,154
Is it Sejin?

11
00:00:33,343 --> 00:00:35,099
She's upset at me
for missing her wedding.

12
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:38,587
She kept asking if you were here
until she entered the hall.

13
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,310
It's always like this.

14
00:00:40,747 --> 00:00:43,143
This is how me and my friends grow apart.

15
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:46,980
Missing her wedding is not the problem.
I could miss my own wedding.

16
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:50,036
Come on.

17
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:55,350
I am very disappointed in you.

18
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,462
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:05,918 --> 00:01:08,393
Since the first day it happened...

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,772
...there wasn't a single day
where I didn't feel victimized.

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,859
You heartless girl.

22
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:17,141
How could you not visit me
when I told you I'm getting surgery?

23
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:19,062
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:21,527
I was on full schedule that day.

25
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:22,621
Schedule?

26
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:26,650
What good is money and fame
if your mom dies?

27
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:28,346
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,497
Mom, is there anything you need?

29
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:32,000
No, you brat.

30
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,244
I took endoscope without anesthesia
because I didn't have a guardian.

31
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:37,109
I was so miserable.

32
00:01:37,443 --> 00:01:39,789
What's the point of having children?

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,753
Good bye.

34
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:48,828
But I couldn't waste 10 long years...

35
00:01:49,498 --> 00:01:51,912
...just crying all the time.

36
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:04,380
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

37
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:08,228
I didn't see anything and I never will.

38
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:11,110
Misunderstanding is my old pal.

39
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:13,990
Actually, I did go.

40
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:15,295
One, two...

41
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,928
I did go to the wedding.

42
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:19,997
She was the one who didn't recognize me.

43
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:20,954
One, two...

44
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,257
One, two...

45
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:27,959
-Let's take one like this.
-Okay.

46
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:30,844
One, two...

47
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:32,999
Mom...

48
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:35,555
Actually...

49
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:37,920
...I did go.

50
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:42,280
-I was with you the whole time.
-She's my daughter.

51
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:44,207
Isn't she just fabulous?

52
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:46,054
She sure is pretty.

53
00:02:46,138 --> 00:02:50,386
But, how come your pretty daughter
didn't visit you even once?

54
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,197
How can she come when she's busy?

55
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:57,044
She insisted to come
but I told her not to.

56
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:01,072
It's understandable
since she's so famous.

57
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:04,351
Who are you taking care of here?

58
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,862
My mom.

59
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:12,460
Your mom?

60
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:14,646
Longevity must run in your family.

61
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:42,944
Oh my gosh!

62
00:03:43,654 --> 00:03:46,910
-What are you doing? Get out!
-Get out now!

63
00:03:48,538 --> 00:03:49,372
Oh gosh! Sorry.

64
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:52,553
I thought I was used to
these kind of things.

65
00:03:53,826 --> 00:03:57,370
But nothing like this
ever happened before.

66
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,067
Go back to my place and wait.

67
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:23,076
But I caused this. So, I should...

68
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:24,898
Do you want to send her to the grave?

69
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,579
The passcode digits are my birthday.

70
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,409
You would know if it's really you.

71
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,718
I do know.

72
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,604
Because it is me.

73
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,280
It must be really you.

74
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,790
It is you, for now.

75
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:00,280
Go wait at home.

76
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:02,702
I'm not done checking yet.

77
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:09,768
Remember when you said
you won't run away?

78
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,978
You'd better not run away either.

79
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:29,017
How old is that boy?

80
00:05:29,102 --> 00:05:30,128
I'm not sure.

81
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,640
About 18?

82
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:33,424
Or 19?

83
00:05:35,438 --> 00:05:37,401
You don't know the age
of the guy you slept with?

84
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:38,976
We've only just met.

85
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:43,422
You've just met him and you...

86
00:05:47,585 --> 00:05:48,582
No.

87
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:51,385
This is all because I got
in between you and her.

88
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:53,472
I caused this to happen.

89
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:55,722
This is all my fault.

90
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,367
My fault...

91
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,960
I think I know what you're imagining.

92
00:06:00,488 --> 00:06:03,902
But it's not as bad as what
you're imagining right now.

93
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:06,526
What?

94
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:09,510
You went that far with him?

95
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,808
What happened?

96
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:17,238
Honey...

97
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:19,913
-Yeah?
-She had a little shock.

98
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:21,214
It's nothing serious.

99
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:24,994
He's the one who seems
to be in shock, not me.

100
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:29,920
For your information, I'm unbiased.
But it's not what you think.

101
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:33,138
What do you mean?
I saw it with my own two eyes.

102
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:35,175
What did you see? You didn't see anything.

103
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:36,730
What is this about?

104
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:39,532
Honey, Dojae is...

105
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:43,405
Ga...

106
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:44,483
Ga...?

107
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:49,205
-Ga...
-You want crab?

108
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,678
But you hate crustaceans.

109
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:55,053
Well, your taste can change
when you're sick.

110
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:57,446
It's not my taste that has changed...

111
00:06:57,537 --> 00:06:58,485
It's not?

112
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:02,094
He's... He's Ga...

113
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:09,477
Once again, you got it wrong.

114
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,104
I should've bought crabs
instead of flowers.

115
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:17,096
Ta-da...

116
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,230
Ta-da!

117
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:23,524
Oh, my.

118
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:27,213
Don't these flowers look sad?

119
00:07:27,358 --> 00:07:31,105
These flowers mean "hopeless love."

120
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:34,574
What kind of love would be hopeless?

121
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:39,311
Sad things are all beautiful.
Just like you, honey.

122
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,274
That's right.

123
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:44,230
I'm sad.

124
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,612
She's fine judging by her screaming.

125
00:07:54,036 --> 00:07:55,090
My little girl!

126
00:07:56,826 --> 00:08:00,590
Just tell me and I'll do
anything you want.

127
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:02,816
What is it that you want to eat?

128
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:05,652
What do you want to have?

129
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:09,122
Dad, I have...

130
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:11,484
...something that I want.

131
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:13,862
Yes, okay. What is it?

132
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:14,931
Segye.

133
00:08:15,857 --> 00:08:18,247
I want to have Segye right now.

134
00:08:21,148 --> 00:08:24,608
Professor Kang, just look at my baby girl.

135
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:29,805
She dreams about the world
in a small hospital room.

136
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:35,663
That's what she dreams about
even when she's sick.

137
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:37,461
Yeah?

138
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,414
You want me to come to work?
Right now? Immediately?

139
00:08:40,498 --> 00:08:42,161
I haven't said a word.

140
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:45,140
What? It's urgent and
there's no time to waste?

141
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,012
Sure, if that's how you want it to be.

142
00:08:47,138 --> 00:08:49,314
A trouble did come up anyway.

143
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:50,410
Sounds good.

144
00:08:51,518 --> 00:08:53,779
Please excuse me. I have to go to work.

145
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:57,114
Why you ungrateful brat!

146
00:08:57,198 --> 00:08:59,392
You don't know what's going on, Grandpa.

147
00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:03,644
I'll be ungrateful of me if I stayed here.

148
00:09:04,264 --> 00:09:06,089
Get some rest. I will call you.

149
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:09,953
Segye...

150
00:09:10,628 --> 00:09:12,466
I'm sorry...

151
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:14,721
Segye...

152
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:27,447
Thank you. Oh, gosh...

153
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:28,633
Thank you.

154
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:29,813
Thank you very much...

155
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:38,117
A huge thanks to your face.

156
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,747
Young man, do you have an agency?

157
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:42,959
You have a phone call.

158
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,267
Hey, that's not important right now.

159
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:52,901
Are you interested in acting?

160
00:09:52,986 --> 00:09:55,855
My mom told me not to take
business cards from strangers.

161
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:58,238
I'm not a stranger or anything.

162
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:03,109
Gosh, why does she keep calling me?
She's so clueless.

163
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:06,868
You know Han Segye, right?

164
00:10:06,952 --> 00:10:10,997
I'm the CEO of World Entertainment,
Han Segye's agency.

165
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:12,885
I was actually...

166
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:15,676
...looking for a face just like yours.

167
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:19,076
What kind of face do I have?

168
00:10:19,606 --> 00:10:20,439
It's...

169
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,755
...a face for the Cannes.

170
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,190
I will send you there.

171
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,528
I'll ask my mom if I can go to the Cannes.

172
00:10:31,907 --> 00:10:34,364
-Why the hell does she keep calling?
-Pick it up.

173
00:10:36,317 --> 00:10:38,020
Come on, Mom. Pick up.

174
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:43,843
Is that you, Segye?

175
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,160
I'm screwed. What should I do?

176
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,995
Goodness gracious!
That was a hell of a coincidence.

177
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:59,042
Regardless of how you look,
you're my artist forever.

178
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:01,579
Oh for crying out loud.

179
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,610
Hey! You're too young for this.

180
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:13,134
I just put someone in a hospital.
I don't want to be sober. Give it back.

181
00:11:13,218 --> 00:11:14,212
Who?

182
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:17,146
Does that person know that you're you?

183
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,450
Of course not.

184
00:11:19,535 --> 00:11:21,144
Really? Then it's fine.

185
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:24,077
No, it's not fine.
Seo Dojae's mother passed out.

186
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:25,929
Seo Dojae's mother passed out?

187
00:11:26,134 --> 00:11:26,967
Why?

188
00:11:29,162 --> 00:11:29,995
Wait...

189
00:11:33,762 --> 00:11:35,066
I slept at his place...

190
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:37,476
Slept...?

191
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:39,836
You are so...

192
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:44,193
Gosh, you're all grown up!

193
00:11:45,152 --> 00:11:46,411
All grown up.

194
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,986
I'm shedding tears of joy.

195
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:56,956
-Did you bed him wearing this?
-No, I didn't bed him that way.

196
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,297
He wasn't surprised?

197
00:11:58,382 --> 00:11:59,215
What?

198
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,497
Wasn't he surprised
when he saw you like this?

199
00:12:02,582 --> 00:12:04,901
Did he call your name, "Segye"?

200
00:12:06,053 --> 00:12:11,238
You said you wished there was someone
else other than me and Eunho...

201
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,267
...who would call you "Segye."

202
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,469
Is that someone Seo Dojae?

203
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,306
He wasn't surprised.

204
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:26,391
Good.

205
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:29,145
Now, you just need to hear him
call you "Segye."

206
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:32,252
Yoo Woomi....

207
00:12:32,828 --> 00:12:33,855
What is it now?

208
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,985
-I'd rather not say.
-Then don't.

209
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:38,558
Aren't you giving up too soon?

210
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:40,753
-What is it?
-I don't want to say.

211
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:43,529
Should I try saying "I don't want to say"?

212
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:44,574
What is it?

213
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:46,391
What is it?

214
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:48,440
Fine, you win.

215
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:50,403
A preemptive strike from One Air.

216
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:52,667
They’re launching the events
one week earlier than usual.

217
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:54,641
That's not much of a strike.

218
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:55,980
It is a strike.

219
00:12:56,178 --> 00:12:59,732
Using the name of One Air, they're doing
a "One-won ticket time" promotion.

220
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:01,147
And it's a huge hit.

221
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,922
And what's our countermeasure?

222
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,120
Nothing impressive came out
of the briefings.

223
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:09,287
The board's most enthusiastic about...

224
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:10,889
...premium service to the first class.

225
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:13,863
It’s already premium as it is.
What more do they want?

226
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:15,802
Do they want to build a palace?

227
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:18,277
Director Kim seems to like that idea.

228
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,038
Maybe it's because he uses first-class.

229
00:13:20,123 --> 00:13:23,658
Are they all gathered here
to get approval on that?

230
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,425
I really don't feel like talking today.

231
00:13:30,744 --> 00:13:34,010
If first-class and economy-class
had a fight, which one would win?

232
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:37,350
The one with the higher number
would win, right?

233
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,605
I want to avoid a losing battle.

234
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:41,305
If it's a fight between 17 and one...

235
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:46,813
...I'd like to be in the team of 17.

236
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,032
You make it so difficult.

237
00:13:54,062 --> 00:13:56,903
First-class passengers....

238
00:13:57,057 --> 00:14:01,798
...are the real loyal customers
of T'road, right?

239
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,679
So, what I'm trying to say is
that we should...

240
00:14:05,764 --> 00:14:09,950
...improve their in-flight service
as a gesture of our gratitude.

241
00:14:10,936 --> 00:14:12,752
What's so wrong with that?

242
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,125
So would you actively participate
in social media events...

243
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,626
...for a first-class seat?

244
00:14:19,711 --> 00:14:20,762
Well, I...

245
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,818
I wouldn't.

246
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:29,092
Why?

247
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,843
Because I'll get the best service
even if I don't participate.

248
00:14:32,377 --> 00:14:33,539
To put it simply...

249
00:14:34,577 --> 00:14:35,826
...it's obvious.

250
00:14:36,723 --> 00:14:38,332
It's not an event if it's obvious.

251
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:40,163
It's a routine.

252
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:45,419
Traveling is about turning boring routines
into a special moment.

253
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:48,114
Essentially, that is what we must do.

254
00:14:49,102 --> 00:14:51,851
Change the target group
to the economy class.

255
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,742
Provide a free upgrade to first-class
to one of the event participants.

256
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:59,114
Chief, that may be okay
for short to medium-hauls.

257
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,122
But do you know the price difference
between economy and first-class...

258
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:03,642
...for long hauls?

259
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:05,925
More than ten times.

260
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,158
Right.

261
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:10,511
More people will participate
for higher stakes.

262
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:12,247
I see.

263
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:14,677
So it's a Cinderella event.

264
00:15:14,868 --> 00:15:20,228
It seems like Chief Seo loves
Cinderella too much.

265
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:28,215
That's a great idea.

266
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:31,431
You are remarkable indeed, Director Kim.

267
00:15:31,543 --> 00:15:32,376
Me?

268
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:36,518
We should bring the real Cinderella
since it's a Cinderella event.

269
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,815
You mean, you will invite Han Segye?

270
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:44,708
Goodness. You're going to work
and have a date at the same time?

271
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:47,316
Why? I can't do that?

272
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:50,025
I can be successful at both.

273
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:52,599
If you're jealous,
why don't you be successful...

274
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,226
...at dating and work?

275
00:15:57,813 --> 00:15:59,894
We'll start the event a week later.

276
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,595
The real Cinderella that I know...

277
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,944
...will be busy for a week or so.

278
00:16:05,351 --> 00:16:08,033
It's much more fun compared last time.

279
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:10,457
Food tastes excellent
around a beautiful woman.

280
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:13,439
You're right. The food is wonderful.

281
00:16:14,898 --> 00:16:18,711
You've finally invited me to this
meeting that I've only heard about.

282
00:16:19,164 --> 00:16:23,864
Does that mean you're starting
to acknowledge me as CEO?

283
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,556
You're the first woman to be invited
to our luncheon.

284
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:29,928
The new event is great.

285
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:34,844
That Seo Dojae never shows up
no matter how many times we invite him.

286
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:39,342
Maybe it's easy to talk to you because
you have that sweetness of a woman.

287
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:43,769
It's not because I'm a woman.

288
00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:46,214
I'm just more ambitious than my brother.

289
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:49,839
I like how "brother" sounds.
Can you call me "brother," too?

290
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:53,453
If you have a hard time doing business,
ring this brother up.

291
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:57,674
I saw a photo of you wearing
a stewardess uniform, and...

292
00:16:59,028 --> 00:17:00,131
Darn!

293
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:02,159
Share it next time.

294
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:08,944
A woman shouldn't pour drinks.

295
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:13,678
All right. Let's drink.

296
00:17:13,762 --> 00:17:15,597
-Sounds good.
-All right.

297
00:17:15,682 --> 00:17:16,573
Miss Kang?

298
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:23,771
I forgot I had something
urgent to approve.

299
00:17:24,229 --> 00:17:25,261
I have to leave now.

300
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,176
Why do you need to work hard
when you're this pretty?

301
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:30,559
If a woman is pretty,
she's done her job. Right?

302
00:17:30,644 --> 00:17:33,628
That's an excellent piece of advice.

303
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:36,352
We should have a meal
like this more often.

304
00:17:37,827 --> 00:17:39,542
All right.

305
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,656
I feel like the atmosphere is...

306
00:18:15,843 --> 00:18:17,597
Ignorant jerks...

307
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:13,452
How pathetic...

308
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:16,826
Couldn't say a word...

309
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:22,756
How stupid...

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,432
What was I expecting?

311
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:31,537
I feel so stupid...

312
00:19:46,526 --> 00:19:47,685
I'm so pissed!

313
00:20:10,382 --> 00:20:11,387
How much is it?

314
00:20:20,263 --> 00:20:21,243
Were you crying?

315
00:20:22,294 --> 00:20:23,127
Who cried?

316
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:28,661
Same price as a cup of coffee.

317
00:20:32,073 --> 00:20:33,517
You asked how much it is.

318
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:35,367
Buy me a cup of coffee.

319
00:20:36,273 --> 00:20:37,149
For this...

320
00:20:37,741 --> 00:20:38,838
I'll pay.

321
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:52,799
If I had known about this,
I would've asked for a steak.

322
00:20:53,694 --> 00:20:54,972
You asked me to buy you coffee.

323
00:20:55,936 --> 00:20:57,159
I'm hungry.

324
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:03,729
I was in such a crappy place
that I couldn't eat well.

325
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:07,817
Why did you cry?

326
00:21:10,028 --> 00:21:11,068
I didn't cry.

327
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:12,623
You were crying.

328
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:19,845
Because of a guy.

329
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:23,249
"Guys," to be exact.

330
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:24,560
That's strange.

331
00:21:25,163 --> 00:21:27,470
You look like you would make
guys cry all the time.

332
00:21:28,903 --> 00:21:30,990
Yes, I'm kind of like that.

333
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:39,891
Let me ask you something
since we're here.

334
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,426
Are you the one who's dating Han Segye?

335
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,137
I do understand.

336
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:49,420
You must feel tangled emotions
looking at photos of your woman...

337
00:21:49,505 --> 00:21:51,294
...on a date with another man.

338
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,679
Do you like her so much
that you put up with all that?

339
00:21:54,764 --> 00:21:56,639
Segye and I are just friends.

340
00:21:56,724 --> 00:22:00,119
We grew up together watching
everything about each other.

341
00:22:00,698 --> 00:22:01,654
That's hilarious.

342
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:04,391
A man and a woman can't be just friends.

343
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:07,775
You shouldn't assume
that everyone's like you.

344
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,159
You have a point. I shouldn't.

345
00:22:14,937 --> 00:22:16,488
Then what's their relationship?

346
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:18,473
They're not dating for real.

347
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,444
If you have questions,
you should ask Segye yourself.

348
00:22:22,604 --> 00:22:24,317
I told you before.

349
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:29,109
Okay, I got it.

350
00:22:29,753 --> 00:22:30,586
Then...

351
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,954
...I'll ask you a question.

352
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,778
Were you really interested in me?

353
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:41,486
Interested?

354
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,468
You asked me to buy you coffee.

355
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:47,869
That's because I heard you came
by the cafe looking for me.

356
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:51,657
So I wanted to hear what you had to say.

357
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:55,078
And get a free coffee from you.

358
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:57,953
Then why show up
in front of me all the time...

359
00:22:58,038 --> 00:22:59,748
...get my number and call me?

360
00:23:02,763 --> 00:23:06,218
You seem to have misunderstood.

361
00:23:07,074 --> 00:23:08,721
I don't like a wicked person.

362
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,117
Bring Kingkang to me.

363
00:23:16,218 --> 00:23:17,302
I need to go now.

364
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:26,184
Thank you so much for the coffee.

365
00:23:29,498 --> 00:23:30,607
The feeling's mutual.

366
00:23:35,853 --> 00:23:37,419
I don't like a good person.

367
00:23:52,252 --> 00:23:55,718
Drink it up! Drink it up!

368
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:59,825
Drink it away! Chug, chug, chug, chug!

369
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:01,685
Do I have to keep dancing?

370
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:03,174
Hey!

371
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:07,433
How can you dance right now?

372
00:24:07,518 --> 00:24:09,952
Kang Sara asked him if you're
really dating Seo Dojae!

373
00:24:10,037 --> 00:24:13,185
We admitted our relationship.
What is she going to do?

374
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:17,118
Hey, why did you meet Kang Sara?

375
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:20,926
So you'd better be careful
before I sell your information.

376
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,483
Where are you going to sleep tonight?

377
00:24:26,568 --> 00:24:28,188
You can't go home looking like that.

378
00:24:28,272 --> 00:24:30,584
Of course she can't.

379
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,504
She has to sleep at my place.

380
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:35,161
There are boundaries to be kept
between men and women.

381
00:24:35,736 --> 00:24:36,569
Hey.

382
00:24:37,595 --> 00:24:40,962
While we're at it,
how about we go to the sauna?

383
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:43,098
Are you crazy? I'm your big brother.

384
00:24:43,183 --> 00:24:46,185
We can find out who's
the big brother at the sauna.

385
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,445
Kingkang. Kingkang...

386
00:24:53,716 --> 00:24:55,027
Not in front of her!

387
00:24:56,025 --> 00:24:56,858
Money.

388
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:58,767
How could ask money
for something like this?

389
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:01,901
You asked me to go because
a scandal might break out if you went.

390
00:25:01,986 --> 00:25:03,330
Hurry up.

391
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:07,794
Here.

392
00:25:10,571 --> 00:25:11,854
Hey, Kingkang.

393
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:21,115
By the way, who is this?

394
00:25:21,256 --> 00:25:24,123
You don't have to know.

395
00:25:24,207 --> 00:25:25,314
Don't even think about it.

396
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,015
Why? I can think all I want.

397
00:25:30,575 --> 00:25:31,666
How old are you?

398
00:25:32,077 --> 00:25:33,345
Do you like older women?

399
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:34,558
Kingkang.

400
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:44,094
How have you been?

401
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:47,214
You like puppies, don't you?

402
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:49,148
You like this kind of guy...

403
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:55,452
Leave her be.
It's only a midsummer night's dream.

404
00:25:55,778 --> 00:25:58,157
This love will be over in a few days.

405
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:01,118
Looks are everything that matters to her.

406
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:03,595
I'm so worried.

407
00:26:05,288 --> 00:26:07,299
I'm the one who should be worried.

408
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:11,403
Your ID.

409
00:26:11,845 --> 00:26:16,041
I was born only recently...

410
00:26:23,212 --> 00:26:24,045
Get out.

411
00:26:24,514 --> 00:26:25,384
Get out?

412
00:26:26,337 --> 00:26:27,540
Get out!

413
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,471
(Han Segye...?)

414
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,810
(Sharp nose and red lips that stands out.)

415
00:27:12,953 --> 00:27:14,173
Hello.

416
00:27:20,956 --> 00:27:22,641
It took you long enough to come.

417
00:27:24,418 --> 00:27:25,770
And you're completely drunk.

418
00:27:30,104 --> 00:27:32,956
Wow, you're not asking who I am.

419
00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:35,945
Oh yeah, is your mom okay?

420
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,459
I think she's fine.
She called me more than 20 times.

421
00:27:40,544 --> 00:27:42,398
-You didn't answer, did you?
-Of course...

422
00:27:43,018 --> 00:27:43,947
...I didn't answer.

423
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:45,130
She'll be fine.

424
00:27:45,572 --> 00:27:47,900
She's been through worse.

425
00:27:48,035 --> 00:27:50,273
Gosh, don't start with
your miserable story again.

426
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,563
Are you alcoholic?

427
00:27:55,723 --> 00:27:56,909
Have you been eating?

428
00:27:56,993 --> 00:27:58,377
Of course...

429
00:27:59,332 --> 00:28:01,681
It's my binge eating week.
Don't stop me.

430
00:28:02,075 --> 00:28:05,461
Even if I eat as much as I want,
I'll return to my original body.

431
00:28:05,703 --> 00:28:07,511
Isn't that wonderful?

432
00:28:07,596 --> 00:28:09,414
I never said you can bring a dog.

433
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:11,590
It's a puppy, not a dog.

434
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:13,723
Now that you've mentioned it...

435
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:17,362
...let me and Kingkang sleep here.

436
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:18,876
Why should I?

437
00:28:22,793 --> 00:28:26,365
Should I go home now looking like this...

438
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,108
...and escalate our relationship
to the love triangle of the century?

439
00:28:30,466 --> 00:28:32,511
Wouldn't that be great?

440
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:34,813
You can try.

441
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,872
Should I explain again
who will be at a loss?

442
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:42,988
I'm getting tipsy. It's hot.

443
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:46,892
What are you up to now?

444
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:49,795
What about it? We're both men.

445
00:28:53,384 --> 00:28:55,204
You're getting naughty ideas.

446
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:58,300
I can see it in your eyes.

447
00:29:00,044 --> 00:29:02,107
I can't talk to a drunk person.

448
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:04,546
We'll talk when you're sober.

449
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:08,447
Look at those deep-black eyes
full of desires.

450
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:11,350
You like this type?

451
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,522
Mr. Seo?

452
00:29:19,432 --> 00:29:21,067
Mr. Seo, are you avoiding me?

453
00:29:21,364 --> 00:29:22,354
Mr. Seo.

454
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:26,188
Mr. Seo?

455
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:29,075
Come out.

456
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,605
Come out!

457
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:37,391
Explain the look you had in your eyes!

458
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,011
What's up with those eyes?

459
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,116
Big brother!

460
00:29:41,833 --> 00:29:45,397
Hey, sweetie. I'm not drunk!

461
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:11,565
Woof, woof...

462
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:13,853
I am a dog.

463
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:15,810
I'm positive that I'm a dog.

464
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:19,927
That's why Kingkang's food
looked delicious.

465
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:21,542
I should just die.

466
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:23,151
Die.

467
00:30:27,574 --> 00:30:29,398
This guy's got a good body.

468
00:30:30,525 --> 00:30:31,694
Good.

469
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:49,792
Why are you coming out
of the shower naked?

470
00:30:50,158 --> 00:30:52,017
Should I take a shower with my clothes on?

471
00:30:53,003 --> 00:30:55,194
What about it? We're both men.

472
00:30:55,423 --> 00:30:57,100
I only said that because...

473
00:30:57,585 --> 00:30:59,116
I guess you do remember.

474
00:31:00,323 --> 00:31:02,038
First, wash up and get changed.

475
00:31:02,364 --> 00:31:05,163
I can't let you stay here
looking that terrible.

476
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:09,595
Bathroom's that way
and the dressing room's that way

477
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:19,570
That guy's got a pretty good body, too.

478
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:31,633
That's not how you do it.

479
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:36,528
I thought you might be fumbling around.

480
00:31:36,826 --> 00:31:39,120
I didn't want you to spill
a liter of blood in my house.

481
00:31:39,205 --> 00:31:42,040
How could you just come in without notice?

482
00:31:42,124 --> 00:31:44,158
What about it? We're both men.

483
00:31:44,242 --> 00:31:46,694
I apologize for saying that.

484
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,446
What for? It's the truth.

485
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:54,095
Now that I got the chance,
I will teach you.

486
00:31:54,722 --> 00:31:55,555
Shaving.

487
00:32:01,215 --> 00:32:02,654
Shave with the grain...

488
00:32:04,243 --> 00:32:05,425
From your cheek...

489
00:32:07,213 --> 00:32:08,046
Neck...

490
00:32:09,483 --> 00:32:10,429
...and around the lips.

491
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,283
From your beard...

492
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:29,498
...to your mustache.

493
00:32:29,678 --> 00:32:30,758
Wait, that's...

494
00:32:30,843 --> 00:32:31,807
Don't speak.

495
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:33,322
You might get cut.

496
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:10,956
After you're done,
run your face with your fingers.

497
00:33:11,517 --> 00:33:13,091
To check if there's a missing spot.

498
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:19,622
All good.

499
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,373
You're really good at shaving.

500
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:40,352
Now that I've learned properly,
I'll do it for you next time.

501
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:00,724
Just wear anything that fits your size.

502
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:02,990
But still, I shouldn't wear
someone else's clothes...

503
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,157
What? You want me to dress you up?

504
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,165
Are you that young now?

505
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,499
Just throw something on.

506
00:34:13,373 --> 00:34:16,655
It's difficult to choose
when there's so many options.

507
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,806
This one's expensive.

508
00:34:20,587 --> 00:34:22,197
This one's too big.

509
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,983
This one's too long.

510
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,936
(Seo Dojae)

511
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:02,044
No. Don't get ideas.

512
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:23,773
This is the only one that fits.

513
00:35:24,198 --> 00:35:26,102
I'm a teenager who's still growing.

514
00:35:28,181 --> 00:35:29,512
The tie is done nicely.

515
00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:32,897
Right? I'm so proud of myself.

516
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:36,646
But why do you keep
your school uniform so clean?

517
00:35:36,731 --> 00:35:39,797
My dad made it for me himself.

518
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:41,980
I'll wear something else.

519
00:35:42,364 --> 00:35:43,376
Ms. Han.

520
00:35:48,503 --> 00:35:50,472
Try walking towards me.

521
00:35:51,197 --> 00:35:52,030
What?

522
00:35:52,703 --> 00:35:53,773
Come over here.

523
00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:55,077
Now.

524
00:36:36,614 --> 00:36:38,621
Where did we meet for the first time?

525
00:36:38,921 --> 00:36:40,239
A rooftop at a hospital.

526
00:36:44,548 --> 00:36:45,990
What did I give you that time?

527
00:36:46,523 --> 00:36:47,356
Shame?

528
00:36:48,985 --> 00:36:49,849
A handkerchief.

529
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:51,479
What's the first thing we ate together?

530
00:36:51,563 --> 00:36:52,396
Insults.

531
00:36:54,904 --> 00:36:55,737
Sushi.

532
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,670
That sushi was delicious.

533
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:07,951
Although, the person I ate with
was a smart-ass.

534
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:09,833
That's all right.

535
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:12,009
I was a let-down back then.

536
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:13,288
You weren't a let-down.

537
00:37:13,642 --> 00:37:14,548
Back then...

538
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:17,840
...I didn't know you that well.

539
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,319
So you really are Han Segye.

540
00:37:32,404 --> 00:37:34,426
Now that you've seen it, how do you feel?

541
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,306
-I have more questions now.
-Like what?

542
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:39,609
When will you come back?

543
00:37:40,744 --> 00:37:43,700
Why? Do you want me back soon?

544
00:37:43,784 --> 00:37:46,865
Yes. As soon as possible.

545
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:52,332
Are you uncomfortable with me like this?

546
00:37:52,577 --> 00:37:53,781
Very uncomfortable.

547
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,609
Because I'm not Han Segye?

548
00:37:56,694 --> 00:37:58,141
Because you're not Han Segye.

549
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:11,890
The same old Seo Dojae. So typical.

550
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:13,927
What did I expect?

551
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:17,223
Sure, I am weird.

552
00:38:17,843 --> 00:38:19,731
Of course he thinks I'm weird.

553
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:22,734
Typical Seo Dojerk.

554
00:38:23,517 --> 00:38:24,413
Auntie.

555

One more portion of tteokbokki, please.

556
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,007
Okay, wait.

557
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:30,874
Eat up.

558
00:38:33,435 --> 00:38:36,147
Really? Joo Gayoung told you
that she likes you?

559
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:38,194
Pay up, chumps.

560
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:40,618
Take your money out.

561
00:38:43,284 --> 00:38:44,542
What did I tell you guys?

562
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,297
With a poor kid, you just need
to be a little nice and it's game over.

563
00:38:48,381 --> 00:38:51,434
Lucky you. A poor girl's all over you.

564
00:38:51,518 --> 00:38:54,191
Shut up. Would you be happy
if you were me?

565
00:38:54,276 --> 00:38:58,048
Why not? I heard she gets support
from a welfare foundation.

566
00:38:58,262 --> 00:38:59,771
Free money's nice.

567
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:01,403
Man, I envy you.

568
00:39:01,488 --> 00:39:04,754
That girl rolls around in free money.

569
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:05,844
I know.

570
00:39:06,448 --> 00:39:08,962
How could they say such things
without even blinking?

571
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:11,749
Of course it's a second hand.
She wouldn't use her money.

572
00:39:12,031 --> 00:39:13,798
It was probably handed down.

573
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,089
How much do they get from welfare?

574
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,818
About 300 thousand won I guess.

575
00:39:19,395 --> 00:39:20,279
Lucky her.

576
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:23,595
-Want to go to an Internet cafe?
-No.

577
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,072
Just play one round!

578
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:27,156
You'll lose anyway.

579
00:39:28,103 --> 00:39:30,003
You'll lose. I'll beat you.

580
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:31,365
You lose everyday.

581
00:39:44,626 --> 00:39:47,253
Gayoung, do you want to be my girlfriend?

582
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,452
What?

583
00:39:55,443 --> 00:39:57,963
It seems like people
won't leave you alone.

584
00:39:58,731 --> 00:39:59,564
What?

585
00:40:00,889 --> 00:40:02,053
What do you want me to do?

586
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:06,229
Should I get revenge or
make them feel sorry?

587
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:10,775
-What are you...
-I'll just do both.

588
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,245
I'm in the acting business.

589
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,881
There's a genre that
I always wanted to try.

590
00:40:20,304 --> 00:40:22,219
Alright, bring it on.

591
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:23,526
Hey, come here.

592
00:40:27,518 --> 00:40:28,906
You're Joo Gayoung.

593
00:40:29,423 --> 00:40:30,872
The girl they were just talking about.

594
00:40:31,313 --> 00:40:32,499
I'll help you.

595
00:40:34,066 --> 00:40:35,270
Who are you?

596
00:40:35,448 --> 00:40:37,857
Just someone who's in a foul mood.

597
00:40:39,054 --> 00:40:40,044
You know...

598
00:40:40,764 --> 00:40:43,174
...I hate jerks who toy
with women's feelings.

00:40:59,538 --> 00:41:01,259
So you're really going?

601
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:04,984
Mom...

602
00:41:05,899 --> 00:41:07,303
Did you go through my room?

603
00:41:07,853 --> 00:41:09,868
I said no, again and again.

604
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:12,672
I tried to stop you for the past 10 years.

605
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:14,733
And you're going to have it your way?

606
00:41:14,818 --> 00:41:17,972
I thought it over the past 10 years.

607
00:41:18,223 --> 00:41:19,664
And my decision is...

608
00:41:22,548 --> 00:41:23,381
...this.

609
00:41:23,465 --> 00:41:25,435
Are you trying to send me to a grave?

610
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:29,170
Doctor, police, judge,
lawyer, prosecutor!

611
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:34,450
There are so many helping professions.
Why must you be a priest? Why!

612
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:37,602
I couldn't help it.

613
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:40,064
I tried not to...

614
00:41:40,994 --> 00:41:42,600
...but I couldn't help it.

615
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:46,984
How can I trust my own son
to the Man upstairs?

616
00:41:47,153 --> 00:41:51,126
Have I heard his voice?
Have I ever talked to him?

617
00:41:51,494 --> 00:41:52,562
I can't.

618
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,214
I can't!

620

I saved it up all this time for you.

Who said I needed money?

622
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,610
I don't need money.

623
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:18,435
If you go there...

624

...you won't see your family
or your friends for years.

625
00:42:21,884 --> 00:42:23,241
Why do you want to live like that?

626
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:24,592
Why...

627
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,900
Why do you have to go down that path?

628

Mom.

629
00:42:41,372 --> 00:42:43,062
I have already made up my mind.

630
00:42:46,008 --> 00:42:48,595
If you're going to do as you please,
get out of this house!

631
00:42:48,843 --> 00:42:50,255
-Mom...
-Get out.

632
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:54,191
If you go there,
you won't be my son anymore.

633
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,346
I have work to do.

634
00:43:10,993 --> 00:43:12,090
I'll be back.

635
00:44:49,923 --> 00:44:51,289
I feel so lame...

636
00:44:53,588 --> 00:44:56,943
...for being too nice to curse
even at a time like this.

637
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:01,421
So lame...

Director Choi.

00:45:10,966 --> 00:45:13,044
Is T'road Airlines our competitor?

640
00:45:16,939 --> 00:45:21,946
So why should I analyze
the STP of our sister company?

641
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:24,522
It's not like we didn't expect this.

642
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:27,795
Whatever they do, it's their business.

643
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,528
We'll achieve the market share
our own way.

644
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,296
Don't get distracted.

645
00:45:48,689 --> 00:45:52,643
I've been looking everywhere for you,
and you were at my house.

646
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,471
Which school uniform is that?

647
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:09,193
He's gorgeous. Is he's an idol trainee?

648
00:46:10,613 --> 00:46:11,968
He's so handsome.

649
00:46:24,078 --> 00:46:25,283
He looked me in the eye!

650
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:35,092
Why didn't you answer my calls?

651
00:46:35,836 --> 00:46:37,599
Are you trying to drive me insane?

652
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:42,133
I almost died missing you!

653
00:46:46,215 --> 00:46:47,448
Hurry!

654
00:46:53,502 --> 00:46:55,542
Hurry up. Next line!

655
00:46:58,974 --> 00:47:01,146
I told you not to call me
whenever you please.

656
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:05,027
It's hard for me if you do this.

657
00:47:05,835 --> 00:47:07,625
Nice one.

658
00:47:09,364 --> 00:47:10,803
I can't control it.

659
00:47:11,004 --> 00:47:12,939
How can I control myself
when I'm in love?

660
00:47:15,784 --> 00:47:18,389
Nice viewer reactions.

661
00:47:21,617 --> 00:47:22,450
Joo Gayoung?

662
00:47:25,685 --> 00:47:26,645
Is that the guy?

663
00:47:27,148 --> 00:47:28,624
The chump you're toying with?

664
00:47:28,952 --> 00:47:30,281
-What?
-Toying with?

665
00:47:31,424 --> 00:47:32,315
It is him.

666
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:35,102
The pitiful fool who doesn't
even know he's just a toy.

667
00:47:40,302 --> 00:47:41,135
Gayoung.

668
00:47:42,012 --> 00:47:43,050
You should decide.

669
00:47:43,553 --> 00:47:44,474
Is it him or me?

670
00:47:58,087 --> 00:47:58,920
Don't go.

671
00:48:14,103 --> 00:48:15,084
Hey, Minwoo.

672
00:48:16,328 --> 00:48:17,333
You...

673
00:48:18,652 --> 00:48:19,930
...are ugly.

674
00:48:22,863 --> 00:48:24,409
Ugly!

675
00:48:25,624 --> 00:48:29,020
So get over yourself.

676
00:48:29,478 --> 00:48:30,880
What did you...

677
00:48:31,962 --> 00:48:34,278
Don't touch my woman.
The last shot.

678
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:38,031
You little shit.

679
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,133
I expected that coming.

680
00:48:40,812 --> 00:48:41,679
All right.

681
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:44,382
Bring it on one by one.

682
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:46,850
-I don't think so.
-Okay. Time out.

683
00:48:47,754 --> 00:48:48,587
What now?

684
00:48:49,453 --> 00:48:50,798
Let's make it two at a time.

685
00:48:50,915 --> 00:48:52,276
-What the hell?
-Come here.

686
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:57,297
Ddolki, Ddeongee, Hochi, Saechomi...

687
00:48:57,381 --> 00:48:58,487
Wrong.

688
00:48:58,571 --> 00:49:02,461
-Drago, Yorong, Macho, Mimi...
-Wrong.

689
00:49:03,475 --> 00:49:05,373
How could you not get it right once?

690
00:49:05,881 --> 00:49:08,946
Are you so deeply in love
that you can't think straight?

691
00:49:09,434 --> 00:49:10,477
This one I know.

692
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:13,012
Of course you should.
He looks different.

693
00:49:13,096 --> 00:49:14,081
Right.

694
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:16,611
Why is this one different?

695
00:49:17,435 --> 00:49:19,289
Why are you mumbling
a question to yourself?

696
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,711
Are you thirsty for attention?

697
00:49:21,484 --> 00:49:22,424
Secretary Jung.

698
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:25,429
Have you ever been excited
by looking at a man's body?

699
00:49:30,007 --> 00:49:31,246
It's not like that.

700
00:49:34,036 --> 00:49:35,616
I said it's not like that.

701
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:49,542
-Hello?
-Are you the father of Seo Dojae??

702
00:49:49,627 --> 00:49:51,038
I'm calling from the police station.

703
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:53,992
Your son was brought in for assault.

704
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:56,375
My... son?

705
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,509
Yes, your son.

706
00:49:57,684 --> 00:49:59,389
Just to be clear.

707
00:49:59,884 --> 00:50:01,165
What year is it...

708
00:50:02,129 --> 00:50:03,231
...over there?

709
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,492
Minwoo, are you okay?

710
00:50:20,577 --> 00:50:24,005
Gosh, why did you get into a fight?

711
00:50:24,776 --> 00:50:25,682
Are you okay?

712
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:28,107
What happened to my son?

713
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,200
How could he do this?

714
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:34,310
Seo Dojae?

715
00:50:36,065 --> 00:50:36,898
Dad.

716
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:45,321
I can tell you had him early
from an unintended pregnancy.

717
00:50:46,388 --> 00:50:48,746
No wonder your son is like this.

718
00:50:49,301 --> 00:50:52,917
This is why we should keep
classless people away from our children.

719
00:50:53,097 --> 00:50:57,045
What an execellent statement.
It totally shows your level.

720
00:50:57,537 --> 00:51:00,775
What? What did my son do wrong?

721
00:51:01,196 --> 00:51:05,597
I heard that girl forgot her place
and tried to seduce my son.

722
00:51:05,682 --> 00:51:08,899
Hey, lady. That's way out of line.

723
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:11,024
Look at him.

724
00:51:11,363 --> 00:51:13,337
How dare you cock your eyes
at me, you little twerp!

725
00:51:13,422 --> 00:51:16,375
Don't argue with the likes of them.

726
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,043
Sue them. Leave it to the law.

727
00:51:19,229 --> 00:51:22,587
-The law should teach them a lesson!
-Look here, ma'am.

728
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,214
I'm afraid it was your son
who threw the first punch.

729
00:51:26,299 --> 00:51:29,687
But I dodged it very quickly.

730
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:32,080
Also, your sons chased after me...

731
00:51:32,165 --> 00:51:36,887
...and got tangled up in each others
feet like a bunch of idiots.

732
00:51:36,972 --> 00:51:38,042
Hey!

733
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:39,797
You little shit!

734
00:51:42,843 --> 00:51:43,676
Are you okay?

735
00:51:44,507 --> 00:51:46,026
-Are you bleeding?
-I'm okay.

736
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,231
What? You're about to bleed a liter?

737
00:51:50,158 --> 00:51:51,708
You feel like fainting?

738
00:51:54,543 --> 00:51:57,602
Oh my! I think my leg's broken!

739
00:51:57,687 --> 00:52:00,974
Call an ambulance! I'm going to die!

740
00:52:03,344 --> 00:52:05,158
Sounds good to me.
Let's leave it to the law.

741
00:52:11,517 --> 00:52:13,597
What kind of joke is this?

742
00:52:15,144 --> 00:52:18,446
"Sunho Group's... T'road Airline"?

743
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:20,638
I've informed our legal team.

744
00:52:20,779 --> 00:52:23,913
Let's find out who the attacker
and the victim was...

745
00:52:23,998 --> 00:52:25,709
...then proceed according to the law.

746
00:52:26,237 --> 00:52:29,561
-Including the assault here.
-Ambulance!

747
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:35,787
We don't have to go by the law
over a children's fight.

748
00:52:35,878 --> 00:52:38,037
You're the one who brought it up.

749
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:39,469
When did I say that?

750
00:52:45,087 --> 00:52:46,613
Why did you help me out?

751
00:52:46,734 --> 00:52:47,734
Because I love you.

752
00:52:49,368 --> 00:52:52,925
Not that. What's the real reason?

753
00:52:53,917 --> 00:52:56,762
Because the tteokbokki you treated
me that day was so delicious?

754
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:01,156
Thank you.

755
00:53:01,832 --> 00:53:02,838
It was a pleasure.

756
00:53:03,483 --> 00:53:04,316
Bye now.

757
00:53:05,951 --> 00:53:08,570
Can I have your number?

758
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:14,925
-I'm going abroad to study.
-Abroad?

759
00:53:16,012 --> 00:53:17,890
-Where?
-France.

760
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:20,546
-You know Cannes, right?
-Cannes?

761
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:21,534
I'll...

762
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:26,723
...return when I become
a cooler guy that you deserve.

763
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:32,375
You even exit the stage in a perfect way.

764
00:53:33,503 --> 00:53:34,682
That was an excellent performance.

765
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:39,230
It was an honor to perform with you.

766
00:53:41,511 --> 00:53:42,486
The honor's all mine.

767
00:53:58,957 --> 00:54:02,164
I knew you were a nice person,
but not to this extent.

768
00:54:03,142 --> 00:54:05,388
You think you know someone,
but really you don't.

769
00:54:05,472 --> 00:54:07,976
That's why you get betrayed.
Why did you come?

770
00:54:08,061 --> 00:54:09,007
They called me.

771
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:13,428
So you weren't happy to see me,
but you came because they called?

772
00:54:13,513 --> 00:54:15,904
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You said you feel uncomfortable.

773
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:19,423
Look ahead or you'll crash the car.
Don't look at me who makes you uneasy.

774
00:54:25,737 --> 00:54:27,836
Why? Should I get out
since I make you uncomfortable?

775
00:54:27,921 --> 00:54:29,642
I asked you what that means.

776
00:54:29,726 --> 00:54:33,291
You said you want me to come back
as soon as possible.

777
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:35,838
You said you were uncomfortable.
What did you mean by that?

778
00:54:36,207 --> 00:54:38,238
It means you don't like me
the way I am right now.

779
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:43,078
After all that talk about how you'll
recognize me, and how you're unbiased…

780
00:54:43,253 --> 00:54:44,725
You're just like everyone else.

781
00:54:49,576 --> 00:54:50,827
Is that why you're sulking?

782
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:52,584
I'm not sulking. I'm angry.

783
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:55,703
You got into trouble and called me
when you were still sulking?

784
00:54:55,787 --> 00:54:57,746
Saying that I'm your dad
instead of your brother?

785
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:00,028
Even if I was sulking,
it was an emergency....

786
00:55:00,401 --> 00:55:02,422
I said I'm not sulking. I'm angry!

787
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:08,094
There will be a promotional event
a week later.

788
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:11,601
That's why I need our spokesmodel,
the actress Han Segye.

789
00:55:12,317 --> 00:55:12,904
What?

790
00:55:12,989 --> 00:55:15,827
Why would I be uncomfortable
with the way you look?

791
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,303
It's me of all people.

792
00:55:19,097 --> 00:55:21,117
You've been Han Segye
to me all this time.

793
00:55:21,686 --> 00:55:23,345
There was not a moment
when I felt differently.

794
00:55:24,098 --> 00:55:25,309
If I felt uncomfortable...

795
00:55:26,236 --> 00:55:27,740
...it was regarding the event.

796
00:55:29,047 --> 00:55:32,432
You should have said it correctly
so it didn't sound misleading.

797
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:36,743
I see your point.
I only thought of myself.

798
00:55:37,107 --> 00:55:39,202
I should've thought about
how it would sound to you.

799
00:55:39,287 --> 00:55:43,712
If you admit it so easily,
it makes me feel awkward...

800
00:55:44,502 --> 00:55:46,143
...and sorry.

801
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,253
Are you sorry?

802
00:55:48,622 --> 00:55:49,851
Yes, I am.

803
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,915
For calling you over a trouble...

804
00:55:52,467 --> 00:55:53,444
For misunderstanding...

805
00:55:54,542 --> 00:55:56,888
For getting drunk and...

806
00:55:57,547 --> 00:55:59,323
Then why don't we live together?

807
00:56:00,317 --> 00:56:02,376
You wanted to sleep with me,
and now you want to live together?

808
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,254
Think of it as a probation.

809
00:56:04,957 --> 00:56:06,584
Before we take care of business...

810
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:08,504
...you might end up in jail.

811
00:56:08,588 --> 00:56:10,834
There are boundaries to be kept
between a man and a woman.

812
00:56:10,918 --> 00:56:12,093
We're both men.

813
00:56:12,177 --> 00:56:14,646
I said I apologize for that statement.

814
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,472
You have no place to go anyway.

815
00:56:16,556 --> 00:56:18,762
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is.

816
00:56:25,622 --> 00:56:27,092
I will pay you back by working.

817
00:56:27,942 --> 00:56:30,443
Since I broke your valuable asset...

818
00:56:30,681 --> 00:56:31,936
...I'll pay you back by working.

819
00:56:32,808 --> 00:56:34,998
No. Pay me back with money.

820
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,099
I don't have money.

821
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:39,272
I will work as your domestic helper
until I pay that back in full.

822
00:56:39,592 --> 00:56:43,206
Why would I let a man
in my house as a helper?

823
00:56:43,706 --> 00:56:45,450
You let me in all this time.

824
00:56:46,365 --> 00:56:48,805
-That's because...
-But you were satisfied.

825
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,662
-I was satisfied, but...
-I'm going to be a priest.

826
00:56:56,304 --> 00:56:58,633
You mean, the female
counterpart of a groom...?

827
00:56:58,717 --> 00:57:01,684
No. Priest, the male counterpart of a nun.

828
00:57:04,945 --> 00:57:06,713
I have no interest in women.

829
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,293
Hence, I have no interest in you either.

830
00:57:12,338 --> 00:57:13,249
Still...

831
00:57:13,334 --> 00:57:14,329
Please help me.

832
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:19,855
You can't?

833
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:31,646
So?

834
00:57:32,133 --> 00:57:34,073
You're going to live there for a while?

835
00:57:34,306 --> 00:57:35,708
What else can I do?

836
00:57:36,552 --> 00:57:38,151
By the way, where are you now?

837
00:57:39,012 --> 00:57:40,490
I asked Aram, but she doesn't know either.

838
00:57:41,407 --> 00:57:42,443
I'm doing well.

839
00:57:42,565 --> 00:57:45,355
Don't ask anymore.
Curiosity kills the cat.

840
00:58:05,337 --> 00:58:06,950
I must be out of my mind.

841
00:58:28,189 --> 00:58:29,479
She's a strange woman.

842
00:58:38,106 --> 00:58:40,250
-Aren't you coming?
-I'm coming.

843
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,347
Why exercise so early in the morning?

844
00:58:44,467 --> 00:58:47,480
In retrospect,
it was a series of strange days.

845
00:58:54,007 --> 00:58:55,608
I bought those for you.

846
00:58:58,641 --> 00:58:59,934
And I bought this for you.

847
00:59:00,015 --> 00:59:03,009
I casually ate meals with someone.

848
00:59:05,652 --> 00:59:07,843
Have fun. Bye!

849
00:59:08,862 --> 00:59:12,449
I casually said good bye to someone.

850
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,735
I couldn't believe my eyes.

851
00:59:19,873 --> 00:59:21,280
When did you come back?

852
00:59:22,998 --> 00:59:24,528
While you were sleeping?

853
00:59:27,187 --> 00:59:29,944
How about we make a love story like that?

854
00:59:30,098 --> 00:59:32,878
You fell in love with me
because I'm kind-hearted.

855
00:59:33,796 --> 00:59:36,239
And you told me how you feel
in just one week.

856
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:37,217
I did?

857
00:59:37,372 --> 00:59:39,189
This is what you said back then.

858
00:59:39,657 --> 00:59:41,778
"You're the kindest women I've ever met."

859
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:44,529
I said that?

860
00:59:51,106 --> 00:59:54,958
And casually sharing jokes with someone.

861
01:00:05,748 --> 01:00:07,070
It feels different.

862
01:00:08,342 --> 01:00:10,273
You're the first person to take my photo.

863
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:13,397
Here we go.

864
01:00:13,515 --> 01:00:15,976
One, two, three...

865
01:00:23,227 --> 01:00:24,183
Do you like it?

866
01:00:26,231 --> 01:00:27,064
I love it.

867
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:32,957
Recognizing each other...

868
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:35,043
...so casually.

869
01:00:38,402 --> 01:00:39,327
Ms. Han.

870
01:00:45,247 --> 01:00:46,177
Ms. Han?

871
01:00:52,902 --> 01:00:53,881
Ms. Han.

872
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:55,885
Because everything was so casual...

873
01:00:57,092 --> 01:00:58,940
...those days were so special.

874
01:01:27,441 --> 01:01:28,473
Did you sleep okay?

875
01:01:33,133 --> 01:01:33,966
Yes.

876
01:01:35,127 --> 01:01:36,399
I slept well.

877
01:01:37,108 --> 01:01:38,145
For the first time...

878
01:01:38,938 --> 01:01:40,529
...coming back felt disappointing.

879
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:58,481
Hey, you're looking fine.

880
01:01:58,892 --> 01:02:00,617
Did you go somewhere nice?

881
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,331
Everything was just the same as usual.

882
01:02:05,074 --> 01:02:06,635
Should I take a guess?

883
01:02:07,187 --> 01:02:09,608
L-O-V-E, love.

884
01:02:10,323 --> 01:02:12,262
It seems like you're in love.

885
01:02:15,121 --> 01:02:16,840
You can't fool me, you know.

886
01:02:17,086 --> 01:02:19,875
Let's go. Looking great.

887
01:02:25,748 --> 01:02:27,509
Tteokbokki for one person, please.

888
01:02:27,585 --> 01:02:30,485
Well, look who's here. It's Han Segye.

889
01:02:30,586 --> 01:02:32,727
I haven't seen you here in a while.

890
01:02:34,301 --> 01:02:35,877
I heard you got a boyfriend now.

891
01:02:36,412 --> 01:02:37,581
Oh, yes...

892
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:40,272
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

893
01:02:54,196 --> 01:02:55,608
Tteokbokki for one person, please.

894
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,741
Would you like an autograph?

895
01:03:03,853 --> 01:03:04,686
No thank you.

896
01:03:16,341 --> 01:03:18,051
They make good tteokbokki here, right?

897
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:19,563
What?

898
01:03:21,649 --> 01:03:22,986
Thank you.

899
01:03:26,607 --> 01:03:28,772
For what?

900
01:03:30,487 --> 01:03:31,637
For a lot of things.

901
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,089
Aren't you going to pick it up?

902
01:03:41,639 --> 01:03:42,818
It's noisy.

903
01:03:45,403 --> 01:03:48,433
-Hello?
-At last, you picked up.

904
01:04:01,646 --> 01:04:03,847
I transferred back the 200 million won.

905
01:04:04,399 --> 01:04:06,367
Except the 100 won which was mine.

906
01:04:07,366 --> 01:04:08,681
Ms. Han...

907
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:10,437
I apologize.

908
01:04:11,133 --> 01:04:14,384
It was very rude of me.
I should've known better.

909
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,280
I am sorry.

910
01:04:18,873 --> 01:04:24,680
Are you giving me stuffs
since money can be easily returned?

911
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:27,086
No, it's not what you think.

912
01:04:29,062 --> 01:04:32,141
Please look after my Dojae.

913
01:04:34,548 --> 01:04:35,883
Just like that?

914
01:04:36,003 --> 01:04:36,922
I know.

915
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:40,119
It's like locking the stable door
after the steed is stolen.

916
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:42,879
So...

917
01:05:05,407 --> 01:05:07,712
To find the Cinderella that I lost...

918
01:05:08,845 --> 01:05:11,416
...I should bring the shoe that she lost.

919
01:05:15,835 --> 01:05:16,668
Will you please...

920
01:05:17,817 --> 01:05:19,665
...be my Cinderella?

921
01:05:20,474 --> 01:05:21,307
Pardon?

922
01:05:22,786 --> 01:05:25,244
(Looking for Cinderella.
T'way will be your glass slipper.)

923
01:05:25,328 --> 01:05:27,643
Congratulations on becoming Cinderella.

924
01:05:27,696 --> 01:05:29,126
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

925
01:05:46,771 --> 01:05:47,610
(Upgrade to First-Class)

926
01:06:20,448 --> 01:06:21,380
Good.

927
01:06:49,741 --> 01:06:52,242
I saw him many times when I had that face.

928
01:06:53,851 --> 01:06:56,546
I haven't seen him once
after I came back to this face.

929
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:23,139
(Sharp nose and red lips that stands out.)

930
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:28,211
(Han Segye...?)

931
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:33,550
(Han Segye)

932
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,988
(Auntie)

933
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:45,194
(Auntie)

934
01:07:46,076 --> 01:07:46,909
Hello?

935
01:07:47,276 --> 01:07:50,157
Just wanted to let you know
that today's event went well.

936
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:53,320
Yes. I saw the photos.

937
01:07:55,903 --> 01:07:56,806
You did.

938
01:07:59,135 --> 01:08:00,517
But why didn't you say anything about it?

939
01:08:01,692 --> 01:08:04,209
So the chief doesn't come
to those kind of things?

940
01:08:04,294 --> 01:08:07,796
Usually I don't. I just receive a report.

941
01:08:10,518 --> 01:08:12,118
Can't you just come?

942
01:08:12,364 --> 01:08:13,197
Why?

943
01:08:14,406 --> 01:08:15,239
What?

944
01:08:15,427 --> 01:08:17,056
Why do you want to see me?

945
01:08:18,837 --> 01:08:22,468
I never said I want to see you.
That's ridiculous.

946
01:08:23,806 --> 01:08:28,601
If you're having fun
while I'm working my butt off...

947
01:08:29,015 --> 01:08:31,745
...I'd feel jealous and annoyed.

948
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:34,958
So... did you call me because you miss me?

949
01:08:35,626 --> 01:08:36,467
No.

950
01:08:38,842 --> 01:08:40,909
I just wanted to check something.

951
01:08:43,483 --> 01:08:44,959
My razor is there, right?

952
01:08:45,244 --> 01:08:47,179
No. I threw it all away.

953
01:08:47,394 --> 01:08:50,745
You're a weird man. Why did you
throw away someone else's stuffs?

954
01:08:51,091 --> 01:08:53,468
I think it's weirder to keep
someone else's stuffs in my house.

955
01:08:53,954 --> 01:08:55,442
If you're done asking, I'm hanging up.

956
01:08:55,527 --> 01:08:56,603
Wait.

957
01:08:56,745 --> 01:08:57,749
What now?

958
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:00,003
Well...

959
01:09:03,643 --> 01:09:07,424
We didn't finish watching
that movie at your house.

960
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:09,145
Don't finish watching by yourself.

961
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,285
You fell asleep as soon as
the movie was on.

962
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:15,903
No I didn't. I just had my eyes closed.

963
01:09:16,802 --> 01:09:18,460
Fine. I won't watch by myself.

964
01:09:18,846 --> 01:09:20,882
Are you happy now? Good bye.

965
01:09:21,105 --> 01:09:22,011
Control tower...

966
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:27,403
Have you ever been inside
of the control tower?

967
01:09:28,489 --> 01:09:30,030
Why do you ask?

968
01:09:32,876 --> 01:09:34,173
Just out of curiosity.

969
01:09:34,258 --> 01:09:35,504
Are you having trouble falling asleep?

970
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,421
Yes.

971
01:09:36,742 --> 01:09:38,105
I can't sleep.

972
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,075
Then let's go out.

973
01:09:51,774 --> 01:09:52,989
Is this allowed?

974
01:09:54,196 --> 01:09:56,039
It is allowed. It's mine.

975
01:09:56,128 --> 01:09:57,193
Really?

976
01:09:58,212 --> 01:10:00,096
To be exact, it's my grandfather's.

977
01:10:00,921 --> 01:10:04,522
It's a training center where we train
our air-traffic controllers.

978
01:10:06,057 --> 01:10:07,598
When there is no training...

979
01:10:08,085 --> 01:10:10,206
...I can make use of it personally.

980
01:10:10,347 --> 01:10:12,217
We're really going in?

981
01:10:12,302 --> 01:10:13,550
You said you were curious.

982
01:11:06,923 --> 01:11:08,105
That's just crazy.

983
01:11:08,687 --> 01:11:09,662
I get what you mean.

984
01:11:10,358 --> 01:11:12,348
That's how I felt when I came here
for the first time.

985
01:11:13,597 --> 01:11:14,855
Do you come here often?

986
01:11:15,197 --> 01:11:18,725
I come by more than once a week.

987
01:11:19,746 --> 01:11:22,278
Equipment inspections and training...

988
01:11:22,813 --> 01:11:25,150
I need to check a lot of things.

989
01:11:28,299 --> 01:11:30,188
Why do you work so hard?

990
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:34,211
Isn't this your family business?

991
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:37,090
I doubt that it's something
you wanted to do.

992
01:11:38,036 --> 01:11:39,967
And you have that unusual condition.

993
01:11:43,796 --> 01:11:45,208
Because I can't lose this.

994
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:54,033
At first, that's how I felt.

995
01:11:55,308 --> 01:11:56,386
It's amazing.

996
01:11:57,933 --> 01:12:03,161
People on the opposite sides of the world
who may never see each other…

997
01:12:04,066 --> 01:12:08,497
...can meet up and fall in love,
or spend the rest of their lives together.

998
01:12:13,728 --> 01:12:16,945
Maybe it's about connecting those
who would've never met.

999
01:12:18,342 --> 01:12:20,653
Maybe it's about helping those...

1000
01:12:21,768 --> 01:12:23,254
...who never would've found love.

1001
01:12:25,159 --> 01:12:27,009
That's the kind of work I do.

1002
01:12:33,238 --> 01:12:34,529
It seems like destiny.

1003
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:36,916
The two of us?

1004
01:13:09,878 --> 01:13:10,884
I'm sorry.

1005
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:53,218
(Beauty Inside)

1006
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:57,904
What does it mean when a guy kisses
you and then pretends he didn't?

1007
01:13:57,989 --> 01:14:00,375
-Are you dating now?
-No, I'm not dating.

1008
01:14:00,459 --> 01:14:02,492
Why isn't he calling?
Why hasn't he called?

1009
01:14:02,577 --> 01:14:03,883
It's already been an hour.

1010
01:14:03,968 --> 01:14:04,875
What are you doing?

1011
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,291
I've done it many times.

1012
01:14:06,376 --> 01:14:07,879
I'm stressed out.

1013
01:14:07,964 --> 01:14:09,997
I normally don't talk about these
kind of things with others.

1014
01:14:10,082 --> 01:14:12,799
You didn't talk because no one listened.

1015
01:14:12,884 --> 01:14:14,193
I'll listen to everything.

1016
01:14:14,278 --> 01:14:17,518
I couldn't tell you because
I'm not used to this kind of thing.

1017
01:14:17,603 --> 01:14:21,142
How am I supposed to say it
when I'm a total mess?

1018
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,224
Just say it.

1019
01:14:23,296 --> 01:14:24,659
I'm a mess, too.
