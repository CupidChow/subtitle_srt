1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,119
There's nothing
particularly wrong with you

2
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:08,790
I see.

3
00:00:08,956 --> 00:00:11,471
Can you tell me exactly
where you are hurting?

4
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:15,669
This despair I felt
from this unexplainable pain...

5
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:30,073
There's a bad spirit clinging onto you.

6
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:35,671
You'll be in trouble.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It will cause a huge trouble.

8
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:42,353
...I just want to try everything
to find an answer.

9
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:46,135
I've tried everything
to cure this illness.

10
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:49,192
I've used a talisman and
received exorcism dozens of times.

11
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:50,585
A girl.

12
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:52,773
A man.

13
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:55,096
A child.

14
00:00:55,832 --> 00:00:57,010
An old lady.

15
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:01,450
Evil spirits...

16
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:05,718
...are residing inside your body.

17
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:07,376
Go away!

18
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:09,666
Go away!

19
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:11,385
Get out!

20
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:13,140
You're don't want to leave?

21
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,445
Fine.

22
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:15,692
Then, I will...

23
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:19,449
...set you on fire!

24
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:20,987
Go away.

25
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:22,726
Go away!

26
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:30,796
The longer I have to endure
this unexplainable pain...

27
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,162
...the more I want to resent
something without any reason.

28
00:01:34,947 --> 00:01:36,242
For example...

29
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:38,079
...a twist of fate...

30
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:47,684
...if there's a God, then Him...

31
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:27,788
...all of my mistakes...

32
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:31,199
...or someone who loves me
unconditionally...

33
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,751
...even if I despise them.

34
00:02:56,203 --> 00:02:57,724
What are you doing?

35
00:02:58,285 --> 00:02:59,362
Sleep.

36
00:03:00,726 --> 00:03:02,934
But you woke me up, Mom.

37
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,494
You're the one who woke me up.

38
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:08,768
Why did you work out
until you're all sore?

39
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:11,736
I have no idea
what's wrong with your body.

40
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,891
You're right.

41
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:17,740
I'm curious to know
what's wrong with my body too.

42
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:21,632
You should know best
since you gave birth to me.

43
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,599
I told you to stop.

44
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,722
How can I stop?

45
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:30,866
Whenever I hear you groan in pain...

46
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:33,320
...my heart feels like it's about to drop.

47
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:35,957
When you're sick...

48
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,463
...I feel like it's my fault.

49
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:43,218
It's as if you're being punished,
for my mistakes.

50
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:46,417
If I could...

51
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:48,480
...I want the pain to
be transferred to me.

52
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:53,026
Do you even know how I feel?

53
00:03:53,445 --> 00:03:55,376
That day, I made my mind...

54
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:59,011
...that I'll never be my mom's punishment.

55
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:01,236
That I'll never...

56
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:06,183
...tell her about this horrible condition.

57
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,675
So if I can..

58
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:09,658
...I'll never tell her
for the rest of my life.

59
00:04:09,743 --> 00:04:12,179
Han Segye, your mom is here.

60
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:13,502
Mom?

61
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,417
Mrs. Han.

62
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,042
Who's this?

63
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:37,517
I did not plan to get caught
in this situation.

64
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:39,938
He's my nephew.

65
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:45,724
He must really miss his mom
that he suddenly called for his mom.

66
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:46,704
Your nephew?

67
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,766
But you're an only child.

68
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:53,104
He's my sworn sister's

69
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:56,468
Mrs. Han, do you know about sworn sisters?

70
00:04:56,577 --> 00:04:58,298
-Were you a bully at school?
-No.

71
00:04:58,383 --> 00:04:59,520
No. That's not what I mean.

72
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:03,762
I'm actually grooming him
to become an actor.

73
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,420
I thought you said
he's your sworn sister's son.

74
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,915
That's right.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,181
I'm younger than my sworn sister.

76
00:05:10,463 --> 00:05:12,065
To sum it all up...

77
00:05:12,748 --> 00:05:15,424
...she's not feeling so well nowadays...

78
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,679
...so she's at the hospital.

79
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:20,003
Where's his father?
Why do you have to take care of him?

80
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,343
Well...

81
00:05:23,754 --> 00:05:26,202
Actually, she is...

82
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:28,535
...a single mom.

83
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:32,689
Geez. Men only cause troubles
but never actually take responsibility.

84
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:36,602
When you grow up, you should
find your dad and avenge him.

85
00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:37,727
I'll help you.

86
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:40,144
Gosh. My mom...

87
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:41,687
...can be quite aggressive.

88
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,971
Still, you can't just bring a kid
in and out of this place.

89
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,938
This is how the rumors start.

90
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:52,247
Don't worry.
I hid him before bringing him in.

91
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:56,091
Now, I just need to hide him again
when I leave the house.

92
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:58,766
-Where's Segye?
-She has a shooting outside the city.

93
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,890
Then, why are you here?

94
00:05:59,975 --> 00:06:01,975
I'm just stopping by
to pick up some stuff.

95
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,810
Oh no. We're late.

96
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:06,407
We should get going.

97
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,271
Let's go.

98
00:06:09,855 --> 00:06:11,130
You can leave him here.

99
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:18,254
Leave him here. I can look after him.

100
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:19,953
You're bringing him to the shoot?

101
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:21,341
That'll spread the rumor even more.

102
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:25,063
I'll keep him company in the house,
so just come back as soon as you're done.

103
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:28,575
You're okay with staying here
with me, right?

104
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:31,704
No, I'm not okay with that.

105
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:32,976
Well...

106
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:36,602
You don't really have to do that.

107
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,792
How can you work and
take care of him at the same time?

108
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,067
I'll look after him,
you just take care of my daughter.

109
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,728
Well, you see...

110
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:46,886
-The thing is, he's very...
-Come here.

111
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:57,904
Say goodbye to your aunt.

112
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,145
Say "Bye, Aunt Woomi".

113
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:03,626
Aunt Woomi...

114
00:07:04,943 --> 00:07:06,092
...bye.

115
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:09,946
I'll pray...

116
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,057
...for your safety.

117
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:14,062
You'll come and save me, right?

118
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:18,483
People will think you're his child.

119
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,966
Why is your farewell so depressing?

120
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:41,390
Let's go inside.

121
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:45,796
My friend...

122
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,702
...please don't forget me
who you're leaving behind.

123
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:01,963
My future seems bleak...

124
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:04,188
...and my blood is boiling.

125
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:13,500
Here you go.

126
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:14,669
Let's have a bite.

127
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:18,140
What's your name?

128
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:19,177
Se...

129
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,210
Se?

130
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,012
It's Woojoo.

131
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:25,249
Se Woojoo?

132
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:27,713
My name is Seo Woojoo.

133
00:08:29,437 --> 00:08:30,513
All right.

134
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,134
Woojoo, do you like this?

135
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:44,910
My daughter also loves this dish
when she was your age.

136
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:47,428
But back then, I didn't have much money.

137
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:49,203
So I can only feed her vegetables.

138
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:51,739
The thought of it still breaks my heart.

139
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,596
Gosh. Look at you.

140
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,117
You're looking at me
as if you know how it feels.

141
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:05,263
But strangely enough...

142
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:07,640
...I kind of like this.

143
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:09,188
Here. Eat up.

144
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:24,644
I can do it on my own.

145
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:29,182
Kids these days grow up so quick.

146
00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:32,789
Segye still couldn't go to the bathroom
on her own at that age.

147
00:09:34,444 --> 00:09:36,685
I can't answer your call right now. I'm...

148
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:38,158
It's that day.

149
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,186
Should I go there now?

150
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:40,697
No. Don't come.

151
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,705
Why?

152
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:43,024
Who did you turn into this time?

153
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,525
It's okay.

154
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:46,163
I can still recognize you.

155
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:49,123
That's exactly why.
I'm scared that you'd recognize me.

156
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,549
My pride is the last thing
I'm hanging on to.

157
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:54,251
You're making me more curious
when you say it like that.

158
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:56,587
Do you remember the third clause
in our contract?

159
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:58,672
"Respond to calls actively..."

160
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:01,106
"... and show a cooperative attitude."

161
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:03,708
I'll call you when I need you.
Just be on standby until then.

162
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:05,380
I thought you said not to come.

163
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:07,974
That's why only come when I need you.

164
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:10,239
Just in case, take your phone to bed.

165
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:12,117
You need to help me keep my secret.

166
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,509
If you don't, I'm going to sue
you for breach of contract.

167
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,284
Who are you keeping your secret from?

168
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,257
Woojoo, are you okay?

169
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:21,589
Does your tummy hurt a lot?

170
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:23,484
I'm out of time. I need to go.

171
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:25,263
Don't contact me for the time being.

172
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:27,642
I'm done.

173
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:29,468
(Don't contact me for the time being)

174
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:33,377
Did I...

175
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:35,044
...just get dumped?

176
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:36,956
I'm glad to hear that.

177
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,823
Just go check on your fish.

178
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:46,835
I've come up with a name for this one.

179
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,773
I don't want to hear it.

180
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:53,660
-Why not?
-Because it's going to be obvious.

181
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:59,264
The loser will buy coffee
for everyone. Okay?

182
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:00,701
-Okay.
-Okay.

183
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:03,113
Fold your finger if you're a man.

184
00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:05,610
Fold your finger if you're over 35.

185
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:08,358
Fold your finger if you're
a team leader or higher.

186
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:09,526
-Just fold a finger.
-Hurry up.

187
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:12,080
Wow. You guys are playing this
the dirty way, aren't you?

188
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:14,267
Fold your finger if you're
below the team leader.

189
00:11:15,894 --> 00:11:17,836
Fold your finger if your hair
doesn't reach your shoulders.

190
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,720
Fold your finger
if your ears are not pierced.

191
00:11:22,552 --> 00:11:24,858
Aren't you guys being too petty?

192
00:11:24,943 --> 00:11:27,601
You're obviously targeting me.
Are you not?

193
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,883
What's going on?
Why didn't you fold your finger?

194
00:11:31,513 --> 00:11:32,977
You have an ear piercing?

195
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:34,885
I had one last weekend.

196
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:37,240
What kind of man has their ears pierced?

197
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:38,769
Gosh, you're so outdated.

198
00:11:38,854 --> 00:11:40,933
Who doesn't pierce their ears nowadays?

199
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:43,298
That person is right here.

200
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:45,842
Team Leader, please go buy us some coffee.

201
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:48,906
This is invalid.
You guys colluded against me.

202
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:49,966
That's why...

203
00:11:50,158 --> 00:11:53,031
...you should've paid more
attention to your staff.

204
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:55,891
How am I supposed to notice
he pierced his ear?

205
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:57,488
I bet even Mr. Seo doesn't notice it.

206
00:11:57,573 --> 00:11:59,088
What are you talking about?

207
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:02,629
Mr. Seo notices every single tiny detail.

208
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,524
Do you want to bet on it? 50,000 won?

209
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,369
-Sure.
-I'm in.

210
00:12:05,454 --> 00:12:06,799
-I'm in.
-Okay.

211
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:14,478
Good morning, Mr. Seo.

212
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:18,667
Hello, Mr. Seo.

213
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,683
Hi.

214
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:21,806
Looks like you're taking a break.

215
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:24,117
It's important to take a break from work.

216
00:12:24,884 --> 00:12:25,745
Excuse me, then.

217
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:32,559
By the way,

218
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,354
Jang Minhee, did you
have your ears pierced?

219
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:41,911
Yes.

220
00:12:42,573 --> 00:12:45,023
-Nice!
-I know Mr. Seo will never let us down.

221
00:12:45,475 --> 00:12:48,088
Team Leader, give us our 50,000 won now.

222
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:51,287
You're not helping me at all.

223
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:54,009
What's wrong with you?

224
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:56,398
Oh my god, what is this feeling?

225
00:12:56,771 --> 00:12:57,672
My heart is fluttering.

226
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:04,564
I forgot my wallet.

227
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:06,372
You pay.

228
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,775
I'll take everything from here to here.

229
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:13,118
I take it back when I said
I kind of like this.

230
00:13:13,672 --> 00:13:16,011
That feeling only lasted one day.

231
00:13:16,785 --> 00:13:18,567
Now that I've been
stuck here for two days...

232
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,008
...I'm starting to get crazy.

233
00:13:25,162 --> 00:13:27,508
Watch the TV while drinking that.

234
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,110
Don't sit too close to the TV.

235
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,346
Geez. Who does she think I am?

236
00:13:37,612 --> 00:13:38,458
Wait...

237
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:40,594
This tastes better than I expected.

238
00:13:43,411 --> 00:13:47,008
But I feel a little bit of suspense.

239
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:51,068
Day three.

240
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,647
I want to be alone.

241
00:14:01,477 --> 00:14:02,518
What's wrong?

242
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,845
You can't fall asleep?

243
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:11,030
You've stayed with me for three days now.
Do you still feel uncomfortable?

244
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,907
Absolutely.

245
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:15,285
I'm very uncomfortable.

246
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,481
It's probably been 10 years...

247
00:14:18,973 --> 00:14:20,710
...since I've lain next to you.

248
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,322
But...

249
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,875
...it does feel kind of relaxing.

250
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:20,519
Long time no see, Eunho.

251
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:24,225
I'm back.

252
00:15:28,882 --> 00:15:31,323
Wash your hands and have a sit.

253
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:34,017
-Go.
-Hurry up. Go to your room.

254
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:46,176
The rice taste extra delicious today.

255
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:52,631
Mom, the seasoned vegetables are perfect.

256
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:57,544
I'll do the dishes.

257
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:01,200
Sure. Why not.

258
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:30,360
(2019 Seminary Admission Guide)

259
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:52,266
Why is Mom cleaning
so early in the morning?

260
00:17:52,974 --> 00:17:53,849
My photo room.

261
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:55,279
My dressing room.

262
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,217
Are you going to keep
sitting on that chair?

263
00:18:08,317 --> 00:18:09,826
-No.
-Why not?

264
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,896
It suits you very well.
Do some of my work while you're at it.

265
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:15,540
I'm already doing a lot of your work.

266
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:18,363
I'm going to be a president.
President of a subsidiary.

267
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,075
I don't want to be a director.

268
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:22,813
Is my mom going to make you a president?

269
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:29,428
I'll do whatever it takes
to make you inherit Sunho Group,

270
00:18:29,553 --> 00:18:31,847
and then make sure you appoint me
as president afterward.

271
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,695
I'm going to make you a president?

272
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:36,468
You'll have to.

273
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,984
-If you don't, I'll reveal everything.
-What?

274
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:42,179
That while dating, you can't keep your
hands off your phone like some fool.

275
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:51,737
Hello?

276
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,332
Come to my house right now!

277
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,360
A kid?

278
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,093
I'm going out for a while.

279
00:19:08,262 --> 00:19:09,302
Sure.

280
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,324
Aren't you going to ask where I'm going?

281
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:14,528
I'm not.

282
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:16,072
It's so obvious.

283
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:02,730
Why isn't she coming?

284
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:14,243
What's wrong?

285
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:20,275
You should've called me
if you need to go to the bathroom.

286
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:22,517
It's okay. Don't cry.

287
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,908
My daughter used to wet her bed
even when she was in fifth grade.

288
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:29,041
Gosh. You peed a lot.

289
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,695
Come and stop my mom.

290
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:42,119
Do whatever it takes.

291
00:20:50,002 --> 00:20:52,342
This blanket somehow smells like apples.

292
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:58,418
Wait. Does she ever do her laundry?

293
00:21:16,528 --> 00:21:17,960
Excuse me for being rude.

294
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,468
Sir.

295
00:21:34,478 --> 00:21:35,661
Are you...

296
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:38,470
...Han Segye's mother?

297
00:21:39,513 --> 00:21:40,738
Yes, I am.

298
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,424
Are you Segye's ex-boyfriend?

299
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:54,250
Mrs. Han...

300
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,870
...please let me meet Segye.

301
00:21:57,704 --> 00:21:58,717
But...

302
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,947
...Segye is not home right now.

303
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:02,658
I know she's inside.

304
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:05,018
I can't give up on her like this.

305
00:22:09,007 --> 00:22:09,917
You're doing great.

306
00:22:11,682 --> 00:22:13,441
Get her out of the house.

307
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,039
I appreciate your determination,

308
00:22:17,124 --> 00:22:19,264
but Segye went to shoot outside the city.

309
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:20,485
She's really not home.

310
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,570
Then, would you please spare me some time?

311
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,990
I would love to do that,

312
00:22:26,115 --> 00:22:27,949
but this kid wet his bed.

313
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,047
No. I didn't. I'm serious.

314
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:40,452
I won't take long.

315
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:45,402
Can you manage on your own?

316
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,895
I'm going out for a while.
So you stay here with Kingkang.

317
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,827
Okay.

318
00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:53,561
-Let's go.
-Yes, Ma'am.

319
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:02,453
I didn't do it.

320
00:23:02,974 --> 00:23:04,111
You wet your bed?

321
00:23:17,774 --> 00:23:19,199
(Yoo Woomi)

322
00:23:22,897 --> 00:23:24,567
Come here right now. We're in trouble.

323
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:27,175
Marry her.

324
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,492
If you're not planning to,
then don't date her.

325
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,665
That issue is not something
I can decide easily...

326
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,462
If you're going to,
then do it within this month.

327
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:40,446
You seem to be quite impatient.

328
00:23:40,866 --> 00:23:42,324
I've wondered who Segye took after...

329
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:44,295
If you're not serious about my daughter,

330
00:23:44,395 --> 00:23:45,741
I want you to stop.

331
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:50,626
Segye... doesn't have a father.

332
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:52,883
-You know that right?
-Yes, I do.

333
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:55,205
I'm looking for someone...

334
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:58,711
...who can stay with her
for a long time, without changing.

335
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:02,855
Someone who won't suddenly die,
or disappear on her.

336
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:08,045
I've once loved a man like that.

337
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:11,962
But that didn't end up that well.

338
00:24:13,557 --> 00:24:15,122
I want Segye to have...

339
00:24:15,478 --> 00:24:19,236
...someone she can return to anytime
just like her home.

340
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,137
Can you be that for her?

341
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:24,758
As long as Segye doesn't change.

342
00:24:25,353 --> 00:24:26,816
She doesn't change that easily.

343
00:24:26,946 --> 00:24:28,447
I know because I raised her.

344
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,306
She's very consistent.

345
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:35,329
Then, I'll also be consistent like her.

346
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,990
Segye takes after you...

347
00:24:41,638 --> 00:24:43,432
...in many ways.

348
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:46,509
I'm prettier than her though.

349
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,137
She also takes after you in that sense.

350
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,513
Eunho, take this.

351
00:25:02,242 --> 00:25:03,482
Take this one too.

352
00:25:05,034 --> 00:25:06,056
Geez.

353
00:25:06,263 --> 00:25:08,978
Call your boyfriend to do stuff like this.
Don't call me.

354
00:25:09,063 --> 00:25:12,408
How can I ask my boyfriend to come here
when she looks like this?

355
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:13,720
Woomi...

356
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,179
...be honest with me.

357
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:16,889
You don't have a boyfriend, right?

358
00:25:18,688 --> 00:25:22,181
I don't care if this is an urgent matter,
I should beat you up first.

359
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:23,231
Wait.

360
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,422
So...

361
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:25,851
...where did your mother go?

362
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:27,631
She went out with Dojae.

363
00:25:29,983 --> 00:25:30,834
What's that for?

364
00:25:30,973 --> 00:25:34,477
You need to help me more
so that I don't look suspicious.

365
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:35,849
Help with what?

366
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,668
I need you to be my guardian.

367
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:41,896
If I go out alone, people will report me.

368
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:45,461
Childcare services will cost you more.

369
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:47,431
It doesn't make sense if you
pay me the same amount,

370
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:48,688
as you paid me to look after Kingkang.

371
00:25:48,773 --> 00:25:50,598
-You jerk.
-How dare you hit me.

372
00:25:54,224 --> 00:25:55,075
-So cute.
-Hey!

373
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:57,387
Just do as she says, you jerk.

374
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,908
You ignorant...

375
00:26:00,882 --> 00:26:02,168
...and violent woman.

376
00:26:05,088 --> 00:26:06,502
Take care of my mom for me.

377
00:26:06,587 --> 00:26:07,440
Okay.

378
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,853
Mrs. Han.

379
00:26:15,124 --> 00:26:16,084
Where's Woojoo?

380
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:17,213
Is he asleep?

381
00:26:17,298 --> 00:26:19,495
His mom called, so I sent him back.

382
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,427
What?

383
00:26:20,771 --> 00:26:22,509
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

384
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:26,146
I had no choice. His mom looked for him
as soon as she felt better.

385
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:28,986
That's right. You would always think
about your children first.

386
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:32,232
Speaking of, why are you here?
Where's my daughter?

387
00:26:32,317 --> 00:26:36,305
Segye needs some change of clothes.
So I came here to pick up some.

388
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:39,068
She's doing really great.

389
00:26:39,153 --> 00:26:42,277
Her acting skills are
improving by the days...

390
00:26:42,362 --> 00:26:44,800
Gosh, I forgot.
I was in the middle of cleaning up.

391
00:26:48,163 --> 00:26:49,182
Mrs. Han.

392
00:26:50,036 --> 00:26:51,775
I'll do it. I can do it for you.

393
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,928
What room is this?

394
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,327
It's an exercise room.

395
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:02,650
Exercise room.

396
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,634
Exercise.

397
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:08,839
You take this and spread it.

398
00:27:09,723 --> 00:27:11,400
There we go.

399
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:16,753
When Segye tries to maintain her figure,
she would call her instructors over...

400
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,872
...and do Pilates.

401
00:27:21,261 --> 00:27:23,372
She also does yoga.

402
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:24,903
Like this.

403
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,219
This is the world star, Segye's,
secret to great figure.

404
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:30,304
Does she hold group classes or something?

405
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:32,505
This is so lavish.

406
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,913
Mrs. Han, follow me like this.

407
00:27:34,998 --> 00:27:36,050
You should give it a try.

408
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,598
What did my mom say?

409
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,723
She told us to get married.

410
00:27:50,022 --> 00:27:51,042
Within this month.

411
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,066
Geez. Mom.

412
00:27:54,902 --> 00:27:56,424
I knew she would say something like that.

413
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:01,273
Anyway...

414
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:04,626
...we can't be together this time.

415
00:28:04,862 --> 00:28:05,991
I don't really care though.

416
00:28:06,076 --> 00:28:07,767
But I'm a little bit...

417
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:09,721
...embarrassed.

418
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,637
I'm sorry.

419
00:28:13,974 --> 00:28:15,225
I just think you're cute.

420
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:19,538
Hurry up.

421
00:28:19,623 --> 00:28:22,101
The longer you take,
the more you have to pay me.

422
00:28:22,482 --> 00:28:23,318
By the way...

423
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:25,606
...it seems like I'm not the only one...

424
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:27,773
...who knows about your secret.

425
00:28:28,662 --> 00:28:29,828
I haven't told you yet?

426
00:28:29,913 --> 00:28:30,982
No.

427
00:28:38,226 --> 00:28:39,799
Hey. You, over there.

428
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,313
My shoulder.

429
00:28:52,466 --> 00:28:54,531
-You're hurting my shoulder.
-Just stay still.

430
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:57,148
Joohwan...

431
00:28:57,388 --> 00:28:58,435
...let him go.

432
00:29:02,025 --> 00:29:02,891
How did you get here?

433
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:04,112
What else do you think?

434
00:29:04,197 --> 00:29:05,275
I followed you, of course.

435
00:29:05,615 --> 00:29:07,615
I took some pictures while I'm at it.

436
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,547
It looks good, right?
There's natural lighting.

437
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:11,985
Why did you follow me?
Didn't you say you knew where I was going?

438
00:29:12,086 --> 00:29:12,961
That's right.

439
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:16,657
It was so obvious where you were going,
but it was weird that you didn't go there.

440
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:19,826
Could he be...

441
00:29:25,352 --> 00:29:26,737
...your hidden son?

442
00:29:27,147 --> 00:29:28,148
Are you crazy?

443
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:31,491
Then...

444
00:29:46,476 --> 00:29:47,648
...do you want a lollipop?

445
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,747
You're so cute.

446
00:30:01,356 --> 00:30:03,870
Why is he suddenly sponsoring a kid?
This is so unlike him.

447
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:05,195
Is he...

448
00:30:06,231 --> 00:30:07,185
...your son?

449
00:30:08,595 --> 00:30:09,851
I'm a bachelor.

450
00:30:09,936 --> 00:30:12,277
Isn't it prejudice to think
that a bachelor doesn't have children?

451
00:30:12,773 --> 00:30:14,931
-Then, do you have any children?
-No.

452
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:25,832
I keep getting calls
from an unknown number.

453
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:27,428
That number looks familiar.

454
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:28,691
Hand me your phone.

455
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,448
-Turn around.
-Yes, Grandpa.

456
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:38,417
Eh?

457
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:40,592
Why are you answering the model's phone?

458
00:30:40,677 --> 00:30:41,843
You said you two broke up.

459
00:30:41,928 --> 00:30:43,456
She's not a model. She's an actress.

460
00:30:43,672 --> 00:30:44,959
What is this about?

461
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:46,734
Are back together?

462
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:48,525
Then, I have nothing to say.

463
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,651
It's not what you think.

464
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:51,487
We have a business meeting.

465
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:53,643
You fool.

466
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,855
Put that model...

467
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,263
No, I mean...

468
00:30:57,549 --> 00:30:58,948
...put that actress on the phone.

469
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,104
She can't answer the phone right now.

470
00:31:04,753 --> 00:31:06,795
You can tell me.
I'll pass your message to her.

471
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,052
Then...

472
00:31:08,187 --> 00:31:11,675
...ask her if there's anything she needs.
This instant.

473
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:14,080
Tell her I can do anything for her.

474
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:17,521
My grandpa is asking if you need anything.

475
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:18,756
He can do anything for you.

476
00:31:19,972 --> 00:31:20,944
I don't need any.

477
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,193
She said she doesn't need any.

478
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:25,880
She's right there next to you.
How dare you pull a trick on me!

479
00:31:26,066 --> 00:31:27,584
Put her on the phone now!

480
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:29,845
It's no use talking to you.

481
00:31:40,716 --> 00:31:42,383
I saw the woman you saved.

482
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:44,045
I overheard...

483
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:47,122
...that her son passed away...

484
00:31:48,052 --> 00:31:50,052
...and his heart was donated
to someone else.

485
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,058
I just thought of one.

486
00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:57,845
She said she just thought of something.

487
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,411
-Hey!
-This is my seat.

488
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:02,087
My seat.

489
00:32:04,912 --> 00:32:06,728
Look at this.

490
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:13,229
I want to get off from work.

491
00:32:14,843 --> 00:32:16,721
I want to go home.

492
00:32:16,806 --> 00:32:18,832
Go and say something to him.

493
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:21,384
-He's your boss.
-He's your kid.

494
00:32:22,353 --> 00:32:24,050
I told you he's not my son.

495
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:31,495
Why...

496
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:33,687
...are you looking for this boy?

497
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,705
Because I want to tell her...

498
00:32:38,664 --> 00:32:40,664
...that her son's heart...

499
00:32:41,817 --> 00:32:43,998
...is beating inside his body.

500
00:32:45,581 --> 00:32:47,379
That he's still alive.

501
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:50,094
That he's not dead.

502
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:53,338
I want to tell her not to die.

503
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,311
The boy who received the heart...

504
00:33:04,578 --> 00:33:06,414
...passed away during the operation.

505
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,142
It's as if fate played a joke...

506
00:33:11,617 --> 00:33:13,005
...and God was being cruel.

507
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:17,871
Hence, you have no choice
but to live your life...

508
00:33:19,467 --> 00:33:20,619
...blaming yourself

509
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:24,315
Can you take me to her?

510
00:33:25,142 --> 00:33:26,607
We're running out of time.

511
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:28,510
I have to see her now.

512
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:33,254
I'm going to take him somewhere.

513
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,644
So?

514
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,285
Whose child is he?

515
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,637
Well...

516
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:43,996
My sworn sister's?

517
00:33:44,517 --> 00:33:45,410
What?

518
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:47,150
Sworn sister.

519
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:27,640
Hello.

520
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:31,108
Do I know you?

521
00:34:32,222 --> 00:34:34,375
The gentleman over there...

522
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,868
...told me...

523
00:34:36,652 --> 00:34:38,120
...that Minjun gave his heart...

524
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,828
...to me.

525
00:34:58,587 --> 00:34:59,618
Would you...

526
00:35:01,443 --> 00:35:02,662
...like to hear...

527
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,146
...Minjun's heartbeat?

528
00:35:58,149 --> 00:35:59,243
Minjun...

529
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:02,086
...is here.

530
00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:06,224
He's with me.

531
00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:12,062
I promise...

532
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:15,932
...I will live a good life with him.

533
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,339
I'll do my best...

534
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:21,787
...to live a good life.

535
00:36:55,562 --> 00:36:56,498
Have you...

536
00:36:57,871 --> 00:36:59,227
...eaten anything?

537
00:37:08,757 --> 00:37:11,523
My son loved to eat this a lot.

538
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,628
I like it too.

539
00:37:21,344 --> 00:37:22,729
Do you think Minjun...

540
00:37:22,923 --> 00:37:25,118
...will keep on liking it?

541
00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:29,747
When he's 15...

542
00:37:30,024 --> 00:37:31,851
...he may not like it anymore.

543
00:37:33,681 --> 00:37:34,888
By the time he's 20...

544
00:37:36,198 --> 00:37:37,977
...he may not like it anymore.

545
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:40,132
Or when he's 30...

546
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,204
...he may not like it anymore.

547
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,934
But I won't know that.

548
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,209
I'll probably never find out.

549
00:38:05,578 --> 00:38:07,640
I'll think of him every time I see this.

550
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:13,762
And that breaks my heart,

551
00:38:17,893 --> 00:38:19,286
but it also makes me happy.

552
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:28,276
What kind of consolation can I offer
to a grieving mother who lost her child?

553
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:31,098
The only thing I can do...

554
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:41,482
It's delicious.

555
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:45,002
For now, I like it.

556
00:38:51,049 --> 00:38:53,175
...is this.

557
00:39:45,588 --> 00:39:47,065
See you in a while.

558
00:39:47,491 --> 00:39:49,567
It's almost time
for the magic to be lifted.

559
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:51,779
I'm going to keep looking at you.

560
00:40:02,963 --> 00:40:05,117
I'm sorry to have caused you
so much trouble,

561
00:40:06,392 --> 00:40:08,547
by having an unusual girlfriend like me.

562
00:40:08,931 --> 00:40:10,431
Why must you be so kind?

563
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,590
It's tiring to become your boyfriend.

564
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:15,167
There's nothing I can do about it.
It's part of my charm.

565
00:40:15,252 --> 00:40:16,211
You just have to accept it.

566
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:20,945
I took too much of your time
when you have work to do.

567
00:40:21,192 --> 00:40:22,882
I rather quit my job,

568
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:24,845
and follow you around.

569
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:27,107
I know you're not going to do that.

570
00:40:29,021 --> 00:40:30,280
But it's nice to hear.

571
00:41:00,314 --> 00:41:01,293
I have a delivery for you.

572
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:11,451
You're Ms. Kang Sara, right?

573
00:41:13,009 --> 00:41:15,174
Mr. Kang Daeshik sent you flowers.

574
00:41:20,053 --> 00:41:21,533
Please sign here.

575
00:41:29,428 --> 00:41:30,813
Thank you. Enjoy the rest of your day.

576
00:41:56,898 --> 00:41:58,691
Happy birthday, my dear daughter.

577
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:02,874
Marigolds grow well
no matter where they are.

578
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:05,511
You just need to give them
enough sunlight and fresh air.

579
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:09,027
Every time I see marigolds
blooming somewhere...

580
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:10,731
...I'm reminded of you.

581
00:42:11,337 --> 00:42:13,243
Thank you for growing up so well.

582
00:42:14,123 --> 00:42:15,345
P.S.

583
00:42:15,757 --> 00:42:17,649
Marigolds symbolize...

584
00:42:17,804 --> 00:42:20,483
...happiness that is bound to happen.

585
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:23,505
I'm sure you'll find your happiness.

586
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,223
From Dad.

587
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:28,317
It's my birthday today.

588
00:43:05,137 --> 00:43:07,063
Are you really choosing this path?

589
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,282
It will not be easy.

590
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:14,592
I'm aware.

591
00:43:17,148 --> 00:43:18,097
All right.

592
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:20,727
Then, I will pray for you.

593
00:43:33,782 --> 00:43:36,128
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

594
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:38,694
Dear Merciful Lord.

595
00:43:39,623 --> 00:43:42,771
Please listen to my desperate prayer.

596
00:43:43,035 --> 00:43:45,302
Please protect my parents...

597
00:43:45,796 --> 00:43:47,796
...whose hearts have been broken
by this sinner.

598
00:43:48,435 --> 00:43:51,079
Please heal my friend, Segye.

599
00:43:52,427 --> 00:43:55,839
Please send my friend, Woomi, a good man.

600
00:43:57,514 --> 00:43:59,704
And finally, to the pitiful and lonely...

601
00:44:00,439 --> 00:44:02,698
I don't normally tell
these things to others.

602
00:44:03,624 --> 00:44:04,819
But why did I just do that?

603
00:44:05,205 --> 00:44:06,767
Because I listen to you.

604
00:44:07,593 --> 00:44:10,280
It's because all this time,
you didn't have anyone who listens.

605
00:44:11,873 --> 00:44:14,052
Please make sure the pitiful and lonely...

606
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:15,481
...person...

607
00:44:16,058 --> 00:44:18,707
...eats three meals a day.

608
00:44:20,347 --> 00:44:23,277
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit.

609
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,465
Amen.

610
00:45:34,543 --> 00:45:36,478
What's this?
You didn't tell me you're coming.

611
00:45:36,563 --> 00:45:37,963
This is my home.

612
00:45:39,245 --> 00:45:41,660
What about you? You didn't even call
to tell me you're coming.

613
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:50,149
Oh my. What's wrong with you?

614
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:53,102
I missed you.

615
00:45:55,351 --> 00:45:56,334
A lot.

616
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:00,286
A whole lot.

617
00:46:10,252 --> 00:46:12,164
I met your boyfriend.

618
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:13,468
I know.

619
00:46:14,091 --> 00:46:17,553
I said "boyfriend", not "ex-boyfriend".
But you don't seem to care.

620
00:46:18,261 --> 00:46:19,375
Are you still seeing him?

621
00:46:20,753 --> 00:46:22,325
No. I just got used to it.

622
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,223
He seemed like a nice person.

623
00:46:25,028 --> 00:46:26,634
He said he wants to date you again.

624
00:46:28,904 --> 00:46:29,952
Han Segye...

625
00:46:30,227 --> 00:46:31,594
...did you hear me?

626
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:34,725
What did you say?

627
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:36,698
I'm telling you to marry him.

628
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:37,971
Seo Dojae.

629
00:46:38,302 --> 00:46:39,393
What did you say?

630
00:46:39,507 --> 00:46:40,919
You heard me just fine.

631
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:42,883
Are you going to keep
pretending you didn't hear me?

632
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:45,401
If you're going to talk
about marriage, then go home.

633
00:46:51,067 --> 00:46:51,910
Here.

634
00:46:54,431 --> 00:46:56,325
Think about your age.

635
00:46:56,742 --> 00:46:58,138
You should have a baby soon.

636
00:46:58,223 --> 00:47:00,136
-I'm not going to.
-Why not?

637
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:01,926
I don't want one. It's scary.

638
00:47:04,056 --> 00:47:05,612
What if my child gets sick?

639
00:47:07,053 --> 00:47:08,381
Who's going to take responsibility?

640
00:47:09,222 --> 00:47:11,968
Why are you so pessimistic?

641
00:47:14,215 --> 00:47:16,091
You're going to need
a place to go back to.

642
00:47:16,281 --> 00:47:17,913
So you need to have a family.

643
00:47:17,998 --> 00:47:19,047
I don't care.

644
00:47:20,105 --> 00:47:21,055
I already have you.

645
00:47:34,173 --> 00:47:35,008
Mom.

646
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:39,008
How would you feel
if my appearance changes?

647
00:47:39,495 --> 00:47:40,381
Why?

648
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,647
Did someone say you're ugly?

649
00:47:43,217 --> 00:47:44,230
Did they say you're different?

650
00:47:44,315 --> 00:47:45,982
No. It's nothing like that.

651
00:47:47,857 --> 00:47:49,503
Don't mind them.

652
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,488
You just live your life.

653
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,582
It's enough as long as
I understand you...

654
00:47:54,798 --> 00:47:56,487
...and you understand yourself.

655
00:47:58,288 --> 00:48:01,848
You should shower yourself with love
every moment.

656
00:48:02,298 --> 00:48:03,321
Like me.

657
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:07,784
I didn't expect that to come from you.

658
00:48:08,658 --> 00:48:10,351
Why don't you want to get married?

659
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,667
He seemed like a good person to me.

660
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,413
Is he a player?

661
00:48:16,498 --> 00:48:17,416
Is that why?

662
00:48:17,505 --> 00:48:20,023
I dumped him. Because he was
getting in the way of my career.

663
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,206
He likes to follow me around.

664
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:26,970
He's too nice...

665
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,223
...and pitiful.

666
00:48:30,399 --> 00:48:31,720
Plus, I really like him.

667
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:34,524
So it's not good.

668
00:48:34,749 --> 00:48:35,661
Segye...

669
00:48:36,486 --> 00:48:37,936
...you're seeing him, right?

670
00:48:38,076 --> 00:48:39,448
I told you, I'm not.

671
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:40,469
Is his family against it?

672
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:42,097
I'm against it. Me.

673
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:44,080
Your daughter is an actress.

674
00:48:44,165 --> 00:48:46,303
Can't you see me taking care of myself
even at this moment?

675
00:48:47,271 --> 00:48:49,273
There are not enough lead roles as is.

676
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:50,238
How can I get married?

677
00:48:50,323 --> 00:48:52,222
You're my daughter
before you're an actress.

678
00:48:52,769 --> 00:48:54,225
You're so ambitious.

679
00:48:54,384 --> 00:48:56,147
Why do you have to work so hard?

680
00:48:56,464 --> 00:48:58,951
I'm afraid I might
suddenly disappear one day.

681
00:48:59,234 --> 00:49:00,873
What are you talking about?

682
00:49:01,841 --> 00:49:04,040
I'm bound to die one day, aren't I?

683
00:49:04,262 --> 00:49:06,262
I want you to watch movies...

684
00:49:06,386 --> 00:49:09,994
...and think about how pretty
and good of an actor I am.

685
00:49:10,611 --> 00:49:12,172
This is nonsense.

686
00:49:12,735 --> 00:49:14,387
Get married before you die.

687
00:49:14,472 --> 00:49:16,009
I told you, I'm not going to.

688
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:26,148
I'm going. Don't forget to eat
the side dishes in the fridge.

689
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:27,196
Okay.

690
00:49:27,355 --> 00:49:30,611
I've also put herbal tonics in the fridge,
so make sure to drink them regularly.

691
00:49:30,696 --> 00:49:33,217
They'll make me gain weight. I'm not
going to drink them. Stop buying them.

692
00:49:33,302 --> 00:49:35,302
I got ones that won't make
you gain weight, you brat.

693
00:49:35,564 --> 00:49:36,684
Drink them.

694
00:49:36,769 --> 00:49:38,667
I bought them because
I'm worried about your health

695
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:39,872
Fine.

696
00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:42,483
Don't drink too much.

697
00:49:42,663 --> 00:49:44,470
Be good to Woomi and Eunho.

698
00:49:44,628 --> 00:49:47,312
Put your socks into
the laundry basket right away.

699
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,042
Am I a kid?

700
00:49:49,582 --> 00:49:52,020
If you're that worried about me,
you should stay here longer.

701
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:53,140
I can't.

702
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:55,034
I have to water my plants.

703
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,741
Are your plants more important than me?

704
00:49:56,826 --> 00:49:58,291
Of course, you brat.

705
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:02,453
They can't move on their own.
Imagine how thirsty they are.

706
00:50:02,862 --> 00:50:05,169
Fine. Go. Get going.

707
00:50:05,286 --> 00:50:06,601
I'm going somewhere too.

708
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:08,526
Where are you going?

709
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:18,514
She's not here.

710
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:21,871
Is it a good thing?

711
00:50:22,548 --> 00:50:23,535
Of course, it is.

712
00:50:25,782 --> 00:50:27,492
Did we do the right thing?

713
00:50:30,105 --> 00:50:31,357
We lied to her.

714
00:50:33,611 --> 00:50:34,661
Who knows?

715
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:37,225
I'm not sure about that.

716
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:38,613
But...

717
00:50:40,888 --> 00:50:42,448
...I think your lie...

718
00:50:42,993 --> 00:50:44,876
...gave her a will to live.

719
00:50:46,093 --> 00:50:46,997
Most probably.

720
00:50:54,448 --> 00:50:55,928
Geez. Seriously.

721
00:50:56,859 --> 00:50:57,864
I like you so much.

722
00:50:58,356 --> 00:50:59,507
Are you talking about me?

723
00:51:00,113 --> 00:51:00,961
Yes.

724
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:05,687
I have to go now.

725
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:06,765
Already?

726
00:51:07,296 --> 00:51:08,427
I haven't seen you in a while.

727
00:51:08,512 --> 00:51:11,128
What do you mean? We met yesterday.

728
00:51:11,213 --> 00:51:12,623
You said you were seeing me.

729
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:13,933
Well, that's...

730
00:51:14,714 --> 00:51:15,606
I have to hurry.

731
00:51:15,691 --> 00:51:16,734
Where are you going?

732
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:21,310
I have a very important appointment.

733
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:32,615
Thank you.

734
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,486
What are you doing? Have a seat.

735
00:51:43,771 --> 00:51:45,302
Han Segye, what are you doing here?

736
00:51:46,028 --> 00:51:47,923
I invited her over.

737
00:51:48,008 --> 00:51:52,056
Your mom really wanted
to have a meal with her.

738
00:51:52,265 --> 00:51:55,436
So I asked for a special favor from her.

739
00:51:56,022 --> 00:51:58,481
She's not your guest. She's mine.

740
00:51:58,837 --> 00:51:59,974
Come, take a seat.

741
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:02,960
You should've told me beforehand.

742
00:52:03,315 --> 00:52:04,900
Either of you.

743
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:06,578
Surprise...

744
00:52:06,682 --> 00:52:09,071
I'm sorry, I'm late. I had to finish...

745
00:52:09,156 --> 00:52:10,368
Hello.

746
00:52:13,828 --> 00:52:15,289
I see we have a guest.

747
00:52:18,684 --> 00:52:19,741
Hello.

748
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:32,651
Seeing Dojae and Segye
sitting next to each other,

749
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:34,948
I feel like I have my appetite back.

750
00:52:35,033 --> 00:52:37,530
They look like a perfect couple.

751
00:52:37,641 --> 00:52:38,550
Don't you think so, Dad?

752
00:52:38,635 --> 00:52:41,739
If your daughter says so,
then I must agree.

753
00:52:44,134 --> 00:52:46,684
It makes me so happy...

754
00:52:46,817 --> 00:52:49,640
...to see you smile widely like this.

755
00:52:51,509 --> 00:52:54,592
It was Sara's birthday not too long ago.

756
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:55,935
Oh my.

757
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:57,154
It was?

758
00:52:57,456 --> 00:52:58,858
Why didn't you say anything?

759
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:01,115
Secretary Kim!

760
00:53:01,353 --> 00:53:02,892
Secretary Kim, where are you?

761
00:53:02,977 --> 00:53:07,572
He should've reported to me
if it was a family member's birthday.

762
00:53:07,657 --> 00:53:10,668
I'm sorry I didn't congratulate you
when I'm your mother.

763
00:53:10,753 --> 00:53:12,215
It's okay.

764
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,899
It's been a while
since we had a family gathering.

765
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,126
I'm happy enough to be here with you.

766
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:24,025
Happy birthday.

767
00:53:32,164 --> 00:53:33,171
Thank you.

768
00:53:33,774 --> 00:53:35,253
I really didn't expect...

769
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:37,204
...to receive a gift.

770
00:53:37,315 --> 00:53:38,474
It's nothing much.

771
00:53:38,992 --> 00:53:41,826
You already have everything
you can wish for.

772
00:53:56,176 --> 00:53:58,706
(How to laugh and get angry at the fools)

773
00:54:01,606 --> 00:54:04,637
(How to laugh and get angry at the fools)

774
00:54:07,366 --> 00:54:08,478
I like it.

775
00:54:08,782 --> 00:54:10,099
I knew you would.

776
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:13,053
If I had known,
I would have also brought a gift.

777
00:54:14,647 --> 00:54:17,539
You being here is already a gift for me.

778
00:54:20,052 --> 00:54:21,463
I heard you broke up.

779
00:54:21,755 --> 00:54:23,434
Are you back together?

780
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:27,229
No. I'm here on Chairman Im's invitation.

781
00:54:29,158 --> 00:54:30,057
I figured.

782
00:54:31,343 --> 00:54:33,521
You made such a fuss when you broke up.

783
00:54:34,194 --> 00:54:36,155
It's not right to get
back together this soon.

784
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,181
Director Kim said this once,

785
00:54:44,089 --> 00:54:47,295
"This is why I can't
really respect the family."

786
00:54:48,975 --> 00:54:50,648
I was angry when I first heard it,

787
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:53,021
but after I think about it again,

788
00:54:53,283 --> 00:54:55,561
I shouldn't have been.

789
00:54:56,412 --> 00:54:59,786
Acting too thoughtlessly
can also be a problem.

790
00:55:00,868 --> 00:55:03,063
Thank you for worrying about a problem...

791
00:55:03,544 --> 00:55:05,552
-...that didn't happen.
-Don't mention it.

792
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,435
The food is delicious.

793
00:55:15,217 --> 00:55:19,323
There seem to be a lot of men
who do housework these days.

794
00:55:19,876 --> 00:55:23,945
It's probably because house chores
are too hard, right?

795
00:55:44,225 --> 00:55:45,282
Han Segye.

796
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:52,834
I didn't expect you to do it,

797
00:55:53,107 --> 00:55:54,344
but you played dirty.

798
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,544
Kang Sara.

799
00:55:56,948 --> 00:55:57,961
It's fine.

800
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:03,395
I don't know why you didn't
expect me to do that.

801
00:56:04,181 --> 00:56:06,557
But I'm someone
who gives back what I received.

802
00:56:07,024 --> 00:56:08,634
Are you done talking?

803
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:11,974
You've got some nerve.

804
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:13,424
I'm not done.

805
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,649
Eunho...

806
00:56:16,238 --> 00:56:18,097
...is a naive and nice kid.

807
00:56:18,624 --> 00:56:20,760
Don't play around with
a naive person like him.

808
00:56:21,783 --> 00:56:22,621
You already know, right?

809
00:56:22,941 --> 00:56:24,388
That he's going to be a priest.

810
00:56:28,006 --> 00:56:28,878
Let's go.

811
00:56:42,334 --> 00:56:43,909
Don't play around with him?

812
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,114
Why can't I?

813
00:56:55,115 --> 00:56:56,666
(Snail Bride)

814
00:57:01,723 --> 00:57:03,546
-Hello?
-Come right now.

815
00:57:04,453 --> 00:57:05,268
What?

816
00:57:05,353 --> 00:57:07,944
I'm telling you to come
to where I am right now.

817
00:57:08,984 --> 00:57:10,156
Right now?

818
00:57:10,457 --> 00:57:12,420
I'm sorry, I'm working right now.

819
00:57:12,505 --> 00:57:13,931
I can't quite leave right away...

820
00:57:14,317 --> 00:57:15,161
Really?

821
00:57:17,665 --> 00:57:18,666
Fine then.

822
00:57:28,136 --> 00:57:30,136
You should've told me
that you were coming today.

823
00:57:30,501 --> 00:57:32,197
Then, you wouldn't have been surprised.

824
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:35,540
You need to take someone off guard
to surprise them.

825
00:57:36,439 --> 00:57:40,065
But I feel like I might have
given you a hard time instead.

826
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,316
Then, why don't...

827
00:57:41,906 --> 00:57:43,300
...we make our relationship public again.

828
00:57:43,385 --> 00:57:46,171
No way. My mom will go berserk.

829
00:57:47,078 --> 00:57:49,647
She might really want to go shopping
for wedding stuff within this month.

830
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:50,782
We can just go, then.

831
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,202
No, we can't.

832
00:57:52,287 --> 00:57:53,596
What about my movie?

833
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:56,603
Your movie is more important than me?

834
00:57:57,717 --> 00:57:59,193
Then, what about you?

835
00:57:59,439 --> 00:58:01,232
Am I more important than your work?

836
00:58:02,298 --> 00:58:03,315
Well, that one...

837
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,273
See? You're just the same.

838
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:07,654
Most importantly,

839
00:58:08,005 --> 00:58:09,514
people can accept you
dating the first time,

840
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,007
but they won't be so nice the second time.

841
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,407
You will get ridiculed.

842
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:17,130
If I get ridiculed, then so will you.

843
00:58:20,077 --> 00:58:22,186
What are you doing today?
Do you have to work?

844
00:58:22,271 --> 00:58:23,122
No.

845
00:58:24,406 --> 00:58:25,397
I'm going on a date.

846
00:58:40,638 --> 00:58:42,032
Are you done cleaning?

847
00:58:43,682 --> 00:58:44,954
Welcome.

848
00:58:45,913 --> 00:58:47,355
Welcome.

849
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,844
Are you Mr. Ryu Eunho.

850
00:58:50,996 --> 00:58:52,298
Yes. Can I help you?

851
00:58:52,383 --> 00:58:54,265
Ms. Kang asked me to escort you.

852
00:58:54,484 --> 00:58:55,362
Shall we go?

853
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:58,447
As you can see, I'm working.

854
00:58:59,378 --> 00:59:01,156
This cafe has been closed for the day.

855
00:59:03,046 --> 00:59:07,172
-Excuse me?
-Ms. Kang has booked the whole cafe.

856
00:59:07,981 --> 00:59:08,833
Let's go.

857
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:09,907
Oh my god.

858
00:59:19,084 --> 00:59:20,052
Aren't you going to eat?

859
00:59:21,877 --> 00:59:24,411
You must be eating
because you're in a bad mood again.

860
00:59:25,035 --> 00:59:26,724
Is it because of a man again today?

861
00:59:28,062 --> 00:59:29,100
Today...

862
00:59:30,221 --> 00:59:31,368
...it's because of my family.

863
00:59:34,722 --> 00:59:37,133
I thought we're gathering
to celebrate my birthday.

864
00:59:37,683 --> 00:59:38,812
But I was wrong.

865
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:44,340
It's not your birthday though.

866
00:59:46,933 --> 00:59:47,895
I'm talking about your ID.

867
00:59:48,848 --> 00:59:50,985
Your birthday isn't
around this time of year.

868
00:59:53,032 --> 00:59:54,458
You remember all sorts of stuff.

869
00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:56,055
I'm quite smart, you know.

870
00:59:59,692 --> 01:00:01,733
My actual birthday is different
from my registered birthday.

871
01:00:01,843 --> 01:00:04,023
So it tends to pass by unnoticed.

872
01:00:05,982 --> 01:00:07,332
Don't be bothered about it.

873
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:09,512
I don't think it's a big deal anyway.

874
01:00:15,849 --> 01:00:16,826
Excuse me.

875
01:00:21,992 --> 01:00:23,956
Yes, sir. Can I help you?

876
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:26,041
I'd like to pay the bill.

877
01:00:26,129 --> 01:00:27,078
It's fine.

878
01:00:27,163 --> 01:00:29,613
I'll pay. Since I'm called you over.

879
01:00:37,368 --> 01:00:39,423
I earn more money than you think I do.

880
01:00:40,123 --> 01:00:42,247
Even though it's late. Happy birthday.

881
01:00:42,866 --> 01:00:43,929
Enjoy your dinner.

882
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:17,797
This is fascinating.

883
01:01:18,231 --> 01:01:20,443
This is the first time I've been
photographed with someone else.

884
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,749
It doesn't feel that special to me.

885
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:26,218
I thought I'm the only one
who knows about your secret...

886
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,513
...but there are so many other people
who also knows about it...

887
01:01:29,598 --> 01:01:30,864
...I was quite shocked.

888
01:01:30,949 --> 01:01:32,640
You're being too greedy.

889
01:01:32,725 --> 01:01:35,676
If you call this me being greedy,
you're in for a bigger surprise.

890
01:01:36,269 --> 01:01:37,131
Fine.

891
01:01:38,012 --> 01:01:39,145
First of all, Eunho knows.

892
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,010
I knew that.

893
01:01:40,095 --> 01:01:41,178
Woomi also knows.

894
01:01:41,286 --> 01:01:42,959
I sort of figured that out.

895
01:01:43,044 --> 01:01:44,605
-The next one...
-The next one...

896
01:01:44,894 --> 01:01:46,847
-...must be me.
-The next one is Kingkang.

897
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:50,975
Where are you going?

898
01:01:51,413 --> 01:01:52,597
To put up the picture.

899
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:53,868
Do you have...

900
01:01:54,238 --> 01:01:55,509
...any comfortable clothes?

901
01:01:56,356 --> 01:01:58,575
Go to the dressing room and pick one.

902
01:02:25,584 --> 01:02:27,088
This is one of the perks...

903
01:02:28,348 --> 01:02:29,556
...of dating someone like you.

904
01:02:32,103 --> 01:02:32,942
Do you...

905
01:02:33,846 --> 01:02:36,499
...prefer me with my hair
tied up or let down?

906
01:02:36,995 --> 01:02:38,090
I like both.

907
01:02:38,423 --> 01:02:39,630
Equally.

908
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:41,916
You really mean it.

909
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:43,044
Of course, I do.

910
01:02:43,918 --> 01:02:46,073
Because the real you remains the same.

911
01:02:46,572 --> 01:02:47,591
At least, to me.

912
01:02:50,087 --> 01:02:52,444
This is one of the perks
of dating someone like you.

913
01:02:55,637 --> 01:02:56,782
I'll go get more of this.

914
01:02:58,476 --> 01:02:59,352
Geez.

915
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:00,467
Oh no.

916
01:03:01,382 --> 01:03:03,193
Oh no. Are you all right?

917
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,766
Are you okay?

918
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:08,795
I'm not okay.

919
01:03:09,806 --> 01:03:11,360
Did you do that on purpose?

920
01:03:12,485 --> 01:03:14,096
What? Me? On purpose?

921
01:03:14,181 --> 01:03:15,095
Yes, on purpose.

922
01:03:15,349 --> 01:03:16,582
So that you can touch me.

923
01:03:18,241 --> 01:03:19,657
No, you're wrong.

924
01:03:19,742 --> 01:03:20,992
I think I'm right.

925
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:43,514
That day, I made my mind...

926
01:04:43,657 --> 01:04:46,300
...that I'll never be my mom's punishment.

927
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:50,744
That I'll never tell her
about this horrible condition.

928
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:52,936
So if I can, I'll never tell her
...for the rest of my life.

929
01:04:53,183 --> 01:04:54,170
But...

930
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:56,829
I knew it.

931
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:58,367
Mom?

932
01:04:59,261 --> 01:05:00,282
But...

933
01:05:00,443 --> 01:05:02,090
...I never imagined
to get caught by my mom...

934
01:05:02,212 --> 01:05:04,212
...in this situation and not that.

935
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,195
(The Beauty Inside)

936
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:29,145
At first, we were only
pretending to be dating.

937
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:32,883
To put it simply, I love Han Segye.

938
01:05:32,968 --> 01:05:34,326
Blow the candles.

939
01:05:34,411 --> 01:05:36,411
I like... you.

940
01:05:36,496 --> 01:05:38,314
Your voice sounds different.

941
01:05:38,399 --> 01:05:39,861
I've changed into someone else.

942
01:05:39,946 --> 01:05:42,251
It's okay. You didn't know about it.

943
01:05:42,336 --> 01:05:44,564
So why didn't you tell me?!

944
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:47,537
Mom, why do you always put me first?

945
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:49,562
-Segye...
-Yes?

946
01:05:49,692 --> 01:05:51,396
...you can do it.
