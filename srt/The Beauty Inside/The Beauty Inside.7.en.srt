1
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:07,307
It seems like destiny.

2
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:09,679
The two of us?

3
00:00:42,636 --> 00:00:43,621
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:22,804 --> 00:01:24,340
I thought I should do that.

5
00:01:29,062 --> 00:01:29,895
What?

6
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,559
I thought it was appropriate.

7
00:01:34,786 --> 00:01:35,751
Where are you going?

8
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:41,776
Now that we've satisfied your curiosity,
we should go home and sleep.

9
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:44,682
Together?

10
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:47,159
No. In our own places.

11
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,243
We have no reason to sleep together now.

12
00:01:52,743 --> 00:01:53,576
Why?

13
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:55,462
Aren't you sleepy?

14
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:25,187
Me too.

15
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,117
I thought I should do that, too.

16
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:31,210
I see.

17
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:35,955
Don't you have anything to say?

18
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,257
No.

19
00:02:40,144 --> 00:02:42,543
I feel like I'm not myself.

20
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,834
I feel like I'm a different person.

21
00:02:49,742 --> 00:02:51,972
I feel very complicated,
and uncomfortable...

22
00:02:56,508 --> 00:02:57,949
You are Han Segye.

23
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:00,547
You're not someone else.

24
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,658
I think I know...

25
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,860
...what you want to hear.

26
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:15,391
Then just say it.

27
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:17,571
I won't say it.

28
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:20,818
So...

29
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:23,652
...sleep tight.

30
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,264
(Uncle)

31
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:56,670
Why won't he call?

32
00:03:57,223 --> 00:04:00,148
Why hasn't he called?
It's already been an hour.

33
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,170
Shouldn't he let me know
if he reached home?

34
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:08,341
It's been an hour and a minute.

35
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:15,724
Did you get home safely?

36
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,973
Is he asleep?

37
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,591
He's asleep in this situation?

38
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,797
No, it can't be.

39
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:42,376
Is he ignoring my message?

40
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:44,792
Is he serious right now?

41
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,623
(Did you get home safely?)

42
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:57,004
Why won't you eat?

43
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:00,400
Who can digest meat in the morning?

44
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:03,170
I have a wardrobe briefing
with the director later.

45
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,130
If I don't want to be outshined
by young actresses...

46
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:07,073
...I need to control what I eat.

47
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:10,343
Just take a tiny bite.

48
00:05:10,662 --> 00:05:12,515
You won't get fat
if you eat only this much.

49
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:18,554
We're going on a trip this week.

50
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:20,465
What trip?

51
00:05:20,673 --> 00:05:22,289
A read-through session and a trip.

52
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:25,714
To read the script and
get to know each other.

53
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,235
Since it's this week,
I told them immediately that we're going.

54
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,677
It's your safe days.

55
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:33,834
Yeah. A trip is nice.

56
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:34,895
Let's go.

57
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,033
By the way...

58
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:43,977
What does it mean when a guy kisses
you and then pretends he didn't?

59
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:46,079
Maybe he didn't want to kiss.

60
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,811
Why do you ask?

61
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,318
Did you kiss?

62
00:05:55,943 --> 00:05:56,776
No.

63
00:05:57,325 --> 00:05:59,130
I just remembered...

64
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:01,328
You know, the movie I was in...?

65
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,130
I was just thinking
about that kissing scene.

66
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:08,085
I messed up more than 20 times
when I was filming that scene.

67
00:06:08,338 --> 00:06:09,171
But...

68
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:12,372
... I didn't feel any emotions.

69
00:06:12,812 --> 00:06:14,015
I didn't say anything.

70
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:18,740
I don't have any emotions...

71
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:20,187
...either.

72
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:22,364
Are you dating?

73
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,285
No, I'm not dating.

74
00:06:26,097 --> 00:06:29,222
Hey, dating's not a big deal.

75
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:31,771
Look.

76
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:34,943
Peel some shrimps.

77
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:37,599
Cook some meat.

78
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,427
That's all dating.

79
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:41,049
I didn't peel shrimps for him.

80
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:42,736
Maybe you haven't eaten
shrimps with him.

81
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:46,704
What the hell? Does that mean
you and me are dating?

82
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,617
This is more than just dating.
It's a business relationship.

83
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,183
Right.

84
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:01,521
It's a business relationship.

85
00:07:03,743 --> 00:07:04,691
Of course.

86
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,211
I knew it.

87
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:18,822
Aren't you too old to run away from home?

88
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:21,001
You ran away for real
because mom told you to?

89
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:22,897
You obeyed Mom all your life.
Why are you doing this?

90
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:24,494
I'm unleashing all my
pent-up insubordination.

91
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:27,549
Why don't you disobey a little bit
at a time like I do...

92
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:29,516
... instead of unleashing it all at once.

93
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:30,921
Keep saying "hey" and watch what happens.

94
00:07:31,005 --> 00:07:32,252
Sure, I will.

95
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,768
Hey. Where do you sleep?

96
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:36,852
Why you...

97
00:07:39,423 --> 00:07:41,501
It's none of your business.

98
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,064
I sleep on the streets.

99
00:07:44,662 --> 00:07:46,198
Are you really going to be a priest?

100
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:48,843
If you don't get married,
then I'll have to.

101
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,378
I'm a celibate.

102
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:53,882
My life is screwed because of you.

103
00:07:57,675 --> 00:08:00,797
Don't let me or anyone
else ruin your life.

104
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:03,420
That's why I left home.

105
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:04,765
Bro.

106
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:08,381
Are you not going to come home?

107
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,356
How's Mom?

108
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,791
She won't come out of bed.

109
00:08:14,356 --> 00:08:16,991
You're lucky Dad's not home
because of an emergency.

110
00:08:17,086 --> 00:08:18,814
If he saw what happened, he would've...

111
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:20,574
...shot you with a gun.

112
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:28,108
Honey, are you okay?

113
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,379
Why did you come home?

114
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:34,617
I ought to knock some sense
into that punk.

115
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:40,410
-Yeah.
-Captain.

116
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:42,329
We have the CCTV results
from the Dogok-dong case.

117
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:44,755
-Did you see the suspected vehicle?
-We confirmed the plate number.

118
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:46,519
Now, we're trying to locate the suspect.

119
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,294
Okay. I'm on my way.

120
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:49,817
You're leaving again?

121
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,735
I'll be right back.

122
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,616
Change your socks first.

123
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:00,430
Why are there so many
bad guys in the world?

124
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:02,842
The worst one is in our family.

125
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:07,447
How dare he break my wife's heart.

126
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:11,204
Then go catch your son first.

127
00:09:11,288 --> 00:09:15,665
I caught many bad guys before
who actually turned out to be good.

128
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,740
Go back to bed. I'll be back.

129
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:18,944
Let's go!

130
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,303
Of course he takes after his father.

131
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:25,999
The apple never falls far from the tree.

132
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:28,535
Don't get hurt!

133
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:33,721
The sales numbers
of this event is serious.

134
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:35,033
What does it mean?

135
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:36,660
I mean it's seriously high...

136
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:38,660
...that it's incomparable
to the sales of previous years.

137
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:39,932
Congratulations.

138
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:42,443
What does it mean?

139
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:44,204
Did you hear what I said?

140
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:46,439
No, I wasn't listening.

141
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:54,440
What does it mean when someone
kisses you and then apologizes for it?

142
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:55,609
It means she's sorry.

143
00:09:55,694 --> 00:09:57,452
And if she asks if I have anything to say?

144
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,114
In that case, there are two answers
she wants to hear.

145
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:01,575
"I love you."

146
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:03,169
Or "I'm sorry."

147
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:05,995
What if I don't want to say sorry?

148
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:07,985
You should tell her you love her.

149
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,288
And what if...

150
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:12,681
...I don't want to say that either?

151
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,580
You should pay me
if you're going to keep asking.

152
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,130
This is emotional labor.

153
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,106
Where do you get that cheeky attitude?

154
00:10:20,444 --> 00:10:21,283
My face.

155
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:25,854
If you keep lying to me because I can't
recognize faces, you'll be in trouble.

156
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:27,898
You're the one who's
about to be in trouble.

157
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:31,173
You have an appointment with Dr. Oh.
Time to get what's coming to you.

158
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:33,062
-What about you?
-I already have plans.

159
00:10:33,147 --> 00:10:34,599
Is it more important than me?

160
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,098
It's not important, but a little scarier.

161
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:39,506
I guess you're talking about my mother.

162
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:41,075
It's strictly confidential.

163
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:43,943
No matter what my mother says...

164
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:45,784
...don't get the wrong idea.

165
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:48,124
Maybe it's not so confidential.

166
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:53,288
Since the character's a cold person...

167
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:57,105
...we prepared mostly black
for a mannish and modern vibe.

168
00:10:57,513 --> 00:10:59,675
These are the same
as Chae Yoori's outfits.

169
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:09,356
This one's intended to give
a vivid look in the darkness.

170
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,208
We prepared a fancy floral print dress.

171
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,445
Chae Yoori has that one as well.

172
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:19,741
This one, and this one too.

173
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:22,188
She brought...

174
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,651
...all of these?

175
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,839
Go get Chae Yoori.

176
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:28,772
Okay.

177
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,876
That's very strange.

178
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:37,626
We may have the same taste in clothes,
but how can all of them be the same?

179
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:57,684
Since I'll be playing six characters,
I needed a variety of clothes.

180
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:07,125
Are you wearing this one too?

181
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:14,239
Oops. This is awkward.
I have that one too.

182
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:17,676
The new editions of this season
look pretty much the same.

183
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,179
When would a hermit
who lives in fear of death...

184
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:26,399
...wear such vivid, colorful clothes?

185
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:28,100
In which scene?

186
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:35,888
A girl who lives in hiding
doesn't have to be gloomy.

187
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:38,809
She may want to wear
those kind of clothes sometimes.

188
00:12:38,894 --> 00:12:40,960
Looks like you want to wear
all the clothes in Korea.

189
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:43,496
Fine. Just wear them all.

190
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:45,331
I'll be naked during the shoot.

191
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:48,049
That would generate a lot of buzz.

192
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:52,772
Whatever. Clothes don't play
the character, actors do.

193
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:03,783
Segye.

194
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:06,348
Why? Do you have something to say?

195
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,878
Are you upset?

196
00:13:20,448 --> 00:13:21,281
What?

197
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:25,718
I won't wear them.
I don't have to wear them.

198
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,194
You are important.

199
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:29,831
You wear them.

200
00:13:31,534 --> 00:13:33,413
I'll prepare mine again.

201
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:40,116
I'm sorry...

202
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,020
...that I upset you.

203
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:03,351
Chae Yoori did that on purpose.

204
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:07,504
I found out that her styling
team went around...

205
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:10,650
...and checked all of our
sponsored outfits.

206
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:15,340
And then she had the audacity to...
That manipulative witch.

207
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:16,470
Forget it.

208
00:14:17,145 --> 00:14:19,725
It's been a while since someone
paid me so much attention.

209
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:23,382
It's impressive how she tries
so hard to screw me over.

210
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,059
I'm not letting this go.

211
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:27,433
Watch what I'll do to her on the trip.

212
00:14:30,425 --> 00:14:32,772
I definitely lost today.

213
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:35,428
Some days are like this.

214
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:37,510
Losing days.

215
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,785
(Did you get home safely?)

216
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:55,247
Forget it. I'm not doing this.

217
00:14:56,701 --> 00:14:57,646
I won't do it.

218
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,152
Won't do what?

219
00:15:00,237 --> 00:15:02,181
If you're talking about retiring again...

220
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:05,064
I meant my schedule.
I don't want any schedule.

221
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:08,219
Clear my schedule so I can practice
acting for a while.

222
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,128
I've already rearranged your schedule.

223
00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:13,993
I cleared everything
except that thing tomorrow.

224
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,124
Tomorrow?

225
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:16,633
I have a schedule tomorrow?

226
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,123
What is it?

227
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:20,153
-You have a date.
-Again?

228
00:15:20,662 --> 00:15:22,648
Tomorrow?

229
00:15:23,984 --> 00:15:25,113
With Seo Dojae?

230
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,995
I asked you here so we can talk.

231
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:36,173
How far are you willing to go for Dojae?

232
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:37,388
Can you...

233
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:40,019
...give me a little pay raise?

234
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:42,063
Why?

235
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:44,445
It seems like I'll have
another secret to keep.

236
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,782
I should get paid more for my work.

237
00:15:47,137 --> 00:15:48,459
What do you do with the money you make?

238
00:15:48,544 --> 00:15:49,753
Make installments for savings.

239
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:52,454
How diligent of you.

240
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:57,024
Did you know?

241
00:15:57,649 --> 00:15:58,958
Dojae is...

242
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,000
Ga...

243
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:02,728
"Ga"...?

244
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,440
Dojae and a ma....

245
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:08,401
"Ma"...?

246
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:10,336
Never mind.

247
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,665
What about Han Segye?
Is he seeing her again?

248
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:15,626
He never broke up with her.

249
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:17,959
They will go on a date
tomorrow, in public.

250
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:19,612
Good.

251
00:16:19,943 --> 00:16:22,438
Keep an eye on everything he does.

252
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,626
In regards to what exactly?

253
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:27,620
I think...

254
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:30,249
...it would be all right
if they got married.

255
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:31,773
All of a sudden?

256
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:35,995
Dojae will make the headlines
in the national section...

257
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,615
...instead of the entertainment section.

258
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,342
I have to stop that from happening.

259
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:42,643
I'm unbiased, but...

260
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,685
...a high school kid is too much.

261
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:49,675
What are you talking about...?

262
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,975
You're always hang out with him
so you should know.

263
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,965
He's seeing a guy, too.

264
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,840
What?

265
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,239
I heard you'll go abroad again.

266
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:03,765
That's right. Now, tell me
how you're doing these days.

267
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,419
I have butterflies in my stomach.

268
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:11,934
I think I miss her.

269
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:13,099
That's pretty good.

270
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:14,806
Is it?

271
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,943
You always dreaded seeing people.

272
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:20,813
Your condition has improved in a way.

273
00:17:22,557 --> 00:17:23,560
But...

274
00:17:23,934 --> 00:17:25,883
...I don't feel quite like myself.

275
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:28,153
Which part of you?

276
00:17:28,238 --> 00:17:31,317
The basics of business are saying
what the opposite party wants to hear...

277
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:34,566
...to get what I want in the end.

278
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,139
And I'm very good at doing business.

279
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,745
But suddenly, I don't feel like
doing that anymore.

280
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:41,982
Do you know exactly...

281
00:17:42,457 --> 00:17:45,187
...what the opposite party wants to hear?

282
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:47,500
I believe I know it exactly.

283
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:50,155
What is it?

284
00:17:54,623 --> 00:17:55,718
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:58,000
"I'm sorry."

286
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:06,317
If you don't want to say
that word, then don't.

287
00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:11,202
Say what you want to say,
looking at the face you want to see.

288
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:12,933
Do not be afraid.

289
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:18,562
It only means that you've found a new you.

290
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:24,770
These are absolutely necessary
for housework. Please prepare them.

291
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:26,050
All of it?

292
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:27,209
By the way...

293
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:33,731
... what on earth are you wearing?

294
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:36,370
I don't get along with my sister.

295
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:39,249
Me too.

296
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,841
If it's disturbing,
then just look at my face.

297
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:45,582
You know you're handsome, don't you?

298
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,802
Everyone says I'm more
on the pretty side.

299
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:52,543
You say that without batting an eye.

300
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:55,117
You should be humble.

301
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:57,753
I didn't need them right away.

302
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:02,508
It's because I'm busy.
I won't have time for except now.

303
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:06,712
I've been wanting to tell you.

304
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,663
Thank you for letting me stay
at your place.

305
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:12,213
I'll try to make you feel comfortable.

306
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:16,803
The house is empty
most of the time anyway.

307
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:18,739
I prefer if someone manages
the house for me.

308
00:19:18,837 --> 00:19:21,908
That's why I agreed.
Don't take it the wrong way.

309
00:19:24,277 --> 00:19:26,198
I'll pay my debts and leave
as soon as possible.

310
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:28,039
As you wish.

311
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:32,911
I've been meaning to say something too.

312
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,241
I am not interested either.

313
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:40,140
-In me?
-In a younger guy.

314
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,708
Oh my, look who it is. It's Eunho.

315
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:51,725
Hello.

316
00:19:52,277 --> 00:19:55,205
Our seasonal promotion will start soon.
Aren't you coming to work?

317
00:19:55,464 --> 00:20:00,105
Our sales increased
last time thanks to you.

318
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:03,788
If I was the owner of the mart,
I would've given it to you.

319
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:05,929
I've found a very good job.

320
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:07,108
Bye.

321
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:08,647
Bye.

322
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:14,922
Just how many part-time jobs do you have?

323
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:17,033
Do you work using your popularity?

324
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,410
Let's just say my popularity is
like public property.

325
00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:25,203
Now it's private property.
I'm the one who's paying you.

326
00:20:25,688 --> 00:20:29,057
I think you should get paid for smiling.

327
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:30,562
It has commodity value.

328
00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:35,043
That was an assessment, not a compliment.

329
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:37,472
Do you want money?

330
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:39,076
No.

331
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,596
How's this one? Isn't it nice?

332
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:57,592
It's nice.

333
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,220
-How about this one?
-Nice.

334
00:21:04,905 --> 00:21:05,738
This one?

335
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:12,554
You're lost in your own thoughts.

336
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,211
Where's your head right now?

337
00:21:15,518 --> 00:21:17,455
-The control tower.
-The control tower?

338
00:21:18,162 --> 00:21:19,365
Why are you over there?

339
00:21:20,851 --> 00:21:21,684
What?

340
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:25,240
What?

341
00:21:26,473 --> 00:21:27,537
"Uncle?"

342
00:21:27,831 --> 00:21:29,514
Are you in touch with your uncle?

343
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:31,243
What are you saying? Why would I...

344
00:21:31,577 --> 00:21:34,460
Yeah, I totally stay in touch
with my uncle. He's a good man.

345
00:21:35,173 --> 00:21:36,996
Hello, Uncle.

346
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:38,380
Where are you now?

347
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:41,772
How's your family and your business?

348
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:44,247
I'm at home. Why?

349
00:21:44,332 --> 00:21:46,639
Let's meet. I'm at the cafe
in front of your house.

350
00:21:46,926 --> 00:21:50,667
You call me out of the blue asking
to meet without any explanation?

351
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,305
I need to tell you something.

352
00:21:52,827 --> 00:21:53,859
Fine.

353
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:55,773
I'll be on my way.

354
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:05,857
My uncle's asking to meet. He's nearby.

355
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:07,935
-I'm going out.
-Can I go and say hello?

356
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:08,870
No!

357
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:11,997
You scared me. Why did you yell?

358
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,393
Well...

359
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,990
My uncle is very shy of strangers
and an introvert.

360
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,615
He can't even make eye contact.

361
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:25,110
He can't stand people.

362
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:28,486
Fine. Just go.

363
00:22:28,696 --> 00:22:29,529
I'll be right back.

364
00:23:47,754 --> 00:23:49,256
Why are you staring?

365
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:51,304
To avoid making a mistake.

366
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,900
It's my first time to see
your hair like this.

367
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:57,956
I was at home just now.

368
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:02,141
I'm sorry. It must've made you nervous.

369
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:04,649
You don't have to be apologetic.

370
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,680
So, what do you want to tell me?

371
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:13,101
There's one good thing
about our relationship going public.

372
00:24:14,016 --> 00:24:17,404
We can meet openly in public.

373
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:23,372
This is the interview questions list
for tomorrow.

374
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:28,404
This is what you wanted to tell me?

375
00:24:29,162 --> 00:24:30,602
We need to plan what we're going to say.

376
00:24:32,983 --> 00:24:33,816
Right.

377
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:37,509
We are the couple of the century.

378
00:24:38,216 --> 00:24:39,648
What else could I expect?

379
00:24:40,507 --> 00:24:42,526
-What happened that time...
-A mistake.

380
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:45,676
It was in the heat of the moment.

381
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:48,508
So stop avoiding me.

382
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:49,989
There's no need to do that.

383
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:53,050
Did I avoid you?

384
00:24:53,153 --> 00:24:54,506
What are you going to wear tomorrow?

385
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:56,607
We should wear matching clothes
since we'll be working.

386
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:02,856
What else should we match?

387
00:25:04,078 --> 00:25:07,787
I didn't reply to your text
because too much time has...

388
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:12,995
I'll send my answers in writing.

389
00:25:13,218 --> 00:25:14,318
Ms. Han.

390
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,062
Let's not overwork ourselves.

391
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:22,586
It feels like I'm working overtime.

392
00:25:44,404 --> 00:25:45,237
Here.

393
00:25:48,691 --> 00:25:49,805
No, thank you.

394
00:25:50,268 --> 00:25:51,517
I'm on a diet.

395
00:25:57,237 --> 00:25:58,357
That must be hard for you.

396
00:26:03,425 --> 00:26:05,097
Not as hard as this.

397
00:26:06,534 --> 00:26:08,544
What's next? The interview?

398
00:26:09,657 --> 00:26:10,503
Next...

399
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:17,810
...is this.

400
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,679
Open it.

401
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:24,454
This is to thank you
for your gift on our last date.

402
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,454
I guess I should open it
with a happy look on face.

403
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:37,114
What a detailed act.

404
00:26:46,922 --> 00:26:48,165
Would this be enough?

405
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:53,852
It's not an act.

406
00:26:55,774 --> 00:26:57,364
I gave them to you because I wanted to.

407
00:26:58,286 --> 00:26:59,259
Because they're pretty.

408
00:26:59,668 --> 00:27:01,223
I thought they would look great on you.

409
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,958
Since you already have a necklace...

410
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,628
...I can't change that.

411
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:19,369
Many people are curious
about your love story.

412
00:27:19,582 --> 00:27:21,432
Who was the first
to confess their feelings?

413
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:22,646
It was me.

414
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:26,211
May I ask how you said it?

415
00:27:26,366 --> 00:27:28,766
"You're the kindest women I've ever met."

416
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,417
I fell for her because
she's so kind-hearted.

417
00:27:32,794 --> 00:27:34,310
In just one week after we met.

418
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:40,496
Segye, you must be having a flashback.
You're blushing.

419
00:27:41,996 --> 00:27:43,622
It's a little hot out here.

420
00:27:44,745 --> 00:27:48,232
What names did you use to save
each other in your contacts?

421
00:27:48,527 --> 00:27:50,229
-Well...
-"Auntie."

422
00:27:51,553 --> 00:27:52,386
Pardon?

423
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,373
Yes, I used "Uncle."

424
00:27:55,126 --> 00:27:56,936
Does it mean anything?

425
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,162
No.

426
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,153
It just came up.

427
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:02,158
No one would be suspicious about it.

428
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:05,984
I did it because someone told me to.

429
00:28:07,468 --> 00:28:09,321
The way she thinks is cute, isn't it?

430
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:11,528
How did you come up with that?

431
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,173
Excuse me for asking...

432
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,660
...but when did you have your first kiss?

433
00:28:19,846 --> 00:28:21,934
No comment for this question.

434
00:28:22,643 --> 00:28:23,698
We haven't.

435
00:28:26,713 --> 00:28:28,683
We haven't kissed.

436
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:32,926
I informed you that
the interview will be off...

437
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,147
...if you ask a question
that is not on the list.

438
00:28:36,223 --> 00:28:37,883
That's enough interview for today.

439
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,586
I gave you enough for your article.

440
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:56,101
You didn't have to drive me all this way.

441
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,931
I don't think so.

442
00:28:58,016 --> 00:29:00,269
Right. This is work.

443
00:29:00,546 --> 00:29:03,675
You're always meticulous in your work.

444
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:06,343
Thank you. Bye.

445
00:29:06,982 --> 00:29:08,146
What are you doing tomorrow?

446
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:14,964
I'm going for a read-through to somewhere
very far, for a long time.

447
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:15,882
Why?

448
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:17,813
-The day after tomorrow?
-I have work.

449
00:29:17,897 --> 00:29:19,233
-And the next day?
-I have work.

450
00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:21,360
-I have work too.
-Exactly.

451
00:29:21,991 --> 00:29:23,762
We're both busy.

452
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:26,531
Speaking of work...

453
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:28,375
... great job today.

454
00:29:28,664 --> 00:29:31,387
It was a great business
for both of us today.

455
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,325
How many more times do we need to do this?

456
00:29:35,539 --> 00:29:36,372
This?

457
00:29:36,704 --> 00:29:37,551
Work.

458
00:29:39,062 --> 00:29:40,608
Let's get it done as soon as possible.

459
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:42,930
So we can end our contract.

460
00:29:44,114 --> 00:29:45,075
It make me uncomfortable...

461
00:29:46,597 --> 00:29:48,049
...in many ways.

462
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:28,126
We didn't kiss?

463
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:30,110
We didn't?

464
00:30:32,093 --> 00:30:33,024
Fine.

465
00:30:33,736 --> 00:30:35,201
Let's just say we didn't.

466
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,536
We never did.

467
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:39,871
Such a coward.

468
00:30:42,361 --> 00:30:43,773
Oh my gosh.

469
00:30:52,578 --> 00:30:55,424
Are you angry because
I had the interview my own way?

470
00:30:55,707 --> 00:30:56,921
I did it for your sake...

471
00:30:57,006 --> 00:30:58,370
Is that what you came here to say?

472
00:30:58,455 --> 00:30:59,496
Ms. Han...

473
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:03,515
For my sake?

474
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:09,746
Nothing good will be left in this world
if you act for my sake again.

475
00:31:09,831 --> 00:31:12,451
-What are you...?
-Things like expectation, trust and hope.

476
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,143
You don't know how I feel
right now, do you?

477
00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:20,867
Right. You can't even remember me anyway.

478
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:23,582
How could you possibly know how I feel?

479
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:26,187
How would you know what's in my mind?

480
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:28,389
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?

481
00:31:28,568 --> 00:31:30,096
If that's what you want...

482
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:32,796
...I don't want to say it.

483
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:33,985
Then don't.

484
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,762
It's too late for that.

485
00:32:18,112 --> 00:32:19,177
So annoying.

486
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,355
(Confidentiality Agreement)

487
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:39,690
Why do you look so weary?

488
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,258
You didn't sleep last night?

489
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,965
The crickets were crying too much.

490
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,171
Where? From your heart?

491
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,817
Sometimes...

492
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,644
...I wonder how much you know.

493
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:57,065
I know a lot...

494
00:33:57,347 --> 00:33:59,582
...but I just pretend not to know.

495
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,275
Did you have breakfast?

496
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,743
I have gimbap in the car.

497
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:06,344
Later. I'll get an upset stomach
if I eat in the car.

498
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:09,028
Come on. We're late.

499
00:34:10,745 --> 00:34:13,319
Hey, buddy. It looks like
you stirred things up again.

500
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:18,278
Top star H took away
C's wardrobe out of jealousy.

501
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:20,452
H, the biggest celebrity troublemaker...

502
00:34:20,537 --> 00:34:24,863
...recently participated in the audition
for a supporting role in L's project.

503
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:27,161
It seems like old habits die hard.

504
00:34:27,435 --> 00:34:30,895
This time, she stole the wardrobe
of C, the lead actress.

505
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:33,520
C had no choice...

506
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:36,808
...but to forfeit her wardrobe
to H, who is her senior.

507
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:41,752
Despite C's generosity,
H did not even thank her once.

508
00:34:41,837 --> 00:34:45,183
The concerned parties
collectively said that H did this...

509
00:34:45,268 --> 00:34:48,631
...out of jealousy because
she lost the lead role to C.

510
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:50,237
"H" for Han Segye, C

511
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,686
"C" for Chae Yoori.

512
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:52,603
That crazy...

513
00:34:53,073 --> 00:34:55,641
God damn it, that witch set this up!

514
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:57,802
That witch with a capital B!

515
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:02,547
I'll beat the shit out of this witch!
I'm so pissed, god darn it!

516
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:04,532
Witch I'll end you!

517
00:35:15,216 --> 00:35:17,901
-Good shot!
-Good shot!

518
00:35:17,987 --> 00:35:19,486
How far did the ball go?

519
00:35:20,288 --> 00:35:25,600
Men need time for some male bonding.
Isn't that right?

520
00:35:25,685 --> 00:35:27,870
I need some time for myself right now.

521
00:35:27,955 --> 00:35:30,550
Then how would you like
to be unemployed?

522
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:37,192
-Good shot!
-Good shot.

523
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:39,516
Good shot, Director Kim.

524
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:42,432
That was Mr. Seo, not Director Kim.

525
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:43,427
Really?

526
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:45,039
Good shot, Mr. Seo.

527
00:35:45,363 --> 00:35:46,691
Why you little brat!

528
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,557
It's fine, Mr. Chairman.

529
00:35:49,642 --> 00:35:52,717
Chief Seo has a naughty sense of humor.

530
00:35:53,106 --> 00:35:55,743
He's so mischievous all the time.

531
00:35:56,626 --> 00:35:58,895
The three of you are
very similar in style.

532
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,834
It's hard to tell
no matter how much I look.

533
00:36:02,684 --> 00:36:06,580
It must be so troublesome
looking after this rascal.

534
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,597
No, sir. I didn't do anything.

535
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:13,106
Chief Seo excels in both work and dating.

536
00:36:13,643 --> 00:36:15,455
He's dating?

537
00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:20,031
Are you dating that model?

538
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:22,229
You're so far behind.

539
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:24,044
You should check out the Internet.

540
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:25,264
What did you...

541
00:36:25,378 --> 00:36:27,392
You little punk...!

542
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:28,456
Good shot.

543
00:36:29,983 --> 00:36:30,816
Good shot.

544
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,888
I've increased the sales.
You shouldn't treat me like a golf ball.

545
00:36:35,197 --> 00:36:36,242
So...

546
00:36:37,101 --> 00:36:39,924
...when my daughter said
she wanted to have Segye...

547
00:36:40,018 --> 00:36:43,132
... she didn't mean Segye as in
"the world," but that model?

548
00:36:43,225 --> 00:36:45,757
-Actress.
-Yes. The model.

549
00:36:45,872 --> 00:36:47,913
Bring her over sometimes
so we can eat together.

550
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:49,143
For what?

551
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,777
My daughter wants to have her.

552
00:36:53,394 --> 00:36:56,225
You need to know that there are
some things you cannot buy...

553
00:36:56,444 --> 00:36:58,327
...in this world, Mr. Chairman.

554
00:36:58,538 --> 00:37:02,006
Don't get smart with me.
I'm holding a golf club.

555
00:37:02,682 --> 00:37:04,595
I'm holding one too.

556
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,091
And it's my turn.

557
00:37:22,486 --> 00:37:24,008
Chief Seo, I got you a juice.

558
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:30,243
Did you mix something in here?

559
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:31,892
No way.

560
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:34,946
Joohwan, drink this.

561
00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:38,396
I don't get hazard pay. You drink it.

562
00:37:40,306 --> 00:37:42,060
My dear Chief Seo...

563
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:46,041
You should stay sharp if you don't
want to lose the war of succession.

564
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,632
It's about CEO Kang of One Air.

565
00:37:48,992 --> 00:37:52,951
She even went to Mr. Kim's luncheon.

566
00:37:53,347 --> 00:37:55,556
-What did you say just now?
-You know...

567
00:37:56,128 --> 00:37:58,126
The only women invite to that luncheon...

568
00:37:58,266 --> 00:38:00,572
...are all either actresses or singers.

569
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:04,144
Isn't that amazing?

570
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:07,780
No matter what they said,
she only said "yes, yes"...

571
00:38:07,865 --> 00:38:10,989
...with a big smile on her face.

572
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:15,346
It takes a lot of ambition to do that.

573
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:17,495
She may be a woman, but we should...

574
00:38:17,768 --> 00:38:18,697
...learn that from her.

575
00:38:18,955 --> 00:38:22,592
Bravo, CEO Kang. Impressive.

576
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:24,923
"Miss."

577
00:38:25,652 --> 00:38:26,280
What?

578
00:38:26,466 --> 00:38:28,299
That's "Miss Kang" to you.

579
00:38:28,986 --> 00:38:31,084
"CEO Miss Kang."

580
00:38:33,248 --> 00:38:35,737
You should have some respect
to the member of the owner's family.

581
00:38:37,034 --> 00:38:37,867
Director Kim?

582
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:44,328
And my sister doesn't exist
to hear your compliment.

583
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,350
You need to know your place.

584
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:55,300
I put that down because
I'm relatively nice.

585
00:38:55,759 --> 00:38:59,095
If CEO Kang was here,
it won't be the juice.

586
00:39:00,895 --> 00:39:02,214
It would be the glass that hits you.

587
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:09,705
Jeez!

588
00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:16,101
"Murder? I can't.
I pass out when I see blood."

589
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:20,218
"Then you get out of here now, Princess."

590
00:39:20,403 --> 00:39:22,827
"Or go and die first."

591
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:24,313
"You're getting in my way."

592
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:29,279
"Number Two's cell phone rings.
Number Two's very startled."

593
00:39:29,363 --> 00:39:30,908
"It's her. It must be her."

594
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,182
"She said she's coming here to kill me."

595
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:34,938
"She's coming for me."

596
00:39:35,023 --> 00:39:37,737
"Number Three picks up the phone
without hesitation."

597
00:39:37,986 --> 00:39:38,969
"Hello?"

598
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:40,825
"Hello?"

599
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,653
"Say something if you called."

600
00:39:43,738 --> 00:39:45,548
"You're not the owner of the phone."

601
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,697
"Are you all gathered together
to make it easier for me?"

602
00:39:47,781 --> 00:39:48,713
I'm sorry.

603
00:39:49,152 --> 00:39:51,067
I need to go to the ladies' room.

604
00:40:03,623 --> 00:40:07,005
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

605
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,823
Shall we continue?

606
00:40:13,581 --> 00:40:15,206
"You're not the owner of the phone."

607
00:40:15,591 --> 00:40:18,018
"Are you all gathered together
to make it easier for me?"

608
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:20,930
-"I'm now..."
-Sir?

609
00:40:21,704 --> 00:40:24,122
Let's just call it a day and have a drink.

610
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,727
Yoori.

611
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:32,997
I'm really tired. I had so many lines.

612
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,610
Everyone's exhausted.

613
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:38,670
Can you give us a break?

614
00:40:49,834 --> 00:40:50,795
Hey.

615
00:40:51,372 --> 00:40:52,655
Bring them in.

616
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,354
(Like a Girlfriend)

617
00:41:05,731 --> 00:41:08,292
No big deal.

618
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:11,002
Just in case there's not enough
booze for everyone.

619
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:18,526
Oh, my.

620
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,091
Not only we have the same taste in
clothes, but we also think alike.

621
00:41:24,155 --> 00:41:25,245
Ms. Yoo.

622
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,163
What's that?

623
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,162
(A Fine Day)

624
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,673
(Like a Girlfriend) (A Fine Day)

625
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:51,537
Don't worry about Kingkang.
Worry about yourself.

626
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:54,469
Hey, where are you?

627
00:41:54,969 --> 00:41:57,686
I work at the owner's place
and sleep in the storage.

628
00:41:57,841 --> 00:41:59,881
-I'm a slave.
-Hey...

629
00:42:00,176 --> 00:42:01,886
Do you want me to buy you a house?

630
00:42:02,032 --> 00:42:04,915
-Are you drunk?
-Hey, I can afford a house.

631
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,357
I'm rich.

632
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:08,495
Then transfer 100 million won
to my account now.

633
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,413
Hey.

634
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,101
Well... anyway...

635
00:42:14,051 --> 00:42:16,447
Please look after Kingkang.

636
00:42:19,514 --> 00:42:20,644
She's only half-drunk.

637
00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:33,155
One hot vanilla latte, take-away.

638
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:35,686
Do you have the coupon?

639
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:36,931
No.

640
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,554
What's this?

641
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:47,230
Because you're a good person.

642
00:42:48,142 --> 00:42:49,591
By any chance, do you like dogs?

643
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:51,746
Anyone who likes dogs is a good person.

644
00:42:55,374 --> 00:43:00,694
The atmosphere is nice
with a beautiful lady around.

645
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:02,155
That's right.

646
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,315
You're still young at heart.

647
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,973
Mr. Kim adores me so much...

648
00:43:08,109 --> 00:43:10,282
...that I get to be here even though
I'm just a young actress.

649
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:11,889
Thank you very much.

650
00:43:14,738 --> 00:43:16,740
Oh, no.

651
00:43:17,392 --> 00:43:19,940
A woman shouldn't pour drinks.

652
00:43:27,627 --> 00:43:28,806
Look who it is.

653
00:43:29,447 --> 00:43:32,008
Chief Seo of T'road Airline.

654
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:35,448
What brings you here after
rejecting all our invitations?

655
00:43:35,594 --> 00:43:36,807
I just happened to pass by.

656
00:43:37,675 --> 00:43:39,837
I feel like drinking for many reasons.

657
00:43:39,922 --> 00:43:44,412
Of course. We must drink
in a historic moment like this.

658
00:43:44,587 --> 00:43:45,434
Here.

659
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:47,187
I should pour you a drink.

660
00:43:54,148 --> 00:43:54,981
Stop.

661
00:44:07,626 --> 00:44:09,127
What do you think you're doing?

662
00:44:09,232 --> 00:44:12,614
I poured enough for the next person
who will sit here.

663
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:15,082
Stop inviting us
to this ridiculous gathering.

664
00:44:16,065 --> 00:44:18,723
We are not the kind of people
who you can invite any time.

665
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,259
Me or CEO Kang.

666
00:44:25,845 --> 00:44:27,133
This one's on me.

667
00:44:30,436 --> 00:44:31,269
Hey.

668
00:44:31,354 --> 00:44:33,356
-Why that...
-Hey, Chief Seo!

669
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:59,570
Why are you looking after Han Segye's dog?

670
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:00,958
She offered money.

671
00:45:01,453 --> 00:45:03,009
You'll do anything for money?

672
00:45:03,266 --> 00:45:05,323
Not just anything, but most.

673
00:45:14,899 --> 00:45:16,751
Did you invite someone other than the dog?

674
00:45:16,836 --> 00:45:18,716
Of course not. It's not even my house.

675
00:45:19,178 --> 00:45:20,779
Isn't it your guest?

676
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:22,762
That can't be.

677
00:45:23,016 --> 00:45:24,469
I have no friends.

678
00:45:31,417 --> 00:45:32,930
It's your brother.

679
00:45:33,681 --> 00:45:35,733
-Who?
-It's your brother.

680
00:45:37,584 --> 00:45:38,823
When did I get a brother...

681
00:45:42,002 --> 00:45:43,237
Mr. Seo Dojae.

682
00:45:51,525 --> 00:45:52,466
Hurry up and hide.

683
00:45:53,008 --> 00:45:54,155
Take that with you.

684
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,073
Okay.

685
00:46:02,164 --> 00:46:03,066
Eunho.

686
00:46:04,196 --> 00:46:07,978
No matter what happens,
do not come out of the room.

687
00:46:08,063 --> 00:46:10,668
There's nothing more dangerous
than you coming out.

688
00:46:39,003 --> 00:46:43,024
Were we close enough for you
to show up at my house unannounced?

689
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:44,535
I have a confession to make.

690
00:46:44,973 --> 00:46:45,916
Do you have some time?

691
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,990
You can speak there.

692
00:46:47,377 --> 00:46:48,768
Why don't we go in and talk?

693
00:46:49,112 --> 00:46:50,327
You might start shouting.

694
00:46:50,412 --> 00:46:52,082
Speak where you stand.

695
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:56,449
It's about the luncheon you went.

696
00:46:57,275 --> 00:46:59,028
I roughed them up for you.

697
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:03,049
-What?
-See? I knew you'd shout.

698
00:47:08,381 --> 00:47:09,720
Who do you think you are!

699
00:47:09,906 --> 00:47:11,962
That's intimidating and authoritative.

700
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,365
Why didn't you give them this attitude?

701
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:19,403
(Mr. Kim)

702
00:47:25,306 --> 00:47:26,444
This is just wonderful.

703
00:47:28,112 --> 00:47:30,748
(Mr. Kim)

704
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,990
Ms. Kang, what did you say to your brother
to make him do that?

705
00:47:35,172 --> 00:47:37,022
I didn't think you were like that.

706
00:47:37,106 --> 00:47:39,867
You're like a little girl
tattling to your brother!

707
00:47:39,952 --> 00:47:44,997
Mr. Kim, you have a very happy,
comfortable life, don't you?

708
00:47:45,748 --> 00:47:46,657
That's all because...

709
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:48,396
...you're ignorant.

710
00:47:48,522 --> 00:47:50,018
-Because you don't learn.
-What?

711
00:47:50,103 --> 00:47:52,703
Don't make it so obvious
that you failed to learn anything.

712
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,613
Have you no shame?

713
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:58,109
Oh well. You wouldn't feel shame
since you don't know anything

714
00:47:58,194 --> 00:47:59,215
Hey!

715
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,454
Pipe down.

716
00:48:01,018 --> 00:48:02,463
Is that a dog barking?

717
00:48:02,906 --> 00:48:04,782
Why is a dog talking to a human?

718
00:48:06,723 --> 00:48:07,644
See?

719
00:48:07,794 --> 00:48:10,287
I had to listen to that
because you interfered.

720
00:48:10,743 --> 00:48:13,167
Do you think I can't talk back?
I just didn't want to.

721
00:48:13,252 --> 00:48:15,459
I know what you're good at.

722
00:48:16,223 --> 00:48:18,467
So do what you do best.

723
00:48:19,276 --> 00:48:20,731
Because I hate seeing you...

724
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:22,466
...lose to someone.

725
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:23,829
Yeah, right.

726
00:48:24,392 --> 00:48:25,633
Who do you think you are?

727
00:48:25,718 --> 00:48:26,551
Me?

728
00:48:27,052 --> 00:48:28,006
Your older brother.

729
00:48:32,245 --> 00:48:33,941
Since when were you my brother?

730
00:48:34,053 --> 00:48:34,886
Well...

731
00:48:35,973 --> 00:48:39,150
...I think it's been about 10 years
since I became your brother.

732
00:48:52,852 --> 00:48:53,860
You have a dog?

733
00:48:55,282 --> 00:48:56,263
What are you talking about?

734
00:48:56,763 --> 00:48:57,789
I don't like dogs.

735
00:49:00,322 --> 00:49:01,844
Just now, that was me coughing.

736
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:06,266
Is there someone inside?

737
00:49:07,537 --> 00:49:08,672
No.

738
00:49:13,135 --> 00:49:14,329
Why are you getting in my way?

739
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:16,545
Do you think I get in your way
all the time?

740
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,957
Don't kid yourself.

741
00:49:19,255 --> 00:49:23,465
Do you hear yourself right now?

742
00:49:23,724 --> 00:49:24,557
No.

743
00:49:24,759 --> 00:49:26,074
I'm tired. Just go.

744
00:49:26,544 --> 00:49:29,380
If you want to say thank you,
call me when you don't have a guest.

745
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,068
No one's inside.
And I'm not thankful at all.

746
00:49:32,152 --> 00:49:35,419
Introduce me sometime.
It seems like he's a dog owner.

747
00:49:36,177 --> 00:49:37,419
No one's here!

748
00:50:01,107 --> 00:50:02,199
I am sorry.

749
00:50:11,934 --> 00:50:13,093
Are you rearing me or something?

750
00:50:16,672 --> 00:50:18,616
The maid became my weakness...

751
00:50:21,054 --> 00:50:22,858
I ruined everyone's mood.

752
00:50:23,966 --> 00:50:25,085
I'm sorry.

753
00:50:27,093 --> 00:50:28,411
Have you eaten?

754
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:31,996
I haven't seen you eat at all.

755
00:50:32,924 --> 00:50:34,865
I'm a little nervous
after the read-through.

756
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,501
I can't eat.

757
00:50:39,382 --> 00:50:40,983
You're still the same as before.

758
00:50:41,681 --> 00:50:42,734
People said you've changed.

759
00:50:43,346 --> 00:50:44,816
I guess they were all lies.

760
00:50:46,049 --> 00:50:49,539
You were never the kind
of person who gives excuses.

761
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:53,050
You'd rather withstand all the criticisms.

762
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:00,870
I know you're all bitter and sad.

763
00:51:02,446 --> 00:51:03,539
It's okay.

764
00:51:04,224 --> 00:51:06,081
I'm used to all that now.

765
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:07,848
I'm fine.

766
00:51:09,252 --> 00:51:11,635
Things like that are difficult
to get used to.

767
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,032
And you can't be fine with it.

768
00:51:15,711 --> 00:51:17,570
I don't have a choice.

769
00:51:20,498 --> 00:51:22,613
You said you wanted to kill her
out of compassion.

770
00:51:25,147 --> 00:51:26,317
During the reading last time.

771
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:31,707
You want to kill her when you pity her?

772
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,930
Her heartfelt sympathy
could've blinded her.

773
00:51:35,834 --> 00:51:38,228
Can't you be compassionate to yourself?

774
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:40,209
Why?

775
00:51:41,146 --> 00:51:43,012
Because you might kill yourself?

776
00:51:45,066 --> 00:51:47,146
You can kill someone out of compassion.

777
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:48,575
But you can also...

778
00:51:49,551 --> 00:51:51,060
...hug that person out of compassion.

779
00:51:51,432 --> 00:51:52,552
Life...

780
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,179
...is different from movies.

781
00:51:56,434 --> 00:51:57,523
So...

782
00:51:59,351 --> 00:52:00,851
...just give yourself a hug.

783
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:05,568
Or you can find someone who can hug you.

784
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:12,214
Take a walk before you come in.

785
00:52:13,993 --> 00:52:15,034
The stars are pretty.

786
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:25,689
It seems like they're all up there
to comfort me.

787
00:52:36,107 --> 00:52:38,484
Someone who can hug me...?

788
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,460
Someone...

789
00:52:46,846 --> 00:52:48,346
...who really knows me.

790
00:53:00,342 --> 00:53:03,580
The booze tastes sweet
when I drink with you.

791
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,724
Have a drink with me.

792
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:08,778
Let me take a break.

793
00:53:09,013 --> 00:53:11,124
I drank too much.

794
00:53:11,652 --> 00:53:13,511
Just this one time.

795
00:53:13,596 --> 00:53:15,328
Okay. I will let you off this time.

796
00:53:16,171 --> 00:53:17,216
Instead...

797
00:53:17,953 --> 00:53:19,649
...look pretty and drink.

798
00:53:20,453 --> 00:53:23,241
-Pardon?
-There's a scene where you drink.

799
00:53:23,326 --> 00:53:25,393
Think of it as practice.

800
00:53:26,883 --> 00:53:28,849
I can't do that all of a sudden.

801
00:53:28,934 --> 00:53:29,767
Why?

802
00:53:30,506 --> 00:53:31,339
Don't want to?

803
00:53:31,598 --> 00:53:35,275
Jeez. You're such a party pooper.

804
00:53:36,366 --> 00:53:37,692
You're ruining the moment.

805
00:53:37,777 --> 00:53:38,794
That's not right.

806
00:53:38,878 --> 00:53:40,150
Why wouldn't I want to?

807
00:53:40,413 --> 00:53:41,594
I'll do it.

808
00:53:42,558 --> 00:53:44,054
I won't use a glass.

809
00:53:46,217 --> 00:53:47,430
I'll drink from the bottle.

810
00:53:48,114 --> 00:53:49,278
That's the spirit.

811
00:53:49,959 --> 00:53:52,581
Try biting your lip lightly.

812
00:53:55,192 --> 00:53:56,751
Go ahead. Looking good.

813
00:53:56,836 --> 00:53:59,154
Okay, just like that. Drink.

814
00:53:59,238 --> 00:54:00,739
That's sexy.

815
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:12,823
If you want to continue,
I'll be your drinking buddy.

816
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:31,568
Darn it, that soju was strong.

817
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:42,780
(Mom)

818
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:46,842
Yeah, what's up?

819
00:54:46,927 --> 00:54:49,172
I saw your interview.

820
00:54:49,976 --> 00:54:51,688
You two looked great together.

821
00:54:52,452 --> 00:54:53,957
Did they Photoshop
your boyfriend's picture?

822
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:55,843
Or does he really look like that?

823
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,023
Mom...

824
00:55:00,721 --> 00:55:02,431
You sound tipsy again.

825
00:55:02,857 --> 00:55:05,303
Hey, did you drink?

826
00:55:05,633 --> 00:55:06,650
Mom...

827
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,997
What was it like dating Dad?

828
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:14,478
Why would you talking about
your dad all of a sudden?

829
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,914
Tell me some stories from
when you were dating him.

830
00:55:17,116 --> 00:55:18,180
Your dad?

831
00:55:20,642 --> 00:55:22,809
There was nothing much.

832
00:55:22,894 --> 00:55:26,352
He suddenly showed up
and he was suddenly sweet...

833
00:55:27,931 --> 00:55:31,352
Suddenly I was in love and
suddenly he disappeared.

834
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:33,564
Dad is so bad.

835
00:55:34,453 --> 00:55:36,392
Why did he suddenly show up...

836
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:39,970
...and was suddenly sweet?

837
00:55:42,141 --> 00:55:43,023
Right?

838
00:55:43,138 --> 00:55:44,797
What's really bad is...

839
00:55:45,816 --> 00:55:49,479
...that he suddenly made me fall in love
and then suddenly disappeared.

840
00:55:49,658 --> 00:55:50,662
You're right.

841
00:55:52,238 --> 00:55:53,071
Why?

842
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:56,053
-Did you fight with your boyfriend?
-No.

843
00:55:56,466 --> 00:55:59,483
I was wondering if all
relationships are like this.

844
00:56:00,896 --> 00:56:02,139
I was curious.

845
00:56:02,223 --> 00:56:04,228
What's your relationship like?

846
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:06,571
Just...

847
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:11,134
...very happy.

848
00:56:13,906 --> 00:56:14,886
It feels...

849
00:56:17,758 --> 00:56:19,308
...very real.

850
00:56:19,469 --> 00:56:20,335
Right.

851
00:56:20,772 --> 00:56:23,714
This one feels real, but the ones
before that seems fake, right?

852
00:56:25,873 --> 00:56:27,684
Maybe you've finally met your match.

853
00:56:30,366 --> 00:56:32,403
I need to hang up now.

854
00:56:32,662 --> 00:56:33,500
Okay.

855
00:56:34,018 --> 00:56:35,739
Don't forget to relieve
your hangover tomorrow morning.

856
00:56:35,823 --> 00:56:37,403
Tell your boyfriend that I said hi.

857
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:38,787
Okay.

858
00:56:51,689 --> 00:56:53,849
Now that I think about it,
this pisses me off.

859
00:56:53,933 --> 00:56:55,623
Why should I be like this?

860
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:17,834
(Auntie)

861
00:57:19,065 --> 00:57:20,986
Why didn't you call me? Why?

862
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:22,027
Because...

863
00:57:22,446 --> 00:57:23,777
...you said you'll be working.

864
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:25,620
Still, you should've called me.

865
00:57:25,704 --> 00:57:28,192
If I can't take the call because of work,
you should call again and again.

866
00:57:28,276 --> 00:57:31,419
How could you have me call first?

867
00:57:31,503 --> 00:57:32,537
Ms. Han?

868
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,407
Did you drink again?

869
00:57:35,492 --> 00:57:37,072
So annoying.

870
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,696
Why did you suddenly show up...

871
00:57:40,432 --> 00:57:42,692
...and suddenly be all sweet?

872
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,788
Where are you now?

873
00:57:46,086 --> 00:57:46,919
Why?

874
00:57:47,656 --> 00:57:48,503
You want to come?

875
00:57:49,712 --> 00:57:50,682
I wish...

876
00:57:51,562 --> 00:57:57,142
I wish you would appear
right before my eyes now, but...!

877
00:58:01,781 --> 00:58:02,891
I'll stop.

878
00:58:05,912 --> 00:58:07,283
I want to stop.

879
00:58:09,661 --> 00:58:10,830
I feel...

880
00:58:11,723 --> 00:58:13,557
...so stupid and I hate it.

881
00:58:19,158 --> 00:58:20,134
Ms. Han?

882
00:58:23,048 --> 00:58:24,060
Ms. Han?

883
00:58:25,986 --> 00:58:27,215
Who do you think you are?

884
00:58:32,187 --> 00:58:33,460
Let's talk later.

885
00:58:33,734 --> 00:58:35,255
Who are you to meddle?

886
00:58:35,372 --> 00:58:37,614
Who said I needed your help?

887
00:58:40,699 --> 00:58:42,368
Did you just hit me?

888
00:58:43,023 --> 00:58:43,856
Yeah.

889
00:58:44,418 --> 00:58:45,677
I hit you and so what?

890
00:58:46,537 --> 00:58:47,388
You didn't like that?

891
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,514
Have you lost it
because nobody's around?

892
00:58:55,238 --> 00:58:57,401
Were you having a good time back there?

893
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,645
It sure didn't look like it.

894
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:02,066
Yeah.

895
00:59:02,896 --> 00:59:04,319
I was having a good time.

896
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:08,367
If you put up with behaviors like that...

897
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:12,616
...and let it all slide, the other girls
will go through worse.

898
00:59:13,226 --> 00:59:15,912
If the lead actress
tolerates everything...

899
00:59:16,005 --> 00:59:17,656
...they will walk all over
the other girls.

900
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:20,023
What does it have to do with me?

901
00:59:20,163 --> 00:59:21,799
Mind your own business.

902
00:59:21,884 --> 00:59:23,574
You're nothing but a supporting actress.

903
00:59:25,716 --> 00:59:30,156
Fine. Let's just I didn't like
what happened earlier and stop this.

904
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:31,972
What did you dislike about?

905
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,343
Who are you to dislike anything?

906
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:36,435
Canceling your schedules.

907
00:59:36,879 --> 00:59:40,946
Running away from the set.
Dating just about anybody.

908
00:59:41,394 --> 00:59:42,945
I don't do those things.

909
00:59:43,515 --> 00:59:44,986
Those are all you.

910
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:48,505
Enough. We can talk later...

911
00:59:48,596 --> 00:59:49,429
Why?

912
00:59:49,932 --> 00:59:52,783
You think you're untouchable now that
you have a rich guy in your pocket?

913
00:59:54,017 --> 00:59:55,910
You're so naive.

914
00:59:57,271 --> 00:59:59,159
Who would like a girl like you?

915
01:00:00,696 --> 01:00:02,014
Don't you get it?

916
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:05,836
He's just playing games with you.

917
01:00:10,542 --> 01:00:11,375
What now?

918
01:00:11,732 --> 01:00:12,912
Are you acting?

919
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:16,094
Han Segye.

920
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,081
Han Segye.

921
01:00:30,074 --> 01:00:30,985
Han Segye.

922
01:00:33,643 --> 01:00:34,479
Han Segye.

923
01:00:37,455 --> 01:00:38,423
Hello?

924
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:40,258
I need help!

925
01:00:56,878 --> 01:00:57,805
Segye.

926
01:00:58,753 --> 01:00:59,725
Are you okay?

927
01:01:00,203 --> 01:01:01,838
How...?

928
01:01:02,122 --> 01:01:03,900
You're crazy.

929
01:01:03,985 --> 01:01:06,483
You collapsed because
you weren't eating well.

930
01:01:06,752 --> 01:01:09,323
You poured alcohol down
in an empty stomach.

931
01:01:10,843 --> 01:01:12,136
I'm sorry.

932
01:01:13,677 --> 01:01:14,871
You must've been scared.

933
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,060
Why is that guy...

934
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,719
He called me because
you weren't picking up.

935
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,259
You had me worried...

936
01:01:37,758 --> 01:01:38,833
Segye.

937
01:01:39,504 --> 01:01:40,460
Segye.

938
01:01:43,277 --> 01:01:44,334
I'll go.

939
01:01:56,058 --> 01:01:57,084
Ms. Han Segye.

940
01:01:57,457 --> 01:01:58,622
That's not me.

941
01:01:59,213 --> 01:02:00,182
Yes it is.

942
01:02:03,163 --> 01:02:05,296
You can't recognize me when you should...

943
01:02:06,297 --> 01:02:08,197
...and you recognize me
when you shouldn't.

944
01:02:09,994 --> 01:02:11,411
You always have it your way.

945
01:02:12,519 --> 01:02:14,571
I told you not to run away.

946
01:02:15,608 --> 01:02:16,600
I was clear on that.

947
01:02:21,912 --> 01:02:23,106
Let's cancel our contract.

948
01:02:25,949 --> 01:02:29,139
Let's cancel our confidentiality or
or dating agreement or whatever.

949
01:02:30,887 --> 01:02:32,004
All right.

950
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:40,340
Yeah.

951
01:02:40,849 --> 01:02:41,724
Publish an article.

952
01:02:42,547 --> 01:02:43,631
We broke up.

953
01:02:49,808 --> 01:02:50,937
All good?

954
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,217
If you're going to do this,
why did you kiss me?

955
01:02:54,302 --> 01:02:56,071
That's what I should be asking.

956
01:02:56,932 --> 01:02:59,392
Are you stupid? Don't you know any better?

957
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:02,279
I don't know.
I'm not used to this kind of thing.

958
01:03:05,646 --> 01:03:07,257
I can't get used to it
no matter how hard I try.

959
01:03:08,272 --> 01:03:11,221
Making guesses on things I cannot see.

960
01:03:13,065 --> 01:03:14,432
And for that...

961
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:16,463
...I hate myself.

962
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:23,021
I have never loved myself since that day.

963
01:03:23,811 --> 01:03:25,026
Not once.

964
01:03:29,525 --> 01:03:31,557
When asked if you have
anything to say after a kiss...

965
01:03:32,469 --> 01:03:34,099
...I heard there are two answers.

966
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:36,939
"I love you"...

967
01:03:38,196 --> 01:03:39,300
...or "I'm sorry."

968
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,819
I don't want to say I'm sorry.

969
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:47,465
That leaves only one answer.

970
01:03:49,803 --> 01:03:51,461
So I couldn't say it.

971
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,837
How am I supposed to say it?

972
01:04:00,406 --> 01:04:02,506
When I'm a total mess?

973
01:04:08,561 --> 01:04:09,394
Say it.

974
01:04:12,884 --> 01:04:13,916
Just say it.

975
01:04:15,255 --> 01:04:16,641
I'm a mess, too.

976
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:26,339
If I give a name to this feeling...

977
01:04:28,025 --> 01:04:29,833
...things will get out of hand.

978
01:04:31,544 --> 01:04:33,283
We won't forget it for a long time.

979
01:04:35,819 --> 01:04:37,246
I can't forget it anyway.

980
01:04:39,054 --> 01:04:40,966
I will never forget
for the rest of my life.

981
01:04:43,055 --> 01:04:44,889
You're the man who recognized me.

982
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,130
Will you be all right...

983
01:04:56,371 --> 01:04:57,204
...with me?

984
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:01,613
Do you mean it?

985
01:05:02,709 --> 01:05:03,818
I mean it.

986
01:05:04,985 --> 01:05:06,343
I don't believe you.

987
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:10,817
Prove it.
