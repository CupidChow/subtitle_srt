00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,920
<i>Players 017, 072,</i>

2
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,920
<i>183, 302 and 398.</i>

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,480
<i>Congratulations, you are the final five.</i>

4
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,360
I'll be the Canadian and say I'm sorry,

5
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,640
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
but I'm going to my team.

6
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,200
In this game, I wanted to blend in,
not stick my neck out.

7
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,240
What? No!

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
Sorry about you.

9
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,800
- We're out. We're out.
- We need one more!

10
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,360
- One more!
- One more right now!

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,200
No one is looking at me
like I'm a big threat

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,280
because they think that I'm alone.

13
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,480
Trinity! Trinity!

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,880
- No, don't, don't, don't, Trinity.
- Trinity, come on, please!

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,440
I've lost so many friends
in the game already…

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,080
and seeing them leave
is just heart-wrenching to me.

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,040
But do I deserve to win?
I don't think I deserve anything in life.

18
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,520
I think what's given to me is a blessing,
and it's a gateway to help other people.

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,880
So many people led me to this moment.

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,000
My brother.

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,120
I think you should stay.

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,520
I've lost Zoe.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,880
I'mma take Yellow down to 22.
I hope one of 'em disappears.

24
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,360
I think it's left,
but I don't wanna go first. I'm scared.

25
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,840
I can go first.

26
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,080
I have to live with all those decisions,

27
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,840
but those sacrifices are my fuel.

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,160
- I live for competition.
- I'm cooking right now.

29
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,280
I don't know why you're crying.
It's just a game.

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,440
I'm a poker player. This is what I do.

31
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,800
When you put seven figures up top,
I'm interested.

32
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,280
I think everyone else thinks I'm a threat,

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,640
but they don't know the extent of it.

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,560
Two years ago,

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,840
I got second in, uh, the championship,
the main event, for 6.5 million.

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Oh, my God.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,840
Yeah.

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,720
There's been so many ups and downs.

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,200
I've made alliances.

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,920
And I've made enemies.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,640
Did you do Faith?

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,680
I knew it.

43
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,200
- Don't take it personal.
- I'm not. Just asking a question.

44
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,200
I'm a cop.
With my background, I'm in my element.

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,440
Who's at the top of your list
that you don't trust?

46
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,920
183.

47
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,280
Only one person can win.

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,480
I'm giving it everything I got.

49
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,320
- Oh!
- Wow.

50
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,640
Yeah, it looks nice.

51
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,360
Oh, my God.

52
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,960
- I want a seat! I wanna… Ah!
- I wanna be the lone wolf.

53
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,880
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! I want that one.

54
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,640
- I want that one! No!
- No, no, no, no, no!

55
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,880
Got it! I got it first.

56
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,120
- Wow. Oh, my gosh.
- This is beautiful.

57
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,400
It looks fire. Let's go, baby.

58
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,320
I feel fancy.

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,680
Seafood, you guys. Scallops.

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,600
Wow, the seats are comfortable.

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,880
Mama, I made it!

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,480
Mama, I made it.

63
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,600
456 started,
and now there's only five of us,

64
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,680
which is bizarre to even think about.

65
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,840
Clearly, I got some luck on my side.

66
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,160
Luck and the grace of God, to be honest,

67
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,800
because I did not think
I would get to the tux part.

68
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,520
I wanna propose a toast.

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,160
Guys, I'm proud of us all.

70
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,640
Final five. I mean,
we've been through so much.

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,120
We've done so much to get here,

72
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,120
and I really wouldn't have it
any other way.

73
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,960
Cheers to you guys. Congrats.

74
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,800
- Cheers.
- Final five.

75
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,720
<i>Salud.</i>

76
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,040
Final five, it was easy.
No, I'm just kidding.

77
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,640
Light work, baby. Light work.

78
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,240
Light work, baby!

79
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,480
Everyone is just on cloud nine right now,

80
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,840
but there's nothing… to celebrate
just quite yet.

81
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,720
If you don't win the money,
it's technically the same thing

82
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,920
as getting out in 456th place.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,680
Fifth is the same as that
because you're still getting squadoosh.

84
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,480
Main dish, main dish, main dish!

85
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,720
Oh, wow. Hmm.

86
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,760
Sorry, let me move. I made a mess.
Sorry. Okay, I'll stop. Thank you.

87
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,440
- Thank you so much.
- Cheers.

88
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,240
- Let's go! Steak time, baby.
- Hope it's good, I hope it's good.

89
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,560
- Oh, man.
- Oh, my gosh.

90
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,800
That looks like the most gorgeous steak
I've ever seen in my life.

91
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,480
- Gosh.
- Oh, yes!

92
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,840
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

93
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,000
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

94
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,440
Mmm!

95
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,960
So, 183, I really haven't heard
much about, like, your life.

96
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,440
I have a boring life.

97
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,440
Tell us about your boring life.

98
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,680
Not much to tell. Normal guy.

99
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,040
- Working the poker game.
- Mm-hmm.

100
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,320
How does one get even--
even get into that?

101
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,760
My mom taught me when I was, like, 12.

102
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,080
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

103
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,040
I definitely am withholding
how much success I've had in poker.

104
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,600
It could potentially
make people salty, uh,

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,560
and think I'm undeserving of the money,
um, because I already have some money.

106
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,960
Did you ever do anything else,
or was it always…

107
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,280
I mean, I-- I worked
on assembly lines in Detroit.

108
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,800
- That shit is not recommended.
- Ah, that had to be horrible.

109
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,120
Yeah, no, it was terrible, bro.

110
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,440
- What is that? In, like, factories?
- Yeah, like <i>8 Mile.</i>

111
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,200
Like Eminem, you know how he was working
on the factory? I was doing that stuff.

112
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,520
Yeah.

113
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I do not trust player 183.

114
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,040
If I had the chance, I'd eliminate him.

115
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,400
I know for a fact, if he had
the chance, he'd eliminate me.

116
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,400
So I've worked, like, every kind of job

117
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,640
and then realized,
like, I don't wanna do manual labor.

118
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,360
Manual labor is where it's at. I'm sorry.

119
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Until it's not!
Until you win $4 million and you quit.

120
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,560
No, that's it.

121
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,040
So, I went to college, and…

122
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,040
and, uh, then I got
my real estate license.

123
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
And so, I've always
been, like, hardworking

124
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,600
and, uh, kind of knew what I wanted.

125
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,800
But yeah, I mean, I had a little bit
of both growing up, pretty much.

126
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,560
My parents divorced when I was five,

127
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,600
and I didn't particularly get along
with my, uh… one of my stepparents.

128
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,560
Um, and that was-- that was just hard.

129
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,320
Uh, at one point, we-- we were--
we were poor, we were wealthy,

130
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,280
we were poor again, we were wealthy.

131
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
So, I've kind of been
through ebbs and flows in life,

132
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,400
and I've seen, "Hey, this is what
I do want, this is what I don't want."

133
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,400
"I want this energy."

134
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,480
And I've really had a good feel
for-- for all aspects of life.

135
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,480
So, I think that kind of helped me
shape me into who I am,

136
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,720
and kinda helped me figure out my goals
and dreams at a young age.

137
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,680
And I was always determined
to have a comfortable life.

138
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,320
I would've never ran
into any of you guys in my life.

139
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,240
It's just wild.
I grew up on the end of a dirt road.

140
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,240
Like, people-- people where I'm from
don't get opportunities like this.

141
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,960
So… I think a lot of you guys are similar.

142
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,080
Like, I-- I've been working
since I was like 12 years old,

143
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,880
I've had a job. I remember lying,

144
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,080
saying I was 16 on the paperwork
just so I could, like, go and make money.

145
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,960
And I worked on farms,

146
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,000
and jobs where, like, grown men
were struggling at it, so…

147
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,600
I don't know, I guess for me,
it's just, like…

148
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,240
I think just seeing someone like me come
and be on such a grand stage like this,

149
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,520
like, I think I'm gonna make, uh,
my little island pretty proud.

150
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,160
- So…
- Hell, yeah.

151
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,320
Yeah.

152
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,160
I come from the middle of nowhere too.

153
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,800
We grew up-- grew up poor as well.

154
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,920
Going to school, looking a little rough,
you know, sometimes.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,240
But, I mean, you push through it.

156
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,480
I just wanna give my son, you know,

157
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,000
a much better childhood
and life than I have.

158
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,640
Had a lot of major changes
since last year,

159
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,480
all within like a month's span.

160
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,560
I got out of a relationship,
and I lost my mom to cancer.

161
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,240
So, I kinda-- I wasn't--
I wasn't doing the best.

162
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,560
You know, went through therapy,
and I feel like I'm stronger than ever.

163
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,080
So, I think that's the big reason

164
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,640
why I stayed strong and pushed
through this competition, honestly.

165
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,000
Perla, what about you?

166
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,640
Um, I was born in '99.

167
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,880
Around 2001, my mom moved
to the United States on her own

168
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,080
just to provide my brother and I
a better life, and my dad stayed with us.

169
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,400
And when my mom was able to save up money,

170
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,880
um, she moved
my brother and I to the-- to the States.

171
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,840
Every choice that the women
in my ancestry made

172
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,720
has led me to be
the freest woman in my lineage.

173
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,800
This money is not just like,
"Oh, my God, yay," like, "I'm so rich."

174
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,680
It's like, no,
this is like a switch in the DNA

175
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,240
that can free not just me
but the people that come after me.

176
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,800
- No, girl. Hell, yeah.
- Yeah. No, for real.

177
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,040
Yeah.

178
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,320
It's gonna be hard winning.

179
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,720
I know-- I know that sounds dumb,
but it's gonna be really hard winning

180
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,560
because you're gonna develop
these friendships

181
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,200
and develop these connections,

182
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,440
and you're gonna want them to win.
You know what I mean?

183
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,200
So, if I get far in this game,
I'm gonna-- it's gonna suck,

184
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,200
because, you know,
I have to take out, uh, 455 people,

185
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,680
so I can be the one to win.

186
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,240
Do I want to win? Yes.

187
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,440
Do I deserve to win? I don't know.

188
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,800
I don't think I deserve anything in life.
I think what's given to me is a blessing.

189
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,800
Trinity, is there one person in particular

190
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,200
that you'd wanna help out with
if you won the money?

191
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,880
- Probably my mom.
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,360
She has MS, and she's getting older,
so it's getting worse.

193
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,800
So, just move her down to Kansas City.

194
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,720
She's in North Carolina alone right now.

195
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,440
She doesn't really have a lot of friends.

196
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,200
Not to put you out
like that, Mom. Whatever.

197
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,200
So, it's just like…

198
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,120
As soon as I can,

199
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,760
even if I don't win the money,
I'm gonna figure out a way to do it.

200
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,920
Mm-hmm.

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,240
But I'm trusting Jesus,
and every time we play a game,

202
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,200
I'll be like, "Win or lose, Jesus,
I still trust you." This is the thing.

203
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,640
Faith is a big part of who I am.
I can't really talk about my life

204
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,000
and not talk about Jesus
at the same time. So…

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,120
<i>Attention, players.</i>

206
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,400
<i>Tomorrow, one of you</i>
<i>will win $4.56 million.</i>

207
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,400
<i>But not all of you</i>
<i>will make it to the final game.</i>

208
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,760
Ooh.

209
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,480
- There's coins.
- What is it?

210
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,840
- Coins?
- Oh, no.

211
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,920
<i>In front of you are five coins.</i>

212
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,600
<i>One is black. This represents elimination.</i>

213
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,680
<i>The first player must conceal</i>

214
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,000
<i>the black coin and a gold coin</i>
<i>in their hands</i>

215
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,520
<i>and offer them to the next player,</i>

216
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,720
<i>who must pick a hand</i>
<i>and, therefore, a coin.</i>

217
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,040
<i>Whoever is left with the black coin</i>
<i>picks another gold coin</i>

218
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,920
<i>and makes the same offer</i>
<i>to the next player.</i>

219
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,120
<i>This continues</i>
<i>until everyone has guessed once.</i>

220
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,640
<i>The player left with the black coin</i>

221
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,440
<i>at the end of the game will be eliminated.</i>

222
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,200
It's a game of chance.
It's a game of bluffing.

223
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,080
At the end of the day, it's 50-50 odds.

224
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,560
All I have to do to make it to the final
is not pick that black coin.

225
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,800
<i>You have already chosen the order</i>

226
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,640
<i>in which you will play this game.</i>

227
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
- Where we're sitting?
- Where we're sitting.

228
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
<i>Please examine the embroidery</i>

229
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,040
<i>in the corner of your napkin.</i>

230
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,960
<i>There you'll find your number.</i>

231
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
I'm fourth.

232
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,000
- Where's it at?
- It says it right here.

233
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,320
Where? Oh, I'm number one.

234
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,080
I'm feeling super fortunate
because I'm sitting in the best position.

235
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,360
I have the best odds to pass this game.

236
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,920
I get four tries at it.

237
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,200
So, I mean, in my mind,
I'm gonna make it through, no problem.

238
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,240
So, one, two, three, four, five.

239
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,520
You have the worst position
'cause you get one shot at it.

240
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,080
Yeah. Thanks.

241
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,800
183 is extremely lucky for having
the biggest advantage in the game.

242
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,200
I low-key was gonna sit right there too.

243
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,400
I want that man gone.

244
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,520
Jesus, win or lose, I'll still trust you.

245
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,480
Thank you, God, for this opportunity.

246
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,080
<i>Player 183, you are in position one.</i>

247
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,680
<i>You will play first.</i>

248
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,120
<i>Please go and select your coins.</i>

249
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,880
<i>Player 398, you are in position two.</i>

250
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,560
<i>You will be first to guess.</i>

251
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,800
It's kinda like bluffing in poker.

252
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,960
And I'm good at being able to get people
to do what I want them to do.

253
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,080
So, I think I'm gonna excel in this.

254
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,360
Good luck, you guys.

255
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,880
Just tell me which one's black.

256
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,120
They're both black.

257
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,120
I want to take the black one.

258
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,600
- You wanna take the black one?
- Yes.

259
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,080
Well, then you should do that.

260
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,960
You'll be safe if I choose the black one,
so which one's black?

261
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,440
I can't remember. That was so long ago.
We had so much wine tonight.

262
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,840
Why do you want the black one?

263
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,240
He's reverse-psychologying me
and himself all in the same time.

264
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,400
Come on, Trinity. Pick the black one.

265
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,640
- You want the black one, for real?
- I honestly want to take the black one.

266
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,040
That's crazy.

267
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,000
- It's over here.
- The black one's on that side?

268
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
Mm-hmm.

269
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,800
- Like, honestly?
- Swear to God.

270
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
That's wild.

271
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,560
- Interesting.
- <i>Player 183, pass.</i>

272
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,160
That doesn't even feel right.
Like, I can't believe he did that.

273
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,440
Trinity, you should've sat
on the other side of me, then.

274
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,720
Make it that easy.

275
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,920
You're not about to self-eliminate
and tell everybody, are you?

276
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,200
Trinity.

277
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,920
Trinity.

278
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,960
Don't do that, bro.

279
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,960
Bro, don't do that.

280
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,840
You deserve to be here, man. Go for it.

281
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,160
You deserve to be here. Okay?

282
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,880
If you wanna play, we should play.

283
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,440
<i>Player 398, as you picked the black coin,</i>

284
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,440
<i>you must now present that and a gold coin</i>

285
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,480
<i>to the next player, 302.</i>

286
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,760
Play the game, man.

287
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,280
I-- I don't wanna see
you go out like this.

288
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,600
Jesus, I know you got me.

289
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,160
I know you got me, Jesus.

290
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,400
I'm doing this
because I love each one of your stories.

291
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Trinity.

292
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,840
I legit do.

293
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,440
And I'd rather one of you guys win it

294
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,360
instead of me.

295
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,240
I'm not trying to do this
for show or anything.

296
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,280
I talk about it all the time. I just--
I hate having to keep eliminating people.

297
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,200
And the closer I got
with each one of y'all,

298
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,400
it just breaks my heart,
so I cannot do it.

299
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,400
- You have one of the best stories here.
- It's fine.

300
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,520
- You do!
- That's why I know I'm gonna be fine.

301
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,680
I love playing the game.

302
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,600
But I've lost
so many good friends in here.

303
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,640
And I'd rather-- Like I said,
I'd rather you guys have it.

304
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,600
You're a single mom.
So I respect that a lot.

305
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,200
Because I grew up with a single mom.

306
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,480
I'm-- I want you to have a chance
to win the 4.5 million for your son.

307
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,880
So I'm gonna tell you
which one it is in, okay?

308
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,200
So the-- the gold one is
in the right hand.

309
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,360
I swear on my life, I'm not lying.

310
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,200
I believe you.

311
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
I hate that you did this.

312
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,600
- Right one.
- I know, I know.

313
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,480
You sure this is what you wanna do?
I'll pick black and take my chances.

314
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,920
No, I-- I want to do this.
It's what I wanted to do.

315
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
I promise.

316
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,040
You're a good man.
You really are a good man.

317

<i>Player 302, pass.</i>

318
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,840

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,160
Yes, it is.

320
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,240
No, it's not.

321
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,040
Right one.

322
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,000
It's okay.

323
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,960
I appreciate you.

324
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,600
God put you in our path for this.

325

And I am forever, eternally grateful
for you doing this for us.

326
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,320
Yeah. It's just money.

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,880
<i>this is the final round.</i>

334
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,040
Yes.

335
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,680
<i>The player left</i>
<i>at the end with the black coin</i>

336
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,000
<i>will be eliminated.</i>

337
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,920
Yes.

338
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Thank you, Jesus, for this opportunity.

339
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,480
It means a lot.

340
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,480
Win or lose, Jesus,
I still trust you every single time.

341
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,480
A thousand times over. Light work.

342
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,280
Light work.

343
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,720
Okay.

344
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,760
It's the right hand.

345
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,280
Every single time.

346
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,720
It's okay. Everything is fine.

347
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,760
I get-- My bills are paid. I have food.

348
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,120
My mom, yeah, she's far away,
but she's okay.

349
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,480
My sisters are doing okay.

350
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,120
If I always second-guessed myself,
I would not be here today.

351
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,240
You get what I mean?

352
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,200
So, Vanessa,
I'm not second-guessing myself.

353
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,240
It's-- It's in the right hand.
Don't pick wrong, please.

354
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,040
<i>Player 017, pass.</i>

355
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,960
- You're one of the best people I ever met.
- It's just money. It literally comes back.

356
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,120
I don't know anyone else
who would've done that.

357
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,280
- Me neither.
- Yeah.

358
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,400
- Like, I truly don't.
- Literally.

359
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,000
One of a kind.

360
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,320
Jesus, I know you got me.
I'm sure I will be fine.

361
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,840
Trust you 100%.

362
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,480
<i>Player 398, eliminated.</i>

363
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,080
- To Trinity.
- To Trinity.

364
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,320
To Trinity.

365
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,480
398 basically
just gave us all pocket aces.

366
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,520
It's sad, but…

367
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,160
…he just gave us a-- a walk,
you know, free pass to the finale.

368
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,320
183 gets a pass to the final.
It's-- It's out of my control.

369
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,600
I-- I would've eliminated him
had I got the choice,

370
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,640
but I'm just gonna focus on my game.

371
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,760
Holy trumpets.

372
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,920
Attention, players 017…

373
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,160
072,

374
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,800
183,

375
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,520
and 302.

376
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,440
Congratulations,
you have made it to the final game.

377
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,000
The current prize fund stands

378
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,240
at $4,520,000.

379
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,640
To all you guys, congratulations
on making it to final four.

380
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
- And to Trinity.
- Same. Congrats, everybody.

381
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,080
Congrats.

382
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,600
I'm looking around the room,

383
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,720
and one of us is
gonna be a multimillionaire,

384
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,120
and just to think
that I could be the one is insane.

385
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,080
- <i>Hands in, right in the middle.</i>
- <i>Final four!</i>

386
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,280
One, two, three.

387
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,440
Final four!

388
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,600
One of us is gonna be
a millionaire tomorrow, y'all.

389
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Yeah, I know, it's crazy.

390
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,800
Literally, like, that's so crazy.
Like, literally one of us.

391
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,560
Wow, like…

392
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,520
In a dorm that used to house 456 people,

393
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,840
we're now down to four.

394
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,960
Big day tomorrow, you guys. Big day.

395
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,000
The fact that it's
only going to be one of us, it's…

396
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,040
it's gonna be nothing short
of-- of devastating and heartbreaking

397
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,880
for, uh, the three who-- who do not
go home with that money.

398
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,560
What?

399
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,440
The money dropping.

400
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,600
Oh!

401
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,040
- No way.
- Piggy?

402
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,080
Okay, I'm getting it. I'm getting it.
First to touch the pig wins.

403
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,040
Hey, that's my money. You get away.

404
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah, back up.

405
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,880
I kissed it. I kissed it. It's mine.

406
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,800
Wow.

407
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,720
Wow. This is incredible.

408
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,400
- How many people have been eliminated?
- I know.

409
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,720
- Jeffrey. Jeffrey!
- Yeah, your brother's in there.

410
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,160
My brother, Jeffrey, he knew it.
He knew that I could make it to the end,

411
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,120
and I can't wait to show him
that the decision that he made

412
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,560
and we made together
was the right decision.

413
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Oh, my gosh.
Well, let me go to sleep, guys.

414
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,080
- Yeah.
- Love you, Piggy.

415
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,200
Wow.

416
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,000
Good night, Piggy.

417
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,720
I'll see you tomorrow.

418
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,240
I grew up with a brother who…

419
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,200
basically needed all the air in the room.

420
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,680
Uh, my brother needed a lot
of-- a lot of guidance.

421
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,360
He needed a lot of help,

422
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,240
and I think that left me
maybe feeling a bit left out.

423
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,720
I think it maybe made me feel
less loved as a child

424
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,080
because I didn't understand
why he was getting all the attention,

425
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,680
uh, and I was
just kind of, uh, pushed to the side.

426
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,160
It just felt as though
no matter what I did,

427
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,360
I could never get
that, um, attention from my parents

428
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,720
that I so craved for.

429
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,160
Waking up in the dorm today, like…

430
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,560
It doesn't feel real.
It just kinda feels like… I don't know.

431
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,280
Like, it just feels like this is a dream.

432
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,440
Truly. Like, it truly feels
like this is a dream.

433
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,680
And whether it's a game
of chance, skill, luck, who knows,

434
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,600
I'm gonna do
whatever it takes to win this.

435
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,000
I didn't come here
to walk away empty-handed,

436
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,240
and I don't intend on doing that.

437
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,960
<i>What do you think of 302 and 072?</i>

438
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,960
At this point, I mean,
I've had scuffles with them and whatnot.

439
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,280
At first, I would've been mad
if, you know, they won.

440
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,800
- Now I'm like, you know what? It's fine.
- I totally get it.

441
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,520
They're here, and everyone… You know?

442
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,680
Maybe we're different personalities,
but I'm not mad at anybody.

443
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,800
Yeah.

444
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,840
I'm pretty sure
player 302 has it out for me

445
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,080
because I eliminated her friend 361,

446
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,240
but I don't care. I'm probably
the fiercest game player at this point.

447
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,840
I've been
in high-pressure situations before,

448
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,680
so I'm pretty confident I'm gonna win.

449
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,800
I think-- I honestly think it's one of us.
Like, we didn't fight this hard for--

450
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,720
- I think it's one of us.
- Truly.

451
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,760
- And I hope it's one of us.
- Yeah.

452
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,160
You deserve this money!

453
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,240
So do you. So that's why
I'm like, "If not me, you." I'm happy.

454
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,440
Like, I'm proud of how far we came.
I'm just happy we made it.

455
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,400
It's just nice. It's really nice.

456
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,320
I love my job. It-- It's a dangerous job,

457
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,240
so, um, sometimes I always think
about getting out of it.

458
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,840
I have a nine-year-old son
I love coming home to,

459
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,120
and just with this job,

460
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,720
I just feel like maybe I should
do something different.

461
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,520
But, I mean, it's my passion.

462
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,520
Sometimes it feels like I have
to prove myself a little extra.

463
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,080
I work in a field dominated by people
that really don't look like me.

464
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,920
Being a black female,
uh, part of the LGBT member,

465
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,480
like, it's just…

466
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,880
it just seems like sometimes
I face a lot of different obstacles

467
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,800
that, you know,
the average person wouldn't face.

468
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,400
You know, sometimes
people just look at you and just…

469
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,160
They don't assume
that you're worth nothing.

470
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,360
So I'm just glad that, um, I can prove
to people that the way I look

471
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,680
has nothing to do
with the skills and knowledge I possess.

472
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,320
- Oh! Amen.
- Oh, wow. We gonna do it.

473
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,440
This ain't lunch.

474
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,800
Attention, players.

475
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,200
The final game will begin shortly.

476
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,600
- Oh, man.
- Let's go.

477
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,560
Please follow the staff.

478
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,560
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, man.

479
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,240
No way.

480
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,480
You silly girl.

481
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,600
Just when you think
you ain't gonna see her.

482
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,120
Sick.

483
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
<i>Attention, players.</i>

484
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,240
<i>Welcome to your final game.</i>

485
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,280
<i>Here you will compete for $4.56 million.</i>

486
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,480
<i>The game is Red Light, Green Light.</i>

487
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,960
<i>Green light, red light</i>

488
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,160
- Oh, okay. It's official.
- Oh, man.

489
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,320
<i>This time,</i>
<i>you won't just be facing the doll.</i>

490
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,040
<i>You'll be racing against each other.</i>

491
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,680
<i>You may only move</i>
<i>when the doll is singing.</i>

492
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,120
<i>Otherwise, you will be eliminated.</i>

493
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,200
<i>The first person to cross the finish line</i>

494
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,760
<i>will win $4.56 million.</i>

495
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
Wow.

496
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,760
<i>Players should spread out</i>
<i>along the start line.</i>

497
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,120
Do you have a preference?

498
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,440
- Do you want the end?
- Yeah.

499
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,720
- You look like you want it. Go ahead.
- If you don't mind.

500
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,000
- I don't care.
- Okay.

501
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,320
Let's do this.

502
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,400
I'm definitely confident with my speed
against these other players.

503
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,840
This is an easy distance to sprint.
This is my type of game.

504
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,240
My biggest competitor is player 183.

505
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,680
I know he works out,
and he looks pretty fast.

506
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,120
So I'm thinking that I need to be
all the way over to the side

507
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,880
so I can keep an eye on him.

508
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,200
This is a game that I grew up
playing with Jeffrey my whole childhood.

509
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,600
I know how to do this.

510
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,960
This game is not about speed.

511
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,640
The moment you start racing too fast,
you're clipped.

512
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,720
I am not thinking about anything else

513
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,160
other than getting across that finish line

514
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,040
as fast as possible.

515
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,640
I am so laser-focused
on winning this game.

516
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,840
I cannot imagine
a different outcome at this point.

517
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,720
<i>Green light, red light</i>

518
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,800
<i>Player 017, eliminated.</i>

519
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,800
Boom! So shocked
that she's out that early.

520
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,040
But this is great news.
And I'm well in the lead.

521
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,240
Player 183, he's moving pretty fast.

522
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,840
It's kind of making me a little worried,
making me wanna go faster.

523
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,960
Shoot. This is for real.

524
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,800
This is no longer
trying to show off in front of my brother.

525
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,800
This is the livelihood
of my family and their future.

526
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,640
<i>Green light, red light</i>

527
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,520
I feel confident in my lead.

528
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,480
I can see the finish line in sight.

529
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,280
I think I might only
have to pause two more times.

530
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,760
<i>Green light, red light</i>

531
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,760
<i>Player 183, eliminated.</i>

532
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,720
I'm glad player 183 is eliminated.

533
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,120
Eventually, karma comes back.

534
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,680
Out of 456 players, I'm top two.

535
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,800
I love player 072, but I'm determined
to walk away with this money.

536
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,400
I am the closest
I've ever been to the money now.

537
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,040
I gotta channel Jeffrey.

538
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,800
He told me that he believes in me,

539
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,760
that he believes
that I can win this competition.

540
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,000
I have to do this
for not only myself but my brother.

541
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,760
I cannot make the slightest mistake.

542
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,840
<i>Green light, red light</i>

543
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,200
<i>Green light, red light</i>

544
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,560
I'm trying so hard to control my breath.

545
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,240
My body feels like it wants to shake.

546
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,040
We are neck to neck.

547
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,640
The money is within reach.
I can smell it now.

548
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,440
I'm driven.
I'm here for my son and my family,

549
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,720
and I'm gonna do
whatever it takes to win this.

550
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,240
<i>Green light, red light</i>

551
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,760
Something's wrong.

552
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,960
I felt a pop.

553
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,080
Oh!

554
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,240
You okay?

555
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,120
This is gonna haunt me forever.

556
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,040
For the rest of my life, I'll never know

557
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,760
if I could've won.

558
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,600
The finish line is right there.
I'm so close.

559
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,640
I wanna keep going,
but I physically can't.

560
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,000
It is devastating.

561
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,120
<i>Player 302, eliminated.</i>

562
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,840
It is what it is.

563
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,080
I am the last woman standing.

564
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,200
It's just me and the finish line.

565
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,040
I had faith, I had strength,

566
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,520
and I had the luck.

567
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,800
I am about to win <i>Squid Game.</i>

568
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,280
<i>Green light, red light</i>

569
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,720
Oh, my God.

570
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,320
<i>Mami. </i>

571
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,960
Oh, my God.

572
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,840
Thank you, God.

573
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,400
<i>Oh, Dios mío.</i>

574
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,480
Congratulations, player 072.

575
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,720
You are the winner of <i>Squid Game.</i>

576
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,200
You have won $4.56 million.

577
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,680
I'm a millionaire!

578
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,080
Yes, bro!

579
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,360
Yes, that's for the Bronx!

580
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,640
Oh, my…

581
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,520
Oh, my God.

582
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,960
Little Perlita
from the BX Boogie Down Bronx

583
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,160
and Santiago de los Caballeros,
Dominican Republic, is a multimillionaire.

584
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,840
Please tell me it's not a lie.

585
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,360
I need to call my mom right now.

586
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,800
Now I can finally take care of my family.

587
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,360
I can breathe now.
Like, money is not gonna be a worry.

588
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,920
And that is just something
I've never been used to.

589
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,400
I am just…

590
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,240
…feeling like the luckiest girl
in the world right now,

591
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,000
to be honest.

592
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,800
<i>Will somebody wear me to the fair?</i>

593
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,040
<i>¿Quién vive aquí?</i>

594
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,280
- What?
- Perla!

595
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,200
I always felt powerful,
but now I'm like, "I'm powerful!"

596
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,560
I am never doubting myself any longer.

597
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,880
Like, if I say I'm gonna do something,
I'm gonna do it no matter what.

598
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,560
I am a force to be reckoned with.

599
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,920
<i>Mami.</i>

600
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,600
<i>Oh, Dios mío.</i>

601
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,960
<i>Are you ready</i>
