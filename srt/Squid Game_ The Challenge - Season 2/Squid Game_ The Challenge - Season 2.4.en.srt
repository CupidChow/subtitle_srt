1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,600
<i>Player 098, you must now choose a player</i>

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,560
<i>to put at risk of elimination.</i>

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,240
<i>The dormitory will then vote</i>
<i>whether to eliminate them</i>

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,480
<i>or you.</i>

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,640
Or-- Or me?

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,600
So what do you think he's doing?

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,560
I thought he was gonna be
eliminated on the spot,

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,080
but getting called into the room
makes it so much more…

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,440
- I know.
- Yeah.

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,440
<i>Player 098,</i>
<i>the vote will begin in 15 minutes.</i>

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,400
<i>Make your choice now.</i>

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,280
The player I'm looking
to eliminate is player--

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,760
I've been in law enforcement
pretty much my whole life.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,320
It seems like I'm an innocent type of guy.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,200
Once someone gets to know me,
they like me.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,400
How'd that go?

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,760
Can you get everybody
and just meet me by the, uh, stage?

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,120
- Everybody?
- Yeah.

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,160
I'm trustworthy,

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,040
but I also have the ability
to manipulate someone if I needed to.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,240
Oh, there he is. There he is.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,000
Can I see everybody by the stage, please?

23
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,640
This could be my last chance to speak out

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,440
and have the players feeling for me.

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,560
And if they can feel for me as a person,

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,840
I may have a real chance
of them voting for me.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,680
- He's crying.
- Oh, God.

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,760
He's either eliminated
or be eliminated, right?

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Oh, my God.

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,040
- Oh, my God, y'all.
- I feel so bad.

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,880
He looks really-- Oh, he's crying. No.

32
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,680
It's a rough game.

33
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,360
When I went to the boiler room…

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,960
…I was told that, uh, I had to put myself
up against somebody else

35
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,800
and that a vote must happen.

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,440
So later tonight,
it will be me or another player.

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,800
Oh, my God, this is actually sad.

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,800
And, um, later,
we'll see who the other player is.

39
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,440
I start to cry, and I see
the other players start to feel it.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,920
I'm not a sneak,

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,200
and I like to think of myself
as a good-hearted person.

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,240
And I hate being put in positions
to hurt somebody else.

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,400
Felt like that worked in my advantage.

44
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,720
I keep trying to guess.
I might as well just stop guessing.

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,360
It's like a popularity contest,

46
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,240
so he's either gonna pick
the weakest person,

47
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,800
that he thinks
no one really talks to, or--

48
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,320
But that could backfire.
'Cause he's, like, intense, right?

49
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,280
Yeah. People are ready to get rid of him.

50
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,720
Player 098 has chosen
another player to go against him.

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,760
One of them will be eliminated,
but no one knows who it is.

52
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,520
I've been very lucky so far,

53
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,400
but at some point,
everyone's luck is gonna run out,

54
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,200
and I'm worried that mine
might run out sooner than others.

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,880
Are you nervous about being up there?

56
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,240
- I am, yeah.
- Why?

57
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,480
I don't know. I--
Today, I just keep feeling eyes on me.

58
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,600
Like, did I do too much the last two days?

59
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,120
I think I'm putting myself
too much out there.

60
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,720
Yeah, everybody knows who August is,
but I don't think--

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,360
- That's not always a bad thing.
- What do you mean by that? Like…

62
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,880
Do people talk about me or, like--

63
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,400
No, no one talks about you,

64
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,720
but I do know
that people know who you are.

65
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,480
People know that you're genuine.

66
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,360
I would be very upset or hurt
if something were to happen

67
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,760
and if you got eliminated.

68
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,320
I was actually born in Guatemala

69
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,240
to a very poor family
that had multiple kids.

70
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,520
Uh, my birth family
couldn't afford to keep me,

71
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,360
um, so they made the decision
to give me up for adoption

72
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,600
as soon as I was born.

73
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,240
Being adopted makes you feel special,

74
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,840
but on the other hand,

75
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,840
all you can think about
is your birth parents,

76
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,880
the people who were supposed to love you
were the ones who kinda tossed you aside.

77
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,040
So the feeling
of needing people to like me

78
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,320
has been a constant in my whole life,

79
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,320
to where sometimes
I would lose track of who I am

80
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,440
in order to be with a group
that I never belonged with anyways.

81
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,320
We love you, New York.

82
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,400
I just need a moment.

83
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,400
Mmm?

84
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,080
- You're good, you're good.
- Yeah.

85
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,160
I'm looking out for myself
and, uh, any opportunity that I can

86
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,720
to make sure people
are sympathizing with me.

87
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,440
I'm gonna have to do what I have to do.

88
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
- This sucks.
- Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

89
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,160
I think he's got a huge facade on.

90
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,720
I think he's overplaying the nice card

91
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,640
to be a player later on.

92
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,280
- Do you care if I pray for you?
- Yeah, you can pray for me.

93
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,880
I don't trust him. I do not trust him.

94
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,800
Heavenly Father, I just--
I pray for a friend here.

95
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,240
And I just wanna thank you
for him and his presence…

96
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,360
I know a lot of people don't like him.

97
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,720
- Right.
- He's pissed a lot of people off.

98
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,120
No, he's rubbed
a lot of people the wrong way.

99
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,800
You think I should worry?

100
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,080
Yeah, I think you should worry.

101
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,560
- 'Cause you are a threat.
- Not at all.

102
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,600
You-- You're a threat
just because you're a twin.

103
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,880
- Yeah, but there's other siblings here.
- Unfortunately.

104
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,880
I know. I know.
This is gonna be really hard.

105
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,360
Well, who would you vote for
between me and 098?

106
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,240
I just ask that you give him
peace and comfort.

107
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,440
- You're thinking of voting me?
- No.

108
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,760
<i>You're stressing me out.</i>

109
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,320
<i>- Thank you so much for-- That was great.</i>
- <i>Absolutely, bro.</i>

110
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,080
<i>Thank you.</i>

111
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,400
Attention, all players.

112
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,160
A vote will now take place
in the dormitory.

113
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,360
Yeah, I'm a little nervous, bro.

114
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,080
I don't think there's anything
to worry about, really.

115
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,040
- I'm gonna move down here just in case.
- Yeah.

116
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,280
Player 098, please come to the stage.

117
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,600
Don't be worried. You guys will be fine.

118
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,840
Part of me is like,
"Oh, my God, it's gonna be me."

119
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,640
I'm panicking, to be honest with you.

120
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,040
Bro.

121
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
- Clammy-ass hands, bro.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,320
Player 098,

123
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
please clearly state
the number of the player

124
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,920
you have chosen to face in the vote.

125
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,040
I'd rather it be me than you.

126
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,480
The player that I chose,

127
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,280
there's two of them and one of me.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,400
Player 431.

129
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,440
Oh, my God.

130
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,960
I'm afraid of anybody that has a sibling
or-- or some type of relationship here.

131
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,480
I need to split that up.
I need to divide it.

132
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,320
If I could take one away,
one becomes very weak.

133
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,400
I'm so glad it's not me.

134
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,520
Player 431 was deceitful
during the game of catch,

135
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,160
and he turned on his team.

136
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,680
And everybody saw his true colors.

137
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,560
There's a target on his back.

138
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,760
It's the best choice
that I could possibly make

139
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,800
to keep myself going in this game.

140
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,680
Players 098 and 431
are now both at risk of elimination.

141
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,160
Don't be nervous, bro.
Whatever it is, it is, you know?

142
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,280
You must now vote.

143
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,000
Press X to save player 098.

144
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Press O to save player 431.

145
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,160
I think that you having your brother here,
that's two versus one.

146
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,920
It's not emotional. It's just strategic.

147
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,120
You've been incredibly intense
these last few days.

148
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,840
- I'm not the biggest fan, personally.
- Mm-hmm.

149
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,200
I just have to go with my gut, man.

150
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,360
We've had such a good time, innit?
Like, what the hell?

151
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,960
- I love you so much.
- Love you too, bro.

152
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,880
Every player that goes up there
to hit that button

153
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,040
shouldn't even have to think twice
to eliminate 431.

154
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,280
They got two brothers.
You gotta eliminate one.

155
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,800
At this point in the game,

156
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,200
people are starting to realize
the twins have an advantage.

157
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,600
There's two of 'em,
double the chances to win.

158
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,160
I'm just going with my gut.

159
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,640
If you separate the twins,
they lose their power.

160
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,120
Yo, we never had a handshake.
We never had a hug.

161
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
That's all this is.

162
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,080
Panic is starting to set in now.
This is not going my way.

163
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,640
I know I said I would, but…

164
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,560
I need to start thinking
with my head and not my heart.

165
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,080
Sorry.

166
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,080
I feel like the plan that I executed,

167
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,480
the strategy that I put in place
should work perfect.

168
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm starting to pick up
more and more votes.

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,120
I'm gaining a healthy lead,
and it's making me feel more confident

170
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,760
each and every time
another player comes up.

171
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,840
Let's hope this doesn't put a rift
between me and everyone else.

172
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,760
Player 098 made the smartest move ever

173
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,560
by choosing player 431.

174
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,000
If he had chosen anybody else…

175
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,920
…he would've been buying
his plane ticket back home.

176
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,640
098, you're loud and obnoxious,

177
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,080
but 431, I-- I think
you just play selfishly and without honor.

178
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,400
So I'll take loud
and obnoxious personality all day.

179
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,440
Holy jumpins.

180
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,760
It is a shame that you tried to go
against our team's plan yesterday.

181
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,560
It's written in the sand at this point.

182
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,240
Sorry.

183
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,120
This is not gonna be the same without him.
This will-- I don't even know if I, like…

184
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,960
I really wanted him to be okay.

185
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,640
Attention, all players.

186
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
<i>Voting is now complete.</i>

187
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,200
<i>Player 431, you have been eliminated.</i>

188
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,560
That's warming.
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

189
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,840
You'll be good, though, mate.
You'll be good.

190
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,400
We just have an unbreakable bond.

191
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,240
I'mma try my hardest for him.
I mean, this is for him now.

192
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,680
We'll see.

193
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,400
These difficult times
and these uncomfortable situations

194
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,800
is what it's all about,
but let it flow through you.

195
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,200
You'll be good, you'll be good.

196
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,400
Come on, I just need to compose.

197
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,320
Sometimes young is ig-- ignorance,
you know?

198
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,840
And I-- I think
he has a lot to learn, you know.

199
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,560
Um, don't betray anybody.

200
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,480
I knew the moment he said he was sorry
and wasn't gonna throw me the ball,

201
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,000
he buried his own coffin.

202
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,200
Thing is, like, not many people
were too keen on him,

203
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,480
so the fact that he thought about it
and thought of a way to get himself in,

204
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,680
and he's managed to do it,
it's just impressive.

205
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
- You all right? You upset with me?
- Yeah, I'm good.

206
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,440
- You should be. It's all right, bro.
- No--

207
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,000
It's-- I understand. Like, I know.

208
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,960
- Okay.
- I know I took out your brother.

209
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,920
I'm not upset. I understand.
That's a very smart move, very strategic.

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,600
- It's all good, yeah?
- Yeah.

211
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,880
Don't stress out about it.

212
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,920
I appreciate it,
but I care a lot about people.

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,120
So it bothers me when someone is upset.

214
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,800
- So that's why I like to talk about it.
- Of course, I'm upset.

215
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,520
That's what I'm saying.
I-- I feel your pain, I understand.

216
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,920
You know, I'm playing a game too,
you know, and I'm sorry.

217
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,040
- Exactly.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

218
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,400
Yeah, you're good, man. Don't stress, man.

219
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,320
How do you feel about that?

220
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,800
Just let me speak.

221
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,600
Yeah, I know. I mean, it sucks for you
that you had experience,

222
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,880
but I think it was a good thing
for you to see

223
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,200
how people are now
starting to play the game.

224
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,320
<i>What I'm gonna say</i>
<i>is that we gotta watch our back.</i>

225
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,160
- Somebody said something?
- It's just time to play the game.

226
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,920
If we're gonna move forward in this game,

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,480
- I'm choosing character before, like…
- Yeah, that's true.

228
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
- Bro, I don't even care, like, about--
- Loyalty, too.

229
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,080
I'm not loyal to anybody.
I'm just like, if you show…

230
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,800
- I'm loyal to you and myself.
- Yeah.

231
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,080
I always jokingly ask him,
like, "If we weren't siblings

232
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,880
and we met in school,
would we be friends?"

233
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,640
And we're always like, "Yeah, probably."
And I, was like--

234
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,880
And because I always become friends
with people that are more reserved

235
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,600
and, you know,
often have a resting bitch face,

236
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,800
and he always becomes friends
with people that are…

237
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,240
And that's how I am.

238
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,600
So I feel like we would've
been friends, um, for sure.

239
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,880
And, yeah, he couldn't escape me, bro.

240
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,040
I'm finding him in-- in every universe.

241
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,360
Beans.

242
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,440
Oh, that's a lot of beans.

243
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,880
Thank you.

244
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,360
- Beans? No!
- Beans!

245
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,160
Beans! Hey, I'll take it.

246
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,840
What's wrong?

247
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,680
I'm just, like… I don't know.
I just get nervous.

248
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,200
The twin going home
makes us more of a target, but…

249
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,800
- Yeah, I know.
- The game's just--

250
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,120
It's kind of getting hard.

251
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,360
It's a game. It's just a game.

252
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,920
I know it's a game,
but it's getting to my head.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,320
'Cause I wanna make sure
I'm being a good person doing it.

254
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,480
You are. 100% you are.

255
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,160
We're not lying,
we're not deceiving, okay?

256
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,240
- It's gonna get worse.
- I know.

257
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,000
I mean, look at everyone cliquing up.
Right? Everyone's cliquing up.

258
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,800
I don't think,
with 70 players left in the game,

259
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,880
any duo is a threat.
I think they're an opportunity.

260
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,440
I, like, kinda agree with that,
and I kinda don't.

261
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,160
I'm going off of speculation,

262
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,360
but I would assume
we're gonna cut down drastically

263
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,560
at the next game or test
or whatever we're gonna do.

264
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,280
And if that's the case,
then I don't really want

265
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,920
someone that has a-- a built-in partner
still in the game.

266
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,440
415 and I have these little meetings
where we just share all the information

267
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,840
that we've learned from the entire day.

268
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,280
And as of right now,
he's who I feel the closest with.

269
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,240
When you have somebody
that you actually trust,

270
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,360
this is like… …gold.

271
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,480
The only time I got nervous
was when Natalie had control

272
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,000
because she's such a loose cannon.

273
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,440
That's a really good point.

274
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,600
110 is perfect.

275
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,280
I hope that my future real babies
are just like her when they grow up.

276
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,920
She's gonna eliminate
a lot of people here. I can feel it.

277
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,480
And I wanna be at her side doing it.

278
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,920
Hey, sit down here. Down here.

279
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,800
Get a little closer.

280
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
What you got?

281
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,000
There was a note on my spoon.

282
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,120
- No, there wasn't.
- Yeah.

283
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,280
What?

284
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,200
It said the next game is Mingle,
and the first group number is six.

285
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,120
No freaking way.

286
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,720
Okay.

287
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,040
Mingle is a game of friendship.

288
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,160
It definitely takes strategy.

289
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,160
Trying to scramble to find groups
and teams and alliances.

290
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,400
I need to bring the people
that are close to me, that I trust,

291
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,680
and I would like
to bring them along as well.

292
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,960
I think it's a huge advantage
knowing what the game is

293
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,000
and what the first number is.
You're essentially safe.

294
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,760
- For the first number.
- For the first, yeah.

295
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,840
You essentially might've
neutralized my disadvantage.

296
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,960
I know. That's why I wanted
to tell you right away.

297
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,080
Thank you.

298
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,080
Because of getting the nesting doll,
I've got a disadvantage.

299
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,280
And this almost--

300
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,280
Doesn't even the playing field,
but this, this is huge.

301
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,080
My guy gets a note that says
the next game is Mingle,

302
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,760
and the first number is six?
That changes everything.

303
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,360
Out of every player in that dorm,
021 is the one I trust the most.

304
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,640
How many do we have? We have me, you…

305
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,640
Dan, AJ, and Lenny.

306
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
- And Tyler. Yeah.
- And Tyler.

307
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,280
I mean, he's-- he's loyal.

308
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,320
I want to tell everyone,

309
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,760
but then what would be the point
of having the note?

310
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
- Walk to the bathroom?
- Yeah, that's where I'm going.

311
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,600
Slow down.

312
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,960
I got a note on my spoon.

313
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,600
- It said that… the next game is Mingle.
- It's what?

314
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,360
The next game is Mingle,
and the first group is six.

315
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,600
So we added you to our group.

316
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
- Bro!
- Yeah, bro.

317
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,640
Thank you.

318
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,520
I played football in the NFL
with the Baltimore Ravens.

319
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,440
And football is not a sport
that you can play alone.

320
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,120
The next game is Mingle,
and the first group number is six.

321
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,920
People have to play
with one goal and heart in mind,

322
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,400
so team dynamics are… …favorable to me.

323
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,120
Here we go, here we go.

324
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,920
- Someone's coming right now.
- What we got?

325
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,040
Attention, all players.

326
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,640
The third game will begin shortly.

327
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,680
Shit.

328
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,400
Player 153.

329
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Yesterday, by choosing to open the doll,

330
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,200
you received
a disadvantage for the next game.

331
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,160
- Please step forward.
- Yes.

332
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,960
You must pick someone
to share that disadvantage with.

333
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,640
Now.

334
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,160
Why?

335
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,800
He's picking another disadvantaged.

336
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,280
How-- How am I supposed to pick?

337
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,160
That's so tough.

338
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,120
I-- I don't know--
I don't know how to do this, guys.

339
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,320
Uh, this is not what I was expecting
with the disadvantage.

340
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,680
I mean…

341
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,680
432, you trying to come with me?

342
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,240
You're the only one
I'm thinking of right now.

343
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,000
I just keep looking at you.

344
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,880
If you choose me, you choose me.

345
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
- Let's do this. Come on, let's do it.
- Yeah, yeah.

346
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,640
432 is just in the front of the line,
and I just keep coming back to him.

347
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,200
I just keep looking at him.

348
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,480
I know the next game is Mingle.

349
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,040
His alliance isn't gonna let him die.

350
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,080
I don't know
how we're gonna get disadvantaged,

351
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,000
but I know
if we are disadvantaged together,

352
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,280
that could ultimately
potentially be a benefit.

353
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,080
And also, I picked 432
because if I'm going down,

354
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,720
you're coming with me, bro.

355
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,760
Oh, shoot.

356
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,920
Handcuffs.

357
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,720
Oh, God.

358
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,760
Do we find someone else to be our sixth?

359
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,760
- We have to.
- I feel terrible for Austin.

360
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,040
He's not gonna like that.

361
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,640
- Greg, are you solo?
- Hmm?

362
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,160
- Are you solo?
- I am solo.

363
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,320
- You wanna jump in with us?
- Absolutely.

364
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,520
I know what the game is.

365
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,200
- Okay.
- I do.

366
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,520
- Do you actually?
- Yeah.

367
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,000
- No way.
- Yeah.

368
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,920
This is good. This is really, really good.

369
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,080
Something that was,
you know, a disadvantage

370
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,000
is now feeling like an advantage.

371
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,680
I'm confident.
I'm feeling really confident.

372
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,200
Players, please follow the staff
to the game hall.

373
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,160
Already?

374
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
I'mma go a little further back.

375
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,680
What do we do, Marcus?

376
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,480
So, you guys need
a group of six to survive, okay?

377
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,280
If you wanna go fast, go alone.
If you wanna go far, go with a team.

378
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,880
And I trust my team.
They're not gonna screw us over,

379
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,520
but I need to step aside.

380
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,320
I'm not gonna cause my team
to get eliminated

381
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,000
because of my disadvantage.

382
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,400
It was my choice to take the nesting doll.
It's my disadvantage.

383
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,920
Listen, you can't tell anybody.

384
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,600
- The game is Mingle.
- Yeah.

385
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,040
The first group number
they're gonna call out is six.

386
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,440
- This is insane.
- Wow.

387
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,920
- This is…
- Oh, my God.

388
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,120
Oh!

389
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,960
This is so crazy, dude.

390
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,920
<i>Attention, players.</i>

391
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,760
<i>Welcome to your third game, Mingle.</i>

392
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,520
This is what we thought.
This is what we thought.

393
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,160
<i>When the game starts,</i>
<i>the platform will begin to rotate.</i>

394
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,480
This thing's gonna spin?

395
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,680
<i>And you will hear a number.</i>

396
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,240
<i>You must form groups of that size</i>

397
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,280
<i>and enter a room with your group</i>
<i>and close the door.</i>

398
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,360
We need to stay with our groups.

399
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,760
We have every combination
if we stay together.

400
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,560
<i>Any player not in a room</i>
<i>when the time runs out</i>

401
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,480
<i>will be eliminated.</i>

402
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,720
We wanna be
at the edge of the platform at all times.

403
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,200
<i>Any player inside a room</i>
<i>containing an incorrect number of players</i>

404
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,240
<i>will also be… eliminated.</i>

405
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,920
Stay on the platform.
Once that music stops,

406
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,760
we'll figure it out,
get to a door, and we'll be safe.

407
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,320
Appreciate you letting me join your group.

408
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,320
- Well…
- Appreciate you helping us out.

409
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,280
Absolutely, man.

410
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,440
I'm not a person to generally let
other people take the lead.

411
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,680
And then, that's where being
shackled together

412
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,360
is a huge disadvantage, right?

413
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,200
I'm working with his people.
I don't-- I don't trust his people.

414
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,160
You wanna keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

415
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,560
Well, we just got real close.

416
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,160
<i>With that, let the game begin.</i>

417
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,640
Whoo-hoo! Let's go!

418
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,480
<i>Round and round…</i>

419
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,720
I feel very confident right now.

420
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,520
And if anyone tries
to infiltrate our room,

421
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
I'm comfortable saying,
"Hey, you gotta go."

422
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,560
<i>We will clap our hands and sing</i>

423
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,360
<i>La-la-la-la… </i>

424
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,000
My main concern is being
in a group with someone I don't trust.

425
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,720
Stay right in the middle, so we figure out
which way you have to go.

426
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,760
We know, we know.

427
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,200
When a number's called,

428
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,280
someone that's on my side
may be, uh, two-timing me

429
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:47,840
and leaving me hanging
and not being able to get into a room

430
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,360
with the proper numbers.

431
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,760
<i>…in a circle and dance</i>

432
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,040
<i>We will clap our hands and sing…</i>

433
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,520
People are celebrating
but they're about to die.

434
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,840
<i>Let's have fun dancing</i>

435
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,280
I can't believe
this is actually our lives right now.

436
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,280
<i>The group number is six.</i>

437
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,840
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait.

438
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,720
- Four, five, six.
- Go to the doors.

439
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,000
- No, you stay here. Get two off Melissa.
- We need two, we need two!

440
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,520
Door four.

441
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,400
- Get in, get in, get in.
- Lock it, lock it.

442
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,880
- Get in.
- Lock it, lock it!

443
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,120
Oh, my God. Oh!

444
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,840
Let's go!

445
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,400
- You and me.
- Let's go!

446
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,880
Oh, man!

447
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,760
Lock, lock, lock. Two, four, six. Lock it!

448
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,240
Hey!

449
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,160
Stay there.
You gotta get-- You gotta get two.

450
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,200
One, two, three, four, five.
That wasn't the plan. That wasn't---

451
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,040
- There's nobody else--
- We are screwed.

452
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,480
Who's out? Who's out?

453
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,280
Sorry, y'all. Uh-oh.

454
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,760
Anybody wanna trade?

455
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,040
Oh, my gosh.

456
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,360
- I don't wanna see it.
- I don't wanna see it either.

457
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,840
Four people are out already.

458
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,880
That's a lot of people, man,
just like that.

459
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,920
All right, it begins.

460
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,120
- One down. One down.
- One down.

461
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,120
I came in here, and I was like…

462
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,520
'Cause I don't have a set alliance,
so the moment I came in--

463
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Now you do.

464
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,320
So guys, next time, yeah,
me and Austin not at the back.

465
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,920
'Cause that means we shut the door quicker
and lock it quicker.

466
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,280
I have a bad feeling in my stomach

467
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,480
that we shouldn't have the players
with the disadvantages on our team.

468
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,960
Do you reckon there's people arguing
right now in their rooms?

469
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,480
They're all fighting, yeah.

470
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,280
Right here, right here, right here.

471
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,760
Stepping back on the platform
just turns my stomach

472
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,680
because I know the chaos
that's about to ensue.

473
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,680
Tell us the plan.

474
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,720
We don't know
'cause we don't know the number.

475
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,840
That's the best way.
We had a plan, and it don't work.

476
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
Oh, my God.

477
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,000
Oh, my God, that was brutal.

478
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
If you are a straggler
or if I'm a straggler,

479
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,560
let's grab each other, okay?

480
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,080
Let's do the best we can.
But I'll be looking to you guys first.

481
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,880
I'm just saying.
Because at the end of the day, it's like…

482
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,040
- Gotta have your group.
- People are gonna have to jump.

483
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,400
Just in case, you never know.

484
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,000
If you have to jump, come to this side.

485
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,680
- Okay. I got you. I will.
- If you have to.

486
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,360
We're trying to get all our bases covered
and have a plan for every number.

487
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,360
Words and promises,
they just don't matter.

488
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,760
What matters is getting in that door.

489
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,160
Welcome to Mingle.

490
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,400
Hey. Hey, now's the time to say

491
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,120
if anyone got another spoon
with the game-- with the number two.

492
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,040
Did anyone get game two?

493
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,520
- We gotta keep the faith.
- Yeah.

494
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,640
Player 111 keeping the faith.

495
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,480
I always hope that something good
is coming anyone's way,

496
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,960
and I always want
the next outcome to be positive.

497
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,640
But a game like Mingle

498
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,800
is where all the worst parts
of the best people come out,

499
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,560
and that's when the game
truly becomes toxic in a way,

500
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,720
to where you have to be willing
to cut people you pledged allegiance to,

501
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,240
and that's not my game style.

502
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,280
This is our whole group. We're 12 deep.

503
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,960
Terror is setting in that,

504
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,080
"Let's start trying
to get numbers covered."

505
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,520
"Let's try to get numbers covered."

506
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,000
- Drake.
- Drake. Drake.

507
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,200
Seven and nine?

508
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,000
Seven? We got seven and nine.

509
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,360
For us. Perfect.

510
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,760
It's done.

511
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,160
You're just looking for bodies
to cover numbers.

512
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,120
<i>The group number is 12.</i>

513
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,160
- Oh, we're good. Go.
- Go, go, go!

514
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,480
Oh!

515
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,640
Yeah, we're good.

516
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,800
Go, go, go, go.

517
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,240
Go, go, go, go!

518
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,440
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

519
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,680
Oh, man.

520
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,440
- One, two, three!
- Do we have a group now?

521
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,080
- Okay. There are 12.
- Go, go, go.

522
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,000
One, two…

523
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,720
Go, go, go!

524
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,960
Eleven, twelve.

525
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,080
Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
Done. We're good.

526
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,440
Six, seven, eight.

527
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:51,960
We're out.

528
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,840
Nine, ten, eleven. Sorry about you.

529
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,040
- Sorry about you.
- Oh, no.

530
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,760
We're out. We're out.

531
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,240
Viking, get your hands off me, boy.

532
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,920
- That is so mean.
- What's mean?

533
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,440
- You're calling him the Viking?
- Okay.

534
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,000
We didn't see that one coming.
We didn't see that one coming.

535
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,120
- Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11.
- We need one more, we need one more.

536
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,400
- We need one more.
- Hey! We need one more.

537
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,640
- One more right now.
- Run!

538
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,000
Oh, jeez.

539
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,720
Run, Damien, run! Damien, run!

540
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,400
Wait, wait, wait!

541
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,200
Close it, close it! No, no, no!

542
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,080
No, no, no. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry.

543
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,800
- No, we can't. We can't.
- Lock the door!

544
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,400
Oh, this game is actually gonna
be harder than we thought.

545
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,480
Two rounds down, two rounds down.

546
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,800
This is a good group.
Let's just stay together.

547
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,920
If it's 11, the new chick is gone.

548
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,520
I am ecstatic for myself.

549
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,760
I somehow made it into a room
that needed one person.

550
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,280
But…

551
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,560
I'm leaving behind all of my allies.

552
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,000
Um, some of my closest friends
in this game.

553
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,800
It's…

554
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,560
It's a double-edged sword, for sure.

555
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,880
Twelve and twelve?

556
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,800
It's crazy 'cause we thought
this was gonna be the most fun game.

557
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,720
I was ready to play this,
but I take it back.

558
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,280
- I take it back.
- This is horrible.

559
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,680
- This is terrible.
- It's horrible.

560
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,360
- We need three more for nine to happen.
- We have nine.

561
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,200
It's getting harder now.
We're losing players,

562
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,440
and it's impossible to know
what number they're gonna say next.

563
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,480
It's becoming very chaotic and confusing,

564
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,200
and we're all just losing our minds.

565
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,120
- I think it's gonna be eight or nine.
- Four.

566
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,040
No, we need seven. We need seven!

567
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,760
I grew up
with, like, an affinity for numbers.

568
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,680
A game like Mingle
is like this massive puzzle

569
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,440
that no one really knows
what the final picture is gonna be.

570
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,000
But I'm beginning to piece
that puzzle together.

571
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,400
And if I'm putting the pieces in right,
the puzzle is not looking good.

572
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,840
<i>La-la-la-la Let's have fun dancing</i>

573
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,200
<i>The group number is nine.</i>

574
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,560
Who's our nine?

575
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,600
We need four. We need more!

576
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,160
- Yes. Nine!
- Twenty.

577
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,880
Four, five, six, seven.

578
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,080
Two, three, four.

579
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,200
Three, four, five.

580
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,160
Y'all, come here.

581
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,800
- Seven.
- Push.

582
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,560
- No.
- Eight, nine.

583
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,080
Oh, my God. We can't do this.
We're all gonna get eliminated.

584
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,240
- We got ten!
- We have ten. We need one to go.

585
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,960
- One, two, three…
- No, we have ten.

586
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,680
- Come on.
- What's the number?

587
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,600
- We have too many.
- Rock, Paper, Scissors.

588
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,960
- What's the number?
- Go! We need two, next room!

589
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,400
- Go!
- Two in the next room.

590
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,840
Two in the next room!

591
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,280
One, two, three, four, five.

592
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,640
- Ten! We have ten.
- One more to get out.

593
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,280
Somebody needs to go!

594
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,800
Yeah, who wants to die?

595
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,720
They're freaking out.
Their door's wide open.

596
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,440
- Please!
- Somebody's gotta go.

597
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,360
- Please!
- I was the first one here.

598
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,840
- Seven seconds left.
- Go!

599
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,000
Guys.

600
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,440
What do you have? What do you have?

601
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,040
- Go, go!
- Come on!

602
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,800
Go! Come here. Get in.

603
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,360
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- No!

604
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,240
- We needed--
- She ran to another one.

605
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,080
She ran! She ran. I didn't push her.

606
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,520
No, we need nine.

607
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,640
- Oh, my God.
- It's nine, guys. We're done.

608
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,480
August was in here first, bro.

609
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,400
- August is out there?
- He's out there.

610
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,920
August was our number guy,
he's the reason we made it so far.

611
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,720
My family's gonna be
so disappointed in me.

612
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,640
My whole life, I've always had
this fear of being abandoned.

613
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,200
As I stood outside the door, it was like…

614
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,160
I was abandoned yet again.

615
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,200
The people I trusted abandoned me.

616
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,400
- Why did he leave?
- 'Cause he always trying to help people.

617
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,040
- He's a good person.
- I know he's a good person.

618
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,520
- You did great.
- My family's gonna be so disappointed.

619
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,080
No, man. You gave it your everything.

620
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,600
August, no! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

621
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,640
He helped us.

622
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,840
He helped us. He sacrificed himself.

623
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,560
My whole family was counting on me

624
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,400
because I told them
I know I have what it takes to win.

625
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,320
They will not be disappointed in you.
They're gonna be so proud of you.

626
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,960
So proud.

627
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,560
We're good for five,
good for seven, good for eight.

628
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,360
- We're good for five, seven…
- Stick together, guys.

629
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,280
We are.

630
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,320
I've never felt so stressed in my life.

631
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,760
This is tough.

632
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,160
We are shackled by the wrists together.

633
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,320
We need to move as one.

634
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,720
And it's harder than, you know, obviously,
being an individual in this game.

635
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,720
Madness, dude. This is madness.

636
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,680
This is gonna be the hardest one yet.

637
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,640
Just get to the door. Lock the door.

638
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,000
Don't let anyone in. Box that Natalie out.

639
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,520
Come on, man.
Let's-- Let's get past this challenge.

640
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,640
<i>Round and round…</i>

641
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,800
If it's seven, last two people in
play Rock, Paper, Scissors.

642
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,600
That's just-- It is what it is.
If it's five, we also have a plan.

643
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,240
We were gonna do seven right here.

644
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,200
One, two, three, four.
We already shook on it.

645
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,640
- Stay with our group. Stay with our group.
- Oh, my God.

646
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,280
- That's the whole point of the game.
- You're jumping ship now.

647
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,560
- Oh, my God.
- Stay with our group.

648
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,160
- They are crumbling.
- Yeah.

649
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,320
Boys, I think we're good.

650
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,800
- Three 12s.
- Yes, yes, yes.

651
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,880
- 100%. All right.
- Done. Done.

652
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,080
It's the fairest way we can do it,
but we have to stick together.

653
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,480
We have been together this whole time.
Stay with us. Seven.

654
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,080
We're only losing one.

655
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,240
And I don't wanna be that one.

656
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,120
We don't take these two.

657
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,000
From the beginning, I was like,
"The two that are chained up."

658
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,920
I was like, "Do not take 'em."

659
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,280
<i>The group number is seven.</i>

660
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,840
- Let's go!
- Bro, you go.

661
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,800
- Are we good?
- Yeah, we're good. We're good.

662
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,560
- Last four. Come on.
- Let's go, let's go!

663
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,120
Come on, Nat. Nat, Nat, Nat, Nat!

664
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,440
Come on. Leave it.
Don't jump ship. Come on!

665
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,000
You come here. No, no, no, no!

666
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,560
- Come on!
- Yo!

667
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,760
Yo, yo, yo!

668
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,800
Come on, come on!

669
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,960
Karim, Karim, Karim! Come here!

670
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,280
Three, three, three, three!

671
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,200
One more?

672
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,320
Oh, no.

673
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,960
Three, three. Three, come on.

674
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,440
Come back, come back!

675
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,240
We need one, one, one!

676
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,600
- What the--
- What happened?

677
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,000
- Yo! Let's go!
- Accepted.

678
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,080
- One more. I think they need one more.
- We got this.

679
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,320
We're together
for the rest of this game. We go, dude.

680
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,480
- Two. Wait.
- Two more! We just need two more!

681
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,240
- Trinity! Trinity!
- Two more.

682
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,800
That's Trinity's bestie.

683
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,760
Don't, don't, don't, Trinity, please.

684
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,440
- Trinity! No!
- You need two?

685
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,760
Trinity, come on, please!

686
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,960
- Trinity, please!
- They need two, they need two.

687
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,240
No, don't mess this up for us!

688
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,120
Trinity, please! Trinity, please.

689
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,600
- I'm trying, bro. They need two.
- No!

690
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,800
- Trinity, please don't.
- Somebody come with me.

691
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,120
- No, we're not coming with you!
- Just one more, bro.

692
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,080
Lemme-- Just one more.

693
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,120
- No, Trinity.
- It's just one more!

694
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,040
I'm so angry. 172 is holding me back.

695
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,080
You just need one more!
She just needs one more!

696
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,120
I'm wanting to help 263

697
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,800
because I know
she can win all of <i>Squid Game.</i>

698
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,200
And I'd rather her win it all than me.

699
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,080
I hope we're done,
and I pray that we're done.

700
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,480
It is hurting my heart,
and it's making me so angry.

701
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,320
Why'd they leave?

702
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,560
- Why did that happen? We had seven.
- How did that happen?

703
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,840
This is devastating.

704
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,560
If we just stuck to the plan,
we would've been fine.

705
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,760
437 is a snake in the grass.

706
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,640
He turned his back on his own alliance
to go with another group.

707
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,160
Hey, those two that are chained up…

708
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,560
They're done.

709
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,600
I don't know
how you got here, but let's go.

710
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,440
You guys have to remember,
we're going to lose people,

711
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,080
and we have to keep our heads strong.

712
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,440
People are being persuasive,
and then people are saying yes,

713
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,760
and people are saying no.
That's the point of this game.

714
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,840
It's supposed to mess with your brain.
That's what it's gonna do.

715
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,360
Why'd she just run over there?

716
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,760
Because she's disloyal.

717
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,120
'Cause she doesn't have faithful
to anybody here.

718
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,880
So why was she telling us to go to four?

719
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,800
She's lying to us
so she can get to first door.

720
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,800
Stay together.

721
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,240
Why did you go to two?

722
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,760
- Thought we didn't have enough.
- We did have enough.

723
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,440
- You shouldn't have done that.
- That's the whole point of the game!

724
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,440
To be disloyal to us?
Right now? We had a group.

725
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,560
- All right, let her quit.
- She's gone.

726
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,240
These people need to understand
that this game is not for friendships.

727
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,000
We're playing for ourselves.

728
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,720
But honestly, I'm here for it
because I want that money.

729
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,160
Do we have 10? Let's make a group of 10.

730
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,720
We gotta stay here.
We have to trust each other.

731
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,200
Wait, wait. Who's your ten?

732
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,520
If it's five, we go together.

733
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,000
Huddle back up in the big group.

734
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,320
<i>The group number is four.</i>

735
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,800
One, two, three, four.

736
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,400
Three, four.

737
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,520
Hey, there's only one person
no good? That's it?

738
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,040
He just left one. He just left one person.

739
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,600
It was fun while it lasted.

740
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,160
This is rough, man.

741
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,160
- This is rough.
- This is rough.

742
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,280
There's certain plays that I've done
that I'm not proud of,

743
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,200
but I'm not gonna be fake to anybody.

744
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,680
I told everybody straight-up,

745
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,400
if it's me versus you, I'm gonna choose me
and I hope you choose you.

746
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,000
And-- And that's all of us here.

747
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,640
All that for one person?

748
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,600
We are at-- just at a point in the game

749
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,880
where your mental
and your physical capacity are drained.

750
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,280
Like, "Am I even gonna
make it another round?"

751
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,520
<i>We go around in circles…</i>

752
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,000
This game is stressful.

753
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,880
Everybody's screwing everybody over.

754
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,720
Everyone's true colors
are coming out at this point.

755
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,200
<i>La-la-la-la, let's have fun dancing</i>

756
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,120
<i>The group number is seven.</i>

757
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,160
Seven, seven, seven.

758
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,960
- Go, go, go.
- Oh, shit. Oh, God.

759
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,480
- Go.
- We have our seven.

760
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,280
No. No, no, no!

761
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,720
Come on, come on. One, two.

762
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,600
Three, four, five, six, seven.

763
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,560
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven. We're good.

764
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,280
- You got too many.
- No.

765
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,320
You guys have too many. You have too many.

766
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,040
- No! Natalie, no!
- …six, seven.

767
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,160
No. Natalie, you're not part of the group!

768
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,440
- Natalie, you're not part of the group.
- Sorry.

769
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,080
She was not part of the group.

770
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,440
- Are we seven?
- No, we're eight.

771
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,720
- Somebody get out.
- Come on, get in here.

772
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,080
They're calling one more.

773
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,000
- Only one!
- One person go!

774
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,640
No, we have eight!
We have eight! We're eight.

775
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,400
Get out! You hold me in last game.
You leave!

776
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,320
They're losing time. They're gonna be out.

777
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,880
Hey, hey, hey! Guys.

778
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,320
Our door is closed. Our door is closed!

779
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,480
Just come over here!

780
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,440
Five, four, three…

781
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,800
Natalie's out.

782
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,760
Nata-- Natalie deserves it, though.
Natalie deserves it.

783
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,160
These groups made sure
they're gonna keep certain players in.

784
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,320
Nobody made promises to me,
and I didn't make any--

785
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,320
Please let that be it!

786
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,360
Oh, my God.

787
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,840
This game better be over.

788
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,240
Just come here.

789
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,280
We're not playing.

790
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,800
No, we're not. We're not, we're not.

791
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,720
- We're not playing, guys.
- No, we're not.

792
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,080
No, nobody play. Nobody play.

793
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,440
No one play.

794
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,000
Everybody hold hands. We're not playing.

795
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,120
<i>Hold hands.</i>

796
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,640
<i>Everyone hold hands.</i>

797
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,920
<i>We're not playing!</i>

798
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,360
Hold on. Hold on.

799
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,920
- We're not playing.
- We're not playing. We're not playing.

800
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,920
<i>The group number is two.</i>

801
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,160
Just pick a two.

802
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,520
No!

803
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,320
We're not playing. No, we're not playing.

804
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,360
Just hold. Just hold somebody.
Hold somebody!

805
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,840
Just in case.

806
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,040
- There's 42 of us.
- It's an even number.

807
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,040
- We're all in.
- Oh, he's right.

808
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,320
We're all in.

809
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
If everyone has two, it's fine.

810
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,160
- Look.
- Oh, my God.

811
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
The Front Man.

812
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,720
Front Man.

813
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,760
They're gonna shoot us.

814
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,320
Players, you have chosen
to stop playing the game.

815
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,360
To reward your courage,
please accept this gift.

816
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,520
Don't cry. This is a stupid game.

817
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,240
It's never a gift here in Squid Game.

818
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,680
They're always up to something here.

819
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,240
The game's over.

820
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,360
They hand you a box. You open it up.

821
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,200
Zoe actually was
the first one that realized.

822
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,560
Marbles.

823
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,800
One of us is going forward
and one of us is going home.

824
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,640
We had worked so hard to get so far,

825
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,760
and this journey's about to end.

826
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,000
This is how the game goes, though.

827
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,680
We have to play the games.
We can't split the money.

828
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,240
God damn it, we shouldn't have paired up.

829
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,280
This was way harder
than I thought it was gonna be, bro.

830
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,000
How was it supposed to be?
It's okay, it's okay.

831
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,480
I really don't wanna play my brother

832
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,760
because I wanted us
to make it towards the end

833
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,920
and fight it out there.

834
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,920
To think that if I win,
he won't be here, it makes me really sad.

835
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,680
<i>Players, the next game is Marbles.</i>

836
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,720
<i>Only half of you will survive.</i>

837
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,480
Marbles is my worst nightmare.

838
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,360
I don't even wanna,
like, play a game with you.

839
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,960
$4.56 million is nothing to sneeze about.

840
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,280
I sacrificed so much to be here.

841
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,040
I know you. You're so competitive.

842
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,840
But I'm not gonna let you win.

843
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,400
Immediately, I'm thinking revenge.

844
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,440
Like a lone wolf out in the wilderness,

845
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,080
looking for food to survive.

846
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,280
No!

847
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,840
<i>One of you will win $4.56 million.</i>

848
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,800
This is where friends and bonds matter.

849
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,960
Oh, my God.

850
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,360
- I can't trust anybody.
- People have to go.

851
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,760
It's having to eliminate or be eliminated.

852
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,560
I want to win.
I'm going to come out on top.

853
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,080
<i>With that, let the game begin.</i>

854
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,680
I'm gonna have no problem
taking any of these players out.

855
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,800
<i>Green light, red light</i>
