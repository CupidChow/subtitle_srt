1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,520
You got it?

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,200
I got this.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
I know you do.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,800
I know you do.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,960
I've been dumped on my whole life.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,720
But, like, I'm a good human being.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,640
I'm kind.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,880
Be proud of yourself.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,440
Be proud of yourself.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,400
I believe in myself.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,440
They're gonna get it.
They're gonna get it.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,480
- It's gonna be so sick.
- Here we go, man.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,040
All right.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,320
One…

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,680
…two…

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,040
three.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,240
Damn!

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,560
Oh, God.

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,240
Oh, my God, dude.

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,840
I'm so sorry.

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,520
I'm so sorry.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,440
I'm so sorry.

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,720
I just needed that win.

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,960
And instead, I got an epic fail.

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,840
<i>- I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>- It's okay.</i>

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,720
<i>Player 443, eliminated.</i>

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,600
<i>Player 100…</i>

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,360
<i>eliminated.</i>

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,720
<i>Attention, players.</i>

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,160
<i>There are 13 balls remaining.</i>

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,840
<i>Player 451,</i>

32
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,520
<i>you are next in line.</i>

33
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,560
<i>Make your way to the center.</i>

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,720
Something in my gut's telling me

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,360
one of us is not gonna make it,
and I think it's gonna be my guy, 437.

36
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,080
Player 082 is safe,

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,560
but my player, 437, picked a back spot.

38
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,920
Watching this happen is terrifying
because I have absolutely no control.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,840
And I just have to trust
that my gut is right

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,480
and that he is going to get
both of us through this game.

41
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,320
All right.

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,040
I am sweating.

43
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,440
I am just on edge.

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,480
But I'm also feeling determined.

45
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,120
One, two, three,

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,520
go.

47
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,120
Yes!

48
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,160
Yes!

49
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,280
I'm standing by my decision to select 152.

50
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,040
He's at the very back.
I'm adamant that he's gonna get through.

51
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,920
Yes!

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,880
Go.

53
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,320
Easy! Easy.

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,720
Yes!

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,320
- Three.
- Oh!

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,400
I'm sorry. That was me.

57
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,240
<i>Player 069, eliminated.</i>

58
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,720
<i>Player 167, eliminated.</i>

59
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,840
It's so brutal, man,
but that's another ball.

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,360
<i>There are 12 balls remaining.</i>

61
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,160
<i>Player 145, please select your catcher.</i>

62
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,640
233.

63
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,120
All right, y'all. It is getting real.

64
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,080
Four.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,040
Oh!

66
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,320
- Oh, shit!
- Shit!

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,000
By positioning myself last,
I thought that I devised a plan

68
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,640
that would ensure
that every ball gets dropped

69
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,000
before the end of the line.

70
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,120
But it's making me a little bit nervous

71
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,240
because everybody is clearing
their passes and their catches.

72
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,600
Yes!

73
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,400
I'm thinking, "Okay,
this might eventually get back to me."

74
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,120
Oh!

75
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,000
You see?

76
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,040
That's why you shouldn't throw this way.

77
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,120
It's two people per ball who get out.

78
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,440
As I'm seeing people drop the ball,
I'm starting to get kind of worried.

79
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,240
<i>There are nine balls remaining.</i>

80
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,440
Oh!

81
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,120
<i>There are eight balls remaining.</i>

82
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,840
We're really deep into the game,
and it is too close to me.

83
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,400
<i>There are seven balls remaining.</i>

84
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,480
<i>Six balls remaining.</i>

85
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,640
<i>Players 058 and 165, eliminated.</i>

86
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,000
<i>There are now five balls remaining.</i>

87
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,440
Oh, boy. I'm stressed, man.

88
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,560
I'm feeling things I've never felt before.

89
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,720
It is getting awfully close to 152, man.

90
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,520
Your gut told you
to pick Viper for a reason.

91
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Viper is a beast. He's got this.

92
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,720
How do you feel?

93
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,200
You don't want it?

94
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,440
I'm looking around,

95
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,760
and most of the people
who are at the end of their line

96
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,200
are not great athletes,
and they don't look very confident.

97
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,440
I don't trust 390.

98
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,840
- You want me to go with you?
- I trust you to throw it to me.

99
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,080
You have a good hand.

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,080
- Yeah. I play sports.
- All right, yeah.

101
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,880
- Keep it to me.
- I'm just gonna throw it up.

102
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,640
- Yeah, we got this.
- Yeah, we do.

103
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,040
You got it. Throw it up. You got it.

104
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,200
<i>Player 294,</i>
<i>please make your way to the center.</i>

105
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,880
Player 152.

106
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,320
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

107
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,320
- Oh, my God.
- He's going for it.

108
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,160
- Viper! That means you gotta--
- It's good. It's good.

109
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,440
Viper, man.

110
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,240
He's gonna catch it. I know it.
I see it in my mind. He's gonna catch it.

111
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,400
Look at the distance of this.

112
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,160
One,

113
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,400
two,

114
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
three.

115
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,280
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

116
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,760
Yes! Yes.

117
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,560
Way to go, boy. Way to catch, boy.
That's what I'm talking about.

118
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,920
Oh, my days, bruv!

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,280
One down, one to go. One down, one to go.

120
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,680
You already know, you already know.
You already know, you already know.

121
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,240
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

122
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,400
- Who do you think he's gonna throw it to?
- 390.

123
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,320
He's gotta go 390, man.

124
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,160
Dalton, stay strong, bro.

125
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,560
I'm not even gonna attempt it.

126
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,920
If they wanna go out,
I'mma try to save the rest of my team.

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,640
We've lost a few people already,
so I've just decided we're not gonna take

128
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
another throw over here. So…

129
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,040
Let's just try
to put a stone wall right here.

130
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,080
- We're almost there.
- Yeah, no. I got you.

131
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,720
- Those other teams are far away.
- I got you. I'm protecting y'all.

132
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,120
Tap in right now.

133
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,560
We're both going out.

134
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,800
I'm protecting my team.

135
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,240
I suggest another team.
We're going out for four million.

136
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,640
That looks silly.

137
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,920
I won't even look.

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,960
- That's how serious I am.
- Why you not turning your back?

139
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,120
I'm protecting my team.
We're going out like that.

140
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,360
Like y'all protected yours.

141
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,320
We're going out like that.
That's how it is.

142
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,680
Protecting your team? They're ridiculous.

143
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,680
- You can still pick him.
- It's your decision.

144
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,000
- What about her? Ask her.
- Yes? No?

145
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,160
No. Do I look like I catch balls?

146
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,280
Oh, my God.

147
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,040
None of us can catch it.
That's why we're in the back.

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,440
No, I'm sick. I have a fever.

149
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,920
- Fuck!
- It's the closest one.

150
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,720
I promise that I'm--
I'm not turning around. It doesn't matter.

151
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,240
They're all saying no.

152
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,240
- He has to choose.
- Hey, guys. Come on.

153
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,840
Someone's gotta take it. Come on.

154
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,040
- I'm the furthest.
- I just can't catch it.

155
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,160
He can make his decision.

156
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,080
- I'm not turning.
- I'm the furthest one.

157
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,320
If he wants to go out like this, throw it,
but I'm not turning around.

158
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,800
That's so cowardly. Play the game!

159
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,920
I don't care what you say.
You protected your team. I'm doing mine.

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,320
- This guy is nuts, man.
- He's not gonna catch it.

161
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,960
Why would you wanna stop it early?
Give yourself and your team a chance.

162
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,160
Play the game!

163
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,640
When I was a kid, all I wanted to do

164
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,600
was grow up and be a rock star.

165
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,800
You know, Viper isn't the name
that I was born with,

166
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,280
but it's the person who I-- I…

167
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,360
most genuinely am.

168
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,600
I-- I've grown up
in a very, sort of, structured household

169
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,760
where I wasn't allowed to experiment

170
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,520
or go against the grain.

171
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,120
So when I stepped out
into the world on my own,

172
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,560
I wanted to take all of the risks
and to be daring and to be a badass,

173
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,760
and Viper just permits me
to do that even more.

174
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,880
So, I-- I lean in, you know?

175
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,360
I lean into all
of the-- the rock star energy,

176
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,760
and I try to just be
as fierce and ferocious as possible.

177
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,640
Say his number.

178
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
Shhh.

179
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,320
We all showed up for a reason.

180
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
We all have a dream.

181
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,440
390, I want you to think really hard
about your dream right now.

182
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,080
This is the worst, most cowardly move
that you could make.

183
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,880
I'm not turning around. It doesn't matter.

184
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,560
I'm choosing you.

185
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,720
Okay, here we go.

186
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,320
Yeah!

187
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah, Viper! Yeah, Viper!

188
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,640
- Yeah, Viper!
- That's so badass. That's so badass.

189
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,560
Yeah.

190
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,440
It's on him.

191
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,120
I choose 390.

192
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,280
Yeah, Viper! Yeah!

193
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,960
- Please turn around, Dalton, please.
- Dalton.

194
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,600
Dalton, there's four and a half mil
on the line, man!

195
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,640
Turn around.

196
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,920
He's a coward for not trying to catch it.

197
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
- Catch the ball!
- Catch the ball, yo.

198
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,600
Are you ready to go home?

199
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,120
He out-bluffed you.

200
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,280
Yeah.

201
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,480
He's gonna catch it.

202
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,600
Oh, my God. He's gonna catch it.
Jesus Christ, dude.

203
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,280
- Go, Viper. Go on!
- Go, Viper. You got this.

204
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,040
Two.

205
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,000
Three.

206
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,720
Ah, man.

207
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,600
- That was so close.
- Good try, Viper. We love you, Viper.

208
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,760
Ridiculous.

209
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,600
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,080
It's all right, man.

211
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,040
- I'm sorry.
- I know, man.

212
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,040
Ah!

213
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,400
My dreams have been shattered.

214
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,040
Don't smile.

215
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,000
Shut up. I was trying to help my team.
Y'all helped y'all's team. Shut up.

216
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,520
He didn't even try or believe in himself.

217
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,840
I wanted it so bad.

218
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,560
<i>Player 390 and player 152, eliminated.</i>

219
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,280
<i>Player 118,</i>

220
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,600
<i>eliminated.</i>

221
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
<i>There are four balls remaining.</i>

222
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,040
229, I'm looking at you.

223
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,440
That's on you.

224
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,440
Catch it!

225
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,280
- I told you I couldn-- Ow, Jesus!
- Ah!

226
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,960
Three balls left. Three balls left.

227
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,920
Anxiety starts to build.

228
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,320
Are they gonna run out of balls
before they get to Zoe?

229
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,680
Four. Oh!

230
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,760
No.

231
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,000
<i>Attention, players.</i>
<i>This is your final ball.</i>

232
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,400
One ball left.

233
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,440
It's coming to you.
It's the shortest throw.

234
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,920
- So it's coming to you.
- Okay, cool.

235
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,120
One.

236
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,160
Two.

237
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
Three.

238
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,960
<i>Attention, players.</i>

239
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,240
<i>Sixteen balls have been dropped.</i>
<i>Therefore, the game is over.</i>

240
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,360
Way to go, Zoe.

241
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,840
<i>All remaining players have passed.</i>

242
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,120
- We got it.
- Yeah.

243
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,120
Damn.

244
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,640
All right, did we do
the right strategy? I told you.

245
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,600
I told you.

246
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,800
Did I tell you-- I tell you
we did the right strategy? I told you.

247
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,720
You did it.

248
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,000
You did a good pick. Good pick.

249
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,760
That was stressful. Good job.

250
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,080
Yoo-hoo!

251
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,000
We're back. Third one, done.

252
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,720
- Yes, sir. Jeez.
- Come on, man.

253
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,360
How are we still here?

254
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,080
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

255
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,120
- Hello!
- Hey.

256
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,800
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

257
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,040
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Oh?

258
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,560
No!

259
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Jonti's gone.

260
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,840
Let's find a place and sit down,
and I'll explain everything.

261
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,600
- What?
- Jonti's out.

262
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,720
Hey, all right.

263
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,840
So, we had to stake our life on one of you
to make it through the game.

264
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,080
To survive. Okay?

265
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,920
So, I picked 437 as my representative.

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,440
So thank you for keeping me safe.

267
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,840
I decided to go with, uh, 383.

268
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,480
Oh, my God!

269
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,480
Jonti's not here with us.

270
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,720
- He picked 152, Viper.
- Viper.

271
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,840
He picked Viper.

272
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,560
What are the chances Jonti chose
the most dramatic death out of everyone?

273
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm sure you got some good insight.

274
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,040
Yeah, we saw so many people break
so many other people's trust.

275
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,280
A lot of people were
kind of upset that some

276
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,480
of the younger athletic, like, guys
forced their way up front

277
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,600
for the easy shots.
They should've been in the middle.

278
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,360
We thought drama was gonna go down

279
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,560
when one of the twins
almost didn't go with the blue team.

280
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,480
Yeah.

281
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,360
People really didn't like
that me and him were at the top.

282
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,360
- I can just-- I can read people well.
- Oh, you can taste-- You can sense it?

283
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,080
- Yeah, I can read people well.
- Sense it.

284
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,960
They're cool dudes,
but they're just real fake.

285
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,480
They're playing the game hard.

286
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,360
What really set me off was the beginning.

287
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,800
He said, "My brother saved everybody.
He deserves to be first."

288
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,000
- I said, "What?"
- No, he doesn't.

289
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,320
I said, "No, the 60-year-old lady
on our team deserves to be first."

290
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,760
They're strong competitors,
and if we wanna play to win,

291
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,440
I think we play to get them out.

292
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,400
I agree, 100%.

293
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,720
432 and 431 took spots two and three.

294
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,440
That tells me everything
I need to know right there

295
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,560
about the twins.

296
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,640
So what made you decide
to finally turn around?

297
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,360
'Cause I just, like-- I was--
When you get put on the spot,

298
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,200
and, like, you're panicking
and you're overthinking about stuff,

299
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,200
I didn't have trust
in you catching it at first.

300
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,280
We don't know each other.
I mean, I understand that.

301
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,760
But you remember,
your loss is my loss, right?

302
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,960
Because at that moment,
we're in it together. You know?

303
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,960
- Of course.
- And, uh…

304
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,720
And I hope that something in my voice
made you feel confident again,

305
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,760
and I think it did.

306
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,640
It did, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I appreciate that.

307
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,000
Him and his brother have a game plan,
and they have a strategy.

308
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,560
They've been making friends,
building relationships.

309
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,760
They come off funny, cute,
but I already know,

310
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,520
I can't trust these players.
They got targets on their back now.

311
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,280
They showed their true colors
and they have something to worry about.

312
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,440
See youse later.

313
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,840
- Ciao.
- See you in a bit, man.

314
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,240
<i>Okay.</i>

315
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,520
<i>We were so, like, curious</i>
<i>what you guys were doing.</i>

316
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,160
<i>We were watching the whole thing.</i>

317
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,080
This must be the piggy.

318
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,640
Attention, all players.

319
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,480
I will now reveal
the results of the second game.

320
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,560
- Look, it's full.
- Oh, yes.

321
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,080
We see more and more numbers diminish,

322
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,080
and there's only, like, 74 of us left.

323
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,560
Good job, 74!

324
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,640
So I'm starting to get excited.
I'm starting to feel

325
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,760
like it's a real possibility
that I could win this.

326
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,280
The prize fund now stands at $3,820,000.

327
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,360
Oh. Bye, guards.

328
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,520
I hate to see you go,
but I love to watch you leave.

329
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,960
I gotta start changing up my game plan.
I'm here for the money,

330
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,120
not to build friendships,

331
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,040
and I feel like
if I could just manage to keep to myself

332
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,080
and, uh, have eyes in the back of my head,

333
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,760
I'll be the last person standing.

334
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,320
What is this?

335
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,080
Oh, no. That's a trap.

336
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,960
That's the thing
that opens up a bunch of times?

337
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,920
- You gonna open?
- No.

338
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,720
Kinda looks like me when I was a kid.

339
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,280
<i>Attention, players. Do not touch the doll</i>

340
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,280
<i>until you hear it sing.</i>

341
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,680
Yeah. I'm not gonna touch that.

342
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,440
Same here, buddy.

343
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,320
Same here.

344
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,840
That doll's just bad energy, low-key.

345
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,240
Do you reckon?
I don't think it's gonna be bad.

346
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,240
I don't like its aura.

347
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,680
Maybe there's nothing.
Except you get to the bottom,

348
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,000
it's ten coins exactly, how much you need
for the black box in the vending machine.

349
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,760
And what is the black box for again?

350
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,680
I think it says
ten coins for one elimination.

351
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,920
Oh, my gosh.

352
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,160
Everyone knows something is inside.
No one knows what that something is.

353
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,720
We just know that that something could be

354
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,920
the best thing
that could happen to our games

355
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,800
or the worst thing that could happen.

356
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,320
Yeah. You gonna go for it?

357
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,440
Yeah, there's gotta be
something good there.

358
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,800
- What if it's an elimination, dude?
- A what?

359
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,680
This doll is creepy-looking, for sure.

360
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,960
And then having
that disadvantage yesterday,

361
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,360
I was just playing this game too risky,
so I'm staying away from that.

362
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,480
- Are you thinking about it?
- Yeah, I-- I would open it.

363
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,640
- It'd be kinda fun, to be fair, hey?
- I would. I would open it.

364
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,280
It might be a little bit of a risk,
but I mean,

365
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,840
I guess risks usually are kinda rewarded.

366
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,520
- 098 said he's gonna go for it?
- Yeah. He's-- He's playing.

367
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,880
He's a gamer, yeah.

368
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,120
Back home, I'm a New York fan.
Uh, New York Mets, New York Yankees.

369
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,720
But for me, I'm a New York Met fan,

370
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,280
and what that means
is that I'm an underdog.

371
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,520
Underdogs have a lot to fight for.

372
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,480
A lot more than some-- some team
like the New York Yankees,

373
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,520
who constantly win over and over again.

374
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,440
And that's what gives me fire.
That's where the fierce comes.

375
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,640
That's where the passion sets in.
And that's the type of person I am.

376
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,080
That made me develop
the career I have today.

377
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,560
Saving people.
Taking bad people off the streets.

378
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,400
Um, putting the fear to the side.
That's what it's all about, you know?

379
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,200
Not everybody has that drive,
but I'm driven by it.

380
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,920
And, um, I don't give up easily.
Uh, I fight to win.

381
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,200
That cop from New York…

382
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,920
What about him?

383
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,880
I-- I think that he's a big threat.

384
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,640
I think that he has
a really big, loud, scary, like, accent.

385
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,360
You can't let that scare you at all.

386
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,400
- No.
- But if you're feeling that way…

387
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,440
If you're noticing that, you're probably
not the only person noticing it.

388
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,760
No, you're not.

389
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,280
- You thinking about it?
- I was, maybe.

390
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,120
I'd start it off
if we need someone to start.

391
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,680
Okay. Yeah, go-- Yeah, that's cool.

392
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
<i>Green light, red light</i>

393
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,560
Oh, there it is.

394
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,000
You wanna do it or me?

395
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,240
Who's gonna do it first?

396
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,280
- Oh!
- Austin got it!

397
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,120
- Gotta be good, right?
- First one's gotta be good.

398
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,400
- Unbelievable.
- What does it say?

399
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,800
- Oh!
- Disadvantage.

400
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,680
Disadvantage in the next game.

401
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,760
You've made it past two games,
one challenge. You're feeling good.

402
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,960
That's why you take a little risk.
You know, you get overconfident.

403
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,240
And yeah, kind of backfired.

404
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,720
You should get rewarded for taking a risk.

405
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,640
<i>Attention, players.</i>

406
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,120
<i>After taking possession of the doll,</i>

407
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,480
<i>you must select another player</i>
<i>to pass it to when it sings.</i>

408
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,280
Oh, hello.

409
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,240
I don't know if I can give
this thing to someone.

410
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,560
I know I have to, but I don't know
if anyone wants it. I'mma be the bad guy.

411
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,840
Anybody interested?
Just testing the waters.

412
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,600
I've already got a disadvantage.

413
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,400
And now pick a player to say,
"Hey, this is yours,"

414
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,840
that puts a target on me.

415
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,000
Anybody interested or no?

416
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,120
Listen, if you gave it to me,
it'd be no hard feelings

417
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,600
if you really can't find somebody,
but I'm not asking for it.

418
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,720
- All right.
- Hey, you're a good dude, though.

419
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,680
Good dude who's gonna be out tomorrow.

420
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,120
And I'm so pissed I got this thing.

421
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,120
It… It's a big risk, big reward.
But do you really wanna risk it?

422
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,320
The one dude that scares me to get it,
though, is the bald guy.

423
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
- Yeah.
- I seen him.

424
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,760
You know, his whole demeanor.
He's a cop, bro.

425
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,560
- Really? Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.

426
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,960
<i>Green light, red light</i>

427
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,240
- You got the power, big bro.
- No, I don't want the power.

428
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,120
I wanna go up in someone's bed.

429
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,960
Don't go too far.

430
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,640
I'm nervous, because after this,
I could be enemy number one.

431
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,560
Does-- Is anyone mildly interested?

432
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,840
- We're all avoiding eye contact now.
- Yeah.

433
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,080
098, you still want it, big dog?

434
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,200
Um, I'm-- I'm, uh-- I think my fate
was to get it the first time,

435
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,720
so I really don't want it, you know?

436
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,920
I mean, you-- you go with your gut.
It's whoever you think.

437
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,520
Cool. Cool.

438
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,840
153, I'll take it.

439
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,160
- Okay.
- Oh, Greg!

440
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,520
- Greg.
- Wow.

441
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,880
Everybody seems concerned
that that nesting doll

442
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,200
is a grenade about to go off.

443
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,680
- All right, brother.
- Do it! Do it!

444
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,240
- Do it! Do it!
- You good?

445
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,040
- Do it!
- Open it!

446
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,400
There's a number of layers here.
They can't all be bad.

447
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,680
Make it good! Make it good!

448
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,720
- Go slow, go slow.
- Big money, no whammies.

449
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,760
- Are we ready for this?
- Here we go.

450
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,760
- All right.
- Something good, hope.

451
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,240
- Here, hold this.
- Yeah.

452
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,920
What he got?

453
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,240
"Better luck next time!"

454
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,800
Anti-climactic.

455
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,840
You now have the power, my friend.

456
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,000
Yeah.

457
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,720
I bet you're glad to get rid of it.

458
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,720
Shoulda took it. I have
to worry about someone giving that to me.

459
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,720
Good job, man. Good job.

460
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,080
Who you thinking
you're gonna give it to next?

461
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,680
Anybody who might be
interested in it, honestly.

462
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,200
- Put me on the list, man. Let's do it.
- You're on the list.

463
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,640
You're on the list. All right.

464
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,240
You gotta-- You gotta play.

465
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,080
<i>So, yeah. Put me on the list.</i>

466
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,600
<i>I feel like you're a personality.</i>

467
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,240
I try to feed off my birth sign,
which I'm a Sagittarius.

468
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,640
- Cool.
- And what are you?

469
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,760
- Aquarius.
- You're Aquarius.

470
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,200
- Wait, I'm Aquarius too.
- Are you?

471
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,880
Wait, so your birthday's coming up?

472
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,840
- Aquarius are very sensitive.
- When?

473
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,760
It's actually today.

474
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,720
But you don't have to make a big deal
about it or anything. Why don't we--

475
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,160
- Everyone!
- No!

476
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,000
- It's Eric's birthday today!
- We got a birthday!

477
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,920
One, two, three!

478
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,200
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

479
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,160
<i>Happy birthday to you </i>

480
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,360
<i>- Happy birthday, dear Eric</i>
<i>- Happy birthday, 415 </i>

481
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,600
Thank you, thank you.

482
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,120
This nesting doll, to me,
it looks less like a doll

483
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,760
and more like a ticking time bomb.

484
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,560
What monster would eliminate
someone on his own birthday?

485
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,320
- Thank you all.
- How old? How old?

486
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,000
How old? Thirty-- Oh, you don't…

487
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,320
I'm 34,
so let's just get that out of the way.

488
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,240
I know I look like I'm 12,
but I'm 34 somehow.

489
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,840
Thank you, everyone. I love you all.

490
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,800
Thanks, guys.

491
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,480
The problem is, it's not my birthday.

492
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,480
Can I say something
while I have this, uh, spotlight on me?

493
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,880
Thanks for accidentally figuring out
that it was my birthday today,

494
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,120
first of all.

495
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,480
Um, I just wanna say while I'm here,

496
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,720
like, this has been hard, actually,
for me, uh, today.

497
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
- Um…
- Hang in there, brother. Hang in there.

498
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,880
My-- My girlfriend back home,

499
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,320
we found out
that she's expecting a month ago.

500
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,040
- I'm shaking.
- You're all good, brother.

501
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,320
This baby doesn't exist.

502
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,160
I figure there's a lot of parents in here,

503
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,400
and parents seem to care
about kids for some reason,

504
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,880
so I thought maybe
if I had a kid on the way,

505
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,000
they would just feel
some sort of protective energy around me.

506
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,120
- Oh, my God.
- Wait. I'm so happy for you.

507
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,640
- Thanks, Zoe.
- Amazing. Yeah.

508
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,520
My strategy is basically
to wake up every morning,

509
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,200
lie, lie, lie some more,

510
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,600
and then when I start getting tired

511
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,960
and think maybe I've done
enough lying for the day,

512
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,560
I'm gonna keep lying more after that.

513
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,600
Happy birthday, bro.

514
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,280
You only get one shot in this game,
and if you don't do anything you can

515
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,880
to win that 4.56 million,
you're an idiot, in my mind.

516
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,080
- I'm, like, shaking right now.
- Happy birthday.

517
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,760
- I didn't know I was gonna get emotional.
- And congratulations.

518
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,120
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Oh, my gosh. That's amazing.

519
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,560
This is making me so much happier.

520
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,480
I feel like I had the best childhood
anyone could ever have.

521
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,240
Having two moms is a bit unique.

522
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,320
I was conceived
by a sperm donor, anonymously,

523
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,720
and for a while, that's all I knew.

524
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,200
But it wasn't until I was in high school

525
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,840
that I found out through this registry

526
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,360
that there's 15 or 16 other half-siblings

527
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,360
who are related to me
through this sperm donor,

528
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,080
scattered across the country.

529
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,480
So, got to know some of them.
We would meet up and hang out.

530
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,400
Every once in a while,
a few more get added to the pool.

531
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,640
Now there's 150 of us.

532
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,440
We have a group chat.

533
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,200
We talk, uh, in that. We share notes.

534
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,160
We're like, "Oh, do you have
this illness? Yeah, we all do too."

535
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,200
"Oh, watch out for this. It came up
on my genetic test." It's crazy.

536
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,840
It's this weird little community
of people related by blood

537
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,600
who were brought into this world
in a very strange way

538
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,480
that I'm very thankful exists.

539
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,320
Oh, wow!

540
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,000
It's doll time.

541
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,120
Yeah.

542
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,840
- Still interested?
- Yeah, man.

543
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,400
It's time to take a chance
and start playing the game.

544
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,880
It's yours. There you go.

545
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,760
- 410.
- All right, Isaiah.

546
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,520
- Come on! Be something good.
- Come on.

547
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,880
- Be something good.
- Be something good.

548
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,280
Treat!

549
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,400
That's good.

550
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,360
That would've been a perfect one.

551
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,720
I ain't never gambled in here yet.
That felt good.

552
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,240
Yeah, that felt good.

553
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,120
Yeah.

554
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,600
Oh, the treat. Treat, treat!

555
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,600
Is that a cake?

556
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,280
410, he gets a treat.

557
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,760
The treat! Is that a cake?

558
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,280
- Is that a cake?
- Is that cake?

559
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,840
I'm like, "What is going on here?"
I get a disadvantage.

560
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,800
Someone gets nothing.

561
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,000
Now you get a cake? Are you kidding me?

562
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,960
- Isaiah got a whole-ass cake! What!?
- Whoa.

563
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,240
That's a fat-ass cake.

564
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,320
That's what's up!

565
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,600
I wanna share it.
Just expand the kindness,

566
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,640
expand the alliance aspect.

567
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,640
If you want some,

568
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,000
I will cut a little thing
and try to give everyone some.

569
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,360
Appreciate you, brother.

570
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,680
You're welcome, guys.

571
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,360
The birthday boy gets a bigger piece.

572
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,360
- No, no. I don't even want it.
- Eat it!

573
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,920
Got you, man.

574
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,920
You can play the game this way too.
There you go.

575
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,800
Isaiah, you know
you gotta share that with me.

576
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,080
Also, it's-- Also, it's like,
giving it to everybody

577
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,880
is like making sure, like,
you're on everybody's good side too.

578
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,640
This is some sneaky work.

579
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,880
410 giving out cake?
It's a little too nice.

580
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,280
Is it game play?

581
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,400
Is it to get everyone
to think that you're nice?

582
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,360
- Thank you so much for sharing.
- You're welcome.

583
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,560
Y'all better back up. Y'all fake.

584
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,320
I'm very cautious of player 075.

585
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,760
I can feel people's energy,
and player 075 puts out negative energy,

586
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,480
and energy that I feel I can't trust.

587
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,800
I don't beef with people.

588
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,320
It's not personal.
I just don't have to like her.

589
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,840
You are the man.

590
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,960
We're all people in here.
It's just a game. You feel me?

591
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,160
- You went up, like, 19 levels with me.
- Oh, yeah.

592
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,920
I come from a divorced family,
a broken family,

593
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,520
and in that brokenness,
in the middle of that divorce,

594
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,160
comes my sense of belonging.

595
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,120
Um, I've always been hard on myself,

596
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,680
and not thinking
I was good enough for my dad.

597
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,080
I come from a basketball background.

598
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,840
If I scored ten points,
I should've scored 30.

599
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,000
A lot of that desire for attention
comes from wanting his attention,

600
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,000
and comes from wanting his approval
and wanting his thumbs-up,

601
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,440
his, "You did good with your ten points."

602
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,760
People have been saying that 098

603
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,800
was really excited
about, like, taking it to begin with,

604
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,440
so that he should have been
the one to, like, take it.

605
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
And now he's, like, retracting from it.

606
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,280
Yeah, but I don't wanna get
that dude angry at me.

607
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,240
Really?

608
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,640
That's an enemy
I don't wanna make right now.

609
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,680
Just tell me where 075 is
at every and any given point.

610
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,360
- Oh, is that what's-her-name?
- She's right-- right in front of you.

611
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,000
I'm just gonna give it to her.

612
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,360
I think you need
to be extremely apologetic

613
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,600
'cause you just put on,
like, the nice guy show.

614
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,240
You know, you need to continue that,
or else people are gonna say

615
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,600
you're a flip-flopper.

616
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,720
I wanna give it to someone

617
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,680
I'm both not close to

618
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,600
and could potentially live with them
getting eliminated from this thing.

619
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,560
Look at everyone in that circle.
Who do you think

620
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,600
is the smartest one
in that circle right now?

621
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,520
Nobody in there knows
what they're doing. Look.

622
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,120
Whizz!

623
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,800
The twins, they had to back off.
They were making it hot.

624
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,480
The only people that are speaking
are the dumb ones.

625
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,520
The smart ones are not talking.

626
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,280
The good thing is,
we're the two coolest dudes in here.

627
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,640
Yeah.

628
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
Oh, here we go.

629
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,480
- Wait, wait. Time-out.
- It's just to move the thing.

630
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,560
- Why? There's one left.
- Who got the last one?

631
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,920
There's one thing left.
Yeah, so whoever has it.

632
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,840
410?

633
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,360
What are you doing, 410?

634
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,360
Isaiah. Where you going, Big Daddy?

635
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,200
- What's up, buddy?
- Not much.

636
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
- Me?
- I have to give it to someone.

637
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,400
Why does it have to be me?
Why can't it be somebody else?

638
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,960
- What'd I do?
- You didn't do anything.

639
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,880
I'm really sorry.
I don't want to get stuck. So…

640
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,240
How do you freaking open it?

641
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,520
It'll be good.

642
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,920
If it's bad,
she's gonna just be on his bad side.

643
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,240
That's bad. He could've, like,
started a war with that.

644
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,400
But then, what choice does he have?
Nobody wanted it.

645
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,280
She is so mad.
This was not a good move, bro.

646
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,760
It'll be good. What's it say?

647
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,840
All good. Good.

648
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,000
- What is it?
- I told you.

649
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,640
What is it? What is it?

650
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
- I get ten coins.
- Yeah, I'm done.

651
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,080
I don't care what it says.

652
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,880
The ten-coin represents elimination.

653
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,000
- Ten coins. Ten coins.
- Y'all manifested it.

654
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,000
Seeing her face, I don't know
that I made the right decision.

655
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,880
I could be at risk here for elimination

656
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,400
simply due to retaliation
from handing her the doll.

657
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,040
I'm nervous.

658
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,520
Thank you.

659
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,720
Whoa. Ten coins.

660
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,600
It's ten coins.

661
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,200
Whoa.

662
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,320
I hope she likes me.

663
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,720
<i>Attention, player 075.</i>

664
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,800
<i>Please make your way to the boiler room.</i>

665
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,120
No.

666
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,200
My first language is sign language

667
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,360
because I'm a CODA. Child of Deaf Adults.

668
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,000
Um, both my parents are deaf.

669
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,480
Like, when I was younger,
I just really remember things and pictures

670
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,560
and, like, memories with no sound, really.

671
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,640
I had to overly express certain emotions
for my parents to understand me.

672
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,240
And not because those emotions
were towards them.

673
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,080
It was because of me
moving my body, signing.

674
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,960
You know, I will overly express something.

675
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,720
If I'm, like, "ew," disgusted,
I'm gonna show it.

676
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,520
If I'm really, really happy,
people are gonna see it.

677
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,160
If I'm really, really upset and angry,
people are definitely gonna see it.

678
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,480
And there's no hiding that whatsoever.

679
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,800
- Can you come with me?
- Yeah.

680
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,640
<i>You really did get me</i>
<i>in this room with you, girl.</i>

681
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,800
Yes. Because I trust you, Faith.

682
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,960
Thank you, Nat.

683
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,800
Nat, this is you.

684
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,360
This is all you, baby.

685
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,800
- Hello.
- <i>Player 075.</i>

686
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,560
<i>You have received a ten-coin.</i>

687
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,480
<i>You must use this coin</i>
<i>in the vending machine</i>

688
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,360
<i>to eliminate a player immediately.</i>

689
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,480
Can you at least help me choose
and be wise about this?

690
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,040
- Of course, of course.
- Please.

691
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,840
Get the instructions.

692
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,120
I have to think carefully.
I don't trust 410.

693
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,520
But do I pick someone I don't trust,
who's a popular player,

694
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,800
or someone who isn't friends
with a lot of people

695
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,320
and isn't going to make
other people turn on me?

696
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,280
"Key in their player number
on the vending machine's keypad."

697
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,800
Okay, give me a second.

698
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,800
The player that I'm choosing

699
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,040
is…

700
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,000
Strawberries and cream?
That sounds kind of gross.

701
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,800
<i>Attention, players.</i>

702
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,520
<i>A player has been selected</i>
<i>for elimination.</i>

703
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,360
Oh, that's no fun.

704
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,760
Did she eliminate somebody?

705
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,480
Oh, Lord. Here we go.

706
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,680
<i>Player 080, you have been eliminated.</i>

707
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
Why?

708
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,600
Ashley got voted out?

709
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,480
But she didn't do anything to anyone.

710
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,560
I don't wanna eliminate someone.
That's not the karma I need in my life.

711
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,560
People with bad energy and fakeness
gotta go. That's all I'm gonna say.

712
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,400
When people do stuff like that,
it-- it's karma,

713
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,760
but it's also--
Like, it will come back for them.

714
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
- Okay.
- Oh, there she is.

715
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,000
Don't look at her.

716
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,520
If everybody wants me to clarify anything…

717
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,480
Hold on, she gonna say something.

718
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,200
I did eliminate 080.

719
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,280
Only because

720
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,120
it was either one of you guys or me.

721
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,800
Okay? I didn't know her.

722
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,320
So me and her didn't have a connection.

723
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,240
And I see-- I see y'all having
these connections with other people,

724
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,520
and I didn't wanna break 'em up,
but I didn't…

725
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,360
My focus wasn't on her.
I didn't know her like that, so that's it.

726
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,760
- You okay, girl?
- Yeah, I'm good.

727
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,200
That was hard, girl.

728
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,560
Yeah, it was rough. It was rough, yeah.

729
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,880
303 running up to me
and trying to hug me and be nice to me

730
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,880
after doing one elimination…

731
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,600
doesn't seem right.

732
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,560
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just…

733
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,840
It's not a good feeling.

734
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
No one's mad at you.

735
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,520
<i>Green light, red light</i>

736
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,800
Oh, shit.

737
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,240
Oh, this is good.

738
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,640
Walk away now. Please, walk away.
I don't… Just walk away.

739
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,240
I know I don't like sitting up this close.

740
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,760
Yeah, should we, um…

741
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,280
- You guys wanna go up?
- Yeah, I'm gonna go up the stairs.

742
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,000
I don't know why y'all quiet.
Keep on talking.

743
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,920
Now sit down, bro.

744
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,760
Everyone's scared of her now.

745
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,360
Player 303?

746
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,360
Yeah.

747
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,160
Can you take this?

748
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,720
All right. It's pink too.

749
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,080
Amazing!

750
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,520
It says…

751
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:50,600
"Immunity to the end of the next game."

752
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,840
That's such a good one.

753
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,200
Why the hell did I give that to her?
I could've gave it to a friend.

754
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,120
But then again, we had no idea.

755
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,400
Oh, that's the doors.

756
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,840
Oh.

757
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,040
Yay!

758
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,280
Good job! Yay.

759
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,440
This immunity is a good thing.
I feel like I can take a deep breath,

760
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,600
so I'm very thankful

761
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,520
that 075 gave me the doll.

762
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,880
Yay!

763
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
The next one's probably a bad thing.

764
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,960
Or it could be the last one
and be a big one.

765
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,880
If it's the last one, it's a big one.

766
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,480
I don't think the last doll
is going to be a positive outcome.

767
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,440
My first thought was to give it to 098.

768
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,480
Anybody seen 098?

769
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,080
He's sleeping?

770
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,800
I feel like this is gonna be bad. Yeah.

771
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,840
He's so aggressive and so loud,

772
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,120
and he just triggers something in me.

773
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,880
Didn't you want this at the beginning?

774
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,720
- I don't want the doll.
- It's probably something good.

775
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,800
I don't want it, if you're asking me that.
I don't want trouble.

776
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,480
Take it, take it, take it,
take it, take it, take it.

777
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,480
I want it to be good.
I don't want you to go home.

778
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,440
- That's okay. That's okay.
- I know you wanted to play earlier.

779
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,720
- That's just-- You know?
- Okay.

780
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,960
If you're offering to me, okay. It's fine.

781
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,880
- Okay.
- Here we go. Thanks.

782
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,960
Good luck.

783
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,680
Good luck. You got this.

784
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,440
"Go to the boiler room alone."

785
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,880
Ooh! I don't like this.

786
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,560
The last time
someone went to the boiler room,

787
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,880
they got to eliminate someone.

788
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,840
I don't wanna eliminate anybody.

789
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,840
I don't know how my name got involved
with this one, but whatever.

790
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,880
Thank you.

791
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,040
Hey, Matthew. We like Twizzlers.
Just bring back some Twizzlers, bud.

792
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,720
I'm here to win.
And in order for me to win,

793
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
I'm gonna have to do what I have to do.

794
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,320
Somebody's getting eliminated.

795
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,320
I don't think I've had
enough conversations with him to…

796
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,280
But he could be like,

797
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,720
"Yo, there's only room for one bald guy
in here," kind of thing, you know?

798
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,040
Oh, God!

799
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,240
Hello.

800
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,960
<i>Player 098</i>…

801
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,400
<i>…you must now choose a player</i>
<i>to put at risk of elimination.</i>

802
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,320
Yes.

803
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,160
<i>The dormitory will then vote</i>
<i>whether to eliminate them</i>

804
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,760
<i>or you.</i>

805
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,840
Or-- Or me?

806
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,040
<i>Shit!</i>
