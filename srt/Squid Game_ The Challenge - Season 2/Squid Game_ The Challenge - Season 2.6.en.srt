1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,000
<i>The first player</i>
<i>to place their number patch</i>

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,800
<i>in the black box will sacrifice themselves</i>

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,080
<i>and eliminate all three players</i>
<i>in the other room.</i>

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,240
Oh, my God, bro.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,400
<i>Your race to survive starts now.</i>

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,520
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,680
So no matter what,
one team is gonna completely go?

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,520
- Only two people are coming back?
- Yes. Yes.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,800
I can't do it. I can't let my son down.
I came here for him.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,560
I came here for my mom.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,560
I don't wanna go.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,200
We have a couple seconds.
If someone sacrifices themselves,

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,800
we're gonna end up dying.

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,280
<i>And I'd rather see them go than us.</i>

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,360
Hurry up! Hurry up!

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,640
<i>How about this? We all put</i>
<i>a one and two behind our backs?</i>

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,360
Whoever has the different number
than the other two, that man's out.

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,480
Do we do Rock, Paper, Scissors?

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,760
I don't think you can do it
with three people.

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,840
You and me. Let's go.

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
- Just me and you?
- Yeah.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,360
- Literally save her?
- Yeah.

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,240
You suggested it. You want it?

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,280
<i>Two out of three?</i>

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,760
<i>Two out of three.</i>

26
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,000
No!

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,480
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh, my God!

28
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,760
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,120
We're gonna see who comes in.

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,280
In here,
there's nowhere to hide how you feel.

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,440
And emotions are even higher

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,920
because you connect
with people really fast.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,520
I hear all their stories,

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,640
and seeing them leave every single time
is just heart-wrenching to me.

35
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,960
Are you guys ready to do this?
Okay, are we clear of any mirrors?

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,440
Everybody happy with our location?

37
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,480
- Let's do it.
- On shoot?

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,960
- On shoot. Okay.
- All right.

39
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,440
We should just do one,
man, just to be quick.

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,720
- No, I don't wanna do one.
- Okay, so two out of three.

41
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,040
- First one to lose twice?
- First one to lose twice.

42
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,760
- Ready?
- One, two, three.

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,360
- Boom.
- Okay, let's go again.

44
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,400
Let's go.

45
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,080
Rock, Paper, Scissors, shoot.

46
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,560
- One, two, three
- Boom.

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,240
Rock, Paper, Scissors, shoot.

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,680
One, two, three. Boom.

49
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,200
- You.
- Okay, I've lost once.

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
Rock, Paper, Scissors, shoot.

51
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,600
One, two, three. Boom.

52
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,120
You've lost once.

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,000
Rock, Paper, Scissors, shoot.

54
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,080
One, two, three. Boom.

55
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,880
You. Hurry up.

56
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,320
Rock, Paper, Scissors, shoot.

57
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,960
Okay, I've gotta save you guys.

58
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,160
I love you, bro.

59
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,440
- We love you, man. We love you.
- Yeah.

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,760
I love you.

61
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,440
And we appreciate you so much.

62
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,320
Hurry up.

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,960
I'm done.

64
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,440
What?

65
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,600
<i>Players 417, 437, and 098…</i>

66
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,000
<i>eliminated.</i>

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,560
It's tough to process.

68
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,680
It's been tough
being away from my family for so long.

69
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
And the longer I stayed here,

70
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,720
the more I realized

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,320
that my $4.56 million was already at home.

72
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,040
Thank you. Thank you.

73
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,640
<i>Player 230…</i>

74
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,880
<i>eliminated.</i>

75
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,040
<i>Players 327 and 410,</i>

76
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,560
<i>you must now choose a new monitor</i>

77
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,040
<i>who will face a test of character.</i>

78
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,280
<i>They must use this ten-coin</i>
<i>to eliminate a fellow player.</i>

79
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,640
This is a good thing. It won't be us.

80
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,840
I'm not trying to be insensitive,
but it's just a fact.

81
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,000
Yo!

82
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,240
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, bro.

83
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
Good job, you guys.

84
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,320
Oh, my God. Kate, that was so scary.

85
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,440
That was so noble.
I'm so glad you're back.

86
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,720
- Oh, man.
- Respect. Respect.

87
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,240
- Legendary, kid.
- She mentioned her child.

88
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,600
- You gotta take care of the mom.
- Yeah, you got to.

89
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,440
That's how I was raised, so<i>…</i>

90
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,480
Not surprised you did the honorable thing.
You've been solid this whole time.

91
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
- Hell, yeah.
- One more thing.

92
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,920
- More?
- There's more.

93
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,440
Oh, jeez.

94
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,360
Obviously, Max was a monitor.

95
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,320
We had to pick a new one.

96
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,440
Oh, man.

97
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,240
Here you are.

98
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,840
You are level-headed,
you are honest, and you won't crack.

99
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,560
We choose you, okay?

100
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,360
- All right, I trust you.
- I trust you.

101
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,440
Big-time.

102
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,360
Big-time.

103
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,320
That's wild.

104
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,240
Big-time, trust you.

105
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,760
My strategy
throughout this entire game so far

106
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,040
has been to lay low
and not take any risks,

107
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,640
but we're getting to the point
where you need to take some risks.

108
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,800
I don't wanna just fly by the seat
of my pants every single round.

109
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,760
I think being a monitor might actually be
something that'll be good for me.

110
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,800
- We have a bit of a situation.
- Okay.

111
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,920
Okay? So, um, they've given me a coin.

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,440
- Okay.
- It's got ten on it.

113
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,200
- But it's only for you.
- Oh!

114
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,960
We have nothing to do with it.

115
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,080
No way.

116
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,080
- So…
- Yeah.

117
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
We wanted to give it to you privately,

118
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,720
because what we don't want
is for everybody to know you've got it,

119
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,200
because then,
if you have to eliminate someone,

120
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,640
which you're gonna have to…

121
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,800
Oh, my God.

122
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,800
…everybody--
everybody knows that it's you.

123
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,120
- Yeah.
- There's your coin.

124
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,440
Oh, thank you.

125
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,080
Oh, my God, you guys.

126
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,200
I was feeling so comfortable.

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,720
How do you live with eliminating someone
this late in the game?

128
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,640
Rationalize.

129
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,160
People are feeling so close
to the money at this point. It's like…

130
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,000
It's like, do I go with someone

131
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,000
that I don't really have
a connection with,

132
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,240
or do I go with someone
who I think is a threat?

133
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,960
- Who do you feel is the person you speak--
- I can't even. I gotta sit over there.

134
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,080
- 'Cause I can't even see.
- Mm-hmm.

135
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,720
Join me, friend.

136
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,680
The person I'm the least close to
right now over there is probably Vanessa.

137
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
Mmm.

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,480
Kevin is also someone
I'm not super close with.

139
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,600
Mm-hmm.

140
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,480
Player 402, he's strong, he's smart.

141
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,720
I think that he would be able
to convince people to go a certain way.

142
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,160
So, do I go with someone
who I don't have a great relationship with

143
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,600
and make a safe move,

144
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,440
or do I go with someone
who I think is a threat?

145
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,640
- You okay?
- Yeah.

146
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,600
Hey, it's okay, bro.

147
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm just happy we're all here. I--

148
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,760
The way I see it, I'm just happy
that the last 18 people here

149
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,040
are honest individuals.

150
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,000
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

151
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,520
Oh.

152
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,200
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God. Ew.

153
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,400
- <i>Attention, players.</i>
- Oh, I'm bugging, bro.

154
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,160
<i>Here are the results of the last test.</i>

155
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,680
A one-in-18 chance, that's crazy.

156
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,760
- Wow.
- Crazy.

157
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,320
I'm here for that four and a half,
and it's just out of my reach,

158
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,240
but I can almost touch it, taste it,
and I'm in a powerful position.

159
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,480
I have the strongest bond in the room
with Steve, 183, and we got Mama Kate.

160
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,160
The Three Musketeers,
we have a lot of influence in the dorm,

161
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,440
and I'm confident that I am a favorite

162
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,360
to win the $4.5 million.

163
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,720
- Bro.
- Are you okay?

164
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,480
- No.
- I know.

165
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,040
How you feeling?

166
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,920
Not gonna lie.
Like, I am confident. I feel up there.

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,280
I feel like a contender in this.
I really do.

168
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,080
- You are.
- Like, let's get it, you know?

169
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
- You have been killing the game.
- Thank you.

170
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
And being a good person.

171
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,040
I feel like of, like, all the people here,
like, I do trust all of them,

172
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,360
but, like, Isaiah and Kevin
are the two that, like, I…

173
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,560
I mean… you know.

174
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,560
I can't really trust Isaiah.

175
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm like 8-0 in these little "contests,"
and it's starting to freak me out.

176
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,920
Just go ahead
and rub off that good old vibe.

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,200
There you go.

178
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,960
- Let me get a little bit of that.
- Have some. Have some. Yes.

179
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,880
I just feel
like Isaiah gives me very, like…

180
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,200
holier-than-thou kind of vibes.

181
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,240
You know what I mean?

182
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Yes, that's so perfect.

183
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,640
He is, like, such a hero,
and we should all be like… You know?

184
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,120
It's like,
"Man, it's just who I am," like…

185
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,720
Yeah. Yeah, right.

186
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,360
I don't-- I don't buy it at all.

187
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,840
- There's, like, an ulterior motive.
- Yeah.

188
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,400
There's a little bit of 410
in all of us, I think.

189
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,280
Just be you,
and don't let this game change you.

190
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
That's what I keep telling people.

191
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,960
I'm aware of the light that I exude,

192
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,520
and, uh, I try to wield
that power for good.

193
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,800
I am very perceptive.

194
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,120
I can smell lies.

195
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,400
I can smell a shift in energy.

196
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,120
I'm too real for fake, man.

197
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,000
So when you see these eyes, you see real.

198
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,320
So if you're fake,
you won't see these eyes.

199
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,040
They'll see you. You know what I'm saying?

200
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,120
So if you're fake
and you switch on me, I can tell.

201
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,000
You're not gonna want to look at me
'cause I can see right through you.

202
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,520
- Look, good night.
- Good night, good night.

203
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,200
- Sleep well, okay, pro?
- You too.

204
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,480
- All right, girl.
- All right, you too.

205
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,320
<i>I'm tired, man.</i>

206
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,080
<i>Attention, all players.</i>

207
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,200
<i>This is your wake-up call.</i>

208
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,760
I literally hate that music.

209
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,520
This is so messed up but, like,
I haven't thought about my friends.

210
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,840
Like, I haven't had FOMO.

211
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,480
When you get to my age, you get JOMO.

212
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,960
- JOMO?
- Yeah.

213
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,560
- What is that?
- Joy of missing out.

214
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,480
"Joy of missing--" My brother has that.

215
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,400
Yeah, I had a dream about him.

216
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,680
Aw.

217
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,040
He'll be pleased for you, remember.

218
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,680
Yeah.

219
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,080
Jeffrey and I were born
into the Mormon church.

220
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,400
Every time I tell that to people,
they're like, "What?!"

221
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,520
"There's Black people that are Mormon?"

222
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,320
Yes, we exist.

223
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,800
And, yeah, I grew up very religious.

224
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,600
I used to… You know,
I loved going to church.

225
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,600
But, you know, as I got older

226
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,040
and started reading about, you know,
the dynamics of the Mormon Church,

227
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,880
I-- I realized it was just a religion
that didn't align with my values.

228
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,520
So, yeah, I-- I actually shied away
from religion for a very long time.

229
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,680
But I-- I have a relationship
with God now.

230
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,360
I know there's something there,
and for this game,

231
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,040
I'm calling to him or her or they,

232
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,280
and I'm saying,
"Please, please help me out,

233
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,160
because I'm grateful
for all you've done to get me here."

234
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,200
"Now let's finish this race."

235
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,000
Get it, baby.

236
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,800
- Exclude yourself.
- Exclude yourself?

237
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,200
If you had to pick,
who do you think would win?

238
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,880
Isaiah.

239
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,240
That's a good answer.

240
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,920
- Perla.
- Perla, I like that.

241
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,760
I think Kevin would win this.

242
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,200
- He's strong.
- I know.

243
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,880
But I don't know that I want Kevin
to win this, if I'm being honest.

244
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,680
- I don't want Kevin to win it.
- If not me, I want somebody…

245
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,080
I really would prefer it to be one of us.

246
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,640
- Yeah, absolutely.
- I would. 100%.

247
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,480
I definitely feel
this morning, uh, waking up,

248
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,400
that I have
a-- a greater sense of purpose.

249
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,720
I want to win, and we're getting down
to the nitty-gritty.

250
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,960
I'm sorry,
but I'm going to come out on top.

251
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,960
I'm a competitor.

252
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,360
I don't fold. I don't--

253
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,040
I don't cave to let somebody else
get what they want

254
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,320
at the expense of me
getting what I feel I deserve.

255
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,960
So the time for sparing
has come to an end.

256
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,640
There's only 18 of us,

257
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,960
and there can only be one.

258
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,360
Hey, morning.

259
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,920
- How are you?
- I'm good.

260
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,880
Can I say something?
So, just 'cause I don't…

261
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,440
I wanna get things out. You know?

262
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,680
I wanna get out how I'm feeling.
I don't wanna, like, sit on things.

263
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,200
The days of me looking out are over.

264
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,360
It's not a backstab.

265
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm gonna give you a sword,
and I'm gonna stab you in the front.

266
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,680
And you're gonna try to stab me too,

267
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,840
'cause that's the only way
this is gonna be fair.

268
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,680
So I'm not a backstabber,

269
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,000
but I can't--

270
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,640
I can't keep saving and saving.

271
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,680
I can't do it anymore.

272
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,480
I'm just saying, on my side,

273
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,560
we're-- we're all homies,
but we're all acquaintances in this.

274
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,840
So that's where I'm at.

275
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,600
Isaiah is telling me
that it's every man for himself,

276
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,000
and I'm starting to realize
that he's right.

277
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,120
I shouldn't just make
a safe move right now.

278
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,800
I'm thinking strategically,
and I think I need to make the smart move.

279
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,520
- Come with me to the boiler room?
- Yeah.

280
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,360
- Okay, let's go.
- Oh, my God, I'm scared.

281
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,760
Can you promise that you won't
say anything to anyone else?

282
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,240
I have to choose someone to be eliminated.

283
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,080
- Oh, you <i>have </i>to?
- I have to.

284
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,160
My heart hasn't raced
in a few days, but it's racing.

285
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,600
I'm going through my head,
wondering if this is the right choice,

286
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,240
but I think I'm definitely more strategic
than I come across.

287
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,880
I think people think I'm a nice person,

288
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,800
and they don't think
that I'm playing strategically at all,

289
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,120
but I am.

290
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,120
I should take out a person who's a threat.

291
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,920
Those types of people
in this game, I think, are a threat.

292
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,200
No one is gonna be super mad.

293
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,360
They're too strong of a player
to not eliminate at this point.

294
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,800
And who knows
when we would have another chance

295
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,600
to send a player like that home?

296
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,400
Okay, all right. I feel good about it.

297
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,480
All right.

298
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,160
I'm shaking.

299
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,080
It's okay.

300
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,320
"To eliminate a player,
key in their player number

301
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,080
on the vending machine's keypad."

302
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,040
<i>Oh, God.</i>

303
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,600
<i>Attention, players.</i>

304
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,040
Oh, man.

305
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,120
<i>A player</i>

306
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,640
<i>has been eliminated.</i>

307
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,160
Oh, jeez.

308
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,400
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wait. What?

309
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,600
When?

310
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,440
Who got to pick?

311
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,400
- It's me.
- Nah, bro.

312
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,320
Oh, my God.

313
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,520
<i>Player 410, eliminated.</i>

314
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,280
- What?
- Why?

315
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,400
How?

316
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,760
- Dude.
- Dude.

317
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,160
- Isaiah, I'm sor--
- Holy…

318
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,280
I'm sorry, bro.

319
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,400
That was a snake move, player 409.

320
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,760
You're a coward.

321
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,120
You know I'm a threat,
and that's why you eliminated me,

322
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,360
so well played.

323
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,040
- Bye, Isaiah.
- Bye, Isaiah.

324
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,920
Hey, guys.

325
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,160
I don't wanna be sneaky.
I don't wanna be a snake.

326
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,920
This was 100% my choice.

327
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,280
When we got given the badge,

328
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,720
we also got given a coin
that she had to have.

329
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,520
- And we had to give her the coin.
- And it had to be my decision.

330
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,760
Yeah.

331
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,680
He was not on my radar until this morning.

332
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,320
He came up to me, and he said,

333
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
"Look, I just wanted to let you know
I'm done playing the social game."

334
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,200
"It is every man for themselves in here,
and I do not care about anyone."

335
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,080
"I do not have anyone's back anymore."

336
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,960
Oh, wow.

337
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,400
I think that's sketchy,
and, like, anyone who has zero empathy

338
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,240
and zero emotion and can just send
someone home like it's nothing,

339
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,920
I just feel like that's someone dangerous

340
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,480
and that's someone who's a threat
and can go far in this game,

341
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,240
and that's the only reason
he was a threat.

342
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,520
- You meant well.
- Yeah. Makes sense.

343
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,040
- Well done.
- Wow.

344
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,560
He was way too nice. He was--
I didn't buy the niceness.

345
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,680
But you see, bro, when you move funny,
shit comes for you. I'm sorry.

346
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,520
Oh, God, what else?

347
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,840
Please don't pick me.

348
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,040
I want nothing to do with this.

349
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,320
Attention, players.

350
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,360
The next game will begin shortly.

351
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,000
- Wow.
- There we go. There we go.

352
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,920
Let's go.

353
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,600
Please follow the staff.

354
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,280
Jesus, I didn't think
we were playing this soon.

355
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,480
It really feels like everybody can taste
the money at this point.

356
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,800
And everyone is freaking out
because this is winner-take-all.

357
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,080
There's no second. There's no third place.
You've come all this way to get zero,

358
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,840
unless you win,
and everybody's feeling that.

359
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,880
Oh, my gosh.

360
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,120
What even is this?

361
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,160
<i>Attention, monitors.</i>

362
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,960
<i>Please stand by the yellow doors.</i>

363
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,520
<i>All other players line up</i>
<i>facing the mannequins.</i>

364
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,040
Let me think, let me think, let me think.

365
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,240
One, two, three, four… sixteen.

366
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,680
There's… one less.

367
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,800
<i>Attention, players 327 and 409.</i>

368
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,280
<i>Your final duty as monitors</i>

369
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,640
<i>is to pick teams of two for the next game.</i>

370
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,560
Do you think we have
to take each other out?

371
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,560
- Do we put friends against each other?
- That's the thing. I have no idea.

372
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,920
I think just keep them with friends.

373
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,240
Yeah.

374
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,480
So we've gone with 402 and 183.

375
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,480
072 and 369.

376
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,920
- We're splitting up. Let's do that.
- Okay.

377
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,880
412 and 327.

378
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,200
302 and 361.

379
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,840
110 and 409.

380
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,080
Player 383 and player 378.

381
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,120
What's up, girl?

382
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,320
451 and 398.

383
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,000
<i>Monitors.</i>

384
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,960
<i>Please now decide which two players</i>
<i>will form the final team</i>

385
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,080
<i>and which player will be left unpicked.</i>

386
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,720
This is quite a tough decision to make,

387
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,200
and I know that you guys all understand

388
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,320
the position that-- that we're in,

389
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,160
and I know you guys do too.

390
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,640
Um, we've kind of gone a little bit
with more emotion here.

391
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,640
Um, so I have more of a connection
with this person.

392
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,200
So, we're gonna go with, um,

393
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,320
318 as the first player

394
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,400
because, um, I know you've got girls…

395
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,040
…and I have kids too, so…

396
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,920
And, um…

397
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,560
017.

398
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,880
<i>Attention, players.</i>
<i>Team selection is now complete.</i>

399
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,400
<i>Player 346.</i>

400
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,320
Go through. Please let him go through.

401
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,720
<i>You have been excluded from the pick.</i>

402
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,520
Please, please…

403
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,040
<i>But now you can select a player</i>

404
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,000
<i>and take their place in the next game.</i>

405
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,440
Oh, my God.

406
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,000
He's coming for me.

407
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,960
Oh, man.

408
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,520
<i>Player 346, please make your decision.</i>

409
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,760
Damn.

410
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,720
I think…

411
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,200
out of everybody, I'd probably choose…

412
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,120
Oh, God.

413
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,920
398, Trinity.

414
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,040
Not because I don't think you're cool.

415
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,760
You're a cool dude. I just think we've had
maybe the least amount of chats.

416
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,200
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, I don't know, I…

417
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,920
It's okay. I-- I understand, yeah.

418
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,000
<i>Player 398 and player 346,</i>

419
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,920
<i>please swap places.</i>

420
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,600
- It's okay, you don't know what it is.
- Yeah, we're good.

421
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,960
- Here.
- Sorry, man.

422
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
Oh, you're chillin'.

423
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,880
You're chillin'. You're chillin'.

424
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,800
I thought I was going. I was ready.

425
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,000
It's okay.

426
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Thank you, Jesus, for this opportunity.

427
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,640
Thank you for this opportunity, God.

428
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,800
I don't take it for granted.
Thank you for the people I've met, Jesus.

429
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,600
<i>Attention, all selected players.</i>

430
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,200
Just do it.

431
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,680
Come on.

432
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,680
<i>Please follow the staff to the game hall.</i>

433
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,840
What? Come on.

434
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,240
Jesus, win or lose, I'll still trust you.

435
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,960
You're good.

436
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,080
Oh, my gosh.

437
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,640
Wow. What the…

438
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,200
Wow!

439
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,720
- Oh, my God.
- Dude!

440
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Oh, my God.

441
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,640
Oh, shoot.

442
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,120
Looks like there's slides.

443
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,800
Slides and Ladders?

444
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, God.

445
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,880
I wonder what
those question marks over there are.

446
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,920
I know.

447
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,160
<i>Attention, players.</i>

448
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,800
<i>Welcome to your fifth game.</i>

449
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,360
Oh, fifth game.

450
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,000
<i>Slides and Ladders.</i>

451
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,160
<i>Teams of two will take turns</i>

452
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,880
<i>as they attempt to make it</i>
<i>to the final square</i>

453
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,080
<i>and pass the game.</i>

454
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,320
<i>If a team lands on a question mark,</i>

455
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,400
<i>they must pull a twist card</i>
<i>and follow the instructions given.</i>

456
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,920
- What?
- Oh, my God.

457
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,200
<i>Ladders take you further up the board.</i>

458
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,440
<i>Slides take you down the board.</i>

459
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,760
<i>Or result in your elimination.</i>

460
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,120
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, jeez!

461
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,240
Oh, you gotta choose the slide.

462
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,240
One of them is elimination.
One brings you back to the bottom.

463
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,040
- Either way, it's bad.
- Either way.

464
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,080
Of course there's a twist.

465
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,160
<i>The first six teams</i>
<i>to reach the final square</i>

466
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,160
<i>will pass the game.</i>

467
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,640
<i>When the sixth team has passed the game,</i>

468
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,800
<i>any players remaining on the board</i>
<i>will be eliminated.</i>

469
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,720
Okay. First six to get there wins.

470
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,160
<i>Red team will roll the dice first.</i>

471
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,080
I realize the massive disadvantage
we've been given.

472
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,080
Because the players
that advance through the board quickest

473
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,520
will reveal which slides go where.
And we're going first.

474
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,640
<i>With that, let the game begin.</i>

475
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,800
Let's play.

476
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,680
If it's meant to be,
it's meant to be, right?

477
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm feeling lucky today, though.

478
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,320
- Have fun.
- Good luck, everybody.

479
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,120
I'm a little uneasy,
but I'm still confident

480
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,600
my luck isn't gonna run out.

481
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,960
Let's go, baby.

482
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,160
Come on, boy.

483
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,440
I'm with my best bud, Steve, player 183.

484
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,800
Being with him makes me confident.

485
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,760
<i>Stevie, sixes. Stevie, sixes.</i>

486
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,120
- Four.
- All right. Here we go.

487
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,040
One.

488
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Two.

489
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,240
It's a strong four.

490
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,360
Right now, I'm feeling stressed.

491
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,280
My life in this game
revolves around a dice.

492
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,320
- Wow!
- Honestly?

493
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,680
<i>Attention, players.</i>
<i>As you have rolled a six,</i>

494
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,040
<i>you may roll again.</i>

495
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,160
Ladies first.

496
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,840
Stay hot, baby. Stay hot.

497
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,640
- Jeez!
- Oh!

498
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,160
Oh, a six again.

499
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,920
The girls came out hot,
but it's an advantage

500
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,440
because now they're ahead of us.

501
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,640
They will reveal the elimination slides.

502
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,800
Three.

503
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,360
Four.

504
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,800
- Oh, they're going here.
- Yeah.

505
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,000
Damn.

506
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,840
Oh.

507
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,560
They have to pick a card, don't they?

508
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,520
Okay.

509
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,720
"Send a team to the next unused slide."

510
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,800
"They must take a slide each."

511
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,400
Oh, my God.

512
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,720
They really took
a lot of the fun out of the game.

513
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,440
That's a terrible card.

514
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,680
This is where friends and bonds matter.

515
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,720
You'll think you're safe with somebody,
and you may not be.

516
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,280
The wrong person can bring you down.

517
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,320
I don't know.

518
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,760
It has to be someone we're not close to.

519
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,880
Should it be them?

520
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,240
I feel really awful at this moment.

521
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,600
Player 402,
he's a New Yorker just like me.

522
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,000
But at the same time,
I am thinking about my other friends.

523
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,760
- Please don't choose us.
- She's not gonna pick us.

524
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,440
She not gonna pick us.

525
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,880
Do you think them?

526
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Aqua.

527
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,880
Aqua?

528
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,960
I don't know, 'cause I love Drake.

529
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,440
Okay, I love Drake. Do you wanna do Red?

530
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
I'm least close with them.

531
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,440
Okay.

532
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,280
They're not gonna pick us.

533
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,600
Okay, we've made our choice.

534
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,720
100% not picking us.

535
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,520
And we're going with the Red team.

536
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,160
Oh, my God.

537
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,360
You guys are on the board already,
so we're just sending you up.

538
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,960
Can your mind be changed?

539
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,360
Yeah, can your mind be changed?

540
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,760
There's just players on each team
that I can't do it to.

541
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,160
Every team?

542
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,280
Yeah, every team. I'm sorry.

543
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,160
So one of them's gonna leave,
and one of them's coming to the bottom.

544
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,200
Hell, bro.

545
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,680
This helps the rest of us.

546
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,480
They have to go down a different slide.

547
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,360
Yes, so you will know which slide
is the bad slide on the first chute.

548
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,960
Think we made the right choice?

549
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,560
I feel like they're gonna target us.
But everyone would.

550
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,800
Damn. After I said "ladies first"?

551
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,240
- Let's just go.
- That's crazy.

552
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,840
All right, no need to pick on us.

553
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,040
We had to pick someone.

554
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
- How do you wanna pick?
- I'll take this.

555
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,960
I just wanna take right,
if you don't care.

556
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,720
Take right. I was gonna take left anyway.

557
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,120
All right. All right.

558
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,240
As I commit to this slide,
I am confident that I'm coming out

559
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,680
on the other side still in the game.

560
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,080
- All right.
- Same time?

561
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,400
Yeah.

562
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,800
One of us is going home.

563
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,320
Honestly, I don't even know
what I want at this point.

564
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,080
- Sorry, guys.
- I'm sorry.

565
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,480
Kevin, he deserves it just as much as me.

566
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,440
This is my guy.

567
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,560
I'll see you on the other side.

568
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,800
I can't watch.

569
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,360
We had a good run.

570
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,000
Yeah, my boy, you good.

571
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,360
- Love you guys.
- See you on the other side.

572
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,080
All right, Steven.

573
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,960
<i>Player 402,</i>

574
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,240
<i>eliminated.</i>

575
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,840
Ah!

576
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,280
I don't even know if I wanted that or not.

577
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,240
I hate taking away someone's game.

578
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,280
Left is the good one.
Right is the bad one.

579
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,200
Okay.

580
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,000
That sucks. I love Kevin too.

581
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:15,960
I'm sorry.

582
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,080
Immediately, I'm thinking revenge.
If you come for me,

583
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,640
my retaliation
is gonna be to come for you.

584
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,440
Lucky, lucky, lucky.

585
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,960
Oh, six!

586
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,520
Party on two. Everybody getting two.

587
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,160
This game is all about connections.

588
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,840
Steven is giving me death stares.

589
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,080
Because when it comes to the twist cards…

590
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,640
"Send a team to square 17."

591
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,360
…you have to decide
who's going up the ladder,

592
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,000
who's going down which slide.

593
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,880
It's a ladder that goes all the way up.

594
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,400
You start to think
of all the relationships.

595
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,160
Where does everyone rank
in people's lists?

596
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,480
Um, the team we choose is Orange.

597
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,920
Oh!

598
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,280
You a fool, bro.

599
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,160
Everyone has their allies,
has their best friends,

600
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,240
but I only have me in this game,

601
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,360
so let's hope player 318
has made some connections

602
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,200
and that we can get through this.

603
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,520
- That's a long way up.
- Mm-hmm.

604
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,600
This is our destiny.
Everything we did led up to this moment.

605
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,840
Mmm?

606
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,440
I'm getting so stressed.

607
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,720
Hmm.

608
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,080
- He will come for us.
- I know.

609
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,520
I'm not gonna stop until I get
the opportunity to get revenge.

610
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,440
What'd they get? Six?

611
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,920
- Steven keeps giving us death stares.
- Oh, yeah. He is.

612
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,760
Girl!

613
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,320
One.

614
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,160
- Yes, dude!
- Yes!

615
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,160
It's a ladder.

616
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,240
Damn, they're close.

617
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,440
Man, y'all need to teach me
how to roll a die.

618
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,560
Two…

619
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,360
- Oh, they got the ladder.
- That's a card, isn't it?

620
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,840
"Advance three spaces."

621
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,040
That's the chute.

622
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,000
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God.

623
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,040
Oh, my God.

624
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,040
- You get it right the first time.
- I know.

625
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,480
You'll be--
You'll be right back up here. Hey.

626
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,880
Hey, you got this.

627
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,560
I'm gonna go first.

628
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,480
So if I don't make it,
just use the other one.

629
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
You're gonna make it.

630
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,600
Oh, my God.

631
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,920
It's okay, guys. You've had good luck.
It's gonna be good.

632
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,040
If not, it's been a good run.

633
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,360
It's been an awesome run, dude.
You're a legend.

634
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,600
Where you going, Drake?

635
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,600
I'm going first. We'll see where I go.

636
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,960
- Good man.
- That's solid.

637
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,000
- Left.
- I'mma choose left.

638
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,400
Yeah, if that's what you think,
then do it.

639
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,240
Oh, my God. They must be feeling sick.

640
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,200
You're all good.

641
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,520
Drake, I'm praying right here for you.

642
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
You're gonna make it down.

643
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,640
- Well, y'all, it's been fun.
- Good luck.

644
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,280
- We're gonna see you in a second.
- Hold my hand.

645
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,760
We'll see you in a little bit.

646
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,680
See you.

647
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,200
Goddamn.

648
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,000
<i>Player 346,</i>

649
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,240
<i>eliminated.</i>

650
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,280
<i>Oh, my…</i>

651
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,960
Oh.

652
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,600
- So 36 is right.
- Oh, man.

653
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,960
Womp, womp, womp.

654
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,240
- Oh, my God.
- That's okay.

655
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,200
I'm heartbroken.

656
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,600
Oh, bless her.

657
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,560
Whoa.

658
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,760
Love you, Mackenzie.

659
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,800
Thanks, guys.

660
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,440
I'm just all over the place.

661
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,680
It's tough.

662
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,840
But I have to move
past the emotions that I'm feeling.

663
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,240
I'm just trying to remember

664
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,000
how that amount of money
will change my life.

665
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,200
God, this sucks.

666
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,800
But I'm playing for my future family here.

667
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,520
Slide was kind of fun, though, right?

668
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,800
What's his name again?

669
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,920
- Steven.
- He's…

670
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,960
He gotta chill.

671
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,800
- So there's three unknown slides left.
- Mm-hmm.

672
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,120
- This dude scares me.
- Oh, my God, I can't.

673
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,800
What'd I say?

674
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,720
- Stuck it.
- Good job.

675
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,520
He's on a question mark? Oh, gosh.

676
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,640
Oh, yeah. I'm piecing people up.

677
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,960
Man.

678
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,840
He's gonna have it out for us.

679
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,760
Don't, dude. Please, God.

680
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,760
"Send a team to any ladder
or any unused slide."

681
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,920
Any team?

682
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,360
He's gonna pick us, bro.

683
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,960
Oh.

684
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,200
Yeah, he's rubbing his hands too.

685
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,080
Oh, my God. He grosses me out.

686
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,880
This is when he knows
to make a good deed or a bad deed.

687
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,800
Mm-hmm.

688
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,600
I'm gonna take Yellow down to 22.

689
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,800
It's one thing to play the game.
We had to choose a pair.

690
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,720
To target us
because of that is just petty.

691
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,640
Why did he do that?

692
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,520
It feels better to do Yellow.

693
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,560
Yeah? That's fair enough.
They took your teammate out.

694
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,320
- Yeah.
- That's a good choice.

695
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,720
That's what they get.

696
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,560
That's what they get.

697
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,960
I mean, it's a good play.
That way we all know which slide is which.

698
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,200
This is when karma gets somebody.

699
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,760
I hope one of them disappears.

700
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,160
You could've made a good deed
and help somebody in the end,

701
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,520
but you decided to be petty.

702
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,800
He's a poker player.

703
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,240
But if I sent someone at the end,
then I'm in a bad spot.

704
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,360
- Because only six teams can make it.
- Just saying.

705
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,640
- Just know that--
- Hey, you started this. You started this.

706
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,000
- We didn't start it. We picked--
- This is a game.

707
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,920
Okay, you picked me. I picked you.
It's not a big deal. It's fine.

708
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,400
It's not a big deal. We picked people
we had better relationships with.

709
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,160
We didn't pick you to be petty.

710
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,960
Oh, my God.

711
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,760
Only six teams make it, y'all.

712
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,680
- I know. It's a game, it's a game.
- Am I gonna put myself in a bad spot?

713
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,120
I'm not mad. She's the one that said
something to me. I just responded.

714
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,920
- I wasn't mad at y'all.
- I can't-- I can't share my thoughts?

715
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,640
- No, you came at me just now.
- Okay.

716
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,400
You been grilling us the whole time
since we picked you guys.

717
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,840
I'm just saying,
we would have never grilled you.

718
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,480
She's crashing.
She's gotta stop. She's crashing.

719
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,600
It's okay, guys.

720
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,480
The energy you gave us was dirty.

721
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,960
- What energy?
- Bro, come on.

722
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,200
- What energy?
- Fix your face.

723
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,480
I'm not gonna argue with you.

724
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,920
- Ignore it.
- Just ignore it.

725
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,440
It's okay.

726
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,600
It's okay.

727
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,760
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

728
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,080
Dirty. Like, that was dirty energy.

729
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,280
Good luck.

730
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,600
You don't mess with God, bro.

731
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,760
You don't mess with God, being petty.

732
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,520
You okay?

733
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,280
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

734
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,720
That doesn't bother me.

735
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,680
Just… What is your gut telling you?

736
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,840
I think it's left.

737
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,520
I'm happy with my choice.

738
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,120
Left feels good.

739
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,760
Damn.

740
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,680
Player 072,
she rolled two sixes, got us up a ladder.

741
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,560
Like, she's having good luck.

742
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,240
I think it's left,
but I don't wanna go first. I'm scared.

743
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,720
I can go first.

744
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,000
I trust her gut feeling.

745
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,920
I'm going left.

746
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,480
You guys got this.

747
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,400
- I love you.
- Love you.

748
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,600
We'll see you in a minute.
We'll see you down here.

749
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,120
It's a $4.5 million slide ride.

750
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,400
Love you all.

751
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,000
99% of you all.

752
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,360
You coming right back.

753
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,360
See you down there.

754
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,440
My dad, he would be telling me
to hold my head high.

755
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,400
I do think it's left,
so I'm gonna be okay.

756
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,720
Oh, my God.
