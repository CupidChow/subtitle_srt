00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,520
<i>Players.</i>

2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,800
<i>Welcome to </i>Squid Game.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,920
- We in the dorms!
- This is crazy!

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,400
Wow!

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,960
<i>Only one room will survive this test.</i>

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,280
<i>The other will be eliminated.</i>

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,080
What?

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,000
- I don't trust either of the twins.
- Oh, we gotta get rid of 'em.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,360
<i>The game you will</i>
<i>be playing is a Six-Legged Pentathlon.</i>

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,400
Guys, I'm sorry!

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,640
Oh, my God!

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,640
Yes!

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,960
Heck, yeah!

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,920
They're gonna show us your Zoe.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,480
It is my baby girl.

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,400
Go, Zoe, go!

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,760
I don't want to see her go home.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,480
I love you.

19
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,240
My girlfriend back home, we found out
that she's expecting a month ago.

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,360
This baby doesn't exist.

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,760
<i>The second game you are playing is Catch.</i>

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,400
- You got it?
- I got this.

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,520
I just needed that win.

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
And instead, I got an epic fail.

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,560
I choose 390.

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,760
Play the game!

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,440
I wanted it so bad.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
Your life's in my hands.
Let's go! Throw me the ball!

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200
Thank you.

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,600
098 is being annoying.

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Confidence!

32
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,000
That cop from New York, he's a big threat.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,160
Wow.

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,240
<i>Welcome to your third game.</i>

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,160
<i>Mingle.</i>

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This game is stressful.

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,920
Trinity!

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,440
- They need two!
- No.

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,680
Trinity, please!

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,400
Everybody's screwing everybody over.

41
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,200
She ran, she ran! I didn't push her.

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,080
Everyone's true colors are coming out.

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,880
You leave! You have to leave.

44
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,960
My family's gonna be
so disappointed in me.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Everybody, we're not playing.

46
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,720
Hold hands!

47
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,640
Guys!

48
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,960
<i>Players, the next game is Marbles.</i>

49
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,280
We walked into a trap.

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,280
<i>And that game begins…</i>

51
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,880
<i>…now.</i>

52
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,320
<i>All pairs have 20 minutes</i>
<i>to devise and play their game of Marbles.</i>

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,840
<i>The winner will pass the game.</i>

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,920
<i>The loser will be eliminated.</i>

55
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,680
- I'm glad we've made it this far together.
- So am I.

56
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,040
Love you.

57
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
I love you too.

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,080
It's hard to think
that we're gonna be saying goodbye.

59
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,800
Right?

60
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,960
Mm-hmm.

61
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,560
We do crazy things.

62
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,920
And this definitely is way up on the list.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,240
But I wouldn't do it with anyone else.

64
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,320
I've just, like…

65
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,680
taken for granted how lucky I am,

66
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,480
like, to have you as a dad.

67
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,480
Because, like, you're more than a dad.
You're one of my best friends.

68
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,200
And I don't tell you that enough, but…

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,320
You don't have to tell me.
I know it. Okay?

70
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,640
We have to play. Right?

71
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,320
So, what are you thinking?

72
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,720
I say tic-tac-toe. Best two out of three.

73
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,760
- Yeah.
- Best two out of three. Perfect.

74
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,240
But I'm not gonna let you win.

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,440
Don't. I know you. You're so competitive.

76
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,880
I just don't like losing,
especially to an old man.

77
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,720
Oh.

78
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,120
- Should we make our thing?
- Yeah.

79
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,400
Okay, you cannot lay off me.

80
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,320
- And I cannot lay off you.
- Deal.

81
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,240
This is terrible.

82
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,240
Okay. What should we do?

83
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,520
Bro, I think it's the last 20 minutes
of us together,

84
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,680
so I don't even wanna,
like, play a game with you.

85
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,080
Let's run down the time.

86
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,240
Yeah.

87
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,680
All right.

88
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,440
If I could name this game,
I'd call it Target.

89
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,320
You know, we'll make three targets,
each with a different point value.

90
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,760
All right, so we got two tens.

91
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,600
All right, so we got three, four, five.

92
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,520
- Facts. Right, brilliant, yeah.
- Beautiful. Let's do it, bro.

93
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,760
My competitive nature lies
deep within my DNA.

94
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,920
I have a heavy sports background.

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,240
I will win at all costs.

96
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,480
So as sad as I am,

97
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,080
it's time to send Daryl back to Ohio.

98
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,080
We could throw, the first to three wins.

99
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,840
Yeah, whoever has the most.

100
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,320
God damn.

101
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,680
It's okay. It's not that easy.

102
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,600
Okay, I hold one marble in my hand,

103
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,760
and then you guess,
you know, which one it is.

104
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,960
Let's see who gets more out of ten rounds.

105
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,120
Okay.

106
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,600
Tell me when you're ready.

107
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,640
Okay.

108
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,200
- All right, which one is it?
- I don't know.

109
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,080
I'm a professional poker player.

110
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,480
You gotta strategize,
you gotta read people.

111
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,400
So I'm just trying to do silly things
to maybe throw her off.

112
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,120
- Yes!
- You got it!

113
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,600
I've got this in the bag.

114
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,880
One by one, we'll throw a marble.

115
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,000
- Okay.
- How about we do closest to the step?

116
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,200
That's perfect. Yeah.

117
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,480
Sorry that, uh, we gotta play Marbles
against each other.

118
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,000
- You know, um…
- Nah, it's okay.

119
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,480
$4.56 million is nothing to sneeze about.

120
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,680
- No, man.
- And, um, I sacrificed so much to be here.

121
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,400
I worked so hard,
and, uh, this could be a life changer.

122
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,320
- You know?
- Yeah.

123
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,280
I'm feeling good about going into Marbles
and who I'm playing against.

124
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,120
I've never had
a strong relationship with him,

125
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,760
I've never built an alliance with him.

126
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
And I just think
I'm a bit more athletic than him.

127
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,680
I have good accuracy,
being a baseball player myself,

128
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,560
so I think I have
a little bit more of an edge.

129
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,560
If I win the money, there's a lot of good
I could do for my family

130
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,240
to-- to try to change
the generations to come.

131
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,360
Yeah. If I win, dude,
I wanna get a new tooth.

132
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,280
- You're missing a tooth.
- Wanna get a new tooth.

133
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,040
And then, uh, one day,
I wanna own my own Burger King.

134
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,160
Oh, wow.

135
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,360
Uh, look, I wish you the best.

136
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,120
Yeah. Whoever's closest to the step?

137
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,560
- Yeah, that's all. The step is there.
- Let's do that.

138
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,720
- Oof! That's yours, dude. Take that.
- Yeah, definitely.

139
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,760
That was crazy. Great shot.
You're stressing me out already.

140
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,280
- Just making noise.
- Close. That was close.

141
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,400
A miss is a miss.

142
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,240
Look at that!

143
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,160
Oh, my gosh.

144
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,360
Swish.

145
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,640
Oh, you're getting close.

146
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,200
There you go.

147
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,080
Oh, my gosh.

148
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,240
- All right.
- That's your ten?

149
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,440
- That's my ten.
- Okay. You can count up.

150
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,400
Okay.

151
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,160
- So, 39 and 3.
- 39…

152
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,920
- 42. All right.
- Okay.

153
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,520
I need 42 to tie you.

154
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,640
Okay.

155
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,800
Five.

156
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,480
So,

157
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,400
what would you do with the money?

158
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,200
What do you think my plan would be?

159
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,320
I don't know.

160
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,600
- Anything--
- Take care of your family?

161
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,080
Specifically?

162
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,480
Your child on the way?

163
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,160
About that…

164
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,480
Please don't kill me.

165
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,720
What?

166
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,080
I don't have a kid on the way.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,480
Oh, my gosh, Eric.

168
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,720
- Are you kidding me? You're an idiot.
- I'm sorry.

169
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,880
Why would you do that?

170
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,320
I wanted to make
as many decent connections as I could,

171
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,960
and that was a way to do it.

172
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,040
I mean, I don't really know what to say.

173
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,080
I don't know why
you wouldn't have discussed it with me.

174
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,120
It's 'cause I thought you would've thought
it was a bridge too far,

175
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,920
and it was something
I decided I wanted to do.

176
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,200
Like, I can't stop thinking
about how this is just one big game.

177
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,680
I mean, it-- it means a lot more to me.

178
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Like, I'm here for my family.

179
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,600
Like, that's the whole reason
why I came here.

180
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,440
That's, like, all I think about
ever since I started.

181
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,400
And how I can make them proud,

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,560
and what this money can do
to change their lives.

183
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,120
So I think that, like,

184
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,680
you playing with something
that means so much to me

185
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,200
is hard to hear.

186
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,000
That… I'm sorry, Melissa.

187
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,040
I feel like I didn't understand.

188
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,760
Like, when I look at you
as a person, a player,

189
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,120
I look at you as someone
who's a stone-cold killer in this game.

190
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,400
I am, and I'm very competitive.

191
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,280
But there is a level of… like, humanity

192
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,760
that you still have
to kind of, like, keep in consideration.

193
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,880
I need 43 points to win.

194
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,000
Four.

195
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,240
Five.

196
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,960
Bling blaow.

197
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,320
- I mean…
- I mean…

198
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,360
Look at that.
It don't get much better than that.

199
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
It don't. Let's count up just to be sure.

200
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,920
40, 41, 42… 46.

201
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,520
Come on, man.

202
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
Hey, that's how you play the game.

203
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,640
That was good. That's all right, brother.

204
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,440
You got a job to do.

205
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,880
You know?

206
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,800
Yeah.

207
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,640
My mind is filled with joy,
but my heart is extremely heavy.

208
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,400
But I'm very happy I won,
and I deserve to be here.

209
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,840
I'm ready to move forward.

210
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,720
<i>Player 342, eliminated.</i>

211
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,000
God, I only have one more.

212
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,200
You're so close.

213
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,800
I'm sorry.

214
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,160
I tried my best.

215
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,240
<i>Player 408, eliminated.</i>

216
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,840

217
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,520

218
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,040
<i>Player 303,</i>

219
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,280
<i>eliminated.</i>

220
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,200
Oh!

221
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,800
Wait, that was it.

222
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,720
Yep.

223
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,400
That's it.

224
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,080
It's okay.

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,160
Win it all, okay?

226
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,120
I will.

227
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,080
I'd rather be eliminated
by a close friend than by an enemy.

228
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,280
I'm surprised I've gotten this far.

229
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,160
There's no way I'll be able to sneak
under anyone's nose and win this game,

230
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,840
but I know AJ can.

231
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,080
<i>Player 021…</i>

232
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,720
<i>…eliminated.</i>

233
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,280
Okay.

234
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,760
We need to decide a game to play.

235
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,800
Yeah, we do.

236
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,480
We could do one fell swoop.

237
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,800
Rip the Band-Aid off
if you're okay with it.

238
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
All right.

239
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,720
Good versus evil?

240
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,120
I guess so.

241
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,840
- Did it go in?
- I think so.

242
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,240
Okay. I got one.

243
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,520
It don't even really feel good.

244
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,880
Take your time.

245
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,160
We don't need to rush anything.

246
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,080
I don't know why I agreed to this.

247
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,560
I actually suck
at throwing things in a bucket.

248
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,600
That's out.

249
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
- I won.
- You won.

250
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,760
One-nothing. Oh, I'm screwed.

251
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,360
No, you're not.

252
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,480
- All right.
- Best two out of three.

253
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,080
You go first again.

254
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,880
I put a red marble in one hand,
a blue marble in the other hand.

255
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,600
Okay.

256
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,560
- You pick a hand.
- Yeah. That's fair.

257
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,280
So if you pick the red marble,
you advance.

258
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,560
If you pick the hand with the blue marble,
I advance, and you get eliminated.

259
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,320
- All right.
- Let's let it come down to fate.

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Okay.

261
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,800
- Oh, my God.
- Congrats, Melissa.

262
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,040
Win it, please.

263
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,440
I love you.
I know you don't love me, but I love you.

264
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,240
- Okay?
- Oh, my gosh.

265
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,920
I feel relieved, honestly.

266
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,400
He has lied. He has deceived.

267
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,960
He cooked himself.

268
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,800
<i>Player 415,</i>

269
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,440
<i>eliminated.</i>

270
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,440
The last six minutes, bro.

271
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,360
Doing this together
has been a great experience. Like…

272
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,880
You don't understand
what it's like to have a little sister.

273
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,600
Like, I… Kinda, like, feels
like it's on my hands

274
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,840
to, like, take care of you, and, like…

275
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,320
Bro, I've been so proud of you

276
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,520
because, like, seeing
you go through this game,

277
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,080
you're a warrior,
and, like, I can't wait to see,

278
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,440
like, what happens next.

279
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,240
Thank you.

280
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,520
We need to--
We need to do this more often.

281
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,040
- We do. We don't do this that much.
- I'm proud of you.

282
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,160
- Yeah.
- Like, I do look up to you.

283
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,760
And you are one of my biggest heroes,

284
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,920
and I wouldn't have been able
to do this by myself.

285
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,840
Yeah.

286
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,640
I think having you here
has been a blessing

287
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,280
because I see you,
and I see Mami's face all the time.

288
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,560
Yeah. I mean, whatever happens, I'm, like…

289
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,400
- We're blessed.
- We're blessed.

290
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,480
Ooh, that was close.

291
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,320
That's in the crack.

292
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Okay.

293
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,560
- I won.
- You won.

294
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,520
Tied one-one.

295
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,880
Let's redo it.

296
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,960
Um, how much time do we have?

297
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,560
We got to get moving.

298
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,280
- Oh, you got one.
- I got one.

299
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,200
You just need one more, and you got it.

300
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,680
I mean, I only have two of yours.
I think you have a bunch of mine.

301
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,960
- Just keep going. Just finish it up.
- You're good.

302
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,680
Bro, I think you just won, man.

303
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,800
- Sorry.
- I love you, dude. Don't worry about it.

304
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,560
- It's totally okay.
- Such a nice kid.

305
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,400
Bro, you're a good guy too, man.
I think you need it more than I do.

306
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,320
- It doesn't matter.
- You have kids, bro.

307
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
- I hate to see a good guy lose.
- You're good.

308
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,000
You're just a good player, dude.
Please go all the way.

309
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,000
Just lay low.

310
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,040
Just how you were in this game,
bro, just be chill, be quiet.

311
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,720
- 'Cause you get really competitive.
- I'm sorry, bro. I'm so sorry.

312
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,680
Yo, it's okay. It's okay, bro.

313
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,520
Great game. Let me give you my marbles.
Let me collect 'em for you.

314
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,560
- It's been an honor, man.
- I'm sorry, bro.

315
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,200
No, you're fine. You're good.

316
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,400
You're gonna win, dude.

317
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,840
I'm a fighter.
I've been that way my whole life.

318
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,160
I never give up.

319
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,400
We're all in here for one reason,
and that's to win the $4.56 million.

320
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,560
Take care, bro.

321
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,280
There's only gonna be one winner,
and I want that player to be me.

Well, it's almost time.
If I don't make one…

325
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,720
Don't talk like that. It ain't over.

326
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,440

So, if you wanna shoot one…

Damn!

328
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,200
That was so close!

329
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,360

- Mm-hmm. 17-18.

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,920
It was just luck,

350
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,440
and then it ran out.

351
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Bye, Emily.

352
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,240
<i>Player 232, eliminated.</i>

353
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,880
What was that throw? Jesus.

354
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,360
I missed it. That sucks.

355
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,320
That one's out. Okay.

356
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,320
Oh, no. It doesn't count.

357
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,680
I won.

358
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,920
Yep, you won.

359
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,680
You won. You go.

360
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,200
You won.

361
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,960
You won, sweetest.

362
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,160
Okay.

363
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,480
- You didn't let me win, did you?
- No.

364
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,920
Come on.

365
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,840
Come on. Come on.
Let's put the marbles away. Come on.

366
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,880
Are you sure you didn't let me?

367
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,400
- No, I did not let you win.
- Yes, you did. You're smiling.

368
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,840
No, I did not. No.

369
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,680
Oh, my God.

370
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,480
Okay. What should we do?

371
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,120
I think this is the time
we think logically.

372
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,200
One of us is moving forward,
so I think what we should focus on

373
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,240
is… who makes more sense to stay.

374
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,160
- Mmm.
- I could give you my marbles.

375
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,440
Oh, no, I'm…

376
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,040
You're not giving me your marbles.

377
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,320
I think you should stay.

378
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,840
It should be you.

379
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,320
Bro, I just…

380
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,880
I'm just, like, if I-- if you leave,
I have to win $4 million.

381
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,680
There's nobody more capable
in this game to win than you.

382
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,400
It's just… I'm scared.

383
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,680
The only thing I'm scared
about is that, like,

384
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,480
now that the game
is getting more ruthless,

385
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,160
it's-- it's-- I know I can handle it.
I'm from New York.

386
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,920
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like, I got it. I'm from the Bronx.

387
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,160
But it's easier if I was, like, ruthless
and I could just look at you.

388
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,560
Yeah, I understand that.

389
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,160
But then, think about it like…

390
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,560
Because you're so… outgoing
and, like, you know everybody here,

391
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,280
it's harder for them
to be ruthless to you.

392
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,400
Whereas me, I'm like more reserved,
more quiet. They-- They don't care.

393
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,400
They-- They gonna take me out
in five seconds, so…

394
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,520
I think… I think you should stay.

395
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
I love you.

396
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,320
I love you too.

397
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,760
Please don't cry.

398
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,160
- Love you.
- I love you.

399
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,480
You gotta go.

400
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,000
Can I have one more hug?

401
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,480
I spent my whole life protecting her.

402
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,640
And then to eliminate her
from such an important part of this game,

403
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,000
to end that for your daughter?

404
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,360
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, honey.

405
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,240
I don't know if I could sleep at night.

406
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,480
I'm so happy we did this.

407
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,120
- Love you.
- Love you.

408
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,640
- Bye, sweetest.
- Bye.

409
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,560
Hey.

410
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,600
<i>Player 370, eliminated.</i>

411
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,480
Do your thing.

412
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,640
- I know you can win it. Go on, go on.
- No, please.

413
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Hand--- Hand it to him
before the time runs out. Go, go, go!

414
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,360
<i>Attention, players. The game is now over.</i>

415
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,080
Yo, I was kind of scared.
I was like, "We have all this time."

416
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,040
This is terrible.

417
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,880
<i>Player 283, eliminated.</i>

418
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,680
- Oh!
- It is empty in here.

419
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh, my gosh.

420
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,920
Oh, my God.

421
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,840
Oh, my God.

422
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,000
- Damn.
- Oh, my gosh.

423
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,680
- Damn.
- You guys.

424
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,320
- Oh, wow.
- This looks crazy.

425
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,760
- Good to see you, Dajah. Congrats.
- Oh, my God.

426
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
- Congrats.
- Oh, my gosh.

427
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,080
<i>- Look at the beds.</i>
- <i>I know.</i>

428
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,080
<i>- Hiya, girl.</i>
<i>- Congrats, y'all.</i>

429
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,120
The problem I think we've got
is that the two people

430
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,360
that I'm unsure about
are playing each other.

431
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,280
Who's that?

432
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,400
- So, 024 and 098.
- Okay.

433
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,920
I'd prefer 024 to come back in than 098.
It's 'cause the other one's a bit barky.

434
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,120
Right.

435
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,480
You got it, brother.

436
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,640
Crazy, bro.

437
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,080
Oh, my God, girl!

438
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,080
Oh, man.

439
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,000
- How'd it go, kids?
- It was tough.

440
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,680
- You put him down easy?
- Yeah.

441
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,880
But he's such a nice kid, Peter.
He's such a nice kid.

442
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,200
It's crazy.

443
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,560
Oh!

444
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,480
My dude!

445
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,600
Still here, baby.

446
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,720
I am over the moon,
but with only 22 players left,

447
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,920
there's no hiding.

448
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,440
So my strategy is I want
to have friends here,

449
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,560
friends in that group,
friends in that group.

450
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,400
Another hug.
I want another one, Kate. We're here.

451
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,920
Because if you play a selfish game
at this point,

452
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,040
you're gonna have
multiple targets on your back.

453
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,760
Whoa! See? See? See?

454
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,960
Oh, Zoe! I called it.

455
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,720
I mean, I'm definitely feeling, like,
pretty sad that my dad's gone.

456
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,000
Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

457
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,880
It's a little bit scary.
Now it's just me solo.

458
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,040
My dad was a super social player,

459
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,960
so now I have to be the one
to make sure I'm having conversations.

460
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,760
I'm gonna miss him a lot.

461
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,760
Perla!

462
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,400
- Hey!
- Whoa, Perla!

463
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,560
Oh, my God, this is scary.

464
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,280
I just said I wanted to see you
and your beautiful hair.

465
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,440
Aw! It's okay.

466
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,120
- Group hug. We want in on this.
- Group hug.

467
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,800
Oh, we love you.

468
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,200
Did he let you win?

469
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,880
- Did he?
- Yeah.

470
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,400
- Ah, he loves you so much.
- What a good bro.

471
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,440
Sad to, like, know
that Jeffrey's not in the dorm,

472
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,000
but our family are cheering for us

473
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,680
and praying for us and manifesting for us.

474
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,280
Don't, don't. You gonna make
me cry, girl. You gonna make me cry.

475
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,720
So, I gotta, like, focus

476
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,800
because now
this is a fight for, like, our family.

477
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,520
What are you gonna do if you win it?

478
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,000
- If I win it?
- Mm-hmm.

479
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,440
Um, after my mom passed,
it's been really hard, um, financially,

480
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,000
especially on my sisters.

481
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,280
What are you gonna do for you?

482
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,200
- For me?
- Yeah.

483
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,400
You know, I… Wha…

484
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,280
Faith, I don't know.
I really never thought about that.

485
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,000
- You should pick something for you.
- You're right.

486
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,600
After Marbles,

487
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,920
just happy that I still have
one of my closest alliances here,

488
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,480
player 361, Faith. I trust her completely.

489
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,800
So with the numbers being this small,

490
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,160
I know that it's important
to have somebody

491
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,000
that close with you still in the game.

492
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,200
The money is literally close enough,
I can taste it at this point.

493
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,080
I'm motivated. I'm not going anywhere.

494
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,880
How about you?
What are you gonna do for you?

495
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,560
If I'm being real,

496
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,600
I have lived my whole life
in fight-or-flight mode.

497
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,720
There's not a time that I can think of

498
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,120
where I wasn't worrying about money,

499
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,080
bills, abuse, something.

500
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,200
Yeah.

501
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,440
So my mom's name is Faith.

502
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,560
And growing up and to this day,

503
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,040
our family calls us
Big Faith and Little Faith.

504
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,000
My mom was a single mom to start,

505
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,800
and then she, um, did meet somebody.

506
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,080
This is around the early 2000s,
and this person happened to be a woman.

507
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,680
So I grew up in a lesbian household
in the early 2000s,

508
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,880
when people were maybe not as friendly,

509
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,560
but I also happen to be a person of color

510
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,640
in a family
that has no other people of color.

511
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,560
Um, and I've always struggled
with my weight.

512
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,880
Um, so all of that put together,
it really makes you have a thick skin

513
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,280
as you go throughout life
and experience people

514
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,160
that may have an issue
with all of those things.

515
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,680
And so as I've aged,

516
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,480
I think a strength of mine
is my ability to be empathetic,

517
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,760
to feel for my fellow human,

518
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,320
and to make decisions
based on how I would wanna be treated

519
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,720
if I was in their position.

520
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,880
- The world really isn't too kind.
- It's not.

521
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,920
And our moms-- our moms probably did
the best with what they had.

522
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,920
- I'm happy to be here with you.
- Yeah. You know it's game time, Faith.

523
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,720
- They're coming.
- They're coming.

524
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,880
Oh!

525
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,360
Oh, jeez.

526
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,320
Attention, all players.

527
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,240
Here are the results
of the previous two games.

528
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,360
Oh, my God.

529
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,080
- Damn!
- No, Dad!

530
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,440
Jeffrey!

531
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,760
Jeffrey.

532
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,560
There are now only 22 players remaining.

533
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,920
Whoo!

534
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,480
The current total stands at $4,340,000.

535
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,960
- Well done, everybody.
- Top 22, baby.

536
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,160
<i>Attention, players.</i>

537
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,120
It is time for the next test of character.

538
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,920
Three monitors
will be given authority in the dorm.

539
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,960
You must collectively choose
who they will be… now.

540
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
I'll do it.

541
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,960
I'd give it a go.

542
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,280
I want it too, though.

543
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,640
Everyone that wants it, go over there.

544
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,480
I think it's good to have a girl.

545
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,560
I'm kinda feeling
like a lone wolf out in the wilderness

546
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,040
looking for food to survive.

547
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,200
I don't know what lies ahead,
but, um, I'm putting myself forward

548
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,640
to become a monitor

549
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,280
'cause I-- I think, uh, it would be
a positive thing and work in my advantage.

550
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Let the people decide.

551
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,640
We do need a female.
We want at least one female.

552
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,200
- Kate, automatically. She's the only--
- She's automatically in.

553
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,920
No. We can't do that.
We-- We can't vote. That's not fair.

554
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,600
I wanna just do Rock, Paper, Scissors.

555
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,960
Why don't y'all three
do Rock, Paper, Scissors then?

556
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,080
- Wait, no.
- They said, "Pick."

557
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,200
I don't-- I don't think any of us
really want you in this situation,

558
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,680
so I'm gonna go…

559
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,680
- Stop, stop. You guys. Guys.
- Yeah. One at a time, maybe.

560
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,960
I say go this way, go this way,
go this way, go this way.

561
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,240
- I would say these three right here.
- I'm good with it.

562
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
We have to agree.

563
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,400
I'm not gonna let you guys
just take me out.

564
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,680
I'm not trying to take you out.

565
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,920
098, we all feel like you've been
in the boiler room, am I right?

566
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,480
I don't care what you feel
like I've been in the boiler room.

567
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,280
I'm not gonna do it if you do it.
I'm not being shouted at all day.

568
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,080
- I wanna be in it. Let's make it fairer.
- They voted three.

569
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,280
- I disagree.
- Okay.

570
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,440
But you ought to argue it out
with all of those people.

571
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,800
We have an issue, I disagree.
Just do Rock, Paper, Scissors.

572
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah, but we all don't feel
comfortable with that.

573
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,720
Okay, but it's not just your game.

574
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,520
It is. Like, we're all voting.

575
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,320
I think that 098 is worried

576
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,640
because he doesn't have
a ton of allies left.

577
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,560
I think he wants to be a monitor
because he wants to try to save himself.

578
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,400
He's just grasping for straws
at this point.

579
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,800
Hey, let's call.
Let's call, all right? 410, 327, 230.

580
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,360
Done, done, done.

581
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,000
Nah, you could always see
how it was gonna go here.

582
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,560
All right, we're set.

583
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,960
I don't know what all it entails,
being a monitor, but I am a risk-taker.

584
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,240
So I put myself forward because I feel
that it will give me a competitive edge.

585
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,800
And we are at the point
where any and all edges

586
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,600
must be taken into account.

587
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,160
Hall monitor badge.

588
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,560
It's a whole new game now.

589
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,560
Thank you.

590
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,000
There's gonna be some changes
around here. No, I'm just playing.

591
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,960
There's a new sheriff in town.

592
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,880
His name is me.

593
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,560
Being a monitor,
it feels great being in power.

594
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,360
Like, I feel like the president.

595
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,880
I mean, I'm from California,
so I'm pretty laid-back.

596
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,400
But I'm smart. I'm smart in my own way.

597
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,480
Maybe not, like, with the books and stuff,
but socially, I-- I know what's going on.

598
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,480
It feels like I'm in charge.
I'm the boss. B-O-S-S.

599
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,880
Who's already in bed right now?

600
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,280
What happened? He just went
straight to bed and wrapped up?

601
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,200
Such a baby.

602
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,800
He's such a baby.
Like, come on, dude, just chill.

603
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,720
Yeah.

604
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Dang. I kinda feel bad for him.

605
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,080
Sometimes, I'm a very impatient guy,

606
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,960
and I can get very short-tempered.

607
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,200
I was so annoyed.

608
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,680
But the best-case scenario right now
is just to continue to follow my gut.

609
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,960
And I feel like if I could just keep
to myself, I'll be all right.

610
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,680
<i>Attention, monitors.</i>

611
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,240
Oh! What is that?

612
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,160
<i>As part of your privileges,</i>

613
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,360
<i>you will receive luxury bedding.</i>

614
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,280
<i>Another player must make your bed for you.</i>

615
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,440
- Hot damn!
- Damn!

616
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,720
Living lavish in the dorm.

617
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,200
Any volunteers?
I'm not gonna make anyone do that.

618
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,200
You-- You wanna do it? Are you sure?

619
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,680
- Yeah. I do my kids' bed all the time.
- All right, thank you.

620
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,080
- I got you.
- Thanks, Dad.

621
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,680
If you wanna volunteer, do mine.

622
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,800
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

623
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,760
<i>Wow!</i>

624
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,520
It is luxurious.

625
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,400
- The red is not a good sign.
- Mm-hmm.

626
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,400
The red is not good.

627
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,240
I mean, there's definitely more to it
than meets the eye.

628
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,840
This is <i>Squid Game,</i>
so everything that happens good,

629
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,480
there has to follow
with the bad after that.

630
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,080
This could be a red flag.

631
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,480
I think they hold
a lot more power than we realize,

632
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,080
that they even realize right now.

633
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,640
Let's see this bed.

634
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,320
Fancy-schmancy.

635
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,360
- Fancy-schmancy.
- My satin sheets.

636
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,520
<i>Can I come feel your sheets?</i>

637
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,120
<i>Feel my sheets.</i>

638
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,240
Sorry.

639
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,920
Get out.

640
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,720
It's my privilege, not yours.

641
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,640
<i>Good night, legends.</i>

642
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,600
- Oh, my God.
- <i>Attention, players.</i>

643
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,640
<i>This is your wake-up call.</i>

644
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,800
Last night was my best night's sleep.

645
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,720
Maybe it was because of my bed linen.

646
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,160
Man, slept good.

647
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,080
- Like a baby.
- Yeah.

648
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,400
<i>Attention, monitors.</i>
<i>Your breakfast is served.</i>

649
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,160
Oh!

650
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,000
You guys are getting some good breakfast.

651
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,520
Oh, my God.

652
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,960
Thank the Lord.

653
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,680
Oh, it's pancakes.

654
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,880
Oh, wow.

655
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,600
- Oh, my God. We have orange juice.
- Oh!

656
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,200
- Easily beats the grits.
- That is it right there.

657
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,880
I'm sorry, y'all.

658
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,320
Holy crap.

659
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,480
Oh, this looks so good, dude.

660
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,840
Yeah, this is too good to be true.

661
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,200
This is too good to be true.

662
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,160
My stomach is growling. I'm so hungry.

663
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,720
- Would you like some?
- Yes, please.

664
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,920
Just say when.

665
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm so hungry. I can't look.

666
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,480
Orange juice is my passion, dude.

667
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,440
- No pulp, low acid orange juice.
- Like… Yes.

668
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,240
God, save me!

669
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,160
I love orange juice.

670
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,720
I don't know, orange juice is so good.
Like, it-- it completes the breakfast.

671
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
You can have it at lunch,
you can have it at dinner.

672
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,280
Literally, this past Christmas,

673
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,880
one of my coworkers got me
a whole case of orange juice.

674
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,880
It's just something I love.
I don't know. I'm like… Ah! Man.

675
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,880
Once I win, if I win,
or whatever you wanna say it,

676
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,480
with the money I have left of it all,

677
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,880
orange juice for a year. I kid you not.

678
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,280
It would mean a lot for me to win.

679
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,360
Like, weight lifted
off my shoulders, I guess.

680
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,280
You know, I'm very cautious with money.

681
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,040
It probably comes
from, you know, growing up,

682
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,000
being very cautious on what we spend.

683
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,440
'Cause I remember we always had
a limit to spend on groceries.

684
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,840
So you never want
to take for granted anything.

685
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,240
Yeah. That's what they're supposed to say.

686
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,080
Look at the syrup. Enjoy it, you guys.

687
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,160
- Pancakes? I know.
- I don't think I can eat anymore.

688
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,000
I just feel like I can't leave them.

689
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,720
I feel solid about my role as a monitor.

690
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,680
It takes good people
to step into these roles.

691
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,320
So in my eyes, my meal is justified.

692
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,920
I'm not being a jerk about it.

693
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,200
I'm not waving my pancake,

694
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,680
like, "Ooh, look at the syrup!"
Like, you know?

695
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,520
I can feel 098's wrath
just coming over here.

696
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,520
He's not doing himself any favors
by just now excluding himself.

697
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,160
Yeah, not at all.

698
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,200
I'm just so hungry.

699
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,040
I was watching Isaiah chew,
and I was like…

700
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
I can't do that. It's--

701
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,680
Like, mmm, it got me mad.

702
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,240
Driving me nuts, man.

703
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,680
Jeffrey would've known what to do.

704
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,440
What do you feel about 410, Isaiah?

705
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,400
He's a threat.

706
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,320
I don't trust him.

707
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,240
For me, it's more
like I don't fully trust him.

708
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,280
Not-- Do not distrust him,

709
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,880
but he is very smart
and calculated and very confident.

710
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,440
And very… Like, he's playing
the, like, very kind, nice, genuine card.

711
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,080
Yeah, and I think…

712
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,280
I'm sorry.

713
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,040
Do not apologize.

714
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,840
I think I'm also just so hungry right now
in this moment.

715
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,360
Yeah, I saw you guys chewing,
I said, "I gotta look away."

716
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,920
- It tasted good, but…
- Good.

717
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,840
I'm like…

718
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,720
- I'm gonna go out of hiding now.
- Yeah.

719
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,080
All right, I'm headed in here.

720
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,080
I gotta be first in line for this food.

721
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,160
- <i>But what is it?</i>
- <i>Porridge.</i>

722
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,480
<i>Oh, my God, bro.</i>

723
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,000
<i>Ooh, that looks gross.</i>

724
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,920
I think resentment in-- is growing.

725
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,200
- Like, it is, yeah.
- Yeah.

726
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,280
Normally, volunteering,
you don't benefit this much.

727
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,440
They benefitted so much,
so I think there's something more to it.

728
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,840
- I agree. I agree.
- Yeah.

729
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,400
Although, um, I tried to be a-- a monitor,

730
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,920
I look at this as just God's way of saying
it's just not meant to be for me.

731
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,760
Maybe it's because these players
that became monitors,

732
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,760
they're gonna be at risk
of being eliminated.

733
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,120
You can't trust nobody.
Yeah, something's up.

734
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,520
There's a rhyme for a reason.
Give someone pancakes and orange juice,

735
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,840
next thing, you send them home.

736
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,960
This is gonna be my last bite.

737
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,400
Oh, my God.

738
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,920
Ugh, it's terrible, bro. Terrible.

739
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,080
I'm nervous.
I wonder where we go from here.

740
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,680
People are thinking
there might be something with this.

741
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,800
Yeah, course there is.

742
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,600
- But I didn't wanna leave here…
- Yeah.

743
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,600
- …not having taken a risk.
- Not doing anything.

744
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,160
Yeah, but trust me, if we have to, like,
vote one of you guys out or something,

745
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,600
you're safe with me.

746
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,800
Yeah, basically, we're all rolling
the dice every second that we're in here.

747
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,880
- It's a kind of a combination.
- Yeah, true.

748
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,760
Yeah. But I play poker.

749
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,480
85 to 90% of the time, you're--
you're gonna lose in a tournament,

750
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,920
so you gotta get used to losing a lot.

751
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
If you're a good player, you'll cash in,
like, 20% of the tournaments you play.

752
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,920
- Who taught you how to play poker?
- My mom.

753
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,680
- Wow.
- Yeah.

754
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,160
I just like the mental warfare of poker.

755
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,360
You can play in, like, high rollers
if you're super rich

756
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,400
for, like 50K buy-ins, but like,
yeah, no, I don't play in that stuff.

757
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,240
In 2023, in the summer,

758
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,040
I finished second
in the World Series of Poker main event,

759
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,320
and I won $6.5 million.

760
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,520
I definitely believe that if people know
how much money I've made in poker,

761
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,080
that they will think
I'm undeserving to win <i>Squid Game.</i>

762
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,800
For sure,
I'm not gonna share that information.

763
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,960
I believe because I didn't win
the main event,

764
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,120
I think that left
a fire burning in me to compete,

765
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,240
um, 'cause I just wanna
keep going, keep going,

766
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,960
and just show how far I can take
certain things in life,

767
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,280
and just, uh, especially in competition.

768
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,400
How do you feel about the power
that has come from this?

769
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,920
If there's a consequence from it,
I took that risk.

770
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,440
Actually, I suppose it wasn't
like everyone else jumped forward.

771
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,320
- There were-- It wasn't like there was--
- And they kinda elected us too.

772
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,240
They were like,
"We want these people to do it."

773
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,080
So I don't feel that bad, honestly.

774
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,600
<i>Attention, monitors.</i>

775
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,040
<i>Please follow the staff.</i>

776
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,080
- Oh, my God.
- You got this.

777
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,840
- Love y'all.
- Good luck.

778
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,080
Love you guys.

779
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,600
Good luck.

780
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,880
What if they're the ones
on the chopping block?

781
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,760
They expect to be in power,
but what if they're the ones on the block?

782
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,120
I think-- I think that that's
a very big possibility.

783
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,840
That sounds plausible.

784
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,600
People have to go.

785
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,520
Oh, my God.

786
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,240
Okay.

787
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,520
Any ideas?

788
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,040
Nothing good goes into a little black box,

789
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,360
<i>and nothing good comes out of a little</i>
<i>black box. That's all I have to say.</i>

790
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,720
<i>Attention, monitors.</i>

791
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,440
<i>You must now select three players</i>

792
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,640
<i>to put at risk of elimination.</i>

793
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,960
I didn't wanna be in this position.
I didn't wanna be put in this position.

794
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,560
I know. I know we didn't.
I know you didn't.

795
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,280
They're gonna know it was us.

796
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,040
I was almost hoping
that this could be taken out of our hands.

797
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,760
No, they're gonna know it's us.

798
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,520
It's for elimination, so…

799
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,680
I mean, that's targets back on us, though.

800
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,040
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

801
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,160
- So…
- First one.

802
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,400
437, I think.

803
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,480
I feel like that's a safer play for us to…

804
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,960
437 is the one that hasn't maybe
formed friendships or alliances,

805
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,000
and so he won't break many hearts.

806
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,440
Who's the second one?

807
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,480
What about… I--
I forget his number, but Craig?

808
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,760
Yeah, Greg, 417.

809
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,120
Who are his people? Does he have people?

810
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,640
I don't think Greg really has people.

811
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,880
He's a nice guy.

812
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,400
And it's gonna be hard for me
to look him in the eye, but I will.

813
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,880
Yeah, and I-- Do we have
that decision on the third?

814
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,000
- Of course, we have. 098.
- 098.

815
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,800
Hmm.

816
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,640
Yeah, I think I'm good with that. So, 098.

817
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,280
- 098.
- 098.

818
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,120
Part of this game is being social,
and he didn't wanna play that part.

819
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,400
- Yeah.
- Exactly, and I think that's fair.

820
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,240
Oh, my God.

821
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,680
So it was, like, free wine and beer?

822
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,560
<i>Attention, players.</i>

823
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,880

God, this is bad.

829
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,960
Okay, y'all got y'all chores.
All right. That's not bad.

830
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,920
437, 417, and 098.

831
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,560
Ooh, that's a combo right there.

832
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,200
Well, there you are.

833
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,440
To go to the chore room.

834
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,960
- You think it's bad?
- Yeah, it's bad.

835
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,400
Oh, my God.

836
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,240
- Oh, shit!
- <i>Here we are.</i>

837
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,560
- Black box.
- Mm-hmm.

838
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,640
- Should we open it?
- Yes.

839
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,400
Nothing in the black box.

840
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,680
We are so cooked.

841
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,000

00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,400
- Oh, my God, bro.
- No.

854
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,720
It's a sacrifice game.

855
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,120
I can't do it. I can't let my son down.

856
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,120
I don't wanna go.

857
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,120
- I really wanna stay.
- They set us up.

858
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,640
Wanna just do Rock, Paper, Scissors,
one of us sacrifice, and we kill them all?

859
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,040
<i>This is a race for survival.</i>

860
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,160
Oh, my God.

861
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,840
<i>And it starts now.</i>
