1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,040
- This is the last game.
- This is it.

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,640
They're gonna show us your Zoe.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,320
- She's got it. She locked in.
- She's got this, Curt.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,800
Please don't let this be the end of Zoe.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,160
Just breathe. Just stay calm.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,520
Concentrate on us, not them.
Don't look at 'em.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,120
We got it. We got this.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,000
She got this, she got this,
she got this, she got this, she got this.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,600
It's my baby girl.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,280
I don't want to see her go home.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,280
- Go, Zoe. Go!
- Come on, Zoe.

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,520
You got this, Zo.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,320
Step, step, step, step.

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
- Stop!
- Step and stop.

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,800
Just get in focus.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,800
Yeah!

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,400
- Come on!
- Looks good.

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,560
One, two. One, two. One, two.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm rooting for the other team
'cause it's my best friend.

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,960
- One, two. One, two.
- Concentrate.

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,480
One, two. Stop.

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,280
Okay. Take your time. Take it.

23
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,120
<i>One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.</i>

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,840
One, two. One, two. Let's go, one, two.

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,840
One, two. I've got this, guys.
Everyone stay there.

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,800
- Go ahead, you got this.
- You got this. You got this, Lizzie.

27
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,400
Concentrate.

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,960
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,560
- Let's go. Ready?
- Wait, wait!

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,800
- Okay. All right.
- Okay!

31
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,400
- Again.
- One, two.

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,200
This is nuts!

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,240
One, two. One, two.

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,640
- Pick it up, pick it up.
- I got it.

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,040
We've got a good lead.

36
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,280
Go, Lizzie, go. Go! You got this, Lizzie.

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah!

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, my gosh. This is intense.

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,880
Take your time, mate. You got this.

40
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,120
Kevin, we believe in you, Kevin.

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,600
- Kevin.
- He's already on that?

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,520
Uh-oh.

43
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,920
You got this. Stay calm, Kevin.

44
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,480
- Perfect.
- Perfect. Right? Go.

45
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,080
- <i>Hold on, hold on.</i>
- <i>Ready?</i>

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,240
- <i>Go.</i>
- <i>On three.</i>

47
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,440
- One, two. One, two.
- That's it!

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,880
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.

49
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,400
One, two. One…

50
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't-- Don't. It's okay, it's okay.

51
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,200
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.

52
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,600
- Deep breath. Deep breath.
- Take your time now.

53
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,640
You got this.

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,200
They're still doing it.
You have plenty of time.

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,440
- Plenty of time.
- I know.

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,160
Take your time. Your hand's shaking.

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,880
- Time, time.
- It's okay. Reset.

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,200
Stay calm. You got this.

59
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,120
Okay. You got it.

60
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,640
- Come on.
- Ready.

61
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,600
- Up.
- Up.

62
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,600
- Ready?
- Go.

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,800
Come on!

64
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,360
And now it's even.

65
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,360
<i>Easy.</i>

66
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,040
One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two. One, two.

67
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,200
There's no pressure, okay?
Don't worry, just stay calm.

68
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,200
- One, two.
- Go, you got this.

69
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,560
Zoe's doing cards.

70
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,880
- Oh, she is!
- <i>Take your time.</i>

71
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,280
This is by far the hardest one.

72
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,640
Come on, Zoe.

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,760
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
She's gonna get it.

74
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,080
Trust me. They're--
They're gonna get this locked down.

75
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,000
Can you pray for me?

76
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,840
Let's go, Zo. Let's go, Zo.

77
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,920
You got this, sweetie.

78
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,720
- It isn't working.
- That was close.

79
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,760
Have a wider gap
between each one. Trust me.

80
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,320
Make it a wider gap.

81
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,040
They-- They didn't even do one yet.

82
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,880
I'm shaking so bad.

83
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,360
Take your time, take your time.

84
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,680
She's struggling just as you are.

85
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,640
Just breathe. Put the cards down,
shake your hands out.

86
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,560
Okay.

87
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,440
Just shake your hands out. Just breathe.

88
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,560
We got time. We got time.

89
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,440
Take your time.

90
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,280
When the kids were small,
to keep 'em entertained at restaurants,

91
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,680
I would pour out the sugar packages,
and we would build houses.

92
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm thinking,

93
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,760
"It's Zoe as a seven-year-old,
at restaurants, stacking sugar."

94
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
<i>You got it, Zoe.</i>

95
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,200
There you go! Good, good. Take your time.

96
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,320
Come on, Zoe.

97
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,640
They're on their second level.

98
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,400
Don't worry about them.

99
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,080
Oh, man!

100
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,320
That's close.

101
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,320
Come on, Zo!

102
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,480
Let's go, Zo! Let's go, Zo! Come on.

103
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,800
Okay, just one.

104
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,120
They're going to the next level.

105
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,000
<i>Okay.</i>

106
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,040
Calm down. Calm your ass down. Come on.

107
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,440
You got this.

108
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,320
He's about to do it.

109
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,480
Okay.

110
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,920
Come on, Zo! You got this.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
- This is it.
- You got this!

112
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,920
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,480
Yes!

114
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,400
Yes! Go!

115
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,080
<i>One, two. One, two.</i>

116
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,360
One, two. One…

117
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,760
Take your time.

118
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,040
One, two, three.

119
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,040
Let's go! One, two!

120
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,280
Don't worry about them.

121
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,160
- One, two!
- Get there!

122
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,400
Yeah!

123
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,680
We're bringing you home to your dad!
We're bringing her home!

124
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,360
We're bringing you home!

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,840
That was awesome, bro.

126
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,120
- Is that your kid?
- Yes.

127
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,440
You good.

128
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes.

129
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,560
<i>Tell me quick, ain't love a kick…</i>

130
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,400
It's all right, brother. It's all good.

131
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,280
<i>…in the head</i>

132
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,320
We're still in it! We're in it, baby!

133
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,320
I love you. Oh, my God.

134
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,520
I love you. We're not separating again.

135
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,320
- They showed it on the screen.
- They did?

136
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,240
Yes. They…

137
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,320
Aw!

138
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,760
I love you, sweetie.

139
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,440
I love you.

140
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,320
I survived!

141
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,080
Being in the game still
is just fricking amazing.

142
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,080
I can't believe
that Zoe and I are still here.

143
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,080
But I mean,
I-- I don't wanna be confident.

144
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,120
All right? I don't want to be confident.
This game can change in an instant,

145
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,920
but I'm feeling-- I'm feeling good.
I'm feeling good.

146
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,280
- So what's with these doors?
- I'm not sure.

147
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,960
- But it is locked.
- Ah.

148
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,440
Something is afoot.

149
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,680
I woke up today, and it felt so gorgeous.

150
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,520
I'm like, "Yes, I am here.
That piggy'll be mine in a few days."

151
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,320
Another day in paradise, right?

152
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,440
I wonder what's for breakfast today, guys.

153
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,480
All right.

154
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,240
- How'd you sleep?
- I'm just exhausted.

155
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,760
- Okay.
- And I feel wiped out.

156
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,080
Rise and shine.

157
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,800
So today, my big goal is honestly to find
more people I can become friends with

158
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,080
to enhance my chances in the game.

159
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,760
- How are you?
- Good. I slept.

160
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,680
Shout out to the people
who can just wake up

161
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,960
and start talking right away.

162
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,360
- We got this.
- We got this.

163
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,560
'Cause that will never be me.

164
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,080
I call those people "murderers," dude.
Those are serial killers.

165
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,680
It's kind of psycho.

166
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,560
Yeah.

167
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,880
I think I got a total
of, like, two, three hours of sleep.

168
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,560
So right now I'm a little bit nervous
about my energy.

169
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,840
Oh, it's porridge time.

170
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,560
My mission is still just to win,

171
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,760
so I can't let my emotions
override the mission at hand.

172
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,360
That's what I have to do
to make sure that I stay grounded mentally

173
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,520
so that I win.

174
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,320
<i>I'm gonna punch a hole through the wall.</i>

175
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,080
<i>I got my pigtails on.</i>
<i>Throw anything at me.</i>

176
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,240
- The pigtails? That's like…
- Bam!

177
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,160
- Bam!
- That's a statement, though. I like it.

178
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,200
<i>I'm gonna go take a leak.</i>

179
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,520
<i>- Bathroom time?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

180
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,640
- <i>Let's rock and roll, chief.</i>
- <i>Oh, God. Gotta go!</i>

181
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,560
Let's get going before that line gets big.

182
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Yeah, yeah.

183
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,840
Hey, whoa, whoa! What the heck?

184
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,760
What's in there? That is scary.

185
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,440
I have no idea what this room is.

186
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,160
It looks like a maintenance room.

187
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,280
- Gonna go in?
- Let's do it. Come on.

188
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,120
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

189
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,240
<i>Those are candy bars! Candies.</i>

190
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,040
Candy, candy, candy!

191
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,760
- Oh, my gosh.
- One coin equals a treat!

192
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,200
Oh, I found one.

193
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,600
- Pick a treat!
- I would like the cookies.

194
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,480
- Okay, let's do it. 27.
- Oh, yeah, let's go!

195
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,480
Yes!

196
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,000
All right, guys.

197
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,000
- Here you go. Go, have one. Yeah.
- Oh, thank you so much.

198
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
- <i>All right, let's do it!</i>
<i>- Cookies!</i>

199
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,880
I immediately want to share
this joy of the cookies.

200
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,200
We have an announcement.
We have an announcement!

201
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,840
Come on, come on.
There was a vending machine,

202
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,280
and there were snacks.

203
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,880
And it said one coin equals one snack.

204
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,880
Are you serious?

205
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,120
We got the coin.

206
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,000
We picked our snack, and it was cookies.

207
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,680
Don't even take a cookie.

208
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh, hell, no.

209
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,560
Something bad's gonna happen.

210
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,960
Don't eat the cookie.
Don't eat the cookie.

211
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,400
- Don't you think so?
- Do you really think I would lie?

212
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,640
No.

213
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,200
I'm telling you, bro. Get a cookie.

214
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,920
The skepticism hits me like a brick.

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Did you do it?

216
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,120
- Everyone is suspicious.
- No, do not do it.

217
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,280
- August, you're fine. Honestly.
- Don't do it.

218
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,080
Don't eat it. You're fine.
You don't wanna eat it, don't eat it.

219
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,080
I'm kind of sad
on how little people trust us.

220
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,360
<i>We just wanna share.</i>

221
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,000
<i>Don't do it.</i>

222
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,160
<i>We don't need no cookie right now.</i>

223
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,200
- <i>Marcus, right?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

224
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,880
- What game did you play?
- Jegi.

225
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,280
He did it on the first try.

226
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,200
- That's-- That's amazing.
- What'd you do?

227
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,320
I did the rock throw.

228
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,160
- That's a hard one, dude.
- I did it like seven or eight times.

229
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,720
- Doesn't matter 'cause we won.
- You still got it.

230
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,600
Oh, thank God.
We live another day, my friend, right?

231
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,600
Yup, live another day.

232
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

233
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,640
<i>Attention, all players.</i>

234
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,760
<i>You have successfully passed</i>
<i>the first game.</i>

235
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,760
<i>A vote will now take place.</i>

236
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,440
For what?

237
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,360
Oh, hell, no.

238
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,560
- Oh, my God!
- It's the voting machine.

239
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,680
At least they put a bow on it.
That's nice.

240
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,480
Prior to the first game, you were told
that every second counts.

241
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
My God, my God.

242
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,800
You participated in five mini-games,
each of which was timed.

243
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,320
Oh, I have chills.

244
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,200
I was really hot before,
but now I feel cold.

245
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,720
Right? Now, I'm like…

246
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,400
The following players
were slowest in their mini-game

247
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,080
and must now make their way to the stage.

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,360
Player 180.

249
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,000
Player 089.

250
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,760
Dang it.

251
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,640
- No!
- Player 040.

252
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,160
- All good.
- It's not over yet, man.

253
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,640
Player 344.

254
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,040
I knew it was me.

255
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,680
And player 289.

256
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,920
Their fate lies in your hands.

257
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,600
What the hell is this?

258
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,920
If you wish to save
these players, press O.

259
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,480
If you wish to eliminate them, press X.

260
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,520
Oh.

261
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,280
Hopefully, they still remember
that I got 'em here.

262
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,760
You wouldn't say no, would you?
You wouldn't say, "Go."

263
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,320
- Even if you don't know half of us.
- Yeah, true.

264
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,520
A lot of people
don't know anyone up there.

265
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,120
I just know 089 is the reason
we're here in the first place.

266
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,480
Oh! Oh…

267
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,400
He's the reason we're all here.
He was the one counting.

268
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,800
Players, you will vote
in order of player number,

269
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,000
highest to lowest.

270
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,760
Majority decision is final.

271
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,240
Ultimately, what this comes down to,
your humanity versus your logic.

272
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,760
What's the consensus?

273
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,000
- 'Cause I'm going first.
- I know what I'm doing.

274
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,240
- I'm not saying--
- I'm 451, I have to vote second.

275
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,400
I'm still voting.

276
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,280
They'll save me because,
you know, I got them there.

277
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,600
I was counting
for over seven minutes yesterday,

278
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,120
and I got 'em into the game,

279
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,280
and they're gonna have my back.

280
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,240
Player 455, please cast your vote.

281
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,200
That's my guy.

282
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,920
I am the person that sets the tone
for the rest of this vote,

283
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,320
and I can feel everybody's eyes on me.

284
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,720
He's gonna X.

285
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,800
At the end of the day, I'm not here
to be braiding each other's hair,

286
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,600
talking about our feelings,
playing happy family kumbaya.

287
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,800
These guys can go home so that I can win.

288
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,480
Oh…

289
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,880
I'm not doing it.

290
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,280
The guy up there was the one
that saved us with the music.

291
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,680
Player 451, please cast your vote.

292
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,600
You got this.

293
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,040
I am not going to sacrifice my integrity.

294
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,600
I don't wanna go home
knowing that I didn't play

295
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,640
by the person that I am.

296
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,960
Oh, dear God.

297
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,080
I got you.

298
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,480
I'm clicking X.

299
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,320
I'm gonna hit X
'cause that's what I wanna do.

300
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,240
I'm not gonna fake it
to try and look good.

301
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,280
There's a lot of money on the line,
we want to win,

302
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,200
and we'll do anything we can to win it.

303
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,960
I understand that the musician up there
was one of the reasons we're through,

304
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,880
but this is a game at the end of the day.

305
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,360
We need to be selfish.

306
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,280
He's a good guy.

307
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,240
I'm sorry.

308
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,480
He's not that good. He's a little shit.

309
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,960
I'm nervous.

310
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,440
Now, I'm think--
I'm-- I might be in trouble.

311
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,240
Life is short.

312
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,240
I wanted to set an example
for my two kids.

313
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,520
I wanted to show 'em that you gotta
swing for the fences sometime,

314
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,160
and you gotta take some chances.

315
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,240
You know, it's-- it's about…

316
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,720
I'm getting emotional.

317
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,880
Uh, you know, it's about the experience,

318
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,200
and that's what I wanted them to see.

319
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,240
See, I wanna press O,
but I want them to get eliminated.

320
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,960
With so many people voting for X,

321
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,360
do you really wanna be an O?

322
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,000
Is it worth it?

323
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,480
Players, if X receives one more vote,

324
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,200
a majority verdict has been reached.

325
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,840
Oh, no!

326
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,040
No!

327
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,960
It's over.

328
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,640
I could not be happier to press that X,

329
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,840
but I've got an image to keep up.

330
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,160
I need everyone in this dorm

331
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,240
to think I'm the sweet little Aussie boy
that no one wants to vote out.

332
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,240
I can't do it to you boys, man.

333
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,360
So it's time to put on
an Oscar-worthy performance.

334
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,440
I'm sorry.

335
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,480
Aw!

336
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,640
Oh, my God…

337
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,960
And the award goes to…

338
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,320
Nail in the coffin.

339
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,800
Unfortunately, now,
no matter if we hit X or O, the X's won.

340
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,480
Yeah.

341
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,320
The game is about to be ruthless.

342
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,040
Now people are gonna be thinking about,

343
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,440
"Who are the few people
that you can actually trust?"

344
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,640
Attention, all players.

345
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,240
A majority has been reached.

346
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,520
Therefore, players 180,

347
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,880
040,

348
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,280
289,

349
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,920
344,

350
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,280
and 089,

351
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,760
<i>you are eliminated.</i>

352
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,240
Out of 226 players,

353
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,960
119 have been eliminated.

354
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,000
- Oh, God.
- Wow.

355
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,440
Wicked.

356
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,040
- Wow.
- Oh, my God.

357
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,840
What are they clapping for?

358
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,440
They don't want money.

359
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,840
That's a lot of money.

360
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,280
The prize money accumulated so far is…

361
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,280
…$3.49 million.

362
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,080
Yes!

363
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,240
My mission here is to be kind,
treat people how I wanna be treated,

364
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,800
and it feels terrible.

365
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,200
But I have to remind myself
that no matter what happens,

366
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,600
only one person wins.

367
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,280
It might be me.
It might be someone different.

368
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,400
But only one person wins.

369
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,280
<i>Are you okay?</i>

370
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,560
- Yeah, I was just sad, girl.
- I know. Me too.

371
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,480
- I don't like that.
- Me too.

372
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,880
I'm like, it's one thing
to play you guys in games,

373
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,960
but to have to look at you
and eliminate you is terrible.

374
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,880
<i>I know.</i>

375
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,400
<i>That's just not how I face life, you know?</i>

376
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,360
<i>Yeah, it's hard.</i>

377
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,520
<i>I think if-- if it was someone…</i>
<i>I didn't know any of them.</i>

378
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,440
If it was someone I knew up there,
I'd struggle.

379
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm sorry. I was this close to pressing O.

380
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,920
No, you weren't!
That was an act. Quit playing.

381
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,120
- Quit playing!
- I wouldn't, man!

382
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,520
When I go up there, and I see 180,
and he's got his two boys at home…

383
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,000
Come on!

384
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,480
You… That was extra.

385
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,400
You was… I hear you,
but you were a little extra.

386
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,560
No, that sucked.

387
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,000
Player 118, Jonti,
is someone who is definitely calculated.

388
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,280
Like, you can tell that he spent time

389
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,960
thinking about how he wanted
to be perceived.

390
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,720
I can smell the fraudulent activity
from a mile away,

391
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,440
and I'm not buying it at all.

392
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,920
- I'm glad you clocked that though.
- What?

393
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,280
- Oh, my God!
- Jonti's little…

394
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,240
Okay, y'all appreciate? I was like…

395
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,480
'Cause we all peeped!
We all peeped, like, "Girl."

396
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,120
Okay. I was like, "Am I mean"?

397
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,560
No, you have eyes. That's all it is.

398
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm sorry. I could not, when he said that.
I was like, "Quit playing."

399
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,920
Way over the top.

400
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,640
He forced a little tear out, then turned
around and then shrugged it off.

401
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,520
<i>I rolled my eyes further</i>
<i>than I ever did before. I remember.</i>

402
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,640
<i>Attention, all players.</i>

403
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,480
<i>For lunch, you have a choice.</i>

404
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,920
<i>If you wish to have your allocated meal,</i>

405
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,160
<i>form a line</i>
<i>on the X side of the dormitory.</i>

406
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,440
<i>If you wish to give up your meal</i>
<i>for a scratcher,</i>

407
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,920
<i>form a line</i>
<i>on the O side of the dormitory.</i>

408
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,720
- A scratcher?
- Take a scratcher or eat a meal.

409
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
- What is that?
- Probably like a lottery ticket.

410
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,800
I am not touching that scratcher.
I am not touching that scratcher.

411
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,240
- Oh, there you are.
- Scratch-off. What are you thinking?

412
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,520
- I'm not gonna take the risk.
- I'm not a risk-taker.

413
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,600
I might take a scratcher, bro.
That'll be interesting to see.

414
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,400
I'm gonna regret it.
I'm gonna be hungry at-- Or gone, dude.

415
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,240
I don't know
what's in the scratch-off ticket,

416
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,440
but I'm thinking it's an opportunity
for me to eliminate somebody.

417
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,840
This is my chance
to get a threat out of this game.

418
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,320
There you go. Hey, I know it's good too.

419
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,640
- I have a feeling.
- Smart, very smart.

420
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,360
My parents would
always tell me I was a lucky child,

421
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,480
and I would win
all the raffles and the lotteries.

422
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,680
- Sam, you feeling all right?
- I feel good.

423
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,720
- I believe in you, Sam.
- Thank you.

424
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,000
So I'm hoping that my luck
would carry on today, here.

425
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,600
I'm going to X.

426
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,160
I love you guys.

427
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,360
- Good luck, guys. Good luck.
- Thank you.

428
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,840
Oh, wow.

429
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,960
We get to pick 'em.
That's great. That's great.

430
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,480
It's not, like, a random order.

431
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,040
Cheers, man. Thank you. Feels warm.

432
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,360
Oh, yeah. That looks good.

433
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,360
Oh, shoot, bro. Dude.

434
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,520
I'm not gonna lie.

435
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,880
In my head, I'm like, "Did I just make
the biggest mistake I've made,

436
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
or am I about to just take
control of this game,

437
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,760
and shock everybody
in the building right now?"

438
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,120
- Yeah, yeah.
- Can I watch?

439
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,360
Oh, no.

440
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,400
- What is it? What is it? What is it?
- Oh, no!

441
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,200
- What'd you get?
- Oh, that's not good.

442
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,800
What is it? What is it?

443
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,560
Oh, no. It's not food.

444
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,560
What is it?

445
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,480
- What is it?
- Oh, that's tough.

446
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,240
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

447
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,040
It's a disadvantage in the next game.

448
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,240
- Oh!
- Ooh.

449
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,840
And no dinner.

450
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,320
That sucks!

451
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,040
It's gut-wrenching.

452
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,760
It feels gut-wrenching right now to be me.

453
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,400
It feels…

454
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,840
It's just-- I'm so stup--
I should've just laid low.

455
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,760
My girl's gonna be so pissed at me, bro.

456
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,440
I'm so arrogant that I'm thinking,

457
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,160
"Oh, I'm about to control the game,"

458
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,680
and it just backfires so hard.

459
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
I have won a treat.

460
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,080
It's pizza!

461
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,200
He got pizza?

462
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,200
"You have won five coins."

463
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,520
A coin?

464
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,840
- For the snack machine.
- Yeah.

465
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,240
It just feels like I made
the dumbest decision ever.

466
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,800
I'm probably gonna end up
eliminating myself

467
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,240
because of my stupid decision, honestly.

468
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,000
It's what you get.

469
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,080
God.

470
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,200
You're always lucky.

471
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,240
Trust you've got this.

472
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,240
I'm meant to be here.

473
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,400
I'm a middle child,
and I personally can say

474
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,720
I'm a victim of the middle child syndrome.

475
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,440
I wasn't my…

476
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,280
I wasn't my family's favorite.

477
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,080
Well, my-- I wasn't
my mom or my dad's favorite.

478
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,640
I have the little brother,
who was the baby,

479
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,680
the mama's boy, and then my sister,

480
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,000
who was more
of my dad's favorite growing up.

481
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,240
And here I am, the middle child.

482
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,200
Always…

483
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,320
felt like I was in the shadow.

484
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Expectations from my family
were pretty low,

485
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,280
while my siblings
had the hopes of my parents.

486
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,680
- Oh, she's stressed now. 352.
- Yeah.

487
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,240
Good luck.

488
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,120
- That might be the golden ticket…
- Yeah.

489
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,400
…that we all left behind.

490
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,320
- We haven't gotten a good one.
- An advantage.

491
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,600
Disadvantage.

492
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,640
Disadvantage.

493
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,360
Oh, man.

494
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,120
I'm sorry, Sam.

495
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,880
I trusted the universe,

496
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,600
but when I reached for that card…
…and saw that--

497
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,480
Definitely not what I was asking
the universe.

498
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,840
But I knew it was risky.

499
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,480
Disadvantage, but you're not eliminated.

500
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,840
- That's true.
- Yes, you're not eliminated.

501
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,720
<i>I'm spending all of mine.</i>

502
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,560
<i>There's a box now.</i>

503
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,840
Oh! "One coin for a treat
and ten coins to eliminate a player."

504
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,320
So you have five coins.
You don't have enough.

505
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,720
- I've done my risk-taking for the day.
- Me too.

506
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,280
<i>I'm gonna get some treats.</i>

507
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,840
<i>If you had a disadvantage, if I did,</i>

508
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,800
I'd be not freaking out,
but I'd be feeling pessimistic.

509
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,960
I don't know how you guys feel,
but I really don't want

510
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,000
people with relationships
still in the game.

511
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,400
If we're considering
taking out some strong players,

512
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,240
the twins, 100%.

513
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,120
They know how to play.

514
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,440
With those eliminations,
things hit really hard.

515
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,000
- It's almost like they're entitled.
- Yeah.

516
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,040
I really see, like,
the alliances really coming out.

517
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,000
I don't trust 432 and 431.

518
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,520
They have a good gaggle of people
that support them and trust them.

519
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,000
They could be a huge issue.

520
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,720
You nervous about the scratch card?

521
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,760
I thought that there would
be bigger rewards,

522
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,680
like an immunity or an elimination.

523
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,240
You know what I wanted to do, bro?

524
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,280
I wanted to get your brother out
and leave you in here, dude.

525
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,400
- You're crazy.
- That would've been crazy, dude, right?

526
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,480
- I don't think I could've done it, dude.
- All right, man, I won't get you out.

527
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,960
Bro, yeah, that would be fire,
but I couldn't do it, dude, I couldn't.

528
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,320
So my dad was a pastor
for the Assemblies of God,

529
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,440
which is like, uh,
a Pentecostal denomination.

530
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,440
And, uh… Yeah, so I just grew up going
to church every Sunday, every Wednesday,

531
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,800
and, like, other days too.
It was pretty part of my life.

532
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,440
And then, when he died
a couple of years after that,

533
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,040
my mom married another pastor.

534
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,880
So I thought I had gotten out of it,
and then she married another pastor.

535
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,600
Same pastor, Pentecostal.

536
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,800
Like, same kind of church, Pentecostal,
and then I was, like, back in it again.

537
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,440
I do believe there's a God,
but I think I'm probably going to hell.

538
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,560
So, like, if it's real,
I think I'm doomed.

539
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,520
I don't know. My parents were these--

540
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,920
these really, like, religious
and, like, good people,

541
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,600
and I feel like I got all these problems.

542
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,760
So it just doesn't, like, fit
sometimes, you know?

543
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,240
It was great to meet you, brother.

544
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,800
No, you're good, man.
Don't even shake my hand until you're in.

545
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,560
I'm already going to Japan
this summer, I think.

546
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,360
Oh, we are definitely meeting up.

547
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,120
I wanna go so badly.

548
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,600
We almost went to Star Wars con,
I think, next year?

549
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,160
What? There's a Star Wars con in Japan?

550
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,800
Official Star Wars convention. Yeah.

551
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,560
- Leon's like, "I don't know."
- I actually do not know that either.

552
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,720
- You're making fun of me but--
- No, we're not.

553
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,720
I'm just not a <i>Star Wars </i>fan.

554
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,720
I just love how unapologetically,
like, dorky you are.

555
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,760
I love that.

556
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,400
<i>Attention, players.</i>

557
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,680
<i>The second game will begin shortly.</i>

558
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
- Oh, here we go.
- Let's do this.

559
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,360
<i>Please follow</i>
<i>the staff into the game hall.</i>

560
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,720
I need a moment.

561
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,840
All right.
Let's get it, let's get it, let's get it!

562
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,840
- Bah! Oh…
- Bah!

563
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,760
Ah, I just got a bit nervous.

564
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,280
- I know, we gotta try to stay calm.
- Yeah.

565
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,840
What is this?

566
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,320
What color are we going?

567
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,200
Pick a color. Pick a color.

568
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,440
What is this?

569
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,080
Purple. We're going purple.

570
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,240
We're going purple.

571
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,240
When I see

572
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,920
all the different colored squares
and dots,

573
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,520
my immediate thought was
that my dad and I stay together.

574
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,840
We did not wanna be separated again.

575
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,120
How many spots are there?
Same amount as players?

576
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,840
There's three less dots than people.

577
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,440
- Okay.
- So just get to a dot as fast as you can.

578
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,680
- I'll go-- I'll go this one.
- I'll go over there.

579
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,480
<i>Attention, players.</i>

580
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,440
<i>Please divide yourselves equally</i>
<i>between the four color zones.</i>

581
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,080
<i>You have one minute.</i>

582
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,520
- Y'all full?
- Yeah.

583
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,360
- Jonti, what are you doing, bro?
- I'm letting fate decide.

584
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,480
I wanna take the risk.
Me gut's telling me to.

585
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,760
It's screaming at me,
"Jonti, take that risk."

586
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
In it together?

587
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,440
They're taking squares.

588
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,320
There's gonna be three of us left over.

589
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,120
Yeah. I'm gonna wait it out.
I wanna see what happens.

590
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,320
Sometimes you take these risks,

591
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,880
and you get a big old boost
towards the finish line.

592
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,760
Sometimes you put your balls on the line,
and you get knocked over the head for it.

593
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,480
If this was the wrong decision,

594
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,000
good luck to everyone.
I love each and every one of you.

595
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,600
And if this is the moment we go,
I had a lot of pleasure with you guys.

596
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,080
Oh, I'm going home. I'm going home.

597
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,760
I'm going home.

598
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,720
We're going home.

599
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,000
<i>The three players</i>
<i>who have not found a marker…</i>

600
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,000
Why did I do that? Why did I do that?

601
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,920
God.

602
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,640
<i>…will not play the game.</i>

603
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,400
- I knew it. I knew it!
- I knew it.

604
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,440
I knew it. I told… Oh, my God.

605
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,600
That gut feeling!

606
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,000
- That gut feeling!
- Yo!

607
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,320
I knew it. Me gut doesn't lie.

608
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,880
I'm looking at every donny
standing on one of them colored dots

609
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,000
and thinking, "You imbeciles."

610
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,400
Thank you. Thank you, Grandpa.
Thank you, Grandpa. Thank you, Grandpa.

611
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,040
You've got to be kidding me. That's crazy.

612
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,440
<i>All other players,</i>
<i>please follow the staff to the game hall.</i>

613
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,480
- Good luck. Good luck, guys.
- Good luck, guys.

614
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,200
Good luck, guys.

615
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,040
104 walking in.
Who knows how many come back?

616
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,400
- Congrats.
- Good luck, guys.

617
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,520
- Good luck.
- Guys.

618
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,000
Good luck.

619
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,040
If I'm being completely honest,
I'm hoping none of them come back.

620
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,880
Good luck, guys.

621
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,320
See you back in here.

622
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,440
I see every player in this game
as rungs on my ladder

623
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,880
to that big old piggy bank.

624
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,760
Well, we did it, boys. We did it.

625
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,960
Oh, my God.

626
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,120
What?

627
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,760
Really?

628
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,880
The hell is this?

629
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,560
Oh, my God. Oh, what? Oh, wow!

630
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,360
Come together. Purple, come together.

631
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,400
What?

632
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,400
What, bro? What is this?

633
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,440
Going into this game with a disadvantage,

634
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,880
my mind is spinning.

635
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,040
I'm kind of expecting to go home.

636
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120
<i>Welcome to your second game.</i>

637
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,600
This is it. Let's find out.

638
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,520
<i>The game you will be playing is Catch.</i>

639
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,720
Catch.

640
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,680
At some point in this game,
you have to take a risk.

641
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,640
- Exactly.
- <i>Attention, players.</i>

642
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,560
<i>You will not play the next game.</i>

643
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
<i>Instead…</i>

644
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,040
Oh, my God.

645
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,600
<i>…you must select a player</i>
<i>to play on your behalf.</i>

646
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,480
Oh.

647
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,360
<i>- Your fate will lie in their hands.</i>
- Oh, my God.

648
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,200
<i>If they are eliminated,</i>
<i>you will be eliminated.</i>

649
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,280
I knew it was too good to be true.

650
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,360
Every decision I make

651
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,120
is to take my own fate in my own hands,

652
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,360
and now I'm putting my fate
in someone else's hands.

653
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,600
And it's terrifying.

654
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,240
<i>Please make your choice swiftly.</i>

655
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,840
- Oh! Oh, my God.
- Oh, yeah.

656
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,200
Dude!

657
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,680
It's like betting on horses.
We gotta ride 'em high.

658
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,880
I know. Imagine you were playing
with this person as your partner,

659
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,360
which partner would you
have the fullest faith in,

660
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,560
in this specific moment?

661
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,880
- I think I know who I'm going for.
- Yeah.

662
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,240
I think I'm gonna do 437. Karim.

663
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,680
I'm gonna go 152.

664
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,720
I just think Viper is such a safe bet.
He's such a all-out beast.

665
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,480
I'm not thinking
about what happens if Viper goes home

666
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,040
because I know he's not going home.

667
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,040
When you fill your mind
with positive thoughts, energy,

668
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,400
that's what you attract.

669
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,280
I'm gonna go with 383.

670
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,280
<i>Players, stand by.</i>

671
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,600
Oh, no.

672
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,920
- What--
- Is this dodgeball?

673
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,640
No! Is it dodgeball?

674
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,760
<i>The second game, Catch…</i>

675
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,200
- Catch?
<i>- …will begin shortly.</i>

676
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,280
Huh?

677
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,520
<i>Each group</i>
<i>must line up on their colored dots.</i>

678
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,600
<i>A thrower will stand on the center spot</i>

679
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,080
<i>and throw the ball to someone</i>
<i>at the front of one of the lines.</i>

680
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,840
I'm gonna throw first.
I played baseball my whole life.

681
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,160
<i>If the ball is caught,</i>

682
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,720
<i>the thrower passes the game,</i>
<i>and the catcher throws next.</i>

683
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,040
<i>If the ball is dropped,</i>

684
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,440
<i>both the thrower and the catcher</i>
<i>will be eliminated.</i>

685
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,400
Oh!

686
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,400
I'mma get to-- About to get to the front.

687
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,960
Okay…

688
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,920
All that's on my mind
is I just need to be in the front

689
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,640
because I have a disadvantage.

690
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,360
I was always picked last

691
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,000
in dodgeball or kickball.

692
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,920
So if-- Any chance I get
to go in the front

693
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,520
and get saved and have an easy throw…

694
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,080
I'm not complaining. Please.

695
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,720
<i>Each time the ball is dropped,</i>

696
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,160
<i>a new ball will come into play.</i>

697
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,400
<i>There are 16 balls in this game.</i>

698
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,640
<i>Once all balls have been dropped,</i>

699
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,200
<i>the game is over.</i>

700
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,080
<i>Any remaining players</i>
<i>will automatically pass the game.</i>

701
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,160
<i>You have five minutes</i>
<i>to decide on the order you will play.</i>

702
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,040
Vipes, be selfish, man.

703
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,040
I'm not gonna lie, bro.
Vipes, be selfish, my boy.

704
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,160
I'm praying on everything
Viper picks something close to the back.

705
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,760
And I mean the very back.

706
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,760
If 16 balls drop
before it gets to Viper, he's safe.

707
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,520
He doesn't have to touch the ball,
and I'm back in that dorm.

708
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,680
I wanna go first.

709
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,080
What? No, I wanna go!
I wanna start the game.

710
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,120
I wanna go first.

711
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,400
Listen, listen, let's take a second.

712
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,760
- There he is.
<i>- Take a second.</i>

713
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,400
There's Viper.

714
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,000
<i>Let's make this the talking shoe.</i>

715
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,160
I have something.

716
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,040
- Wait, shoe first.
- We all have something.

717
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,560
Listen, this is a game of defense.

718
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,960
We may not look
like the strongest catching team,

719
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,960
but they have to want to throw to us
in order for them to throw to us.

720
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,760
So we throw our worst players up first.

721
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,680
To make them uncomfortable.

722
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,520
We put our best players at the end,

723
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,760
just in case we have
to actually land those long shots.

724
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,680
Perfect.

725
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,880
That's exactly it. That is exactly it.

726
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,880
Look at Viper taking charge, man.
That is so smart.

727
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,600
How do you feel about this though?

728
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,800
- I feel good.
- You do?

729
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,680
- I feel good about this as well.
- I feel good.

730
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,720
Because of my disadvantage,
my team put me into the front.

731
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,360
They believe people will throw the ball
to other people.

732
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,880
Thank you, guys.
I feel like you're gonna be the ones.

733
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,320
We believe enough balls will be dropped
that our team will scoot through

734
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,640
because our front half looks so bad
that no one's gonna want to throw to us.

735
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,600
If we put our strongest people
in the front,

736
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,880
we toss to each other.

737
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,040
When we don't think we can make a throw,
we turn around and toss it to an easy…

738
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,720
Now, we've put the ball in their hands.

739
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,360
Do you think they're gonna go for us
if we're way back here

740
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,840
when they have other people?

741
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,600
We have to stick with our own team.

742
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,120
We gotta figure out the order.

743
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,520
Basically, the person throwing first
is guarantee in, right?

744
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,560
No matter who it is.

745
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,960
We should honor that to Jacob
'cause he did get you guys

746
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,840
through the first challenge. Can we agree?

747
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,320
Yeah? Cool. That's good.

748
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,480
I have great acting skills.

749
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,800
What if we put
one of us towards the front,

750
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
and when that catcher
is looking for someone,

751
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,600
I'm like, "I can't close my hand
all the way, I have a condition"?

752
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,960
We come up with a name for the condition,

753
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,200
and those people are never gonna take
a chance throwing it to that person.

754
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,880
They're gonna always choose someone else.

755
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,320
The entire team
behind that person remains safe.

756
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,640
I don't think that's gonna work.

757
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,520
- Athletes, identify yourself.
- <i>Oh.</i>

758
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,240
- There he is.
- There's your boy.

759
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,440
Oh, putting his hand up.

760
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,720
I wanna throw something out.
This is gonna be a little crazy, okay?

761
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,840
Now remember, the one throwing it
is gonna be judging who's gonna catch it.

762
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,600
They're gonna judge Mark a lot.

763
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,640
- They will judge him.
- On how you look and how you talk.

764
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,160
Exactly, so they're gonna judge Mark
harsher than the rest of us.

765
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,600
- Yo, this is savage, man.
- Oh, wow.

766
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,720
If we put Mark right here or right here,
no one's gonna throw anything to Mark.

767
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm gonna--

768
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,120
- I'm throwing it out there.
- Why am I the scapegoat?

769
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,280
- Just listen, Mark.
- It's perception.

770
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,360
People judge you, Mark,
and if they judge you and they say,

771
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,200
"Hey, we're not gonna throw to you,"

772
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,400
then everybody behind you,
including you, is gonna be safe.

773
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,080
It's sixth grade again, okay?

774
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,560
Ryan, I'm gonna stop you right here

775
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,240
because we're not gonna continue
singling out one single person like that.

776
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,400
That's just not…
Ryan, I'm sorry, that's not okay.

777
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,120
Breathe.

778
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,920
I think nature and nurture
are very, very real things,

779
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,360
and it's really nice
when they both match up to be good.

780
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,640
Like, your nature's good,
your nurture's good, so you're good.

781
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
But, like…

782
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,960
There's a lot of bad in this world.
It's sad.

783
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,480
I think the best thing to say
is I was raised to be thankful

784
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,520
and treat people how I wanna be treated.
I mean, that's a fact.

785
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,600
My parents are amazing about that.
Like, they're the kindest people I've…

786
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,080
I'm lucky. I'm so lucky.

787
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,080
They're that weird yin-yang thing,

788
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,840
like, where they're
a little bit different,

789
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,560
but they're, like, so perfect
for each other,

790
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,440
like, the puzzle's complete.

791
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,320
They've always made sure
the world is as kind to me as it can be.

792
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,880
'Cause I've always been an awkward kid.

793
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,320
I was bullied a lot as a kid. Um…

794
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,080
And, like, they've always been

795
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,920
that person I can go to
if I had any issues,

796
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,120
and I'm thankful for that.

797
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,560
It's okay. It's okay.

798
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,720
Hey, this whole time,
people have shown their true colors,

799
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,280
and now everybody
knows that about him, okay?

800
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,160
<i>Attention, players.</i>

801
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,640
<i>Your positions are now locked.</i>

802
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,880
Oh, Vipes up the very back. My boy.

803
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,160
Oh, is Em in the middle?
That's such a tough spot to be in.

804
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,760
That's-- Might be one of the worst.

805
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,640
- You either wanna be up front or back.
- God.

806
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,040
Karim's in the back.

807
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,680
With Karim in the back,
I have to have full faith

808
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,880
that the Mark strategy is gonna work.

809
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,200
I hate that they called
Mark out like that,

810
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,720
but I'm just banking that it works.

811
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,840
It's like a tennis ball.

812
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,640
<i>Player 017,</i>

813
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,640
<i>as the player at the front of the lines</i>
<i>with the lowest number,</i>

814
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,840
<i>you will be the first thrower.</i>

815
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,240
No matter what happens…

816
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,040
- We're gonna make it through.
- Yeah. Yeah. We got it.

817
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,320
<i>With that, let the game… begin.</i>

818
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,560
Okay. My team was nice enough
to put me at the front.

819
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,320
I'll-- I'll be the Canadian
and say "I'm sorry."

820
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
but I'm going to my team.

821
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
You got this.

822
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,120
- I'm just gonna lob it to you. Ready?
- Yeah, go for it.

823
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,360
<i>Player 017, pass.</i>

824
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,520
Come on, man.

825
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,560
Those twins might be in hot water, bro.

826
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,600
They know damn well
they are confident catching balls,

827
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,080
and somehow
they've mustered their way up the front.

828
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,000
Guys, I'm just gonna go for my twin.

829
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,960
Dude, the twins are two and three.
That's pathetic.

830
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,600
You ready?

831
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,920
<i>Player 432, pass.</i>

832
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,040
Once you give that ball up,
it's in their court.

833
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,560
- I promise you I'll catch the ball.
- It won't make a difference.

834
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,240
- We wanna save our team.
- It's not a team sport, man.

835
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,960
I'm guaranteeing my spot, okay?

836
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I need to think about my safest bet,
and these three teams

837
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,520
are obviously closer.

838
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,240
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to put… 324.

839
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,440
Thank you.

840
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,640
- Changed plans on us, guys.
- You're changing the plan? Really?

841
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,080
Changed plans on us.
Throw me the ball, I'll catch it.

842
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,120
Won't make a difference.

843
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,640
Don't think about it.
I'll catch the ball. Be confident in me.

844
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,440
It won't make a difference to you guys.
You're still gonna throw it.

845
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,360
Throw me that ball, and I will catch it!

846
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,800
Oh, here we go.

847
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,240
We have a plan.

I never liked that guy.

I'm an experienced person

and, uh, I have a lot of training.

873
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,640
Most people, when they hear… gunshots,

874
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,280
they run the opposite way.

875
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,920
I'm one of those individuals
that have to run towards it.

876
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,920
Uh, that's just always
the person I've been.

877
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,960
I've always wanted to help an individual.

878
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,240

879
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,960

880
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,240
there's a fire.

881
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,760
I've always wanted to be the first one

882
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,960
to get there and-- and save the life, and…

883
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,280
Um, aIso, I was able
to bring a life into this world.

884
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,920
Uh, the hospital sent my wife home
with two aspirins.

885
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,960
They told her she wasn't ready
to have the baby.

886
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,360
When she walked back in, she wanted
to take a shower to try to feel better,

887
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,840
and my son's head popped out,
and she was crowning.

888
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,160
We put her on the dining room floor,
and we had to deliver our son.

889
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,640
Stay on our court!

890
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,080
He will catch the ball!
Listen, you gotta be confident.

891
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,600
My whole job was catching balls.

892
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,320
- What about the most capable?
- We got this!

893

- I'm a softball player.
- Just-- Just toss him the ball!

00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,120
He's not taking the easy throw to 360.

1017
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,280
Ryan, bring it here.

1018
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,520
I'll take it. I'll take it.

1019
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,440
Let's do it. You got it.

1020
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,560
That's nuts.

1021
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,040
Oh, yeah, man. This is gonna be sick.

1022
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,320
It's like I caught it already.

1023
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,480
Ready?

1024
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,400
Oh, God! Damn.

1025
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,720
Oh, my God!

1026
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,280
That's karma.

1027
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,880
That's karma.

1028
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,400
Forget it, forget it.

1029
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,000
<i>Players 272 and 264,</i>

1030
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,880
<i>eliminated.</i>

1031
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,200
I have to make peace
with what's happening right now

1032
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,760
because I have no control.

1033
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,920
Just trying to not put
any bad energy out there.

1034
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,920
Just trying to be a good source of light.

1035
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,760
Be positive with myself. Show strength.

1036
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,680
Be truly strong

1037
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,080
and get through it.

1038
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,200
383, Emily.

1039
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,720
Come on, Emily. Come on, Emily.

1040
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,720
<i>One, two, three.</i>

1041
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,600
- <i>Player 360, pass.</i>
- Oh, my God.

1042
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,040
This is one
of the most high-stakes throw yet.

1043
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,360
One, two, three.

1044
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,400
- Yes! Yes!
- <i>Player 383…</i>

1045
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,760
- Let's go, let's go!
<i>- …pass.</i>

1046
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,080
Nico, you're it, man.

1047
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,960
Three, two, one.

1048
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,920
Yes.

1049
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Yeah!

1050
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,000
That came in hot. Jeez.

1051
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,480
Yeah, Nico!

1052
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,840
- Love you, Zoe. You're not going home.
- <i>Player 370, pass.</i>

1053
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,520
I feel like I'm inside a tunnel.

1054
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,920
<i>Player 216, pass.</i>

1055
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,120
And I've been in this tunnel for so long.

1056
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,400
I just start seeing that glimmer of light.

1057
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,960
- Can you catch?
- Nope.

1058
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,760
I'm right here.

1059
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,080
- 443.
- Okay.

1060
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,560
I'm like, "Okay. I'm almost there."

1061
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,160
One, two, three.

1062
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,680
Oh, my God, what a throw!

1063
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,840
Man, we're eating squirrel tonight.

1064
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,240
<i>Player 081, pass.</i>

1065
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,720
There's nothing else
more important in this moment

1066
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,720
than you, Julie, and the ball.

1067
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,920
You got this. People care about you.

1068
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,440
Breathe.

1069
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,000
You got this.

1070
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,520
You think you've got it, Mark, 100%?

1071
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,280
- I'm going to catch the ball.
- 100%?

1072
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,360
I'm going to catch the ball. 100%.

1073
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,840
100%?

1074
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,720
Yeah, Mark!

1075
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,000
Whoo!

1076
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,080
Okay.

1077
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,320
You're brave, you're smart, you're kind.
You're brave, you're smart, you're kind.

1078
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,480
There's no way he's dropping this, surely.

1079
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,160
Player 100.

1080
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,960
- Come on, Mark.
- You got it.

1081
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,600
- You got it?
- I got this.

1082
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,200
I know you do.

1083
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,920
I know you do.

1084
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,560
I got you. On three.

1085
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,760
Very softly on three. Okay?

1086
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,000
Yeah.

1087
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,240
This is so huge.

1088
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,320
All right.

1089
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,080
Be proud of yourself.
Be proud of yourself.

1090
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,280
One…

1091
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,800
…two…

1092
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,600
three.

1093
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,920
<i>Be proud of yourself.</i>
